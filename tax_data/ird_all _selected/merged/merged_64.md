REVIEW The bill contains a package of amendments to the tax rules for closely held companies. These changes deal with concerns about the workability of certain aspects of the rules and aim to simplify the rules and reduce compliance costs. At the same time the amendments ensure the rules remain robust and in line with intended policy. The amendments: • tighten the eligibility criteria for look-through companies (LTCs); • modify the entry tax calculation for LTCs so it is calculated at each shareholder’s personal tax rate; • restrict the coverage of the deduction limitation rule; • address concerns about how the debt remission rules work in relation to LTCs and partnerships; • remove qualifying status for qualifying companies (QCs) that have a change in control of the company; • narrow the scope of the “tainted capital gains” rule; • address current over-taxation of certain dividends under the resident withholding tax (RWT) rules; and • enable shareholders receiving shareholder salaries to elect to split their income so their base salary is subject to PAYE and the variable amount is paid out before tax. Fourteen submissions were received on the amendments. The majority focused on the proposed changes to the eligibility criteria for LTCs, and on technical issues. Submitters generally supported the overall package of amendments. In particular, there was broad support for the changes to the rules on deduction limitations, debt remission, tainted capital gains, RWT on dividends, and shareholder salaries. The key issue raised was in relation to the changes to the eligibility criteria for LTCs. Submitters were generally opposed to changes to the eligibility criteria for LTCs, mainly because of concerns that there would be additional compliance costs, and that LTCs that had entered into the rules in good faith would be negatively affected. Officials consider that the tightening of the eligibility criteria is necessary to ensure that the LTC rules are targeted towards those originally intended to be covered, and to maintain their policy intent. The changes should only affect LTCs at the margin. We are recommending some changes to address submitters’ concerns about overreach. They include a transitional rule that will allow LTCs that lose their status as a result of the amendments to transition to ordinary companies without tax consequences, and the grandparenting of charities’ LTC holdings as at the date of introduction of the bill. In addition, we are recommending some modifications to the proposed restrictions on a LTC earning foreign income, and to the rules for counting trustees and beneficiaries as LTC counted owners. 3 CLOSELY HELD COMPANIES REVIEW GENERALLY Issue: General support for amendments to closely held company rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Two submitters supported the amendments to closely held companies generally. However, the two submitters had concerns about some of the specific features of the amendments. These specific concerns are addressed later in this report. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Appreciation of officials’ engagement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter asks the Committee to note their appreciation of officials’ engagement with them on the closely held company taxation review project. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Need to address LTC transparency Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Work on the extent to which a LTC is transparent should be progressed as a priority. Uncertainty regarding the extent of LTC transparency complicates the regime and increases compliance costs. The legislation should clearly state whether or not a LTC is fully transparent and if not, how transparent. Comment Transparency is the extent to which a LTC and its owners are treated as the same person for tax purposes. We agree that LTC transparency should be an area for further consideration. However, we believe that it should be a low priority on the Tax Policy Work Programme given significant competing demands. The key issue in this area, namely the flow-through of debt remission income to owners is being addressed in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 LTC ELIGIBILITY GENERALLY Clause 262 Issue: LTC eligibility criteria should be simpler and less restrictive Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, The Whyte Group) Three submitters opposed the proposed amendments to the LTC eligibility criteria generally. The reasons given were that the proposed amendments: • are unnecessarily complex and restrictive; • would increase compliance costs through the need to review whether existing LTCs who entered into the rules in good faith meet the revised criteria, as well as continued monitoring of on-go ing compliance with the LTC criteria; • would create a risk that taxpayers would breach the eligibility rules inadvertently, which will cause significant hardship to closely held and family-owned businesses; • the LTC eligib ility criteria were originally drafted deliberately wider than the Qualifying Company (QC) regime and so were intended to be used more widely; and • the changes would increase the tax costs for LTCs. Comment The LTC rules are intended to apply primarily to company situations when the investment could have genuinely been alternatively owned directly by the individual or family trust shareholders. The proposed amendments to the LTC eligibility criteria are intended to ensure that the LTC rules achieve this goal and are appropriately targeted. The majority of current LTCs have only one or two owners and as a result we consider that the amendments will not affect the majority of current LTCs. We are, however, recommending some changes to address submitters’ concerns about overreach. They include a transitional rule that will allow LTCs that lose their status as a result of the amendments to transition to ordinary companies without tax consequences, and the grandparenting of charities’ LTC holdings as at the date of introduction of the bill. In addition, we are recommending some modifications to the proposed restrictions on a LTC earning foreign income, and to the rules for counting trustees and beneficiaries as LTC counted owners. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 Issue: Need for wider grandparenting Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) The revised LTC eligibility criteria should generally apply only to companies that elect to be LTCs after the date the bill is enacted. This is fairer on LTCs that entered into the LTC rules in good faith and ensures that they are not penalised through the tax consequences of having to leave the LTC regime. Comment It is important that the LTC rules achieve their policy intent of being targeted towards situations where an investor could have genuinely made their investment directly. We agree that appropriately targeted transitional rules are needed for some situations. In this regard, the bill includes: • a transitional rule for trusts to move gradually to counting all distributions made to beneficiaries; • a transitional rule for corporate beneficiaries through only counting distributions to corporate beneficiaries after the date of enactment; and • grandparenting of Māori authorities with existing LTC interests. In response to submissions we recommend a transitional rule to allow LTCs that will lose their LTC eligibility to be able to convert to ordinary companies without tax consequences and grandparenting of existing charities’ LTC interests (see Issue: Transitional provision for existing LTCs and Issue: Grandparenting charities that hold interests in LTCs). This means there is either grandparenting or a transitional rule for LTCs affected by these changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Transitional provision for existing LTCs Submission (New Zealand Law Society, PwC) There should be a transitional provision to enable LTCs that will lose their LTC status as a result of the changes to restructure without a tax cost. This is fairer on LTCs that entered into the LTC rules in good faith and ensures that they are not penalised through the tax consequences of leaving the LTC regime. 6 Comment We agree with the submission. Although it may be necessary for some LTCs to lose their LTC status in order to ensure that the rules are appropriately targeted, this should not result in the parties having to pay tax earlier than they would have done. Ordinarily, on exiting the LTC regime the parties will pay tax on unrealised gains held on revenue account. A transitional rule will instead enable the tax book values to be rolled over to the ordinary company (subject to certain safeguards). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 7 LTC ELIGIBILITY – CLASSES OF SHARES Clause 262 Issue: Support for proposal to allow LTCs to have greater flexibility around classes of shares Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Two submitters supported the proposal to allow greater flexibility around the class of shares LTCs can hold. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Allowing LTCs to have shares with disproportionate voting rights Submission (EY) The proposed changes to allow LTCs to have shares with different voting rights is too limited and will not provide the desired flexibility. For the proposal to be really effective it should be possible for shares to have no or disproportionate voting rights on any of the matters listed in paragraph (a) of the current definition so long as all shares retain equal rights to receive distributions. Comment The bill proposes to allow companies that have shares with disproportionate voting rights to become LTCs as long as all shareholders still have equal voting rights on decisions regarding the distributions to be made by the company and decisions to vary the capital of the company. The key reason for the restrictions on classes of shares is to avoid the opportunity for the LTC to stream income or deductions to individual shareholders. However, this objective is achieved primarily through requiring equal rights to distributions rather than requiring equal decision making voting rights. As a result, we agree with the submitter that additional flexibility should be granted to enable shares to have disproportionate voting rights as long as all the shares retain equal rights to receive distributions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 LTC ELIGIBILITY – FOREIGN INCOME RESTRICTIONS Clause 262 Issue: Opposition to restrictions on foreign LTC owners Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw) Submitters raised the following concerns with the proposed restrictions on the amount of foreign income that a LTC can earn when controlled by foreign owners: • The proposal is too broad and will exclude some family-owned businesses that have overseas owners. • An owner moving overseas could inadvertently trigger the loss of LTC status. This could have retrospective impact if an owner moves overseas part-way through an income year. • The proposal in the bill is wider than that proposed in the issues paper, 1 which provided assurances that the proposal would not capture a domestic family business through an owner emigrating. • The proposed restrictions would apply to LTC owners that are resident in Australia. There is limited reputational risk through a LTC owner residing in Australia. • The same tax outcome as a LTC could be achieved through the use of a limited partnership rather than a LTC, which is not subject to the restriction. • The amendments will impose costs on taxpayers who formed LTCs in good faith, based on the settings that were in place when the LTC regime was enacted. • There will be increased compliance costs in reviewing existing LTCs and monitoring LTCs ongoing compliance with the proposed amendments. The proposal should not proceed. (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The proposal should be amended to reflect the narrower proposal in the issues paper in relation to restricting the extent to which a company can derive foreign income and retain LTC status if it is controlled by non-resident shareholders. A resident trustee should be treated as a resident shareholder for the purpose of this test. (OliverShaw) Comment The proposed restrictions on foreign ownership of LTCs are intended to prevent the reputational risk to New Zealand from LTCs being used as conduit vehicles when a LTC that is owned by non-residents invests primarily or exclusively offshore. The proposed maximum foreign income threshold of the greater of $10,000 or 20 percent of the LTC’s gross income is intended to provide some flexibility for LTCs to have combined non-resident shareholding and foreign income. 1 Closely held company taxation issues – an officials’ issues paper, September 2015. 9 We consider that these thresholds should reduce the chances of a domestic family business inadvertently falling outside the rules through an owner emigrating as it will only apply when 50 percent or more of the ownership interests are owned by non-residents. An owner who has less than 50 percent shareholding will not trigger the thresholds by emigrating. As a result, we believe the majority of family-owned businesses will not be affected by the proposed changes. The Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules considered whether the existing foreign trust disclosure rules were adequate to ensure that New Zealand’s reputation is maintained. The Inquiry made a number of recommendations to bolster the foreign trust disclosure rules, which have been introduced in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill. In its report, the Inquiry commented that LTCs were commonly used with foreign trust structures, and noted the proposals in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill to restrict foreign-sourced income above a certain amount. The Inquiry supported these measures and stated that it thinks they will reduce the scope for inappropriate use of foreign trusts. Overall, therefore, we consider the foreign income restrictions need to apply to all conduit LTC situations, including existing ones. We are recommending some changes to provide a transitional rule so that LTCs affected by the changes to the eligibility criteria can convert to ordinary companies without tax consequences. We are also recommending an amendment to the rules for measuring a “non- resident settlor” to address the overreach raised by submitters in relation to the extent to which a resident trustee of a LTC is considered to actually be non-resident (see Issue: Transitional provision for existing LTCs and Issue: Reference to “non-resident settlor” should be revised). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Raising foreign income threshold Submission (KPMG ) If the proposal proceeds, the foreign income threshold needs to be raised to a more commercial level with the foreign income component of a LTC raised to a maximum of 50 percent of the LTC’s gross income and the proposed $10,000 income threshold should be removed altogether as it is arbitrary. Comment The LTC regime is targeted at businesses that are likely to be predominantly domestically focused. Therefore the expectation is that the source of income will be predominantly from New Zealand, but with some allowance for overseas income as businesses expand and export. To put the proposed rule in context, currently less than 1 percent of the 50,000 LTCs have foreign income. 10 The $10,000 threshold is intended to provide greater flexibility for very small L TCs. The interface of the LTC rules with New Zealand’s international tax policy settings is far from straightforward and judgements need to be made about where to set the thresholds. Our judgement is that a non-resident who intends to use New Zealand purely as a conduit will not want to earn significant New Zealand income in order to meet the threshold. On the other hand, it will allow some foreign income when a LTC is an inbound investment by a non- resident. It should be noted that if a LTC is controlled by residents then it can have significant amounts of foreign income as the threshold will not apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Delaying restriction of foreign-controlled LTCs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, OliverShaw) There is currently a narrow period of time between the likely date of enactment of this bill and the application date of 1 April 2017. If the proposal to restrict foreign income proceeds, then the application date should be deferred to 1 April 2018. This will provide existing LTCs with a longer window to restructure. Comment We believe it is important to act quickly to address the reputational risk of LTCs being used as foreign conduits. The proposed restrictions were signalled a year ago in the issues paper, Closely held company taxation issues, released in September 2015, and were confirmed in the bill introduced in May 2016. Those losing their LTC status because they breach the foreign income threshold should be affected prospectively as LTC status will be lost after 1 April 2017. To ensure that those few who have early balance date LTCs are not in effect retrospectively excluded, we recommend that the application date be changed to income years commencing on or after 1 April 2017. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 11 Issue: Reference to “non-resident settlor” should be revised Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) New Zealand income tax law has a very broad concept of “settlor”. Th is is too far-reaching for the purposes of the proposed restrictions on foreign LTC ownership. Comment Currently the bill considers the trust to be non-resident if any settlor is a non-resident irrespective of the relative value of their settlement. We agree with the submission that this proposal may overreach and may result in a loss of LTC status through a trustee shareholder being “tainted” by a minority foreign settlor. As a result, we recommend that when determining whether a trust that is a LTC owner is resident or non-resident the trust will only be counted as non-resident to the extent that non-resident settlors have provided settlements to the trust. For example, if non-resident settlors have provided 25% of the total settlements, then the trust will be considered to be 25% non- resident when assessing whether the 50% threshold has been reached. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Use of term “foreign-sourced income” Submission (EY) The bill uses a new term “foreign-sourced income”. There are several similar terms in the Income Tax Act 2007 that should be used instead to provide greater clarity. Comment We agree with the submission and believe the existing term “foreign-sourced amount” should be used. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 LTC ELIGIBILITY – TRUSTEES Clause 262 Issue: Opposition to proposed amendments on how trustees and beneficiaries are counted Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) Four submitters opposed the proposed changes on how beneficiaries and trustees are counted for the LTC rules, for the following reasons: • The proposed amendments overreach and will negatively impact many family-owned businesses. • The proposed amendments will increase the risk of an inadvertent breach of LTC status, create additional complexity and result in compliance costs through the need to restructure trusts and for LTCs to monitor ongoing compliance with the new rules. • There is no ability to use trusts to pass on income to an excessively wide group through the distribution of trustee income and corpus, as trustee income has already been taxed and corpus is the original capital invested/settled. • The risk of using trusts to increase the number of owners of a LTC is overstated. • The proposed amendments require counting distributions to beneficiaries that have no relation to income the LTC earns. Comment Fungibility of money is the main reason for the proposed amendments on how trustees and beneficiaries are counted when determining the number of look-through counted owners. The LTC rules are only intended to be available for entities with few owners. The current rules for counting beneficiaries and trustees can be used to enable LTCs to be more widely held and, therefore, to defeat this purpose. A LTC can only have a maximum of five counted owners. Only natural persons, trustees and other LTCs can be owners. The current test for counting trustees and beneficiaries of trusts that have LTC interests only counts distributions that are sourced from the LTC in the current year and last three income years. Given the fungibility of money and the three to four year measurement period, it is possible to replace distributions sourced from LTC income with other distributions, and to stream distributions from LTC-sourced income to artificially decrease the number of counted owners. Given it is not feasible to say from which source a distribution is funded it is more reasonable to assume that all beneficiaries are benefiting to some degree from the LTC holding. 13 We consider that for the majority of family trusts the proposed amendments will have litt le practical effect. This is because close family members are treated as a single counted owner. For those that are affected, the trust should have records of who it has made distributions to over the past three to four years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for proposed amendments for counting trustees Submission (Deloitte) One submitter supported the proposed changes to the way that beneficiaries and trustees are counted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Simplifying transitional rule for counting trustees Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports a transitional rule to move gradually to counting all distributions to beneficiaries. However the submitter believed the rule proposed in the bill is too complex, will impose undue compliance costs and should be simplified. Comment The proposed transitional rule is intended to phase in the proposed new requirements given that they will for several years cast back to periods subject to the current test. The transitional rule is, therefore, intended to help mitigate concerns that a number of LTCs could lose their LTC status because they could not meet the new test in those prior years even though they met the current requirements. We will provide further guidance on this rule in the Tax Information Bulletin that covers the bill changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: Counting trustees who have made no distributions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The bill should confirm that the trustees of a trust will be a single look-through counted owner if no distribution of income has been made. Comment We agree with the submission. Th is will ensure that a LTC has at least one counted owner, and when a LTC is owned by multiple trusts that make no distributions to beneficiaries that each trust is recognised as an owner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Double counting for trusts Submission ( PwC) The proposal may result in double counting of trustees through counting both the trustee and the beneficiaries of a trust. The bill and Commentary should make it absolutely clear that this will not occur. Comment We agree that the current trustee counting rule in combination with the proposed rule for counting beneficiaries could result in double counting in some circumstances. We therefore propose to simplify the counting rule by removing proposed paragraph (c) from the definition of “look-through counted owner” and replacing it with a rule that states that a trustee is a look-through counted owner when no beneficiaries of the trust are look-through counted owners. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 15 Issue: Disregarding distributions sourced from pre 2017–18 funds or assets Submission (EY) There should be some revision of the wording of proposed new paragraph (bb) of the definition of “look-through counted owner” so that distributions sourced from pre-2017 assets or non-LTC income are also disregarded. Comment The LTC rules are intended to be simple given their intended audience of small closely held businesses. We consider that the proposed amendment would add significant additional complexity to the rules for marginal benefit. The non-LTC income has not been counted under the old rule and what is important going forward is who received a distribution, not its source. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Should extend calculation period Submission ( PwC) If there are real concerns that the beneficiaries receiving LTC income are being rotated, then one solution would be to remove the four-year time limit so that a beneficiary is counted if they have received a distribution of LTC income as beneficiary income in any income year. Comment Having a longer measurement period was a proposal outlined in the issues paper but was dropped after strong concern from submitters that it would increase compliance costs, particularly given the proposed changes to how beneficiaries and trustees were to be counted. Officials consider it to be more important to address the fungibility issue which requires all distributions to be taken into account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 LTC ELIGIBILITY – CORPORATE BENEFICIARIES Clause 262 Issue: Widening LTC eligibility to include ordinary companies as owners Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) There are good policy reasons to widen the LTC eligibility criteria to allow companies to become look-through counted owners under the LTC rules. Doing so would provide an alternative investment vehicle to achieve the same tax result as a limited partnership or joint venture but at a lower compliance cost. The concern that this could encourage loss retailing is not in itself sufficient to preclude corporate ownership and could be addressed through applying the deduction limitation rule to corporate owners of LTCs. Comment The LTC rules are intended to apply only to closely held companies where individual and trustee shareholders could have genuinely made the investment directly. As a result, ordinary companies are currently not eligible to be shareholders of a LTC as this would enable LTCs to be more widely held than intended. Another LTC can, however, be a shareholder. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Opposition to restricting distributions to corporate beneficiaries Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, The Whyte Group) KPMG does not support the proposal to prevent LTC shareholding trusts with corporate beneficiaries making distributions. The potential revenue risk is min imal. A more appropriate rule would be to limit the counted distributions to a distribution of LTC income. (KPMG ) A distribution to a close company beneficiary should be allowed. It is not unusual for a family trust to include a close company beneficiary; it would be within the policy intent of the LTC regime for a trust with a look-through interest in a LTC to make a distribution to that close company beneficiary. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed changes should not proceed as they impose significant costs on taxpayers who formed LTCs in good faith based on the policy settings that were in place at the time the LTC regime was enacted. (New Zealand Law Society) 17 No change is required to the LTC rules for trustees. LTC owners should have the choice to pay tax at 28% on business profits that are reinvested in the business for investment or growth purposes, and pay tax at the trustee or personal marginal rate on profits applied for private purposes. The Government should be encouraging reinvestment of profits by business owners as opposed to collecting further tax and reducing the working capital available for growth. If it is considered that some control is required, then trustees should only be able to distribute to ordinary companies which they wholly or substantially own. (The Whyte Group) Comment The LTC rules are intended to apply only to closely held companies when individual and trustee shareholders could have genuinely made the investment directly. As a result, ordinary companies are currently not eligible to be shareholders of a LTC as this would enable LTCs to be more widely held than intended. The proposed amendment deals with a gap in the rules that enables an ordinary company to have an interest in a LTC indirectly through a trust. We consider that this gap should be closed to ensure that the LTC rules achieve their policy intent. Leaving this gap open would encourage structuring with trusts to avoid the company restriction. Such outcomes are not the simple business structures that the LTC regime envisages. Ideally, indirect LTC interests should be precluded but in recognition that there are already trusts with corporate beneficiaries, the proposal in the bill only precludes the making of distributions to those corporate beneficiaries. This allows a business structure to be gradually simplified over t ime. Moreover, the LTC regime is not intended to favour the retention of profits within businesses. Rather, it is about trying to create a more neutral tax transition between a sole trader who is taxed at personal rates on his or her business income and the outcome if these same businesses were to incorporate. Providing this transition lessens the likelihood that tax will distort decisions on whether to incorporate. To achieve this, it is necessary to have full flow through, so that income is taxed at the LTC owners’ personal tax rates. Allowing a LTC to have corporate beneficiaries does not create a neutral tax transition and instead enables tax advantages to be gained through structuring. For example, a LTC could be structured so that it has low marginal tax rate investors holding their shares directly while high marginal tax rate investors hold their shares through a corporate beneficiary of the trust. Such a structure creates a tax advantage over both: • the individuals holding the assets directly (as it provides deferral advantages for owners on marginal tax rates above 28%); and • holding the assets in an ordinary company (because distributions do not need to be made to owners on low marginal tax rates for their share of the income to be taxed at the lower rate). Also capital gains and losses from the LTC can flow through to the owners, which they cannot do for an ordinary company. The proposed restriction will not apply to a LTC that has an interest in another LTC indirectly through a trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 Issue: Interposed trusts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The meaning of “a company that is indirectly a beneficiary of the trust” in the definition of “look-through company” should be clarified. Officials should clarify whether it is intended to catch interposed trust scenarios. Comment The definition of “look-through counted owner” is intended to include situations where there is a distribution to a corporate beneficiary through interposed trusts. Take the following example: • Trust A is a shareholder of Company X • Trust B is a beneficiary of Trust A • Company Y is a beneficiary of Trust B Company X makes a distribution to Trust A. Trust A then passes on the distribution to Trust B who passes it to Company Y. Under the proposed amendments, Company X will be ineligible to be a LTC. This is because a trustee shareholder of Company X has made a distribution of income to a company that is indirectly a beneficiary of the trust. We will provide further clarity on this point in the Tax Information Bulletin on the enacted changes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Distribution of income from trustee Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed changes to the definition of “look-through company” do not meet the stated policy objective. Proposed paragraph (eb) of the definition of “look-through company” only prohibits a trustee shareholder of a LTC from making a distribution of income to a corporate beneficiary. The Commentary and the Regulatory Impact Statement state that this restriction should apply to all amounts, not just income, distributed by a trustee shareholder. 19 Comment We agree with the submission and consider that this should be addressed throughout the definition of “look-through company”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting issue Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed paragraph (bb)(ii) in the definition of look-through counted owner currently refers to “after the 2017–18 income year”. This provision should apply to income years after the 2016–17 income year. Comment This provision should refer to “after the 2016–17 income year” as the new rule for counting beneficiaries of LTC owners is intended to apply to and from the 2017–18 income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 20 LTC ELIGIBILITY – MĀORI AUTHORITIES Clause 262 Issue: Support for grandparenting Māori authorities Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Two submitters supported the proposal to grandparent existing LTCs with interests in Māori authorities. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Grandparented Māori authority Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill proposes to grandparent current Māori authorities that acquired interests in look- through companies before the introduction of the bill. This grandparenting is intended to enable Māori authorities to continue to hold existing LTC interests that they acquired before the introduction of the bill and, therefore, avoid the compliance costs of converting their LTC interests to limited partnerships. However, the current wording of the grandparenting provision provides wider concessions than was intended. Under the present proposed wording, a Māori authority that had a LTC interest prior to the introduction of the bill is able to both retain this previous interest as well as acquire new interests in other LTCs. Comment It was not intended that Māori authorities should be able to acquire new interests in LTCs after the introduction of the bill. As a result, we consider that the grandparenting provision should be tightened to apply only to interests in a LTC that a Māori authority held before the introduction of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 21 LTC ELIGIBILITY – CHARITIES Clause 262 Issue: Opposition to excluding charities from being counted owners of a LTC Submission (Hugh Green Foundation, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) Three submitters opposed the proposal to exclude charities from being counted owners of a L TC. A charity has no beneficiaries beyond its public purpose. As it has one purpose, it should be treated akin to an individual person and not considered to be widely held. There is no potential for mischief by allowing a charity to be a LTC owner as LTC income is required to be allocated pro rata, based on each owner’s effective look-through interest. The proposed amendment penalises charities that are already LTC owners and has negative consequences for any non-charitable owners of an existing LTC as there will be tax consequences for them if LTC status is lost, as well as restructuring costs. Comment We consider that charitable entities are in effect reflective of wide ownership even though the ultimate beneficiaries of the charity may have no control or influence over the LTC. This becomes more of an issue when the charity is able to control or influence the LTC distributions through a direct or indirect shareholding. As a result, we consider that companies with a charity shareholder should not be eligible to be a LTC as this would enable the LTC to be effectively widely held. When, however, the charity is only a residual beneficiary or in effect receives a distribution akin to a donation, then the distributions should not result in a loss of LTC status. Furthermore, we accept there is a case for grandparenting existing LTCs with charity shareholders. This is addressed in the submission below, Issue: Grandparenting charities that hold interests in LTCs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 Issue: Grandparenting charities that hold interests in LTCs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Hugh Green Foundation, PwC) If the proposal to exclude charities from being LTC owners proceeds, then existing charities with LTC interests should be grandparented. This would align the treatment with that proposed for Māori authorities. There is no policy justification to differentiate the treatment between Māori authorities and charities. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) There are good policy reasons for the preferential tax treatment of charities, and the ability to continue to be a LTC owner will mean that the charity will be able to maintain this treatment without having to undertake the unnecessary compliance costs of having to convert their LTC interest to a limited partnership. (Hugh Green Foundation) There are some situations where the charity will be unable to convert its LTC interest into a limited partnership due to having insufficient ability to direct other owners of the LTC. (Hugh Green Foundation) Existing LTCs owned by charities will have elected into the LTC regime in good faith before the introduction of the bill. The LTC that is part-owned by the Hugh Green Foundation elected into the LTC regime on a fully transparent basis and incurred significant costs in obtaining a private binding ruling from Inland Revenue confirming it is eligible to be a LTC. It is therefore overly harsh to effectively penalise the Hugh Green Foundation while Māori authorities are able to maintain their LTC owner status. (Hugh Green Foundation) Comment We agree with submitters that charities with LTC holdings face similar issues to Māori authorities. Grandparenting charities’ LTC interests as at the date of introduction of the bill will reduce compliance costs for these charities. We anticipate that very few charities will have such LTC interests. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Distributions to a charitable beneficiary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Two submitters supported the proposal to allow charit ies, in some circumstances, to be beneficiaries of a trust that is a LTC shareholder. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 23 Issue: Reference to “tax charity” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed changes to the definition of “look-through company” relate to tax charities. Not all charities will be a “tax charity”, such as a charitable organisation that chooses not to register as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005. It is unclear why any proposed changes should apply only to tax charities. Comment The term “tax charity” provides a clear, easy to apply rule as all organisations that are “tax charities” are listed on the registry of charities. We believe that the term “tax charity” should continue to be used to help ensure the legislation is clear. We also consider it is unlikely that a tax charity would deregister solely to avoid the LTC eligibility rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANY ENTRY TAX Clauses 14, 106, 178, 239 and 262 Issue: Opposition to proposed amendments to the look-through company entry tax Submission (The Whyte Group) The proposal to calculate entry tax at the shareholder personal marginal rate will provide a disincentive for existing companies to join the LTC regime and access the lower compliance costs offered by the LTC regime. Existing companies wanting to become a LTC will have to fund 5 percent of their retained earnings under the proposed approach. Only when profits are applied for private purposes should income be taxed at marginal personal rates or the trustee rate. There is an incentive for a company that might be contemplating liquidation or downsizing to elect into the regime, have all of the earnings taxed finally at 28% and then distribute that amount to avoid the marginal rates. Rather than the amendments proposed in the bill, the focus should be on taxing these situations where entry and distribution of existing profits are connected. Comment The proposed entry tax calculation is intended to ensure that the retained earnings of companies becoming LTCs are appropriately attributed to shareholders at their personal tax rates as would be the case if the earnings were actually distributed prior to conversion. This deemed distribution needs to be done at the time of entry because distributions made subsequent to becoming a LTC are not taxable. Currently, upon entry into the LTC regime, taxpayers can be undertaxed when their marginal rate is greater than 28% and overtaxed when their marginal tax rate is less than 28%. This arises because to the extent the company’s retained earnings can be fully imputed, this income is regarded as being finally taxed. Officials consider the proposed amendment is necessary to remove this over- and under- taxation and ensure fairness between taxpayers on different marginal rates. It should be noted that the LTC owners have the tax liability or benefit, not the company converting to a LTC so there are no cashflow implications for the company from applying personal tax rates to the deemed dividend. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 Issue: Drafting of LTC rollover provision should be clarified and deal with the status of property transferred Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Proposed section HB 13 provides that a company who enters the LTC regime acquires the assets of the “superseded” company at their tax book value. The proposed section also refers to “steps into the shoes of the company”. Th is is problematic as : • the terms “superseded company” and “steps into the shoes of the company” suggest that the previous company has been replaced when in fact it still exists; and • the section does not clarify whether the LTC has the same acquisition date, status, intention or purpose in relation to the property. The section should be redrafted to account for this. Comment We agree with the submission. The “steps into the shoes” concept should apply more widely than just to the tax book value. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying application date Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The Commentary to the bill states that the application date of proposed section CB 32C is the 2017–18 and subsequent income years but the bill says it applies from the date of Royal assent. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The Commentary to the bill states that the application date of clause 239(2) is the 2017–18 and subsequent income years but the bill says it applies from the date of Royal assent. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) This should be clarified. Comment Proposed section CB 32C contains the revised entry tax calculation and clause 239(2) of the bill contains a cross-reference to this section. The sections should apply to the 2017–18 and subsequent income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 26 Issue: Extending transitional period for QCs that convert to LTCs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) A number of QCs will have held off on becoming LTCs hoping for simplified dividend rules. Further work on dividend simplification is planned as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation. This work will not be concluded for some time. In these circumstances, a two-year transitional window should be provided for QCs that convert to LTCs in the 2017–18 and 2018–19 income years. Under such a rule QCs should be able to convert to LTCs without tax consequences. Comment Under the proposed amendments in the bill, entry into the LTC regime will mimic more closely the outcome had the company liquidated. This will decrease the over-taxation of QCs with untaxed reserves that convert to LTCs and decrease the under-taxation of companies that have sufficient imputation credits to fully impute dividends when they convert. A two-year tax-free transition was provided to QCs converting to LTCs when the LTC regime was first introduced. We do not consider there is a strong case for another transitional window. If such a window was provided we consider it likely that the only elections that would be made would be from QCs with shareholders predominantly on marginal tax rates greater than 28% who would wish to avoid the proposed removal of the under-taxation on conversion to a LTC. This would defeat the purpose of the proposed amendments. Any further work on dividend simplification is unlikely to influence decisions on whether to become a LTC. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Retrospective requirement to use tax book values on entry Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The requirement for LTCs to use the tax book values of the company that elects into the LTC regime should be prospective. The grounds for retrospective amendment have not been made. The change does not correct something that is clearly contrary to the policy intent and there is no evidence that the current law poses an obvious risk to New Zealand’s tax base. There has been no analysis of the actual problem and its extent in either the original issues paper or the Commentary to the bill to justify the change. The uncertainty the proposed amendment proposes to remedy is a consequence of the haste in which the LTC legislation was enacted. Taxpayers should not be penalised for a deficiency in the rules when they have relied on the rules in good faith. 27 Comment The proposed requirement that the LTC adopt the tax book values of the converting company is a clarification to ensure the rules work as intended. There would be a significant revenue risk if taxpayers could revalue their assets without any tax consequences at the time of conversion. Take, for example, a taxpayer with a forest that has a tax book value of $0 and a market value of $1 million. On entry into the LTC rules, if the taxpayer could use the market value of the forest, the tax book value of the forest would become $1 million and there would be no requirement to pay tax on that $1 million (as these revenue gains are not realised upon entry into the LTC rules). As a result, the amendment clarifies that this is not possible and prevents gains in asset values from leaving the tax base. We are not aware of any taxpayers that have used the market value of assets upon entry into the LTC rules. However, the proposed amendment is retrospective to ensure that this potential uncertainty is not abused through positions being reopened which could otherwise create significant revenue risk. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 DEDUCTION LIMITATION RULE Clauses 97 and 105 Issue: Support for removing deduction limitation rule Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) Four submitters supported the proposal to remove the deduction limitation rule for LTCs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Technical issues should be addressed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Officials are aware there are a number of technical issues with the deduction limitation rule and have stated in the Commentary to the bill that they are continuing to work on them. Officials should expedite this work and address the technical issues as a matter of urgency. Comment The bill will significantly limit the scope of the deduction limitation rule. Given this narrowing in scope, we consider these technical issues are not a high priority. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Joint ventures Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The term “joint venture” should be defined. In some circumstances, there is uncertainty over whether or not a joint venture exists. It would be helpful if the term were defined in the legislation. 29 Alternatively, we suggest Inland Revenue provides detailed guidance and examples of the types of arrangements it considers would be “joint ventures” in this context. Comment The definition of “joint ventures” is not limited to just the deduction limitation rule or just to tax. As a result, any changes to the definition would need to consider the wider use of the term “joint venture” and the wider implications. Given the significant competing demands on the Tax Policy Work Programme we do not consider legislatively defining the term to be a high priority. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Revising sequence of wording in clause 97 Submission (EY) The sequence of wording in the proposed amendment in clause 97 should read “subparts HB and HG (which relate to look-through companies, and joint ventures, partners and partnerships)”. Comment The sequence of wording in clause 97 follows the sequence of the sections it is referring to. We believe that this sequencing is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 DEBT REMISSION Clauses 13, 56, 104 and 119 Issue: Support for changes to debt remission for LTCs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) Three submitters supported the proposed changes to the debt remission rules for LTCs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Debt remission provision does not achieve the policy objective Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, EY) Four submitters stated that the proposed debt remission provision for LTCs does not achieve the policy intent. This is because the effect of the amendment is to provide the lender a deduction under section DB 6 by virtue of a negative base price adjustment. However, a deduction is available under section DB 6 only when the general permission is satisfied. This may not be satisfied in the circumstances of a debt remission for LTCs. Submitters raised several different options for how the provision should be drafted to ensure it achieves the policy objectives. Comment We agree with the submission. We plan to rectify this by enabling the LTC owner to have an automatic right to a deduction for a base price adjustment as a result of a self-rem ission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 31 Issue: Extending debt remission provision to LTC liquidations and other LTC interest disposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Offen Advisors Limited) The proposed debt remission amendment should be extended to cover other situations where the LTC owner effectively remits debt but through disposing of a LTC or otherwise. Comment We agree with the submission. The provision should be extended to cover the income that flows through to the lender-shareholder from the LTC as a result of a base price adjustment on the debt owed to the shareholder-lender that will not be repaid as a result of revocation of LTC status or permanent cessation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying application date of credit impairment amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commentary to the bill states that the proposed credit impairment amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. However the bill provides that the amendment applies from 1 April 2017. This should be clarified. Comment Both are correct. The proposed amendment in effect applies from 1 April 2011 but to avoid reopening past returns, any additional income and associated penalties and interest from those earlier years is brought to account in 2017–18 income returns. We will clarify this point in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 32 Issue: Credit impairment provision does not work as intended Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) As currently drafted, section HB 4(7) provides that the market value of an owner’s interest in a financial arrangement as a debtor must take into account the amount of any adjustment for credit impairment. It is uncertain what the phrase “must take into account” means; does it mean the debtor must take a deduction or add an amount back? It is unclear, as the credit impairment is an adjustment made by the creditor, not the debtor. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is unclear what the proposed credit impairment amendment is intended to achieve. If it is intended to ensure base price adjustment income arises for LTC owners on third-party debt which they are unable to pay all or in full, it would not necessarily be effective. We would not expect a debtor LTC to have made any adjustment for credit impairment to a financial arrangement liability it (and its owners under the LTC rules) owes. On that basis proposed section HB 4(7) would not seem to effect the change apparently desired by officials. (EY) The provision should be redrafted. Comment The proposed credit impairment clarification is intended to ensure that a debtor accounts for the debt at the market value of the debt, including, any impaired value of the debt when a base price adjustment is being calculated when a LTC owner is disposing of a LTC interest. For the purposes of the disposal price, the impaired value of the debt needs to be used in the base price adjustment rather than the face value. This ensures that what is in effect a debt remission is treated as income of the LTC owners. This market value adjustment is similar for other situations where assets or liability may need valuation at a different level than their book value to account for risk or other intangible factors that could affect the value of the asset or liability. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Guidance needed on how to determine amount of credit impairment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Guidance is required on how the amount of an adjustment for credit impairment is determined. 33 The credit impairment adjustment is made by the creditor, not the debtor. For commercial reasons this information is not likely to be made readily available to the debtor. Comment The adjustment needed for impairment of debt is, in principle, similar to other adjustments needed for assets to account for risk or other intangible factors that may affect their value. Under the amendment, debtors will not need to rely on information from the creditor to determine the amount of credit impairment. Instead, the debtors will need to make a fair and reasonable estimate of the credit impairment based on the information they have available. To determine the credit impairment, the key question to ask is “if the LTC was sold or liquidated, how much of the debt would be repaid to the creditor”. In most cases, determining this would involve looking at the balance sheet of the LTC to determine the net assets of the L TC. Officials intend to include this explanation in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to retrospective credit impairment amendment Submission (EY, Offen Advisors Limited) Clause 104 stands to retrospectively impose income tax in a situation where no current or potential economic gain arises. Moreover taxpayers could have restructured their affairs and avoided the tax consequences of this retrospective change if the other changes proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill had been in place from the beginning of the LTC regime (1 April 2011). Retrospective legislation is not justified in this circumstance. It is up to the courts to determine how a provision is to be interpreted. The proposed amendment is not a mere clarification; otherwise retrospective legislation would be unnecessary. (Offen Advisors Limited) Taxpayers will have made tax positions in previous years on an arguable legitimate basis of the tax law as then enacted. Retrospective taxation is unreasonable and unwarranted. (EY) Comment The policy intent of the LTC rules is to deem the assets and liabilities of the LTC to be disposed of at market value upon exit from the rules. This policy intent was clear at the time the rules were enacted and the legislation clearly intended to avoid the issues with the previous Loss Attribution Qualifying Company rules in this area where some were avoiding debt remission income being brought to account. 34 We accept that the legislation was not as clear as it could have been in the determination of credit impairment and the argument that debt should be deemed to be disposed of at face value is understandable. However, we believe the case for retrospective legislation has been met in this case. The intent of the legislation was clear and deeming debt to be disposed of at face value would create absurdity. We also believe that retrospectivity is needed as this issue creates a sign ificant revenue ris k. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 35 QUALIFYING COMPANIES – CONTINUITY OF OWNERSHIP Clauses 98 and 262 Issue: Opposition to proposed qualifying company continuity requirement Submission (KPMG ) Qualifying companies (QCs) should not lose their QC status if there is a shareholding change of over 50 percent in aggregate. Qualifying companies do not provide a tax deferral advantage and instead provide tax deferrals no different to that of ordinary companies. More importantly, the population of QCs cannot increase, meaning the revenue risk (if any) can be managed. Comment One aspect of the 2010 tax package was that existing QCs were allowed to continue but no new QCs could be created. This grandparenting of existing QCs was, therefore, intended solely to enable existing owners to retain their QC interests. The sale of an existing QC interest would in effect allow new QC interests to be created, particularly if more than 50 percent of the shareholding was sold. Any tax advantage that the QC might enjoy could be traded in this way, which was clearly not the intent of grandparenting. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repealing qualifying company regime and extending similar treatment to close companies Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Consideration should be given to repealing the QC regime but at the same time enabling close companies to distribute amounts of tax to their shareholders to the extent the distribution is not a fully imputed cash distribution. This would create a level playing field as all close companies would have this treatment rather than just QCs. Comment The issue raised by the submitter is complex and is intertwined with the treatment of entities generally. 36 We do not think that the issues can be considered in isolation to the whole approach to entity taxation. This would be a significant piece of work which we consider would best be handled through the standard Tax Policy Work Programme process at a future date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Sale of shares to close relative should be excluded Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The sale of shares in a QC to a close relative should be excluded from the proposed continuity test. This is common in intergenerational planning and it would be unfair to lose QC status in these circumstances. Comment We agree with the submission. Such shareholder changes as part of intergenerational planning should not need to wait until a shareholder’s death. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Shareholding changes within existing shareholder groups should be excluded Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Shareholding changes within a group of existing QC shareholders should be excluded from the proposed continuity test. It would be unfair if a QC test applied to changes in shareholding between existing shareholders. This happens often in family situations and applying the continuity test in this situation would be unfair and unnecessarily restrictive. Comment Officials do not consider the situation of existing shareholders selling out to the remaining shareholders should be excluded from the proposed continuity requirement. Such exclusion would make the rule more complex and difficult to apply. It would also potentially enable a group of existing shareholders to realise upfront any future benefit through selling to one remaining shareholder. Many of the situations where shareholding changes occur within a QC are likely to involve family members in which case the recommendation to the previous issue (Issue: Sale of shares to a close relative should be excluded) will provide flexibility to change shareholding within existing QC shareholders. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Rollover relief for livestock Submission (KPMG ) A LTC structure is generally not suitable for farm succession due to an omission in the rollover relief for trading stock on transfer of LTC interests not including livestock. This omission should be addressed. Income arises due to livestock being held on the notional standard cost method which is used to a greater or lesser degree by almost all livestock farmers. Either livestock should be included in the rollover relief under section HB 6 or QC status should be maintained for transfers to associated persons. Comment Section HB 6 relates to disposals of a LTC owner’s interests in trading stock other than livestock. The policy intent was to exclude livestock from section HB 6. Instead, livestock is transferred at market value rather than there being rollover relief. This is because when there is a significant difference between market value and tax book value there is the opportunity to create tax planning advantages if the tax book value is rolled over. The difference between the tax book value and market value of livestock is generally large and so we do not wish to provide rollover relief for it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Dividends by ex-qualifying companies within wholly owned groups Submission (Alexandra Low & Associates, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Companies that have previously been a QC cannot utilise the exemption for dividends between wholly owned companies in section CW 10. This is an overreach and creates uncertainty and unintended consequences. It is common for a wholly owned group to have a company that at one point was a QC. A limited exception should be introduced when the company can demonstrate to Inland Revenue that it has no overdrawn current accounts at conversion date. The change should be retrospective to the date the relevant section (CW 14) in its present form was introduced. (Alexandra Low & Associates) The associated section in the QC rules (section HA 17) should be repealed and the mischief it is intended to target should be addressed through the general anti-avoidance rule. Alternat ively, sect ion HA 17 should be redrafted to more expressly and specifically address the scenario that it was enacted to prevent. (Deloitte) 38 Section HA 17 should be clarified to provide that the exclusion of the application of section CW 10 applies only if the recipient company is currently a QC. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The current rule that prevents companies that were previously QCs from using the exemption for dividends between wholly owned companies (the intercorporate dividend exemption) is intended to address avoidance risks. These risks were identified when developing the QC regime in the early 1990s. 2 The potential avoidance cited was when a QC creates capital gains through revaluing its shares it holds in a non-qualifying company. These capital gains can be passed to shareholders as exempt dividends and funded by a loan back to the QC. If the QC then converts to an ordinary company, the company can, if the intercorporate dividend exemption is available, receive an exempt dividend from other companies in a wholly owned group which could be used to repay the loan from the shareholder without a tax cost. However, we agree that the current rule overreaches and would apply in situations where there is no significant avoidance risk. We recommend that the prohibition should be narrowed and the rule should apply only when: • the relevant QC has previously paid unimputed dividends; and • it has been less than seven years since the company was a QC. We recommend that this should be retrospective to the 2005–06 income year (the application date of the Income Tax Act 2004). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Aligning “minimum QC interest” definition with other definitions Submission (EY) The proposed new section HA 6(4) definition of “minimum QC interest” should be revised so that it aligns with the “effective interest” concept defined in section HA 43 and measured under section HA 44. The proposed test would involve possibly having to compare different types of measurement for different shareholders and could result in additional complexity and possible confusion. Alternatively, it could be expressed similarly to the criteria in sections IA 5(2) and (3) or OA 8(7). 2 The Taxation of Distributions From Companies, Valabh Committee, November 1990. 39 Comment The test in proposed new section HA 6(4) is the test that is commonly used for all continuity provisions. A QC will have to apply a similar test for the purposes of the loss continuity rules. As a result, we consider that the proposed test in section HA 6(4) is preferred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consistency between “qualifying company continuity period” and other defined terms Submission (EY) Any references to “continuity period” in the “minimum QC interest” definition should be expressed as “QC continuity period” to ensure consistency with that defined term and remove any uncertainty. Comment We agree with the submission. The references in this section to “continuity period” are an error and should be expressed as “QC continuity period”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Including section HA 6 within definition of “continuity provisions” Submission (EY) Section HA 6 should be included in the section YA 1 definition of “continuity provision” to ensure that section YC 8 can apply in relation to the death of a shareholder and section YC 9 in relation to trustee holders. Comment We agree with the submission. The provisions in sections YC 8 and YC 9 should apply to the QC continuity provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 40 TAINTED CAPITAL GAINS Clause 23 Issue: Support for removing tainting from certain capital gains Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC) Six submitters supported the proposal to remove “tainting” from certain capital gains. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Wider review of taxation of capital gains and dividend regime Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There is a need to review the rules for the taxation of capital gains and the dividend regime as a whole. The current government policy is not to impose tax on capital gains. Companies can only distribute capital gains tax-free to shareholders on liquidation. It is not sound tax policy to restrict tax-free capital gains only to liquidation. Comment Look-through companies (and QCs) can distribute capital gains without needing to liquidate, because this means the tax outcome is the same as if the owner had invested directly. Other closely held companies can only distribute capital gains tax-free on liquidation. While we acknowledge the concerns raised by the submitter, the issues are intertwined with the treatment of dividends and raise a number of complex considerations. We do not think that the issues can be considered in isolation to the whole approach to entity taxation and the treatment of dividends. This would be a significant piece of work which we consider would best be handled through the standard Tax Policy Work Programme process at a future date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 Issue: Support for proposal relating to assets sold outside the group Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the removal of tainting of gains on assets sold between companies when the asset is subsequently sold outside of the group. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application to tainted capital gains from 1988–2010 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Capital gains made between 1988 and 2010 are subject to the “related parties” test which preceded the “associated persons” test. The “tainted” gains under the “related parties” test should be treated the same as the “tainted” gains under the “associated persons” test. Many taxpayers delayed winding up companies in expectation of this. Comment We agree with the submission. The policy intention is that both situations should be covered. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Assets that have ceased to exist Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Clarification is needed in respect of how the proposed rule, which requires measuring ownership at the time of liquidation, operates when the property in question has ceased to exist or has been significantly impaired in value. Comment If, at the time of liquidation the asset ceases to exist, any capital gain amount or loss relating to the asset should be untainted. We will clarify this point in the Tax Information Bulletin. 42 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Wider application to close companies Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Consideration should be given to amending the proposed inter-company transfer provision, so that it will not apply to “close companies”. Such a rule is not appropriate for “close companies”, which should be taxed in a manner consistent with direct ownership of property. If this proposal is adopted, consideration should also be given to the definition of “close company”, which currently excludes companies in which 50 percent or more of the shares are held by one or more trusts. Comment The tainted capital gains rule is intended as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent closely associated companies selling assets between themselves to create additional capital reserves that can be distributed tax free. The risk the rule is intended to address can occur in situations when any third party influence in the companies is minimal. This risk can therefore exist in close company situations and officials consider the rule should apply to them. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying “time of liquidation” Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) There is uncertainty about what amounts to the “time of liquidation”. This might include: • when the decision to liquidate is made; • when resolution to liquidate is made; • when the liquidator is appointed; or • when amounts are distributed. 43 Comment We consider that the time of liquidation should be the time when amounts are distributed. This should be clarified in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Capital gains made before date of enactment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society) Officials should clarify that the proposals will apply to situations when the capital gain has been made prior to the date of enactment and the liquidation (including distribution) has occurred after the date of enactment. Comment The provision is intended to apply to capital gains made either prior to or after the date of enactment and the relevant distribution as a result of the liquidation occurs after the date of enactment. We will clarify th is in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Backdating tainted capital gains provision Submission ( PwC) Taxpayers who have wound up, made distributions and exposed themselves to a liability before enactment should be able to benefit from the proposed amendments. The key issue for these taxpayers is inadvertent non-compliance as a result of the taxpayer and their advisors not being aware of the current rule which policymakers have acknowledged is too wide. The proposed changes should be made retrospective from the commencement of the 2006–07 income year. If it is deemed that retrospective application of these rules is not appropriate, Inland Revenue should issue operational guidance that confirms historic tainted capital gains will not be pursued except in circumstances where the new rules are breached. Taxpayers should have certainty over previous positions if their position is consistent with the proposed new rules. 44 Comment We do not consider there to be a strong case for retrospective application in this situation or, alternatively preserving past positions taken. The tainted capital gains rule clearly applied for the years prior to the proposed amendment. Retrospective legislation would provide a windfall gain for non-compliance with a clear rule. This would be unfair to those who were previously compliant and paid tax based on the rule or who incurred other costs as a result of the rule. There will be situations when taxpayers have gained no advantage from the transfer but trying to distinguish this situation from others is not practically feasible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 RWT ON DIVIDENDS Clauses 20, 239, 240, 241 and 242 Issue: Support for relaxing RWT requirements Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, EY) Three submitters supported the proposed amendments to relax resident withholding tax (RWT) requirements. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Removing RWT for all dividends between companies Submission (KPMG ) The RWT requirement to withhold should be removed altogether for dividends between companies. There is no policy reason for deducting RWT in this situation. Comment Removing RWT for all dividends for companies would create tax evasion and avoidance concerns. As part of the review of closely held company taxation issues, consideration was given to enabling a company to elect out of paying RWT when the company directors provide a guarantee of payment of the eventual tax (as the guarantee would address some of these evasion and avoidance concerns). However, it was concluded that this issue was best dealt with as part of the work to simplify business tax processes as this work was considering similar issues, and because the change would, given existing processes, come at a significant fiscal cost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 46 Issue: RWT rate on dividends between companies should be 28% Submission (Chapman Tripp) The RWT treatment of dividends should be aligned with that for interest payments and the unimputed portion of dividends paid to companies should be 28% as it is for interest paid to companies. Comment In principle, we agree with this submission. In effect it would extend the proposal in the bill which enables RWT not to be deducted on dividends to corporates when the dividend is fully imputed. However, we are concerned about making this change without the opportunity for wider consultation. To ensure this matter is progressed expeditiously, officials recommend it be handled as part of other work currently being done on changes to business taxation proposed as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Wider issues on grossing up non-cash dividends Submission (KPMG ) The requirement to gross-up non-cash dividends can mean additional RWT must be withheld, even though this additional amount is ultimately refundable to the shareholder and comes at an additional cash cost to the payer. This highlights the cashflow issue many companies face with the current gross-up requirement for deducting RWT on non-cash dividends generally. This wider issue needs to be considered. Comment Issues with non-cash dividends are currently being considered by Inland Revenue in a separate project. We consider it is more appropriate to consider this issue in that project. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 47 Issue: New option should be available when non-cash dividends are paid Submission (EY) Proposed new section RE 14B should also be available when a non-cash dividend subject to section RE 15 is provided. Doing so prevents gross-up and double taxation issues. Comment Section RE 15 relates to dividends that are bonus issues in lieu or shares issued under a profit distribution plan. Whether these types of non-cash dividends should also be included in the new formula that combines cash and non-cash dividends paid concurrently to determine the amount of RWT payable could be an item for further consideration as part of future work on RWT and dividends. However, at this time we do not believe it is a high priority item as we understand the key concern was in relation to other types of non-cash dividends, which is being addressed in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying what gross amounts shareholders are taxable on for cash and non-cash dividends Submission (EY) The wording of section RA 9 should be revised to ensure that the dividend amounts that may be taxable to shareholders include amounts of tax paid on a shareholder’s behalf in relation to any distribution as well as to amounts withheld from monetary payment. Comment We consider that this issue would require more time for consideration and is more appropriately handled as part of any future work on dividends. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 48 Issue: Similar option for NRWT Submission (EY) A similar amendment as that proposed for RWT should be made for NRWT as the same issue arises for NRWT as are being addressed for RWT. Comment We consider that the proposed amendment would require more time for officials to work through. This is an item that could be considered on any future review of dividends. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for fix to backdated dividend provision Submission (BDO, KPMG) Submitters supported the proposed fix to section CD 39(9) which allows a dividend to be backdated to clear a shareholder’s overdrawn current account. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Equivalent amendment to section RD 36(2)(b) Submission (BDO, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) An equivalent amendment to that made in section CD 39(9)(c) needs to be made to section RD 36(2)(b), which relates to employment-related loans that can be cleared by backdating various income payments to the beginning of the income year. The policy rationale for both of these provisions is the same and both should be similarly amended to ensure that the provisions work as intended. Comment We agree with the submission. Both situations enable a payment to be backdated to clear a shareholder’s current account. This backdating cannot be technically achieved because of the requirement that RWT has not been deducted from the payment. An amendment is required to rectify this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 Issue: Clarification on amount of cash dividend required to satisfy the RWT liability Submission (EY) The proposed section RE 14B(2) formula should work appropriately but it assumes the “cash dividend” amount is known. The key question in practice will likely be “what amount of cash dividend is required simply to satisfy the RWT liability?”. An appropriate formula in the legislation should be considered. Alternatively, the Commissioner should provide appropriate examples to show how that amount is arrived at, as well as illustrating the relevant amounts to be included in dividend statements for shareholders. Comment We will provide further guidance on this in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarifying application date Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Commentary to the bill states that the application date of clauses 239(1) and (4) is from the date of enactment but the bill says it applies from 1 April 2017. This should be clarified. Comment These clauses contain amendments to allow companies to opt out of deducting RWT from fully imputed dividends paid to corporate shareholders. The amendments should apply from 1 April 2017 as in the bill. We will clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 PAYE ON SHAREHOLDER-EMPLOYEE SALARIES Clauses 234, 235, 236 and 262 Issue: Support for amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society) Two submitters supported the proposed amendment to PAYE on shareholder-employee salaries. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Irrevocable nature of election unclear Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It is unclear whether the legislation achieves the policy intent of making an election between provisional tax and PAYE irrevocable. This is because if the requirements of section RD 3C are not met it is unclear what the consequences are. Comment The consequence of non-compliance with section RD 3C should be that the person defaults to PAYE. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Elections should only be irrevocable for a limited period Submission (EY) The proposed options for shareholder salary are too limited and should not be irrevocable or made on a “once only” basis. Instead, an election should be irrevocable for a limited period – say, three income years. This would enable flexibility for changing circumstances such as changing profitability, solvency or ownership. 51 Comment We agree with the submission and consider a three-income year irrevocable period appropriate for switches from PAYE. We also consider that a taxpayer should be able to switch from paying full or partial provisional tax on shareholder salary to paying PAYE on the salary without time restrictions. This is because the consequence of non-compliance with the shareholder salary rule is that the taxpayer defaults to paying PAYE on the salary. If a taxpayer can switch to PAYE through non-compliance, a compliant taxpayer should be able to switch to PAYE without needing to be non-compliant. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Noting ability of LTC to pay non-PAYE deducted salary Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Retrospective “minor technical amendments” have been proposed to section RD 3. The Commentary to the bill states that “these do not alter the scope of section RD 3”. This does not appear to be the case and the changes will enable LTCs to pay non-PAYE deducted shareholder salaries. This change should be noted in the Tax Information Bulletin for the bill. Comment The proposed technical amendment in clause 234 is a retrospective rewrite clarification and applies only up to the date which proposed clause 235 applies from. Clause 235 expressly excludes LTCs companies from the rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Enabling LTCs to pay non-PAYE deducted salary Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Given the ability of LTCs to pay non-PAYE deducted shareholder salaries, the proposed changes to enable a mix of PAYE and non-PAYE deducted salaries should apply to LTCs. 52 Comment As outlined above, under the proposal in clause 235 of the bill, LTCs will expressly not be able to pay non-PAYE deducted shareholder salary. This is just a restatement of the current position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of shareholder-employee amendments Submission (EY) The proposed shareholder-employee amendments apply from the date of enactment. However, it is unclear how elections under proposed new sections RD 3D and RD 3C would be made. Election under the provisions would apply to all amounts paid in the year even though the election may be during an income year. The bill should clarify the first income year for which the election may be made and provide some savings provision as necessary for situations when amounts may already have been paid, but not treated exactly as required under either of the new provisions. Comment We agree with the submission and consider the amendment should apply for the 2017–18 and later income years. We also consider that a taxpayer should be able to choose on election whether to use the new options for all payments over the income year or solely for payments from the date of election. This would help address transitional difficulties. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting of section RD 3 Submission (EY) Section RD 3(1)(b)(ii) needs to refer to the circumstances set out in the proposed new subsection (3), at least to the extent amounts are treated as income other than from a PAYE income payment, as well as to subsection (2) (as proposed to be replaced). 53 Comment We agree with the submission. Payments for which RD 3(3) applies should not be included in the defin it ion of “PAYE income payments”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 OTHER CLOSE COMPANY MATTERS No clause Issue: Clarifying definition of “close company” when there is a trustee shareholder Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The definition of a “close company” needs clarification. Many family companies are owned by trustees and it is appropriate that they get the compliance cost savings of being a close company. There has been a view expressed that companies owned by trustee shareholders currently satisfy the definition of a close company. This should be clarified. Comment Inland Revenue is currently considering whether the current definition of “close company” can include companies with trustee shareholders. Once this is complete, officials plan to consider what legislative changes or further guidance is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: A revocation of LTC status should require a unanimous election Submission ( PwC) The current LTC election rules are unbalanced. All owners of a company must sign an election form to elect into being a LTC, but only one owner is required to revoke the election. This can have significant impact on a company and should be addressed by requiring a unanimous election to revoke LTC status by all owners. In practice, this risk can be mitigated by putting a shareholder agreement in place. However, this increases compliance costs and, in our experience is not routinely put in place by closely held companies. Comment We consider that as all look-through owners of a LTC are personally responsible for the tax on their share of the LTCs business profits, it would not be appropriate to change the rules to restrict an owner’s ability to elect out. Furthermore, if the owners have had a falling out, obtaining unanimous agreement is likely to be difficult. 55 Instead we consider that shareholders’ risks are best dealt with through the use of shareholder agreements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying scenarios where LTC owners are not bound by elections or methods adopted by a LTC Submission ( PwC) There are currently some situations when LTC owners are not bound by elections or methods adopted by a LTC. There are a number of questions about how these various elections apply and they should be clarified either through legislative change or through further commentary by Inland Revenue. Comment We agree that, similar to LTC transparency issues, this could be an area for further consideration. However, we believe that it should be a low priority on the Tax Policy Work Programme given the significant competing demands. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 NRWT: Related party and branch lending 57 58 “MONEY LENT” AND “INTEREST” Clauses 246, 247 and 262 Issue: Money lent and branches Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed definitions of “money lent” and “interest” apply to “a resident in New Zealand”. The amendment should equally apply to a non-resident where they carry on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Comment Officials agree that these definitions, and the subsequent provisions that rely on them, should also apply to New Zealand branches of non-residents. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Excepted financial arrangements Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed new definitions both rely on the financial arrangement rules applying. However, not all “funding” is provided under the financial arrangement rules. For example, some “funding” relates to excepted financial arrangements. An election to treat an excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement (under section EW 8) may have an impact on the NRWT regime applying under the current drafting. This is not appropriate (and such an election may only be made at year-end after interest is paid). There would also be an inappropriate difference between an election being made under section ED 4, which does not give rise to a financial arrangement and section EW 8, which does. Comment Where a taxpayer elects to treat an excepted financial arrangement as a financial arrangement and claims income tax deductions on that basis, officials see no reason why they should not also be covered by the proposed rules. Officials note that the submitter does not suggest any practical d ifficu lt ies w ith doing so. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 59 Issue: Straightforward funding Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed definition of “interest” for the NRWT rules and a related party debt, broadly means amounts provided to the non-resident lender by the New Zealand resident borrower. In the case of complex derivative financial instruments, amounts may be provided by the non- resident lender to the related party borrower. The definition of “interest” does not take into account amounts provided by the non-resident lender to the borrower and, as there is no mechanism to offset or reduce the borrower’s non- resident financial arrangement income (NRFAI), this may result in over-taxation of the non- resident lender. To minimise any over-taxation these rules should be limited to straightforward funding (relatively simple derivative financial instruments that are issued with standard features), or an offsetting mechanism should be introduced. Comment The intention of these proposals is to cover arrangements that are debt or economically equivalent to debt. It would be impossible to achieve the policy intention if the scope of the proposals was limited to arrangements that provided straightforward funding as there are an almost infinite number of options to achieve an equivalent outcome using more complex products. These proposals have been limited to arrangements that provide funding and as such will not cover arrangements that are not entered into to provide funding such as interest rate or foreign exchange swaps or collateral held as security on a derivative. The proposed addition to the definition of interest only applies to amounts paid by a person in relation to money lent to a person. Officials also note that these arrangements are entered into between related parties who will continue to have choice over how they structure their arrangements and whether they will t rigger the NRFAI rules at all. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Scope of definitions Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We are concerned that the term “funding” is too broad and may capture commercial arrangements that should not give rise to NRWT. For example, it could be argued that swaps, or collateral provided in relation to swaps, provide “funding”, with the result that payments under a swap become subject to NRWT. This is a significant departure from the current position and appears inappropriate. (Chapman Tripp) 60 The definitions are very wide. We recommend clear examples be published by Inland Revenue of balances that fall within the definition of “money lent” and the definition of “interest”, and balances that do not. For example, some derivatives have a funding element and there is uncertainty about whether this could / would capture those. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Due to the variety of financial products available it will not be possible for officials to provide a definitive list of examples of arrangements that will or will not be covered by these definitions. It is also for this reason that the legislation uses the term “provides funding” rather than providing a definitive list of what is or is not covered by these rules. However, officials agree that guidance will be useful to taxpayers who are affected by these rules, and will provide a number of examples in the Tax Information Bulletin after the rules are enacted. As noted elsewhere, arrangements that are not economically equivalent to a loan, such as a forward foreign exchange agreement or interest rate swap, or collateral provided in relation to swaps are not intended to be covered by the term “provides funding” Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Cross-reference between money lent and NRFAI Submission (Russell McVeagh) Given that proposed section RF 2(1)(e) would expressly include NRFAI in the definition of non-resident passive income, it is unnecessary (and confusing) to also define “interest” and “money lent” in section YA 1 to include NRFAI. Alternatively, if the amendments to the definitions of “interest” and “money lent” are retained, they should be amended to refer simply to NRFAI as defined in section RF 12D (as the definitions currently proposed are not consistent with the way NRFAI is defined). Comment The amendments to the definitions of “interest” and “money lent” are to ensure that amounts which give rise to financial arrangement deductions also give rise to NRWT rather than as an additional definition of NRFAI. Officials do not consider any changes are required in this area. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 61 Issue: Interest relates to money lent Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section RF 2(1)(d)(i) includes that the “interest relates to money lent”. This wording is too wide as this exclusion from the definition of non-resident passive income should be narrowly targeted at only specific interest that should not be subject to NRWT. Comment Officials recommend that this wording is replaced by the wording “is derived from”, which also links better with the opening wording in existing section RF 2(1). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Lending by non-resident banks Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section RF 2(1)(d)(ii) should be reordered to make it clear that the New Zealand branch relates to the non-resident rather than the borrower. Comment This change will not alter the meaning of the proposed section but will clarify its application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 62 NON-RESIDENT FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT INCOME Clauses 5, 15, 55, 246 to 248, 252, 253, 261 and 262 Issue: The proposals should not go ahead Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, KPMG) We are broadly supportive of legislative amendment to prevent a mismatch in timing of payment of NRWT and interest deductions for related party lending. However, the proposals in the bill, particularly the calculations required to determine whether a substantial deferral of payment of interest has occurred, seem an overly complex method of preventing a mismatch. (Chapman Tripp) We agree that New Zealand’s tax policy settings need to be robust and that there is a need to strengthen the NRWT rules in respect of back-to-back arrangements. However, with the exception of back-to-back arrangements, there is not a strong case to change the current policy settings on NRWT and AIL, particularly in advance of the Government finalising its decisions on anti-BEPS measures. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) These proposals have been subject to extensive consultation over the last year. We expressed concerns that the proposals as originally consulted would increase the cost of capital in New Zealand and potentially defer inbound investment. Measures included in this bill are more targeted and so will have a lesser impact. We remain unconvinced that some of the measures are required. (EY) We remain of the view that there has been no clear statement of the underlying policy of the NRWT rules and the proposed changes appear to be ad hoc solutions to a set of disparate problems. Our strong recommendation is that changes to the NRWT and AIL regimes be considered concurrently with any changes to the interest deductibility rules to ensure consistency and coherence. (KPMG ) Comment One submitter noted the recent publication by officials of New Zealand’s Taxation Framework for Inbound Investment – A draft overview of current tax policy settings. Officials consider this provides further detail on how NRWT fits into the policy framework and supports the introduction of the proposals in the bill. Officials consider the proposals do not represent any significant shift in the framework behind how interest payments to non-residents are taxed. Rather, the proposed changes are to level the playing field, ensuring that economically similar transactions are taxed in the same way. The proposed changes will also only affect a small number of taxpayers. Firms who are currently paying NRWT on interest payments should be unaffected by the proposals – the majority of firms that will be affected are those that have planned around the existing rules, but will now have to join other firms and apply those rules. 63 For this reason officials do not consider it is necessary to delay this project so decisions are made at the same time as decisions on other BEPS-related measures. The changes in this bill are to ensure existing taxes apply appropriately. Furthermore, the proposals seem entirely consistent with the BEPS agenda. In particular, a component of the BEPS agenda is aimed at eliminating tax benefits arising from borrowers deducting on an accrual basis while lenders recognise the same income on a payments basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternative approach – denying interest deductions Submission (Chapman Tripp, OliverShaw) A simpler approach would be to defer the interest deduction for related party lending until NRWT has been paid. (Chapman Tripp) To the extent to which accrued interest deductions on which NRWT/AIL are not paid is a base maintenance problem, in the interim a targeted response that is more clearly consistent with DTAs (such as a targeted denial of interest deductions) should be developed. (OliverShaw) Comment Several countries, including Australia and the United States, have rules which defer or deny deductions for interest paid to a non-resident where NRWT is not paid on the interest. These rules can be complex to understand and are not always targeted at the same issue that the bill attempts to address of aligning the timing of income tax deductions and NRWT payments for related party debts. For example, the rule in Australia does not attempt to align the timing of the tax on the income with the timing of the deduction. Where the deduction is available in advance of the income being taxed, the deduction is allowed, but then denied if the tax is not paid. A rule which would achieve a similar outcome to the bill would defer a borrower’s income tax deduction for interest on related party debt until the lender (or the borrower on its behalf) paid NRWT on the equivalent income. The principal advantages of deferring deductions instead of imposing NRWT are that: • there would not need to be any changes to the existing NRWT rules; and • the cashflow issues arising from requiring a borrower to pay NRWT in the absence of an actual payment do not arise. While officials agree that a deferral of deductions would simplify some aspects when compared with incurring NRWT on an accrual basis, it would also create concerns that do not arise under the bill proposal. The primary reasons the bill proposal is preferred are: 64 • It is more economically sound. The financial arrangement rules are designed to give an accurate measure of a person’s income or expenditure from financial arrangements, for the purpose of then calculating the person’s tax liability. Deferring deductions will reduce this accuracy. That in turn has the potential to create difficulties. For example, deferral allows a company in tax loss to artificially preserve the interest deduction (by not paying it), in a situation where it might otherwise be eliminated by an ownership change. • The deferral calculation would be complex. For example, suppose deferral were applied to a related party loan in a foreign currency. It would not make sense to apply deferral to the recognition of foreign currency movements on the loan, since these are not subject to NRWT in any event. Furthermore, if the loan is hedged, deferral of recognition of foreign currency movements might well create a timing mismatch. Deferring part of the expenditure but not all would be complex. • It would be difficult to integrate with the thin capitalisation regime. Deferral would, prima facie, mean that interest economically incurred in one year would give rise (or not) to an additional amount of income under the thin capitalisation rules, depending on the borrower’s debt/equity ratio in the later year when the interest is paid, rather than in the year it economically accrues. That would not be desirable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternative approach – anti-avoidance/intention test Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh) The proposed annual deferral calculation should be replaced with a purpose or intention-based test when the loan is entered into. A purpose or intention-based test will prevent a substantial increase in compliance costs as a result of the proposed complex rules. Alternatively, the proposed rules should not be enacted and section BG 1 should be applied if loans have an inappropriate deferral mechanism. Guidance on how section BG 1 applies to loans with an inappropriate deferral mechanism should be published by Inland Revenue. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It would be preferable to adopt a targeted anti-avoidance rule. One possibility would be a rule reversing prior year deductions under the financial arrangements rules if NRWT is not paid on or before a base price adjustment (BPA) is performed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) Arrangements with the purpose or effect of deferring NRWT (or similar) should already be caught under section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This may suggest that no law change is required to target such arrangements; however, for clarificat ion, officials may want to consider a targeted principle-based test as an alternative. On this basis, officials should consider a principle-based test targeting arrangements that have the purpose or effect of deferring NRWT (or similar). (Deloitte) 65 Comment An anti-avoidance rule would not address all of the concerns motivating the NRFAI proposals. For example, if a non-resident invests in a newly planted forest, there may be good commercial reasons for any related party debt to be non-interest paying. However, this situation should not be allowed to give rise to a mismatch between NRWT and interest deductions. Officials consider that the proposals in the bill are appropriately targeted so that many of the transactions that would need to be covered by an anti-avoidance rule will also be covered by the proposals in the bill. The advantage of the bill proposals when compared with an anti- avoidance rule is increased certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue over whether a transaction is covered by the rules. Furthermore, anti-avoidance rules can create uncertainty over the appropriate reconstruction even if the anti-avoidance rule applies. While ant i-avoidance rules are often desirable, officials consider the proposals in the issues paper are a more appropriate response, and do not recommend they be replaced by an anti- avoidance rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interaction with double tax agreements Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, OliverShaw) New Zealand’s current double tax agreements (DTAs) have been negotiated, understood and applied in the context of the existing NRWT rules, which focus on interest payments. Analysis is required on how the proposed changes will be affected by New Zealand’s DTAs. For example, it is unclear whether the changes will be subject to challenge under the treaties. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There needs to be further consideration of DTA implications relating to the NRFAI proposals and publication of detailed explanations on when and how any DTA relief or limitations will apply to any NRWT payable under the NRWT amendments for related party debt and the NRFAI rules. Particular DTA issues needing such treatment include: • whether or not NRFAI income deemed derived under New Zealand’s domestic law will be treated as payment of interest to which the Interest Articles of all New Zealand’s DTAs may apply to limit the rate of any New Zealand NRWT; • the need for clarification of the intended relationship of proposed section RF 12I(3) to the NRWT provisions; and • whether or not any DTA relief may apply and, if so, how, if section RF 12I(3) is intended to apply to the effect that some or all interest paid to a direct non-resident lender (or NRFAI deemed to arise in such situations) has to be treated as received on behalf of some other non-resident party and subject to NRWT. 66 Confirmation is also required that non-resident entities, which are deemed to derive NRFAI income, will be able to claim appropriate foreign tax credits in their home jurisdictions. (EY) The bill proposes that the interest is “deemed to be paid” but that cannot override a treaty already entered into – that is, change the treaty by deeming something to be what it is not. A reasonable conclusion is that the bill proposals are overridden by our treaties in the absence of a specific treaty override. As a result, if the bill proceeds, we give up the ability to tax under NRWT rules and we do not have the ability to tax under NRFAI rules because of the DTAs. It would seem that New Zealand would lose the right to tax interest income of foreigners in many DTA countries. (OliverShaw) Comment Officials can see no reason to believe that imposition of NRWT on an accrual basis would breach New Zealand’s current tax treaties. Most of New Zealand’s tax treaties define interest to include income treated as interest by the state imposing the tax (see, for example, article 11(5) of the New Zealand/Australia DTA). Only a few older treaties (for example, the United Kingdom DTA) use the OECD Model. Even the OECD Model is likely to be expansively interpreted, in this respect. Officials also note that if a deferral approach were to be implemented instead, that might face an issue of treaty consistency under some of New Zealand’s treaties, which contain an older form of anti-discriminat ion article, prohibiting discrimination in the tax treatment of a payment for the payer on the basis of the residence of the payee. Officials do not agree there is a requirement that interest be “paid” before a source country can tax it under a treaty. For example: • Many of New Zealand’s DTAs (for example, those with Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) do not use the word “paid” at all. • Those DTAs that do use “paid” use it in paragraph (1), which allows the residence country to tax interest arising in the source country. The reference in paragraph (2) to “such interest” does not necessarily incorporate the “paid” requirement”. • If “paid” were interpreted literally (in the way suggested by submissions), in those DTAs where it is used, New Zealand would not be able to apply the financial arrangement rules to tax New Zealand-resident lenders deriving interest from borrowers resident in the other state. Paragraph (1) would only give New Zealand the right to tax interest sourced in (for example) China if the interest was “paid”. In almost 30 years, no-one has made that argument. • “Paid” is not defined in any of the DTAs so can be defined in accordance with New Zealand law. Officials do not believe that the imposition of NRWT on an accrual basis would affect a foreign lender being able to claim a foreign tax credit (FTC) in its home jurisdiction. It would not do so in New Zealand or in Australia, nor has any basis been put to us on which that could sensibly be argued. It is common for countries to have different rules for recognising income and expenditure. FTC systems need to deal with this issue all the time. Logically, if a source country withholds tax on an item of income before the residence country taxes it, there should be no difficulty for the residence country giving a credit for the source country tax at the time that the residence country taxes the income. Both New Zealand and Australia’s FTC systems work in this way. 67 For non-resident lenders who for residence-country tax purposes have to declare income on an accrual basis (as Australian lenders are required to) the new rules will accelerate their ability to claim a foreign tax credit. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Interaction with transfer pricing Submission (EY) New Zealand’s income tax transfer pricing rules include several provisions to deal with compensating arrangements and the effect of adjustments made when an arm’s length amount of consideration is substituted under sections GC 7 or GC 8. Section GC 12 provides that withholding tax obligations are not generally affected by adjustments under any of sections GC 7 to GC 10, except to the extent to which GC 11(2) applies. The bill does not currently include any specific provision about whether or how the NRFAI rules may apply if interest expenditure on cross-border associated party lending into New Zealand is adjusted under the transfer pricing rules. The position should be clarified and the statutory provisions amended appropriately. Comment The interaction between NRFAI and a transfer pricing adjustment will be the same as the interaction between interest and a transfer pricing adjustment. If a New Zealand borrower has paid NRWT on NRFAI and a transfer pricing adjustment subsequently reduces the income tax deduction that borrower is entitled to, this will have no effect on the NRWT liability, unless an application is made under section GC 11. Alternatively, if the parties agree to a reduction in the financing cost for the borrower in line with the application of subpart GC, this will have the same impact on the lender’s liability for NRWT on NRFAI as it would if the NRWT were imposed on interest. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amounts subject to NRFAI Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The definition of non-resident financial arrangement income “NRFAI” in proposed section RF 12D should be amended. Amounts (for example, certain fees) paid to parties other than the non-resident related party lender should not be included in the calculation of NRFAI. 68 Comment Officials agree that amounts that will not be received by the non-resident lender should not be included in NRFAI (for example, fees paid by the borrower to a third party that are part of the same arrangement). Equivalent modifications should also be made to the deferral calculation and prepayment rule for the same reason. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Timing of foreign currency conversion – general Submission (EY) The general section YF 1(2) rule would require conversion at the close of the trad ing spot exchange rate “on the date at which the amount is required to be measured or calculated”. In the NRFAI context we assume that should mean conversion as at the “NRFAI due date” (that is, the last day of the second month after a terminating event, otherwise the last day of the second month following the New Zealand borrower’s balance date (section RF 12E)), with no further conversion required (or allowed) as at the date the related NRWT must be paid to Inland Revenue. Confirmation would be desirable. Comment As noted by the submitter, the date that NRFAI is treated as paid is provided in proposed section RF 12E as the last day of the second month after a terminating event, otherwise the last day of the second month following the New Zealand borrower’s balance date. The currency conversion should be calculated as at that day consistent with any other interest payment that had been paid on the same date. Officials note that this is not the NRFAI due date which is defined in proposed section RF 2(9) and will usually be the 20 th of the month following the date the payment is treated as paid. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Timing of foreign currency conversion – de minimis limit Submission (EY) It is not necessarily clear when amounts should be converted in determining whether or not the NZ$40,000 de minimis limit in proposed section RF 2B(3) is met. Clarificat ion of that aspect would be desirable. 69 Comment The conversion of expenditure under loans denominated in a foreign currency will use different rates, depending on whether the taxpayer is converting foreign currency flows (valued at spot) or balances – for example, end of year balance might be valued at spot, or might be valued at a forward rate from when the loan was entered into, using the expected value approach. The taxpayer already has to work out its New Zealand dollar expenditure from a financial arrangement, including a foreign currency financial arrangement and this is the amount that would be included for the purpose of applying the de minimis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Timing of foreign currency conversion – mismatches Submission (EY) There would be substantial mismatches between the New Zealand dollar amounts of NRFAI income brought in under section RF 12 first year adjustments, assuming the latter would convert the total accrual income for all pre-NRFAI periods at the single “NRFAI due date” when it had to be brought into account. In some cases, the New Zealand borrowers may have been parties to relevant FAs for a number of years and the New Zealand dollar value of any “interest” amounts, even when distinguished from other elements of their FA expenditure in those past years, may be quite different from any amount calculated and converted as a single amount of a future NRFAI due date. Comment As with the general point above, the conversion date of a first year adjustment will be the date in proposed section RF 12E(b). Officials acknowledge choosing a single currency conversion point for the first year adjustment is highly likely to result in a different conversion rate from when the arrangement matures or the interest would have otherwise been paid. Whether this results in a greater or lesser amount of New Zealand dollar NRWT being payable will depend on the relative strength of the New Zealand dollar at the point of conversion. This does not seem problematic. As the NRWT liability is initially calculated in the currency that the arrangement is denominated in, there would be no subsequent adjustment for any first year adjustment treated as paid to the extent foreign exchange rates subsequently move. Officials will include examples of the currency conversion in the Tax Information Bulletin after the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 70 Issue: Numerator and denominator should be consistent Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The numerator and denominator in proposed section RF 2B(4) are inconsistent. Accumulated payments (numerator) refers to interest paid to all non-residents. In some cases this will be narrower than the accumulated accruals test (denominator), which refers to total expenditure under the arrangement. Total expenditure is the amount allowed as a deduction under a financial arrangement which may not equate to the actual interest paid to a non-resident. For example, total expenditure will include integral transaction costs. Amounts may also be paid to a resident and non-resident (if there are syndicated/multiple lenders) or interest may be paid to a resident and then the loan transferred to a non-resident. This does not appear to be addressed by the proposal. Comment Officials agree that the numerator and denominator should be the same – both should refer to all payments and accruals. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interest accrued to balance date Submission (EY) We are pleased to see that the proposals in the bill have taken some account of submissions made on the May 2015 issues paper. In particular, we welcome the provision which should prevent the NRFAI rules applying in many situations where interest accrued to balance date is typically paid shortly after that date each year. Comment Officials always intended that interest accrued over a period of up to 12 months and paid after a balance date would not trigger the NRFAI rules applying. However, the method for achieving this was not outlined in the issues paper. Officials welcome support of the method included in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 71 Issue: Financial arrangement income Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh) The interest or consideration payable to the non-resident related party lender should not be spread using the same spreading method as the related party borrower as the borrower might use a method that does not correlate to the interest payments – for example, a fair value method. A mechanism is required to prevent over-taxation of the non-resident, when the borrower has income in one year and a deduction in a subsequent year. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Where a borrower fair values the financial arrangement, the amount allowed under the financial arrangement rules will diverge from the interest payments over the life of the financial arrangement. The deferral calculation might inadvertently catch transactions outside the intended focus and be wider reaching than intended. An appropriate alternative in this situation could be to provide an option of testing on an “accruals” basis. (Deloitte) Comment The NRFAI rules are not intended to impose NRWT on either currency fluctuations or fair value fluctuations. Nor are they intended to change the existing law, which does not allow non-residents to reduce the amount of their non-resident passive income by reason of currency fluctuations, fair value fluctuations or non-payment either of accrued interest or principal. By calculating the NRWT liability in the foreign currency, a significant source of financial arrangement income of a borrower is already omitted from the calculations. We agree with submitters that under the reform, where a borrower is accounting for the cost of a borrowing using the fair value method, and the borrower recognises expenditure due to an increase in the fair value of the borrowing, that should not give rise to income subject to NRWT for the lender. Nor should NRWT be reduced when there is a decrease in the fair value of the loan. Accordingly we agree that the calculations in sections RF 2B, RF 12D and RF 12F should exclude fluctuations due to changes in the fair value of an arrangement, just as they exclude fluctuations due to changes in the exchange rate in the case of a foreign currency instrument. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 72 Issue: Wash-up upon maturity Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The NRFAI rules should include an adjustment or a wash-up mechanism to reflect any financial arrangements income of the borrower so that over the life of the arrangement NRWT is only paid on interest that is in fact paid by the borrower. There is no adjustment or wash-up mechanism to recognise financial arrangement income. As a result, the rules could (over the life of a financial arrangement) require NRWT to be paid on an amount exceeding (potentially very significantly) the total net interest deductions claimed by the borrower. This would be an anomalous outcome and presumably is not intended. Comment Due to the changes recommended above it is not expected that any financial arrangement income that should not be subject to NRWT will be included in the NRWT calculation. Therefore there should not be any sort of wash-up to reflect the amount of income ultimately economically derived by a non-resident. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Income of non-resident Submission (EY) NRFAI is proposed to be included in a taxpayer’s income under section CC 4, which is headed “Payments of interest”, but proposed new section CC 4(3) does not expressly state that NRFAI should be treated as “interest” or “interest paid” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. We consider it would be desirable to include explicit statements to that effect in the body of section CC 4. Comment The purpose of section CC 4 is to confirm that NRFAI is “income”. Clearly, it is income from the lending of money, and this should be sufficient to ensure that it is treated as interest for the purpose of any DTA. It cannot be defined as “interest” for purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007, because interest is only subject to NRWT when paid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 Issue: Proposed NRFAI rules should not apply to existing arrangements Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) For arrangements entered into after enactment of the bill, it may be possible for the parties to negotiate at the outset terms which either ensure the NRFAI rules do not apply, or provide a mechanism for the borrower to recover the cost of the NRWT on the NRFAI from the lender. This is not the case for pre-existing arrangements however. The broad definition of “related- party debt” will capture a range of transactions where the borrower and lender are not commonly controlled – for example, where the lender is a member of a non-resident owning body, or where the parties are associated under the associated person rules. It cannot be assumed in such cases that the borrower will be in a position to renegotiate or prepay the loan such that the NRFAI rules will not apply. Accordingly, the proposals may impose an additional tax cost in respect of a transaction that was negotiated at arm’s length before the NRFAI proposals were introduced. Further, it may not be clear who will bear the burden of that tax cost. The NRFAI proposals should not apply to arrangements entered into prior to enactment of the bill. Comment Officials consider the application of the new rules to existing arrangements is appropriate. These changes are intended to cover situations when the current tax treatment creates the incorrect outcome. It would be inefficient to continue this tax treatment for the term of existing arrangements, which in some cases may be perpetual or indefinitely extendable. While it is proposed that existing arrangements will be covered by the new rules, these rules will only apply to interest expenditure arising from the start of the year after enactment of the proposed new rules. Even when NRFAI applies, this will frequently result in the same total tax paid as under the existing rules (the result when the arrangement involves only deferral of NRWT). It is also important that most changes will only affect related party debt which can, in the majority of cases, be restructured at relatively low cost if the parties choose to do so. Due to the operation of the deferral calculation no NRWT on NRFAI will be required to be paid until the due date for the NRWT return two months after the end of the second year starting after enactment of the proposed rules. This will provide two to three years post-enactment of the rules for any existing arrangements to mature or be restructured before they incur any cashflow or tax consequences. When there is genuine commercial funding involving third parties, a small number of targeted grandfathering provisions have been included. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 74 Issue: Reforms should not have retrospective effect Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Russell McVeagh) In the first income year for which NRWT is required to be paid on NRFAI for an arrangement, proposed section RF 12F requires NRWT to be paid on the NRFAI for that income year, plus any NRFAI (less actual interest paid) that would have arisen from the date on which the borrower became party to the arrangement (“first year additional amount”). In respect of existing arrangements, the inclusion of this first year additional amount has the effect that NRWT could be required to be paid on NRFAI deemed to arise in the years before enactment of the bill. The Commentary suggests that taxpayers can “avoid” paying NRWT under this first-year adjustment calculation by “making sufficient interest payments after the enactment of the proposals so that NRFAI does not arise”. As, in many cases, the borrower and lender will not be commonly controlled, there will be commercial tension between them, and therefore it cannot be assumed that they will agree to vary their arrangement as a result of the proposed amendments in the bill. The f irst year additional amount should not include financial arrangements rules expenditure incurred in income years of the borrower commencing before enactment of the bill. Comment The deferral calculation for existing arrangements only includes deductions and interest payments after the application of the new rules so that existing arrangements are treated consistently with new arrangements. It is only when an inappropriate level of income deferral post-enactment triggers NRFAI that the first year additional amount incorporates amounts accrued before the application of the new rules. As demonstrated by example 4 on page 40 of the bill Commentary, including accrued interest in a first year additional amount calculation can still result in a deferral of NRWT compared with replacing an existing loan with a new loan that does not have an inappropriate level of income deferral. If not for this treatment borrowers would have an incentive to maintain existing arrangements indefinitely to permanently delay the payment of NRWT for interest accrued before enactment – an approach that is specifically targeted by the proposals. The first year additional amount calculation also delays the payment of NRWT compared with applying section BG 1 to an arrangement, a proposal preferred by a number of submitters. Officials acknowledge that there may be a limited number of cases where a borrower and lender of a related party debt will not be commonly controlled. Cases considered by Inland Revenue, however, suggest that in the vast majority of cases the lender will have sufficient control over the borrower that the benefit of their funding decisions will be aligned. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 75 Issue: First year adjustment Submission (Deloitte, EY) In the first year that a non-resident derives NRFAI on a related party debt, the borrower will need to pay NRWT in relation to the debt for that income year. The proposals also require the non-resident to perform a “wash-up calculation” and pay NRWT to the extent any NRWT was deferred in previous income years (including income years the arrangement existed before enactment of these proposals). We are not supportive of this proposal. Proposals are inconsistent with the officials’ issues paper, which proposed to perform the wash-up calculation in the income year that the financial arrangement matures. We are supportive of the approach in the issues paper. We submit that the wash-up calculation in relation to the payment of deferred NRWT should be made in the year the financial arrangement matures. (Deloitte) The proposed NRFAI rules, particularly the proposed transitional “catch-up” adjustment, are punitive for taxpayers that made commercial decisions to invest in New Zealand forests years ago and entered into long-term funding arrangements to fund those investments on the basis that the payment of interest, with any resulting NRWT cash liability, would be met from revenues of harvesting completed at the end of a production cycle. (EY) Comment Officials note that the first year adjustment will only apply to existing arrangements when they continue to have interest payments that are less than interest deductions on related party debt after the enactment of the proposed new rules. When a borrower starts making interest payments (including crediting interest to the lender or funding interest payments by additional borrowing from the related party recipient of that interest) from the enactment of the proposed new rules the first year adjustment will not apply. This will result in an identical treatment to the maturity wash-up proposed in the issues paper, except that the NRWT obligation will be accelerated so that it matches deductions. This seems an entirely appropriate result. Officials also note that these rules will only apply when an investment (such as forestry) is debt funded by a non-resident related party. In most instances these investments will generate sufficient cashflow to pay the NRWT impost. If not, it should be possible for the lender to fund the NRWT. In any case, NRWT will only be one cost of running the business. The first year adjustment as contained in the bill was also recommended over the wash-up calculation proposed in the issues paper due to the significant complexity that would be required in the case of a wash up calculation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 76 Issue: Deferral calculation where there is a novation Submission (Deloitte) There is a risk that the deferral calculation does not work when there is a novation of a liability, as a borrower may be entitled to a deduction that is greater than the amount paid as interest. We consider that taxpayers would benefit from examples that show how the deferral calculation works in different transaction examples (for example, buying and selling the asset or liability for different values that can create a difference between the deduction and the NRWT/interest amount). Comment When a debt is novated the obligations of the borrower are taken over by a third party and the original borrower’s financial arrangement will mature which triggers a base price adjustment. If NRFAI had not yet been derived under that arrangement – as would be the case if the deferral calculation were still required – then the existing NRWT rules would continue to apply. Examples will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin once the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Examples of amounts other than interest Submission (Deloitte) An example of how these rules are intended to work where amounts/consideration other than interest is included in the financial arrangement would be useful (for example, convertible notes, derivatives that have a funding element, financial reinsurance, credit/asset/index linked notes and the impact of “integral” transaction costs). Comment Examples will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin once the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 77 Issue: Minor drafting points Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Russell McVeagh) The word “to” should be inserted between “person A” and “all non-residents” in section RF 12F(3)(b) before subparagraph (i). In section RF 12H(1)(a)(iii), the cross-reference should be to “section RF 12I(4)”, rather than to “section RF 12I(3)”. Comment Officials agree with submitters. One submitter suggested that the reference in section RF 12H(1)(a)(iii) should be to section RF 12I(4) and (5) – officials do not consider a cross- reference to section RF 12I(5) is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definitions of “person A” and “person B” Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The provisions in the bill dealing with NRFAI refer in a number of places to “person A” and “person B”. These references are confusing. It appears that these terms are defined in section RF 2B, and then used in other sections (for example, RF 12D) without reference back to the section RF 2B or to a standardised definition (for instance in section YA 1). (New Zealand Law Society) To ensure that the NRFAI rules apply only where the borrower is subject to the financial arrangements rules and the lender is not, the definitions of “person A” and “person B” (in proposed section RF 2B(1) should be amended to align with the test for whether the financial arrangements rules apply (in section EW 9). As currently drafted, the NRFAI rules could apply in situations where both the borrower and the lender are subject to the financial arrangements rules in respect of the relevant arrangement. (Russell McVeagh) Comment The first submitter is correct that these terms are defined in section RF 2B then used in other sections without reference back. This is consistent with the drafting convention for related provisions. However, to assist application of these provisions, officials recommend references to “person A” and “person B” be replaced by the terms “borrower” and “lender”. 78 The NRFAI rules are not necessary where the lender is subject to the financial arrangement rules as they will already be subject to New Zealand income tax. Officials recommend changes to section RF 2B to ensure NRFAI does not include a lender that is a New Zealand branch of a non-resident. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Deferral calculation documentation Submission ( PwC) Although the outcome of the deferral calculation is not expected to require adjustments for a large proportion of taxpayers, in practice, we anticipate that all New Zealand borrowers with related party loans will need to consider the deferral calculation and document their compliance. In this respect, we note that the proposed calculation is still complex and will take taxpayers some time to consider and apply as intended. Inland Revenue should provide further guidance by way of a publication such as the Tax Information Bulletin to assist taxpayers and their advisors determine the potential application of the rules, with detailed examples and practical suggestions to minimise the complexity and compliance costs. Comment Officials do not intend for there to be a prescribed form for the deferral calculation. Taxpayers will, however, be expected to complete and retain sufficient records to support their tax position. As the deferral calculation is only important in determining whether NRFAI has been derived, rather than the specific value of that calculation, officials would expect that the record keeping would be broadly proportional to the significance of the calculation. For example, a related party debt that had regular interest payments equal to the interest accrued since the previous interest payment would not be expected to be near the 90% threshold so the records to support this would not need to be particularly detailed. Likewise a related party debt that did not have any interest payments would be treated as over 90% at the first NRFAI due date but would be less than 90% at the second NRFAI due date so again minimal records would be required. In contrast, a taxpayer that completed a deferral calculation showing that the result of the formula was 92% would need to maintain sufficient records to satisfy the Commissioner, if requested, that the 92% figure was accurate and should not instead be below 90%. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 79 Issue: Commencement date should be clarified Submission (Russell McVeagh) Based on the Commentary to the bill (see in particular the examples at pages 37 to 40), officials’ intention appears to be that, for an arrangement entered into before enactment, the first income year in respect of which the NRFAI rules could apply would be the second complete income year after enactment. For example, for a taxpayer with a 31 March balance date, assuming the bill is enacted before 31 March 2017, the earliest income year in which NRWT could be payable on NRFAI would be the income year ending 31 March 2019. The mechanism by which the bill appears to achieve this is, however, highly complex. It relies on the fact that first, a financial arrangement would not become related party debt until section RF 12H applies (being the first income year after enactment) and secondly, the deferral calculation will not be breached in the first income year as a result of the rule in proposed section RF 2B(7)(b). To reduce complexity and provide greater certainty, the intended date from which NRFAI could arise for existing arrangements should be more clearly and expressly stated in the bill. Comment Officials agree that the submitter has accurately applied the rules in their supplied example. The deferral calculation compares deductions up to the end of the previous year with interest payments up to the end of the current year, plus the period up to the NRFAI due date. This is necessary so that interest payments made after a balance date can be compared with interest accrued during the previous year. A consequence of this is in the first year an arrangement is related party debt, there is no previous year to compare the current year interest payments against. To resolve this, the proposed rules treat the deferral calculation as being over 90% for the first year of all arrangements that are related party debt. For an arrangement that exists before the enactment of the proposed rules, the NRFAI rules will apply from the beginning of the first year but consistent with arrangements entered into after enactment, the deferral calculation only considers interest payments and interest accrued from when the proposed rules apply to the arrangement. A consequence of this is that NRFAI will not arise, at the earliest, until the second year. As the NRFAI rules will apply to existing arrangements from the beginning of the taxpayer’s first year after enactment of the bill it is not possible to define when the rules will apply as this will be dependent on the enactment date of the bill and the taxpayer’s balance date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 Issue: Symmetry between income and deductions Submission (EY) If there is a policy focus on symmetry between New Zealand borrowers’ deductions and income derived by non-resident lenders, then the provisions as currently drafted in the bill will be unlikely to achieve any symmetrical result where FAs are denominated and payable in overseas currency. Several of the proposed provisions refer to the total expenditure incurred by the New Zealand borrower under the FA rules. The proposed section RF 12D(2)(b) requires the borrower’s spreading method under the FA rules to be used. But related provisions require that amounts be calculated in the currency of the FA which conflicts with the basic approach applied for the borrower under the FA rules. There are difficulties in terms of mixed and inconsistent concepts in the NRFAI rules as currently drafted, which are likely to cause uncertainty and add to compliance, particularly in relation to foreign currency FAs. They include references to NRFAI amounts equalling the “expenditure incurred” by the borrower and requiring the borrower’s spreading method to be used yet requiring calculations to use the currency of the FA. Comment The policy behind this change is to more closely align the deductions available to borrowers with income derived by related party lenders. The most egregious outcome under the existing rules is where a deduction is available to the borrower and the lender never has withholding tax withheld. Officials acknowledge it is not appropriate to exactly align these concepts, such as amounts calculated in a foreign currency as raised by the submitter. Calculating amounts in a foreign currency removes the effect of currency fluctuations from the scope of NRWT, which is consistent with New Zealand’s current approach and international standards. Officials do not consider these differences detract from the desirability of achieving the overall goal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Special purpose vehicles Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) If NRWT is payable on NRFAI in circumstances when no interest (or less interest than the amount of NRFAI) has in fact been paid to the relevant lender, this will be problematic from a cashflow perspective for a securitisation special purpose vehicle (SPV). That is because securitisation SPVs do not tend to retain excess cash, but rather will typically pay out all cash receipts in accordance with a prescribed “cash waterfall”. The practical result if NRWT is payable other than by reference to actual payments of interest (which it can then be deducted from) could be that the returns received by another (non-associated) lender to securitisation SPVs are reduced. 81 Further, the stated policy rationale for the NRFAI rules (to prevent related parties intentionally structuring lending arrangements so as to claim an immediate deduction for interest but defer payment of NRWT) does not apply to securitisation structures. That is because securitisation SPVs are intended to be tax-neutral and cashflow-neutral on an annual basis. Even if a securitisation SPV were to claim a deduction for accrued but unpaid interest or fair value adjustments on its liabilities, the SPV will likely be recognising corresponding income in respect of interest owing to it under, or fair value adjustments in respect of, the receivables it holds, such that there is no timing advantage for the SPV to bring forward the time at which it claims deductions. We also note that although one of the lenders to the SPV may be associated with the SPV for tax purposes (for example, because it holds the nominal shares when the SPV is a company or it settled the SPV when the SPV is a trust), neither that lender nor any other lender would typically be associated with any of the underlying borrowers and the terms of the lending by the associated lender would typically be the same as for one or more other lenders. This reinforces the fact that securitisation SPVs are not within the intended scope of the NRFAI rules and should be excluded. Comment Officials understand that this issue largely arises due to fair value movements which, as noted elsewhere in this report, have been recommended to be removed from the deferral and NRFAI calculations. Whether or not securitisation vehicles are intended to be cash-neutral is not relevant to the application of this reform to them. The fact that often none of the SPV funders are related to the underlying borrowers is also not relevant. It is the relationship between the SPV and its funders that is relevant. If an SPV is associated with a funder, and the SPV is entitled to a deduction for expenditure on a loan from the associated funder, it is not clear why NRWT should not be imposed at a similar time under this reform. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Turning off NRWT on a payments basis Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section RF 2(1)(d)(iii) should be amended to ensure NRWT on a payments basis is only disabled once NRWT on NRFAI is required to be paid. Comment Once NRWT is required to be paid on NRFAI, NRWT should not apply to any subsequent payments. The bill proposes to achieve this by excepting an interest payment from being non- resident passive income if it is paid after the first NRFAI due date for the financial arrangement. However, the NRFAI due date is the date the deferral calculation is required so will first occur at the end of the first year the arrangement is a related party debt. This is not appropriate, since related party debt will not necessarily give rise to NRFAI. 82 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Onshore branch exemption Submission (Matter raised by officials) NRFAI should not be derived when the lender is a non-resident acting through their New Zealand branch as this is a valid use of the onshore branch exemption. Comment If the New Zealand branch of a non-resident provides funds to an associated New Zealand borrower, the New Zealand branch will derive New Zealand-sourced income that will be subject to New Zealand income tax. Accordingly, any interest payments on this lending should not be subject to NRWT so should also not be covered by non-resident financial arrangement income. This can be achieved by removing such lending from the scope of section RF 2B(1). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 BACK-TO-BACK LOANS Clause 253 Issue: Support for proposals Submission (Chapman Tripp) The bill proposes changes in relation to “back-to-back” lending and similar arrangements, which we understand are intended to prevent application of the approved issuer levy rules in circumstances when lending is, in substance, between related parties (but provided via an unrelated party in order to access AIL). We support legislative amendment to require NRWT in these circumstances. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Alternative approach – intention test Submission (ANZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp) The wording of proposed section RD 12I(2), which determines what is a “back-to-back” loan, creates significant uncertainty. Proposed section RF 12I(2) captures arrangements when a non-resident parent entity provides funds to a bank “in order for” the bank to provide funds to the non-resident parent entity’s New Zealand subsidiary or the non-resident parent entity “compensates” the bank for providing funds to the non-resident parent’s New Zealand subsidiary. As section RF 12I is, in essence, a specific anti-avoidance provision, it would be better that more typical anti-avoidance wording is used to determine when the “back-to-back” loan rules apply. This will create a more appropriate nexus between the provision of funds or compensation to the bank being provided to the New Zealand subsidiary for the purpose of defeating the intent of the NRWT rules. This is exactly what these proposed rules are designed to counter. A significant risk exists that, with such broad and uncertain wording, legitimate banking arrangements may be inadvertently captured. Comment Officials believe that the proposed wording, as amended in accordance with the submission considered immediately below, introduces an appropriate intention requirement. The section will not be engaged simply because a non-resident provides funding to a bank that also provides funding to a resident who is associated with the non-resident. The funding provided by the non-resident must be provided for the purpose of inducing the bank to provide funding 84 to the resident, or to reimburse the bank for doing so. This will not be the case if the transactions are independent, and each could occur in the absence of the other. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Working capital and similar commercial arrangements Submission (Chapman Tripp, PwC) We are concerned that the legislation as drafted could have wider application and apply to genuine commercial arrangements that are not in substance related party lending. The mechanism for capturing back-to-back loans and similar arrangements as related party lending is the definition of “indirect associated funding” in proposed section RD 12I(2). The definition is in our view very broad, referring to the provision of compensation “in any way” in section RF 12I(2)(b). There is a risk that standard banking arrangements, such as working capital facilities provided to multi-national groups, could be captured. This is reinforced by the example provided in the Commentary on the bill that refers to cash pooling arrangements. We do not consider it appropriate for working capital facilities and similar commercial arrangements to be treated as indirect associated funding and submit that proposed section RF 12I(2) should be amended to ensure an appropriate outcome. Comment Officials do not intend that genuine commercial funding borrowed by a New Zealand resident from a third party, including funding from a bank which has entered into a cash pooling arrangement with the resident’s worldwide group, would be covered by the wording of proposed section RF 12I(2), which requires that the indirect lender provides funds so they can be on-lent (or reimburse the direct lender for doing so) to the New Zealand borrower. This can best be demonstrated by the following examples: • If a New Zealand borrower has a loan from the same worldwide banking group that an associated non-resident lender has lent to, this will not be covered unless there is a specific agreement that the bank would not have lent to the New Zealand borrower unless another party made the deposit or other similar agreement (for example, under a setoff or cross-guarantee arrangement). • If a New Zealand taxpayer and an associated non-resident both use the same cash pool for their working capital facilities and the New Zealand borrower happens to have a negative balance for a short-term and the non-resident happens to have a positive balance this will not automatically trigger the back-to-back provisions as both transactions are independent of each other, other than the existence of the cash pool. • If a New Zealand taxpayer has an on-going funding requirement and chooses to use a cash pool (instead of a more conventional bilateral lending arrangement) to meet this funding need and where there is an arrangement where one or more associated non- residents have a credit balance in account subject to the cash pool, then this may be a transaction that the back-to-back provisions would apply to. 85 Officials see there is a distinction between the second and third example. In the second example the New Zealand taxpayer and the non-resident are operating their cash pool accounts independently of each other and just using the facility offered by the bank to manage their working capital. Both parties will be free to deposit and withdraw money independently of the other party (subject to any borrowing limit that may be imposed by the bank) and the parties are likely to have fluctuating balances. In the third example, the New Zealand borrower requires funding on more than just a working capital basis and the degree of coordination between the New Zealand borrowing and the non-resident lending makes this transaction economically equivalent to a loan directly from the non-resident to the New Zealand taxpayer. However, to address some concerns raised by submitters, officials recommend that an intention requirement is added to section RF12I(2). This should be in addition to the existing proposed requirements. Officials note Inland Revenue has concerns that cash pools may give rise to inappropriate NRWT min imisat ion. The use of cash pools will be monitored by Inland Revenue and a further policy response may be considered in the future if this continues to be a concern. Recommendation That an intention requirement be added to the back-to-back provision. Issue: Indirect associated funding should be narrowed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Russell McVeagh) Proposed section RF 12I(2) provides that indirect associated funding exists when the indirect lender either “provides funds” or “pays money” to a direct lender, in order for the funds to be provided to person A, or “to reimburse the direct lender, or compensate them in any way, for providing the funds to person A”. This could have some overreach, because it could apply to situations when the “indirect lender”, for example, pays bank fees to the “direct lender” as opposed to arrangements when the “direct lender” has been interposed between lending that would otherwise have gone directly from the indirect lender to “person A”. Section RF 12I(3) should be amended to clarify that it is only the provision of principal amounts by the indirect lender to the direct lender which can give rise to indirect associated funding. Comment Officials agree it would be possible for the back-to-back provisions to be triggered by an indirect lender paying bank fees to a direct lender when that payment was to reimburse the direct lender, or compensate them in any way, for providing the funds to the borrower. This would, however, depend on the specific facts of the arrangement. For this to apply there would have to be a link between that payment and the funds provided to the borrower, which would often not be present. 86 Given that back-to-back loans are already structured to achieve the desired tax outcome officials consider it would be difficult to design a rule that carved out specific payments by a non-resident associate without creating structuring opportunities to allow back-to-back loans of the type intended to be covered to be also carved out. Officials also note that a payment of indirect associated funding is only treated as paid to the direct lender as agent for the indirect lender to the extent to which the amount is not more than the amount paid by the direct lender to the indirect lender. The consequence of this is if an arrangement was only indirect associated funding due to a payment of bank fees by the indirect lender, there would be no payment at all from the direct lender to the indirect lender. Therefore, none of the payment by the borrower to the direct lender would be affected by these provisions, and they would not give rise to any additional NRWT. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “As agent” provisions should be removed Submission (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) It appears, at least from the Commentary to the bill, that if a New Zealand subsidiary does not pay the NRWT applicable where the back-to-back loan rules in proposed section RF 12I apply, the New Zealand bank will be obliged to pay the NRWT (through operation of the proposed “as agent” provision). For the following reasons, it is inappropriate to push this obligation to banks and the proposal will create rules that will be impossible to apply in practice: • The bank may have no knowledge of whether the back-to-back loan rules are applicable to its customers. The back-to-back loan rules appear to be triggered where an intention or purpose to have a back-to-back loan exists in a non-resident parent entity. Such an entity will not be related to the bank. The non-resident parent entity’s intention or purpose may not be known by, nor can be subsumed to, the bank. • The bank will not know whether the New Zealand subsidiary has paid the NRWT. Pushing NRWT liability onto the bank, when it is not paid by the New Zealand subsidiary, is unfair. For example, if the New Zealand subsidiary was audited by Inland Revenue, which identified that NRWT should have been, but was not paid, by the New Zealand subsidiary, Inland Revenue may seek payment from the bank. In essence, the bank becomes liable for the poor tax compliance of the New Zealand subsidiary over which the bank has no control. • Assuming the NRWT should be based on an accrual of interest per the NRFAI rule, the bank will have no knowledge of what the interest would be. The NRFAI rules are complex. They require an inherent knowledge of whether the proposed de-minimis rules would apply, determining the deferral calculation and the detailed workings of how the payer of the interest determines their accounting and income tax positions. The bank will not have this knowledge. 87 • The New Zealand subsidiary will be a New Zealand taxpayer within the New Zealand tax system. As such, if the New Zealand subsidiary did not pay NRWT but should have, it should be the only entity that is liable for the NRWT. Comment The submitters’ concerns arise from proposed section RF 12I(3)(b), which treats the amount as paid to the direct lender as agent for the indirect lender. Officials agree that it would be inappropriate for Inland Revenue to pursue the direct lender for unpaid NRWT in certain circumstances. Officials consider, however, that treating the direct lender as agent for the indirect lender is still the correct starting point. The items above should go some way to addressing submitters’ concerns about the scope of the indirect associated funding provisions. The lack of commerciality in indirect associated funding mean that with the possible exception of certain cash pooling arrangements, there will be very few, if any, arrangements when the arrangement would be indirect associated funding without the direct lender being involved in negotiating the facilities that resulted in the provisions being applied. Even in a cash pooling arrangement the scale of borrowing relative to any previous limits that may have been negotiated by the borrower would be likely to put the bank on notice that they should make further enquiries with the borrower. Officials also expect that if the law is enacted as proposed, financial intermediaries will minimise their risk by ensuring that they do not get involved in back-to-back transactions and, where necessary, requiring representations from their clients that they are not entering into transactions with the objective of avoiding NRWT. This will assist in achieving the objectives of the legislation. However, officials agree that further clarification of the application of agency provisions to indirect associated funding is desirable. This is addressed in the item below. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of “as agent” provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Application of the “as agent” treatment of indirect associated funding should be clarified. Comment The proposed treatment, as explained below, is broadly in line with existing agency provisions that already apply to NRWT. Officials consider the following principles should apply to an arrangement that meets the indirect associated funding definition: 88 • The borrower is required to withhold NRWT from interest payments that are deemed to be to the indirect lender (even if the direct lender is a New Zealand resident). • If the borrower does not withhold NRWT (or withholds insufficient NRWT) the indirect lender should deduct the requisite amount of NRWT at the time they receive the payment. • The direct lender will not have an obligation to deduct NRWT from the payment received if they have taken actions to confirm that this is not a back-to-back loan but have incorrect information. For example, if the borrower incorrectly represents that this is not a back-to-back loan. • If the arrangement has insufficient interest payments that result in the NRFAI deferral calculation for the borrower being less than 90%, the borrower is required to pay NRWT on the NRFAI. The direct lender cannot be expected to know that this arrangement is NRFAI or the amount of NRFAI calculated so will continue to have the same obligations as above on any interest payments received. Any NRWT withheld by the direct lender on a payments basis will be available to the borrower and/or indirect lender to meet any NRWT liability arising on an NRFAI basis. • In the event that the above NRWT was not withheld/paid by the relevant parties Inland Revenue would commence collection activity consistent with other debts. Inland Revenue would generally attempt to collect this tax from the borrower or the indirect lender in the first instance before attempting to collect from the direct lender and would not attempt to recover this tax from the direct lender when they did not originally have an obligation to withhold under the principles above. Officials recommend drafting changes to ensure the above principles are achieved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Double tax agreements and tracing Submission (EY, PwC) Even assuming any relevant payments or income could be treated as interest paid for any DTA purposes, it is not clear that any DTA relief would necessarily then apply. The Interest Articles of New Zealand’s DTAs typically refer to interest payments as well as to the beneficial owners of the interest in some way in limiting the maximum rate of tax. Some DTAs expressly require the recipient of the interest to be its beneficial owner and be a resident of the relevant state but do not expressly require identity of recipient and beneficial owner. We anticipate possible uncertainties and difficulties arising in some cases in determining which, if any, DTA may apply and whether any DTA relief may be available if section RF 12I(3) applies to treat an indirect funder: • as the recipient of interest paid while the direct lender remains the legal and beneficial owner of that interest; and 89 • as deriving NRFAI, rather than interest payments, when the NRFAI rules supersede the general NRWT rules. (EY) In a cash pooling scenario, when a company group may have multiple entities who deposit cash within the same cash pool, we foresee significant difficulty in the ability of the group to trace a loan out of the cash pool to the New Zealand borrower to specific cash deposits made by other companies in the cash pool group. The Commentary to the bill notes that when a portion of the borrowing is also supplied by the unassociated third party, an apportionment of the loan/interest payments is required to be undertaken to determine the portion of the loan that is supplied by a non-resident related party via the cash pool and how much is supplied by the unassociated third party. These calculations are likely to be complex and require significant oversight of the cash pool and lending arrangements for the group that the New Zealand group borrower in most situations will not have. In practice, when the New Zealand operations of a worldwide group only constitute a minor part of the group, the New Zealand borrower may experience difficulties in receiving the required documentation from its worldwide group and therefore the ability of the New Zealand entity to determine the financing decisions behind a loan received could be limited. Further, in the case of the deemed loan from the non-resident related party, our understanding is that it is unlikely that the deemed lender will be in a position to claim a foreign tax credit for the NRWT withheld on the deemed loan. This will lead to double taxation on the payment from New Zealand. Lastly, it should be noted that typical cash pooling arrangements include a gross up clause, whereby the New Zealand borrower will be required to “make good” any payment to the third party bank to ensure that its return on lending to the New Zealand borrower is not negatively impacted by the deemed related party loan and subsequent NRWT imposed. This additional cost of funds that will arise to the New Zealand borrower is counter to the policy drivers at the time of the introduction of the AIL regime. (PwC) Comment Officials have not considered whether a foreign tax credit would be available to the non- resident lender nor whether other DTA relief may apply. However, we note that these rules are essentially an anti-avoidance provision intended to result in a New Zealand tax treatment that is equivalent to recharacterising the loan in accordance with its economic substance. Any lender that found they were unable to claim a foreign tax credit on a back-to-back loan could restructure it as a loan directly from the non-resident to the New Zealand borrower. Officials do not intend that commercial cash pooling account transactions of the type described by the submitter would be caught by the proposed back-to-back rules as they will not have a sufficient linkage between the New Zealand borrowing and the non-resident deposit. Examples of the types of cash pooling transactions that would be covered are when the New Zealand borrower uses a withdrawal from a cash pool to replace a previous related party loan at the same time that related party deposits a similar amount into the pool or when the New Zealand borrower has a new funding requirement and withdraws from the cash pool at the same time a related party deposits a similar amount having reached some agreement with the New Zealand borrower to do so. In these circumstances officials expect the New Zealand borrower would hold sufficient documentation to comply with their tax obligations without needing significant additional information from other members of the group. 90 The apportionment requirements are intended to make the tax outcome more consistent with the economic substance, which in this case, would be a loan from a related party and a separate loan from the direct lender. Officials consider it would be inappropriate to classify an entire loan as requiring NRWT when only a portion of it had been funded by a related party. Given the significant hurdle that needs to be met before an arrangement is classified as indirect associated funding (see for example the cash pooling examples above), officials expect the New Zealand borrower would have sufficient information that apportionment would not provide many practical difficulties. Officials expect that most, if not all, lending in these circumstances would have a gross up clause so the third party borrower did not bear the incidence of the NRWT. This would be a commercial relationship between the respective parties that does not involve Inland Revenue. Officials do not agree that imposing additional costs on the New Zealand borrower is counter to the policy drivers of the AIL rules. The AIL rules have only ever applied to third party debt. These new rules will only be triggered when lending is in substance between associated parties but has been channelled through a third party for the purpose of inappropriately avoid ing NRWT. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Intended application of proposed section RF 12I(3) Submission (EY) Proposed new section RF 12I(1) states that section RF 12I applies “for the purposes of section RF 12H to describe what is meant by arrangements involving indirect associated funding and funding through non-associated entities acting together”. That wording suggests the section RF 12I provisions would be solely descriptive in function. The proposed section RF 12I(3), however, states that payments will be treated in particular ways when indirect associated funding exists. That subsection does not appear to play any meaningful role in describing the sort of arrangements that are intended to fall within the section RF 12H definition of “related party debt”. If section RF 12I(3) is intended to play such an active role, it is not appropriate to include it in section RF 12I. Alternatively, the wording of section RF 12I(1) needs revising to provide a more appropriate description of the section’s function and scope. Comment We agree that section RF 12I should be split into two so that descriptions and active provisions are appropriately separated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 91 Issue: Interposed trusts Submission ( PwC) The bill captures situations where a trust is interposed between the borrower and the lender and the non-resident has settled 50% or more of the trust. We expect that this proposal will have limited application, but note that the specific inclusion of an interposed trust was not outlined in the May 2015 issues paper. We request commentary as to the policy driver and application of this change. Comment Officials consider that the inclusion in the back-to-back loan rules of a loan which is made by a non-resident to an associated resident through an interposed trust is consistent with the issues paper. The purpose of the back-to-back proposals is to identify and recharacterise loans that interpose a non-associated party between two associated parties. Where one of these is a trust the same rules should also apply. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: New Zealand-resident direct lenders Submission ( PwC) It appears the bill will capture situations when a New Zealand-resident third party is interposed between the New Zealand borrower and the foreign lender. We request further commentary on the specific situation when a New Zealand-resident third party lender is interposed between the New Zealand-resident borrower and foreign lender. It is unclear whether, in this situation, the loan between the New Zealand-resident third party and New Zealand borrower would still be deemed to be between the foreign lender and the New Zealand-resident borrower and therefore require NRWT to be withheld on interest payments made to the New Zealand-resident third party lender. This obviously would not be the answer without specific deeming provisions stating otherwise. Other questions that arise are whether the third party lender is considered to derive the interest income, and could the New Zealand borrower have resident withholding tax (RWT) obligations as well to the New Zealand third party lender. The outcome of these issues needs to be considered. This scenario appears to produce an inconsistent tax outcome and we consider further guidance is needed. 92 Comment In this circumstance the financial arrangement between the New Zealand borrower and the New Zealand third party is replaced in whole or in part by the financial arrangement between the New Zealand borrower and the non-resident, with the New Zealand third party acting as a kind of paying agent. The consequence of this is that the New Zealand borrower’s RWT obligation (if any, given most lenders will have an RWT exemption certificate) is replaced by an NRWT obligation. The New Zealand third party will also have not received any interest income for income tax purposes. The consequence is the same as if the indirect lender, wishing to make a loan to person A, had provided the loan funds to the direct lender as agent, which the direct lender then provided to person A. Person A’s payments to the direct lender that are in repayment of this loan are similarly received by the direct lender as agent, and passed on to the indirect lender. This is not an uncommon situation, and the tax consequences should be ascertainable. Officials consider the current drafting of proposed section RF 12I(3) already achieves this outcome. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Association with direct lender Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current requirements for indirect associated funding do not prevent the application of the indirect associated funding when the borrower and the direct lender are associated. Comment These provisions are only intended to cover situations when an unassociated party is interposed between two associated persons in order to access the AIL rules. It is not intended to cover lending within a corporate group which is already subject to NRWT. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 93 ACTING TOGETHER Clause 253 Issue: Scope of proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We agree that limiting abuse of the AIL rules is important to protect the New Zealand tax base. We are pleased that the consultative process undertaken by officials resulted in some sensible changes to the scope of the proposals, including, for example, in the narrowing of the “acting together” rule. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scope of non-resident owning body definition Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) The “non-resident owning body” definition (which is imported from the definition in section FE 4, and which currently applies for certain purposes under the thin capitalisation rules) includes not only shareholders who lend to a company in proportion to their ownership interests (paragraph (a) of the definition), but also shareholders that enter into an arrangement under which “member-linked funding” is provided to a company (paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition), subject to an exception for companies that are not “widely held companies” “Member-linked funding” may arise when one or more shareholders lend, or guarantee or provide security for lending, to the company as part of an “arrangement” between the shareholders or in a way recommended to or implemented for them as a group by a person. Such member-linked funding should not be included in related-party debt. That is because the broad member-linked funding concept can apply in situations where although there is an “arrangement” in respect of the debt, or debt has been provided in a way recommended by a person: • none of the lenders has control over the borrower; and • the debt (not being in proportion to equity) is not economically substitutable for equity. 94 The breadth of the member-linked funding concept may be manageable in the context of the thin capitalisat ion rules, as those rules include safe harbour debt-asset thresholds, such that being subject to the thin capitalisation rules does not necessarily result in any additional tax cost to the borrower or to investors. But it is not appropriate for the definition of “related- party debt”. Comment In the NRWT rules, as in the thin capitalisation rules, it is necessary that the “non-resident owning body” definition is appropriately targeted. Officials disagree with the submitter that the safe harbour debt-asset thresholds compensate for an overreach in the application of the non-resident owning body definition as it applies to thin capitalisation. The purpose of paragraphs (b) and (c) of the non-resident owning body definition is to cover arrangements which could be economically equivalent to debt that is proportional to ownership interests and officials consider this is equally applicable to NRWT as it is to thin capitalisation. Officials consider the member-linked funding provisions are appropriately targeted and will cover arrangements where, despite no single lender having control over the borrower, there will be sufficient coordination between lenders and other owners (if any) that treating the lending as related-party debt is appropriate. The non-resident owning body definition was inserted in 2014 in relation to thin capitalisation and officials are not aware with any problems arising in practice, nor have submitters on the current proposals raised specific changes which could improve coverage of the member- linked funding provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section RF 12H(1)(a)(iii) is unnecessary Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The reference to “non-resident owning body” in section RF 12H(1)(a)(iii) appears superfluous as under proposed section RF 12I(5) a non-resident owning body is generally treated as being an associated person (meaning that section RF 12I(1)(a)(i) would apply. Proposed section RF 12H(1)(a)(iii) should be removed. (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section RF 12I(5) provides that person A, and a member of a non-resident owning body which holds 50 percent or more of the ownership interests in person A, are treated as associated person for the purposes of certain provisions. This deeming provision is unnecessary, however, because those provisions do not require that the lender be associated with person A; rather, the provisions will be triggered if the lender is providing “related-party debt”. It is also confusing, given that section RF 12H(1)(a) provides that related-party debt includes funding provided by an associated person or by a member of a non-resident owning body. Accordingly, section RF 12I(5) should instead provide that the funding provided by the 95 member to person A will be treated as related-party debt in accordance with section RF 12H(1)(a)(iii). (Russell McVeagh) Comment Officials note that the submitters have identified the same problem but have proposed different solutions. Officials consider that three limbs are necessary within section RF 12H(1)(a) and that proposed section RF 12I(5) should be removed and rewritten in section RF 12H(3) to include the section references within the rule. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Location of “non-resident owning body” definition Submission (Independent advisor to the Select Committee) The definition of “non-resident owning body” is contained in section FE 4 as it currently applies to the thin capitalisation rules. As this definition is proposed to be applied to the NRWT rules it should be moved to YA 1. Comment Officials agree that this definition should be relocated to section YA 1 so that a taxpayer does not have to refer to the thin capitalisation rules in order to apply the NRWT rules. Officials do not consider that any changes are necessary to this definition and that it should be carried over, consistent with the current definition in section FE 4. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE BRANCH CHANGES Clauses 5, 247, 269, 270, 279 and 333 Issue: Lending by banks to unassociated residents Submission (ANZ) We support excluding loans from an offshore head office company to unrelated third parties (which are sourced in New Zealand) from the proposed AIL changes. Taking such an approach mitigates what would otherwise be a significant compliance burden for a significant number of third parties. Comment The exclusion the submitter refers to is where a New Zealand resident borrows from a foreign bank with a New Zealand branch – usually to fund a foreign property. The most frequent use of this arrangement is where a New Zealand-resident buys a foreign investment property or holiday home or where a non-resident migrates to New Zealand while continuing to own a foreign property. In these arrangements the tax treatment depends on whether the foreign bank has a New Zealand branch even though the branch may have no involvement in the transaction. Officials continue to consider the tax treatment should be aligned for all borrowers from foreign banks irrespective of the existence of a New Zealand branch that is not involved in the transaction. However, due to the compliance burden referred to by the submitter there is no change proposed at this time. Officials may revisit this issue at a later date. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Grandparenting for non-banks Submission (Titan NZ Funding Trust) In respect of the onshore branch exemption changes and the transitional treatment for registered banks, the five-year grandparenting concession should be extended to Titan New Zealand Funding Trust – NZ Branch, which operates as a third party intermediary finance provider with a purpose equivalent to that provided by registered banks. 97 Comment Currently, the onshore branch exemption allows a New Zealand resident to borrow from a non-resident with a New Zealand branch without withholding NRWT or paying AIL on interest payments. The changes in the bill will require NRWT to be withheld or AIL to be paid on these interest payments. However, for certain existing transactions, these new rules will not apply until the end of the 5 th year starting after enactment of the bill. Th is five-year grandparenting arises from clause 5(4) of the bill and applies only when the borrower is not associated with the lender or when the borrower is a member of a banking group. This grandparenting will not apply to a New Zealand securitisation vehicle that is associated with the non-resident lender and borrows from that related non-resident even when the funding is ultimately borrowed from third parties. Officials included registered banks in the grandparenting as it is recognised that these banks have non-resident parents that are also banks. These foreign banks are subject to regulatory oversight, and often tax laws, that are specific to banks. These provide officials with confidence that these entities will be borrowing money to fund their New Zealand operations and the funding cannot be considered equivalent to equity. The same principles do not apply to non-banks including entities that are involved in securitisation structures or that provide non-bank funding to third parties. For these reasons officials consider that the current grandparenting provisions for the onshore and offshore branch changes in the bill are appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Increased cost of capital Submission (ANZ, Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The onshore and offshore branch changes are not in New Zealand’s interest and should not proceed for the following reasons: • The terms of the relevant funding programmes will require the New Zealand banks to bear the cost of any NRWT or AIL. As a result, the cost of funding for New Zealand banks will increase. It can be expected that this increase in cost of funding will be passed on to New Zealand borrowers, with a resulting increase in cost of capital, negative impact on economic growth and/or reduction in tax payable by those borrowers. This outcome is inconsistent with the Government’s Business Growth Agenda. If the increased cost of funding is not passed on by the banks, this will result in a reduction in taxable income for the New Zealand Banks and reduced tax payable by them. 98 • To the best of our knowledge, few (if any) other jurisdictions impose a withholding tax in similar circumstances – that is, banks in those jurisdictions can raise wholesale funding offshore without the bank’s home jurisdiction imposing withholding tax. We cannot see a good rationale for New Zealand taking a contrary approach to other jurisdictions. Comment Many taxes, including the general company tax, (which applies to inbound as well as purely domestic investment) increase the cost of capital. This does not mean that they should be eliminated. Taxes are necessary to raise the revenue Government needs to finance its spending. What is important is to minimise economic efficiency costs. In order to do that it is important that taxes are applied as consistently and coherently as possible. That is the objective of the proposal. At present AIL normally applies to third party lending to New Zealanders but not to lending by New Zealand’s large foreign-owned banks. Some of the benefits of this may be passed through to New Zealanders in lower interest rates but the extent to which this happens is unknown. If fully passed on, it would mean that banks are offering lower interest rates that are lower by a factor of one fiftieth than would otherwise be the case (for example, an interest rate of, say 5.0% rather than 5.1%). But this is a maximum pass through assumption. In practice, loans by New Zealand’s foreign-owned banks will be competing with other forms of lending that do not have access to the branch rules. These include other lending from offshore or lending by New Zealand-owned banks which cannot access the onshore or offshore branch exemptions on funds that they source from overseas. As a result New Zealand’s foreign-owned banks may be passing on little of the tax saving they make from the branch rules. At the same time the rule provides them with a commercial advantage relative to the New Zealand-owned banks. Thus, changing the branch rules so that they do not apply to the extent that the branch lends to New Zealand residents may increase interest rates offered by foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand. But the effect is expected to be very slight. The burden that they will be subject to is only that which is applying to other third-party lending. With respect to the submission that comparable jurisdictions do not impose withholding tax on wholesale offshore funding, in our view there is much less justification for these exemptions in New Zealand, as follows: • Other jurisdictions do not have AIL, and are therefore faced with a choice of 10% or 0% rates. This is the position in Australia. Even though they do have 0% for particular situations in domestic law, the relevant exemption for interest paid to banks is only given in a few of their recent treaties – so it does not apply across the board (unlike AIL). • Because AIL is only 2%, the deadweight costs it imposes are much less than those imposed by a 10% tax. • Imposition of AIL ensures that New Zealand does not give up the opportunity to collect NRWT from lenders who are prepared to pay it without passing the cost on to the New Zealand borrower. • Jurisdictions with wide-ranging financial sector-related NRWT exemptions (for example, the United States of America and the United Kingdom) generally have these because they have global financial sectors and need to provide exemptions to preserve them. New Zealand does not have a global financial sector, and therefore would reap less benefit from providing an exemption. 99 Furthermore, there does not seem to be a great deal of international consensus about what the best basis for an exemption might be. Accordingly, officials believe the current AIL/NRWT system serves New Zealand well. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Zero-rated AIL should be extended Submission (Chapman Tripp, Russell McVeagh) A better approach that does not harm New Zealand’s interests and is consistent with international norms is to amend the 0% AIL regime contained in section 86IB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 to apply more broadly, so that current constraints preventing the application of AIL at 0% in practice to offshore funding programmes (of the New Zealand banks and other New Zealand corporates) are removed. This should be possible w ith relatively minor changes to section 86IB, such as permitting: • the security to be denominated in a currency other than NZD; and • an offer for the security to be made under relevant United Kingdom or European securities law. (Chapman Tripp) It would have been better to investigate the possibility of an exemption from NRWT and AIL for banks’ borrowing costs and widely held debt, since imposing NRWT or AIL on interest paid in such cases generally leads to increased costs of borrowing for New Zealanders. (Russell McVeagh) Comment The current zero-rated AIL provisions in section 86IB were introduced to remove a potential obstacle to the further development of the New Zealand bond market (bonds issued in New Zealand and denominated in New Zealand dollars) rather than reducing taxes on foreign debt funding more generally. Extending the provisions as suggested by the submitters would not be consistent with that policy. There is no reason why borrowing on international bond markets should be tax favoured compared with other forms of borrowing from unrelated non-resident lenders. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 100 Issue: Money used to acquire or hold overseas assets Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Interest is not subject to NRWT or AIL if the money is lent outside New Zealand to a New Zealand resident and is used by the New Zealand resident for the purposes of a business it carries on through a fixed establishment offshore (offshore branch). The proposed amendments will result in interest being subject to NRWT or AIL to the extent that the offshore branch lends to New Zealand residents. The exclusion should be extended. NRWT or AIL should not apply when a New Zealand resident borrows offshore and uses the money to acquire or hold overseas assets. This includes, for example, when a New Zealand resident purchases a rental property in Australia that is financed by a loan from an Australian bank. Comment Inland Revenue has previously issued Questions We’ve Been Asked QB 11/01: Residential investment property or properties in Australia owned by New Zealand resident – N RWT treatment of interest paid to Australian financial institution, which details the tax treatment of interest paid to offshore lenders on overseas assets. The submitter’s proposal already applies when the New Zealand resident borrows through an offshore branch as this treatment allows the branch to be taxed equivalent to a foreign incorporated entity operating in the same jurisdiction. Extending this treatment to all foreign assets would not be consistent with New Zealand’s tax framework and would also raise issues with apportioning debt between assets held or acquired in New Zealand compared with those held or acquired in a foreign country. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Apportionment of interest paid to New Zealand Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendments in sections YD 4 and YD 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 assume that it will be possible to trace foreign funds applied to New Zealand use. Tracing could be difficult if money is borrowed for various different purposes at various different times from various different lenders. Difficulties in tracing how money is used may also mean that a borrower may not have the option of withholding NRWT in many cases. The amendments to sections YD 4 and YD 5 should be considered further. 101 Comment The proposed apportionment rules do not require a taxpayer to trace what money has been borrowed for or how it was used. Instead, apportionment is based on the value of the taxpayer’s financial arrangements that produce income that has a source in New Zealand as a portion of their total assets. Officials expect taxpayers will not have particular difficult in confirming either of these amounts and that the proposed apportionment methodology should operate correctly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Apportionment of income having a New Zealand source Submission (Russell McVeagh) Proposed section YD 4(11)(b)(i) should be amended to state “...and the interest or redemption payment is not apportioned...”. As drafted, proposed section YD 4(11)(b)(i) could be read as referring to the money lent being apportioned to New Zealand rather than the applicable interest or redemption payment. Comment While the current drafting can arrive at the correct outcome officials agree that this change should be made to avoid any uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interest or redemption payments Submission (Russell McVeagh) The source rule in section YD 4(11)(b) applies to “interest or a redemption payment”. However, the proposed amendments to section YD 5, which relate to income having a New Zealand source under proposed section YD 4(11)(b)(i), only refers to “interest”. For consistency between the primary source rule and the apportionment rule the amendments to section YD 5 should refer to both “interest” and “redemption payments”. 102 Comment Officials note that there are four references to “interest” in the proposed amendments to section YD 5 and that interest is already defined in section YA 1 as including a redemption payment for the purposes of the RWT rules and the NRWT rules. However, to avoid the inference that these terms may not also include redemption payment, officials agree with the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interest derived in an income year Submission (Russell McVeagh) Proposed section YD 5(5)(b) defines “amount” for the purposes of the apportionment formula in proposed section YD 5(4). As drafted, it states that “amount is the amount of interest described in subsection (1)(d) that is derived in an income year”. To determine what amount of NRWT should be withheld or AIL paid in respect of an interest payment to which the proposed apportionment rule applies, it will be necessary to apply the apportionment formula on the day the relevant payment is made and in respect of the specific amount being paid. The definition of “amount” as drafted does not permit this as it requires reference to interest “that is derived in an income year”. The words “that is derived in an income year” should be deleted. Comment It is intended that the apportionment formula is calculated based on the income and assets from the immediately preceding income year so that the borrower does not have to recalculate their apportionment each time they make an interest payment. The exception to this is if the borrower does not have an immediately preceding income year when the apportionment will be from the start of the current year to the day before the interest payment. This is already achieved in proposed section YD 5(9). The submitter is correct that the definition of amount in proposed section YD 5(5)(b) cannot be applied correctly and the words “that is derived in an income year” should be removed so that it applies to the full value of an interest payment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 103 Issue: Reference to value Submission (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Proposed section YD 5(9) contains various definitions for the purposes of calculating the apportionment of income sourced from New Zealand for an offshore branch. These definitions refer to the “value” of certain assets. However, it is uncertain what value should be used for such purposes. We recommend that the reference to value should be to the value as recorded in the relevant accounts. Such values should be non-controversial, are subject to accounting standard obligations and are generally applied for income tax purposes. Comment This reference to “value” in the bill will in most instances refer to the value in the accounts. However, there may be instances when the value is demonstrably different from that recorded in the accounts and this alternative value is more appropriate. Officials do not consider further clarification in the bill is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of defined terms Submission (Russell McVeagh) Proposed section YD 5(9)(a) refers to “financial arrangement assets”, which is not defined. Proposed section YD 5(9)(a) should be amended to refer to “assets that are financial arrangements”. Proposed section YD 5(9)(b)(ii) refers to “the interest or redemption payment date”, which is not defined. Proposed section YD 5(9)(b)(ii) should be amended to refer to “the date on which the interest or redemption payment is paid”. Comment Officials agree w ith this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 104 Issue: New Zealand banking group Submission (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Clause 5(4) of the bill determines the timing of application of the offshore branch rules. Clause 5(4) refers to a “member of a banking group”, which is not a defined term. This should be amended to refer to a “New Zealand banking group” which is a term currently defined in the Income Tax Act. Comment Officials agree with the submitter and note the same issue in relation to the notional loan rules considered elsewhere in this report. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Further review of amendments Submission (ANZ) We have discussed most of our recommendations with Inland Revenue officials and understand that they will undertake to amend the bill, where required, to provide the necessary clarification and certainty. We welcome the ability to have such discussions with officials. We recommend having the opportunity to review any further amendments to the bill, in conjunction with officials, before enactment to assist in mitigating further unintended consequences and to provide certainty. Comment Officials have been empowered by the Select Committee to liaise with submitters as required but it is not possible to make further commitments, particularly given the limited time available. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 105 NOTIONAL LOANS TO NEW ZEALAND BRANCHES Clauses 83, 279, 329, 332(2) and 333 Issue: Reference in section FG 2(1) to “for the purposes of the Act” Submission (ANZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) Subpart FG is stated in section FG 1 to apply for the “purposes of the NRWT rules”. However, section FG 2(1) states that a notional loan to a foreign bank’s New Zealand branch is treated “for the purposes of the Act” as money lent to the branch. We are unsure why this inconsistency exists and the Commentary to the bill provides no explanation of what other parts of the Act would impact the notional loan or how they would do so. Comment Officials agree there should not be an inconsistency between these two provisions, and that section FG 2(1) does not need to apply for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007 more generally. However “the NRWT rules” is defined in section RF 1(1) and includes a number of specific provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 but does not include the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. As subpart FG is used to calculate the AIL payable on notional interest payments it should also apply for the purposes of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Meaning of “foreign bank” Submission (Russell McVeagh) Proposed section FG 1(2) should be amended to clarify that it is the foreign bank and not its fixed establishment that is a registered bank. Registration as a bank under section 69 of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 applies to legal persons not branches. Comment Officials agree w ith the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 106 Issue: Borrowing specifically for the purposes of a business carried on in New Zealand Submission (ANZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) If a head office of a foreign bank borrows money from a non-resident lender, and that money is used specifically for the purposes of a business carried on by the foreign bank through a fixed establishment in New Zealand, interest payments in respect of that money may have a source in New Zealand under section YD 4(11)(ii). Provided that the relevant lender does not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand, such interest would be subject to NRWT or AIL on notional interest payments from the New Zealand fixed establishment to the foreign bank’s head office. This would result in double taxation as the interest payments from the head office of the foreign bank would also be subject to NRWT or AIL under subpart RF. Comment Officials agree that only a single amount of NRWT or AIL should apply to an interest payment by a New Zealand branch. Where a foreign bank borrows specifically to fund its New Zealand branch any interest payments on this borrowing will already be subject to NRWT or AIL and therefore should be excluded from the notional loan rules in subpart FG. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interest on offshore notional loans is non-resident passive income Submission (ANZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) Notional interest payments deemed to arise under the notional loans proposals are intended to be subject to NRWT or AIL. The NRWT rules apply only to non-resident passive income. Proposed sections FG 2 and FG 3 do not, however, deem the notional interest payments to be non-resident passive income and it is unclear whether notional interest payments may fall within the exceptions to the definition of non-resident passive income in proposed section RF 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii). The drafting of proposed subpart FG should deem such notional interest payments to be non- resident passive income. As such, deemed interest arises only in respect of the New Zealand branch of a bank, and in view of proposed section 86IC of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, which makes AIL compulsory if NRWT is not paid, it is also appropriate to deem the notional interest to meet the criteria in section RF 12 for AIL to be paid. Comment Officials recommend changes to confirm that notional interest payments are non-resident passive income. 107 The bill already includes an extension to the definition of “registered security” in clause 329 and a replacement section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) in clause 252(1), which will allow AIL on a notional interest payment to reduce the rate of NRWT payable to 0%. Officials do not consider further changes are required to meet the criteria in section RF 12. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials' comments. Issue: Payments vs amounts recorded in the financial accounts Submission (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) We understand the intention is for subpart FG to apply to interest as recorded in the financial accounts of the onshore branch. Such interest recorded in financial accounts is on an accrual basis. We support this intention as a pragmatic and reasonable approach for ascertaining the interest subject to AIL. The drafting of subpart FG (particularly sections FG 2(2) and FG 3), however, includes references to both interest recorded in the financial accounts and interest payments. As these concepts are different, uncertainty arises from the current drafting of subpart FG. Comment The submitter is correct that the NRWT or AIL liability on notional interest amounts is intended to be on an accrual basis as this is expected to be easier for a bank to calculate as it is already required for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Officials do not agree that a change is necessary to section FG 2(2). The current wording refers to “a notional repayment” and “the amount is treated as a repayment”. These references already reflect amounts recorded in accounting records rather than a physical payment from the New Zealand branch to its head office. Officials agree that the reference to a “payment made” in proposed section FG 3 should be replaced by an “expense” to ensure the section is consistent with the accrual approach. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Grandparenting will not apply Submission (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The current drafting of the transitional rules in clause 83(2) states that subpart FG applies: (a) to a transaction that is recorded in the relevant accounting records on or after the date on which this Act receives the Royal assent; or 108 (b) from the first day of a person’s income year that starts 2 income years after the last day of the income year in which this Act receives the Royal assent, for a transaction that is recorded in the relevant accounting records before the date on which this Act receives the Royal assent. A transaction entered into before the date the Act receives Royal assent (which should be captured under paragraph (b) above) will also be recorded in the relevant accounting records after the date the Act receives Royal assent. As such, paragraph (a) above would also apply resulting in the proposed grandparenting not applying at all. Further, this clause refers to the existence of a “transaction” between the foreign bank and its New Zealand branch. In a legal sense, no transaction exists as it is not possible to have a legal arrangement with oneself. Comment Officials agree that it was not intended that a transaction entered into before the application of the new rules would satisfy both (a) and (b) above. However, we recommend clause 83(2) be redrafted to use terminology more consistent with the application provisions for the other NRWT and AIL changes in clause 5. This redrafted section is intended to have the same effect as the submitters’ suggestion but should be easier to follow. Officials also agree that legally a branch cannot have a transaction with the foreign bank. Instead of referring to a transaction this should be replaced by a reference to an amount made available by the foreign bank to its New Zealand branch. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Sections FG 3(b) and FG 3(c) Submission (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Sections FG 3(b) and (c) appear to indicate that the interest on the notional loan is incurred by the New Zealand branch and derived by the foreign bank. However, we note that the interest on the notional loan is already treated as incurred and deductible through the combined application of the Income Tax Act 2007 and relevant Double Tax Agreements. Section FG 3(b) and (c) should therefore be removed. Comment Section FG 3 is closely modelled on the equivalent Australian provision in section 160ZZZA of their Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. However, officials agree that this interest is already deductible for income tax purposes. The real purpose of the provision is to ensure that there is interest for purposes of imposing NRWT or AIL. Recommendation That the submission be accepted with respect to proposed section FG 3(b). 109 Issue: Timing of AIL liability Submission (ANZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) Section FG 3 deems the interest on the notional loan to be paid on the last day of the income year, thereby triggering the timing for payment of AIL as the 20 th day of the month following income year-end. The interest upon which AIL will be payable is to be based on the financial accounts of the onshore branch. However, the accounting records for the New Zealand branch are unlikely to be complete within 20 days of financial year end. More likely, they will be completed within three months following financial year end. As such, it will not be possible to determine the AIL payable with accuracy within the timeframe proposed by the bill. The timeframe for triggering the AIL liability should be extended to the 20 th day following three months after financial year-end. Comment Officials agree that the timeframe for calculating the AIL liability should be extended to provide sufficient time for the relevant interest amount to be confirmed. Submitters were unanimous that the notional interest should be treated as paid at the end of the third month following balance date. Officials note that equivalent provisions for NRFAI will continue to be at the end of the second month following balance date as originally proposed in the bill. No submissions were received on altering this t im ing. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Length of grandparenting Submission (ANZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh, Westpac) The proposed grandparenting period for existing inter-branch loans is two years. In contrast, the proposed grandparenting period for other existing funding arrangement within banking groups is five years. A five-year grandparenting period for the onshore branch rules is more appropriate than a two-year grandparenting period. The inter-branch loans (or notional loans as so described in the bill) are often subject to detailed negotiations between the respective branches (or the foreign bank and the New Zealand branch), particularly as they relate to independent profit centres and are also subject to detailed and complex transfer pricing analysis. As the imposition of AIL in essence alters the pricing of such notional loans, a five- year grandparenting is more appropriate. 110 Comment The f ive-year grandparenting applied to other branch changes reflects specific funding that, in almost all instances, has been raised from third parties or as part of a back-to-back arrangement with a third party that will usually have a term of up to five years. In contrast a notional loan from a foreign bank to its New Zealand branch cannot identify specific funding from a third party and the average maturity of the foreign banks funding pool will often bear no resemblance to the amount allocated to the New Zealand branch. The purpose of all the grandparenting provisions is to minimise disruption to commercial transactions with third parties rather than purely to delay the application of the new rules for the purpose of minimising the amount of AIL payable. As such officials consider that two years is an appropriate period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Lending directly from offshore Submission (Chapman Tripp) We are concerned that these proposals will encourage foreign banks to lend directly to New Zealand from offshore, rather than through their New Zealand branch. In that case, AIL would apply to interest income received by the foreign bank but otherwise New Zealand would not be entitled to tax the net interest margin made from the lending transaction. This would result in a reduction in New Zealand’s tax revenue. Comment The proposed changes will, in general, neutralise the tax treatment of offshore borrowing from third parties. AIL will apply both when an offshore bank lends directly to a New Zealand company, and when a New Zealand bank borrows from offshore and then on-lends this money to a New Zealand company. This is in contrast to the present situation, where some borrowers (such as some of New Zealand’s banks) are able to borrow from offshore without AIL whereas other borrowers (such as other New Zealand banks as well as other companies) are required to pay AIL on such borrowing. This change may slightly increase the tax payable by some New Zealand-based banks compared with offshore banks lending directly into New Zealand. As the submitter points out, this may make it more likely that the New Zealand tax impost on an offshore bank lending directly to New Zealand may be lower than the tax impost on a New Zealand-based bank – making it more likely that direct lending from offshore will occur. Importantly, however, it is not the imposition of AIL that gives rise to this higher tax burden – the AIL impost for both banks is the same. Rather, it is the imposition of New Zealand’s company tax on the New Zealand bank that may give rise to the higher tax impost. This is in line with our general framework – where we seek to tax the profits of companies, including banks, that operate in New Zealand, but do not tax profits made by non-residents from their non-New Zealand operations. 111 Officials note that, under present settings, offshore banks in many instances will have incentives to lend directly into New Zealand – for example, because of the franking system in Australia. Nevertheless, by and large, most individuals and companies borrow from New Zealand-based banks, not directly from offshore banks. Officials consider that any additional incentive that imposing AIL on the offshore funding of New Zealand-based banks will be marginal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deductions for notional interest Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Proposed subpart FG recharacterises the treatment of notional loans to New Zealand branches of foreign banks. As a general rule, a branch is not allowed a deduction for interest on a notional loan from its head office as that loan and the amount of interest do not exist. The wording of section FG 1(1) should be amended to reflect correctly that it does not apply solely for the purposes of NRWT but also applies for the interest deductibility provisions. For example, the provision could be worded “This subpart applies, for the purposes of the NRWT rules and section DB 6 (Interest: not capital expenditure) when ...” This would mean that the deemed interest arising on the notional loan is deductible under section DB 6. Comment In general, branches are not entitled to a tax deduction for interest attributed from their head office and they also do not have to withhold NRWT on this notional treatment. However, this treatment does not apply to the New Zealand bank branches which are already entitled to a deduction as a means of determining the profit attributable to their New Zealand operations (see further explanation below). This current treatment for banks is what results in an asymmetric result of a deduction with no NRWT or AIL paid. The proposed changes in the bill will correct this asymmetry without requiring any changes to deductibility. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interaction with double tax agreements Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Russell McVeagh, Westpac) New Zealand has many double tax agreements that restrict the amount of income tax that New Zealand can impose. Imposing tax on this notional loan is also clearly in breach of the OECD Commentary (see paragraph 28 of the commentary on Article 7) (Model Tax 112 Convention of Income and Capital). An analysis of how a notional loan will be treated under New Zealand double tax agreements should be carried out and published by Inland Revenue. Comment The reason NRWT is not withheld on the actual interest paid by the foreign bank is practical rather than conceptual. As an economic matter, and taking a fungibility of money approach, this interest does have a connection with New Zealand. Accordingly there is a conceptual basis for imposing a tax on it. Furthermore, because AIL is in any event imposed on borrowers (unlike NRWT which is imposed on lenders but collected by borrowers), its imposition on the bank in this case, rather than on the foreign lender to the head office, is not unusual. New Zealand’s treaties generally apply to income tax, and taxes which are identical or substantially similar and imposed after the date of signature of the convention. AIL is not identical or substantially similar to income tax. In particular: • It is a tax imposed on a borrower, who clearly does not derive income under a loan. • It is not subject to any reductions for expenses. • Its imposition and collection are under different legislation and use different mechanisms from income tax or NRWT. The OECD comment that notional interest deductions of this kind are not an appropriate subject for withholding is made in the Commentary on the new Article 7. It relates to OECD guidance on treaty policy on attribution of profits to branches. Specifically, it suggests that if countries are not willing to give up the withholding tax that they may impose under their treaties then they should not adopt the new Article 7 which implements the new approach to taxing branches (the “Authorised OECD Approach”) and allows deductions for notional payments – including interest. It is not guidance regarding appropriate domestic law settings and is therefore not relevant. New Zealand has reserved the right to use the previous version of Article 7 immediately before the 2010 update taking into account its observation and reservations on that version. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extension to non-bank financial institutions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Although this is a banking-specific rule there does not appear to be any strong policy rationale for restricting the concessionary treatment to registered banking groups over other financial institutions. For example, regulated non-bank deposit takers, insurers and asset managers, as well as dedicated finance or treasury companies within multinational groups. The proposed rules may create an unfair playing field to the advantage of other financial institutions. 113 Comment The policy on the deductibility of interest expense by a branch is set out in paragraphs 44 to 52 of the 1984 Reports of the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs Transfer Pricing and Multinational Enterprises three taxation issues. This document sets out that deductibility applies to bank branches. In general non-bank businesses are unable to claim an income tax deduction for interest expenses on a loan attributed from a head office to its New Zealand branch when a specific funding source cannot be identified. To ensure appropriate deductibility, these businesses will ensure that specific funding raised by the head office for the purpose of funding the New Zealand branch can be identified. Interest payments on these specifically identifiable loans will already be subject to NRWT or AIL so the provisions in the bill are not required to be applied more generally. However, officials note there may be a limited number of examples of New Zealand branches that are claiming interest deductions for these notional funding amounts without being able to identify specific funding by the head office. This may arise, for example, where a foreign bank is not registered with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand as their New Zealand branch does not conduct banking operations. Officials agree that there are good reasons why the notional loan provisions in the bill should be extended to such entities but that further work is necessary to identify the scope of such an extension. This work cannot be completed in time for inclusion in the current bill. To the extent that equivalent provisions were considered for a future bill this would also give the opportunity for businesses affected by these provisions to submit on the bill in the usual manner. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Interaction with transfer pricing Submission (Westpac) We are concerned that this change will impact the correct attribution of profit under permanent establishment/transfer pricing principles. This has the potential to give rise to cross-border disputes and it will be essential that Inland Revenue is able to defend the New Zealand branch position in such situations. Furthermore, we seek assurance that should a transfer pricing adjustment rise from a reassessment of the allocation of interest, then Inland Revenue will permit previously levied AIL to be recovered since that AIL will have been overpaid based on a higher amount of interest allocation. 114 Comment Under current legislation it is not possible to reduce NRWT to 0% by paying AIL on interest payments on debt with a related party. If such interest is reduced via a transfer pricing adjustment, existing section GC 12 confirms there is prima facie no effect on any NRWT that has previously been withheld. However, it is possible for the lender’s NRWT obligation to be reduced by making an application under section GC 11. It is also possible for the obligation to be reduced if the lender agrees to accept a reduction in the interest payable to them so that the amount payable is no more than the amount deductible by the borrower. Section GC 11 does not apply for purposes of AIL, so prima facie a reduction in the amount deductible does not allow an AIL reduction to be made. Amendments should be introduced so the Commissioner has the power to reduce AIL on interest that is held to be non-deductible to the borrower by reason of a transfer pricing adjustment, equivalent to the operation of section GC 11. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Costs will be passed on to borrowers Submission (Westpac) Banks are margin lenders, so ultimately any significant funding cost incurred by banks will be passed on to the New Zealand borrowers. This extra cost will be borne by New Zealanders as opposed to the foreign investors as originally intended. This is therefore not good tax policy and law. Officials have stated that the impact of such changes will be relat ively small. Th is is possibly true in the current interest rate environment when rates are extraordinarily low. However, interest rates are expected to normalise at some point to historically higher levels and, at that time, the imposition of AIL will have a disproportionately larger impact on the economy than currently, since any extra borrowing cost will inevitably deter New Zealanders from taking on debt. This may harm the competitiveness of many New Zealand banks. Westpac submits that the Finance and Expenditure Committee revisit the economic analysis underlying these changes and stress test that analysis for future higher interest rates before being satisfied that this policy be implemented through this legislation. We believe this is especially important given the significant requirements for funding investment in New Zealand business recently signalled by the government. Comment With respect to the cost of capital, the key point to note is that many taxes, including the general company tax, (which applies to inbound as well as purely domestic investment) increase the cost of capital. This does not mean that they should be eliminated. Taxes are necessary to raise the revenue Government needs to finance its spending. What is important is to minimise economic efficiency costs. To do that it is important that taxes are applied as consistently and coherently as possible. That is the objective of the proposal. 115 At present AIL normally applies to third party lending to New Zealanders but not to lending by New Zealand’s large foreign-owned banks. Some of the benefits of this may be passed through to New Zealanders in lower interest rates but the extent to which this happens is unknown. If fully passed on, it would mean that banks are offering interest rates that are lower by one fiftieth than would otherwise be the case (for example, an interest rate of, say 5.0% rather than 5.1%). But this is a maximum pass-through assumption. In practice, loans by New Zealand’s foreign-owned banks will be competing with other forms of lending that do not have access to the methods the bill proposals seek to counter. These include other lending from offshore or lending by New Zealand-owned banks, which are currently already paying AIL on funds that they source from overseas. As a result New Zealand’s foreign-owned banks may be passing on only a portion, or possibly none, of the tax concession they currently enjoy. At the same time the methods provide them with a commercial advantage relative to the New Zealand-owned banks. Thus, imposing the notional loan and other branch proposals may increase interest rates offered by foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand. But the effect is expected to be very slight. The burden that they will be subject to is only that which is applying to other third party lending. Further detail was provided in the Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue and Treasury document New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment: A draft overview of current tax policy settings, which was released in June 2016. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New Zealand banking group Submission (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Proposed section RF 2(3)(e) is designed to confirm that NRWT on interest paid by a New Zealand bank will be a final tax. Proposed section RF 2(3)(e) currently refers to a “member of a banking group”, which is not a defined term. This should be amended to refer to a “New Zealand banking group”, which is a term currently defined in the Income Tax Act. Comment Officials agree with the submitter and note the same issue in relation to the offshore branch rules considered elsewhere in this report. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 116 AIL ON RELATED PARTY LOANS Clause 252 Issue: Application date Submission (ANZ, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) The bill proposes that members of a New Zealand banking group have the ability to reduce the rate of NRWT to 0% by instead, paying AIL on interest paid to associated persons under existing arrangements. We support such a position. The Commentary states that the ability for a member of a banking group to pay AIL on an interest payment to an associated party will apply from the date of enactment. However, clause 5(2) of the bill provides that the ability to pay AIL applies from the first day of the person’s income year that starts after the date on which this Act received the Royal assent. There is no reason to delay paying AIL on interest payments made by a member of a New Zealand banking group to an associated person. Comment Officials agree that the application date should be enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Extension to other financial institutions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Titan NZ Funding Trust) Proposed section RF 12(1)(a)(ii) provides a concession for members of a New Zealand banking group. We welcome the concession for registered banks but we believe the concession should be extended to other financial institutions that play a role in importing “market” capital to New Zealand (and similarly act as a conduit). For example, a non-resident bank that provides funding to a non-bank subsidiary in New Zealand or a finance company that raises money in the market. When a degree of control is required for non-banks, this could be managed by the issue of a determination at the request of the non-banks. Comment Officials included registered banks in the concession as it is recognised that these banks have non-resident parents that are also banks. These foreign banks are subject to regulatory oversight, and often tax laws, that are specific to banks. These provide officials with confidence that these entities will be borrowing money to fund their New Zealand operations and the funding cannot be considered equivalent to equity. 117 The same principles do not apply to non-banks including entities that are involved in securitisation structures or that provide non-bank funding to third parties. Officials note that it is still possible to operate a securitisation structure that will incur AIL, rather than NRWT, on interest payments to non-residents and that this treatment is consistent with the policy changes in this bill. Officials limited this concession to New Zealand banking groups as they are easily defined. Officials are not aware of an equivalent definition that could be applied to financial institutions more generally that would distinguish between those that operate as a conduit and those that may be sourcing funding in the nature of equity. Officials note that there are already provisions in the tax system that apply a different tax treatment to banks compared to non-banks that are otherwise providing similar services. Examples include the branch notional loan proposals in this bill and the bank thin capitalisation rules. As well as the concerns above, a determination approach would require empowering provisions and legislative guidance on whether these determinations should be issued to specific taxpayers. This would have to consider features of both the New Zealand borrower and non-resident lender. Officials are not aware of, and submitters have not provided, any suitable approach that could adequately distinguish between various non-bank financial institutions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 PREPAYMENTS Clauses 261 and 330 Issue: Clarification Submission (EY) Proposed section RZ 12 has the aim of preventing parties to existing FAs prepaying interest where no NRWT is presently payable or using the present AIL rules when interest payments in due course would be subject to full NRWT and/or NRFAI treatment under the new rules. Section RZ 12 would treat any excess of interest paid over the borrower’s total expenditure accrued as not being paid until the date the new rules first apply to the FA in question. Proposed section RZ 12(2) refers to the “total interest paid under the arrangement” and the “total expenditure of person A accrued on the arrangement”, which suggest the calculations should be based on those totals from commencement of the arrangement rather than some later date. The example given in the bill, however, refers to a loan which commenced on 1 April 2010 but seems to be basing the section RZ 12(2) calculation solely on a portion of a September 2016 payment as relating to a period from 1 April 2016, rather than providing a comparison of the total interest payments made under the FA and X Ltd’s total accrued expenditure. It is not clear whether the borrower’s accrued expenditure should be to the date of latest payment or to the date when the new NRFAI/NRWT rules start applying to the borrower, so clarification on that aspect is also needed. Comment As noted by the submitter, the prepayment rule should be calculated based on totals from commencement of the arrangement rather than some later date. It is necessary to complete this calculation from commencement of the arrangement as applying it only to the last or latter income years could result in a payment being classified as a prepayment when it was actually a payment of interest accrued in previous years. Officials consider the current drafting already achieves this result. The example in the legislation assumes that the $60,000 interest payment each year by X is matched by a $60,000 interest deduction. The result of these matching payments and deductions is that a calculation from 1 April 2010 to the date the changes are enacted would result in an identical outcome to the same calculation from 1 April 2016 to the date the changes are enacted. The date of accrued expenditure should match the date the proposed rules apply to the arrangement. Officials do not consider an interest payment should be covered by this rule just because it was paid to reflect interest accrued up to the date the proposed rules apply. Calculating accrued expenditure up to this date achieves this outcome. Officials consider the current drafting already achieves this result. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 119 Issue: Foreign exchange Submission (EY) If FAs are denominated in foreign currency, the borrower’s total expenditure under the FA rules to any given date would be affected by any foreign exchange variations to that point. We expect there could be situations where there has not been any deliberate pre-payment of interest to avoid or reduce the impact of the new NRFAI/NRWT rules but the impact of exchange gains over time could result in an apparent excess of the amount of interest payments over the amount of the borrower’s FA expenditure. We consider the application of section RZ 12 in such circumstances would be unreasonable and unjustified. We submit the section RZ 12(2) calculation should be revised to ensure that there is no deemed excess deemed payment on commencement of the new NRFAI/NRWT rules by reason of any foreign exchange gains included in the borrower’s FA expenditure accrued to the relevant date. Comment Officials agree that foreign currency gains that result in a borrower claiming a smaller deduction that the foreign current amount of interest payments should not in themselves trigger the prepayment rule as this rule is only intended to cover interest payments in excess of what would otherwise be expected in a commercial transaction in order to defeat the intention of the proposed rules. Officials recommend that, where an arrangement is denominated in a foreign currency, the calculation of both interest payments and total expenditure in proposed section RZ 12(2) should be completed in that foreign currency and then any excess converted to New Zealand dollars using the existing rules in subpart YF of the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Refunds of AIL Submission (EY) Proposed section 86GB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 would allow refunds to be sought by those who have paid AIL in relation to amounts which would be treated as subject to NRWT by virtue of proposed section RZ 12(2). We submit such AIL should be transferred in the first instance on account of the NRWT which would become payable, unless a refund is expressly requested. Alternatively, taxpayers should have the option to have such AIL transferred in that way. 120 Comment Officials always intended that a refund of AIL under section 86GB would be available to be transferred to partially meet an NRWT liability arising by virtue of section RZ 12(2). Officials recommend amendments to ensure this is achieved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: FA amounts other than interest Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amounts that are not interest, such as fair value movements, should not be included in the calculation of the total expenditure of person A for the purpose of applying the prepayment rule. Comment When a borrower derives financial arrangement income this should not trigger the prepayment rule on an arrangement that otherwise pays interest in line with deductions. Likewise when a borrower incurs financial arrangement expenditure on amounts that are not equivalent to interest, such as fair value losses, this should not be available to shelter prepayments of interest before this rule applies. These adjustments should be similar to those recommended above as being introduced for the calculation of NRFAI. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 AIL REGISTRATION Clauses 246, 294, and 330 to 332 Issue: The proposals should not proceed Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) The proposals introduce additional compliance costs that are unwarranted. The additional criteria mean that some genuine arm’s-length arrangements will no longer be entitled to use the approved issuer levy regime. Deliberate non-compliance with the AIL rules should be dealt with in the same manner as other taxes, with audit and enforcement action undertaken by Inland Revenue. We question whether currently non-compliant taxpayers will comply with the proposed new law, and whether Inland Revenue will be any more willing or able to enforce the new law than the current law. If Inland Revenue does not consider it cost effective to scrutinise AIL registration applications and AIL returns made under current law, it is unclear how it would be more cost effective to do so under the proposals. Comment Submitters have identified a number of concerns with these proposals. These include that borrowing by and/or from certain borrowers will be unable to register for AIL and that even those that do comply will incur costs in continuing to ensure they still qualify. While many of these concerns could be rectified – for example, by expanding the categories or clarifying the application of the $500,000 threshold – it is acknowledged that these proposals have raised significant opposition and would impose compliance costs on many compliant borrowers that would be high as a proportion of the additional tax raised from non-compliant borrowers. Officials consider that these proposals should be removed from the bill so that the current registration requirements for a registered security remain. Officials still consider that the inappropriate use of AIL by borrowers and lenders who are associated continues to be a concern. This is because it is time consuming and often impossible to determine the chain of funding in a family or friend context. There is common use of nominees and “hand-shake” agreements in masking the source of the funds. Even when Inland Revenue finds such arrangements it is time consuming to apply section BG 1. Any decisions on the appropriate level of audit response will continue to be an operational decision for Inland Revenue. One problem with this approach is the current registration process does not allow Inland Revenue to refuse a registration even where the lender is associated with the borrower. This continues to raise integrity issues and officials may consider a further policy response in the future when this continues to be a concern. There were a number of other submissions on technical aspects of the AIL registration rules. These have been superseded by the recommendation to withdraw the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 GST 123 124 GST AND CAPITAL RAISING COSTS Clause 311(4) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC) Submitters support the proposed amendment to clarify an aspect of GST law that has been uncertain and on occasion an area of dispute with Inland Revenue. The proposed amendment will provide taxpayers with clarity and certainty. Comment Officials welcome the submitters’ support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) The application date should be brought forward to the date of application of the bill. Given there is consensus that the current legislation does not result in the desired policy outcome (that is, registered businesses are currently unable to recover GST costs when raising capital), businesses should be able to benefit from the new rules as soon as possible. (PwC) The application date should be retrospective and apply from the date the GST issues paper announcing these reforms was released – 17 September 2015. There is a strong case for the amendment to apply with effect from the date of the issues paper, noting in particular that the amendment is taxpayer-favourable. It is arguable that taxpayers were already allowed an input tax deduction under our current law, however we acknowledge there was some uncertainty regarding this. In light of this, it would be detrimental to the integrity of the tax system for the uncertain state of the current law to be prolonged. If there is concern that taxpayers may seek to re-open prior tax positions, the application date could be set so that it applies to costs incurred after 17 September 2015 but with taxpayers only being able to claim input tax credits in future tax returns (that is, using the two-year rule in subsection 20(3) of the GST Act). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 125 The date on which the GST and capital raising costs proposals were announced would be a fairer application date for taxpayers. Inland Revenue would have certainty that the proposals would not be misused because taxpayers cannot easily change capital-rais ing activit ies, as they are a time-consuming/drawn out process (sometimes taking years). On this basis, the application date of GST and capital raising cost proposals should be the date proposals were announced, 17 September 2015. (Deloitte) Comment Submitters have suggested a range of retrospective application dates. Officials consider that the proposed amendment represents a policy change, rather than a clarification of the existing law. Inland Revenue has maintained a well-documented position that the existing law does not allow GST to be recovered on capital raising costs. In 2004 the Court of Appeal confirmed this position in CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 . Departing from the usual approach of applying policy changes prospectively could create inequity by advantaging a specific group of taxpayers if this treatment was not extended into other, comparable, policy changes. A retrospective policy change would also create uncertainty in the treatment that has been applied prior to the amendment, and could require or allow taxpayers to reopen and correct past returns. Applying the law change on a retrospective basis would involve a fiscal cost of $10 million a year for each additional year covered. Back-dating the law change to September 2015, as proposed by some submitters, would cost an additional $17 million. The 1 April 2017 application date provides more certainty than the date of the bill’s enactment, which is not fixed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Grandparenting provision Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) A grandparenting provision that preserves the positions of GST registered persons who have already taken an input tax deduction for GST on capital raising costs would be appropriate and fair and would provide certainty for those persons on their historic GST positions. Comment As mentioned above, Inland Revenue has maintained a well-documented position that the existing law does not allow GST to be recovered on capital raising costs and has publicly communicated this position. 126 It would be unfair to grandparent the positions of businesses that incorrectly claimed GST deductions for their capital raising costs compared with those businesses that correctly complied with the existing law. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Scope should be expanded to include failed attempts at capital raising Submission (KPMG ) The drafting of proposed section 11A(1)(rb) should be inclusive of unsuccessful capital raising attempts. Section 11A(1)(rb) should be amended as follows: the services are financial services supplied in the course of an activity of obtaining funds by a registered person who does not principally make supplies of financial services, to the extent to which the funds are used or are intended to be used by the registered person for expenditure in an activity of making taxable supplies... . Comment Expanding the scope of the amendment to include failed capital raisings is consistent with the policy intent of the amendment, as these are costs incurred as a part of a business’s taxable activity, whether the capital raising is successful or not. Officials therefore agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification as to the amounts of consideration for zero-rated supplies in GST returns Submission (EY) Clarification may be needed or desirable as to the amounts of “consideration” that taxpayers should be showing for zero-rated supplies in their GST returns. At the practical GST compliance and return level, the current GST return form requires taxpayers to state the total value of their zero-rated supplies in any return period. The bill’s proposals to zero-rate certain financial service supplies will mean that all GST-registered taxpayers (other than those who principally make supplies of financial services) will need to account for any zero-rated supplies arising from their debt or equity securities or related payments. Clear and detailed guidance should be provided so that taxpayers can comply with those obligations relat ively simply and with certainty. 127 Comment Officials acknowledge the point raised in the submission about the likely difficulty for businesses who do not principally make supplies of financial services in applying a zero- rating rule. Rather than zero-rating the supplies, we propose that it would be simpler to use a special deduction rule (similar to section 20(3L) in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which allows non-residents who are registered for GST under section 54B to claim back the GST on inputs purchased in New Zealand, despite the fact that they do not make taxable supplies in New Zealand). Such a rule would allow these businesses to claim back the GST on their capital raising costs, to the extent that the capital raising is undertaken to fund a taxable activity. The special deduction rule would not affect the amount of input tax that is claimable for the costs incurred in cap ital rais ing in terms of the bill’s proposal. Businesses will still need to account for the amounts of consideration paid for their inputs and determine which amounts relate to the capital raising activity. Further, businesses that make a combination of taxable and exempt supplies would still be required to apportion the input tax claimed where the capital raising is not undertaken to fund a 100% taxable activity. Agreeing to the submitter’s proposal would reduce compliance costs in relation to accounting for the value of their supplies of financial services (outputs) made to raise funds for a taxable activity. Stating the amounts of consideration for zero-rated supplies of certain financial services can be difficult due to the substitutability of fees and margins. Further, businesses that only make standard-rated supplies in the normal course of their business will not be accustomed to stating the amounts of consideration for zero-rated supplies in their GST returns. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 128 AGREED METHODS OF APPORTIONMENT AND ADJUSTMENT Clauses 314(3), (4), (5) and 315(2) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Deloitte, EY, PwC) The submitters are supportive of the proposals, which enable businesses to apply alternative methods of apportioning and making adjustments to input tax deductions. These proposals should reduce compliance costs for some businesses who apply the current apportionment and adjustment rules. Comment Officials welcome submitters’ support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Proposed amendment should apply to all registered persons Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY) The option to agree an alternative method of apportionment and adjustment with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should not be restricted to persons who reasonably expect to make supplies of goods and services with a value of more than $24 million in a 12-month period – instead, it should be available to all registered persons. Submitters note that many businesses currently use an approximation of the apportionment and adjustment rules or pragmatic “shortcuts” (which are technically not legislated for) and would benefit from the proposal if the threshold was removed. An alternative approach would be to expand the proposals to all taxpayers. This would encourage all taxpayers to have an open dialogue and relationship with Inland Revenue. This approach would be consistent with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s duty to collect the highest net revenue over time, with specific regard to the importance of voluntary compliance. (Deloitte) The proposal discriminates unfairly between large and other taxpayers by allowing taxpayers to agree an alternative method of making apportionments and adjustments only if the registered person is making, or reasonably expecting to make, supplies of goods and services in excess of $24 million in a current 12-month period. The details and expected administrative requirements for any application for approval of an alternative method should provide an effective and sufficient constraint in practice on the numbers of taxpayers likely to apply. Only those with the necessary resources and commitment to make appropriate applications would do so. If taxpayers are willing to commit their resources to making 129 appropriate applications, there is no justification for refusing them on the basis their turnover or expected turnover in a current year does not exceed $24 million. (EY) Comment The proposed amendment allows large businesses that make a mix of both taxable and exempt supplies (such as residential accommodation and commercial accommodation) to agree an alternative method of apportionment with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The proposed amendment is limited to larger taxpayers (including registered groups) with $24 million or more in turnover. This is because larger businesses are more likely to have difficulty applying the standard apportionment rules as they have a greater number of transactions and more complex transactions. This makes it more likely that there will be a net benefit for the business as there are costs associated with formulating and agreeing an alternative method of apportionment (such as advisor fees), and in some cases, these costs may exceed the costs of continuing to apply the standard apportionment rules. It was envisaged that the majority of businesses who would apply to the Commissioner for an agreed method under the proposal would be retirement villages, as these are high-turnover businesses which supply a mix of both taxable supplies and exempt accommodation. Given their high turnover and this combination of taxable and exempt supplies, retirement villages have experienced particular difficulty in applying the apportionment and adjustment rules and, anecdotally, have used approximations which, technically, are not legislated for. We are not aware of any specific examples of other businesses or industries that would similarly benefit from the proposal if it were extended to all taxpayers. Because New Zealand’s GST has few exemptions, the vast majority of smaller businesses only provide taxable supplies so should not need to apply the apportionment rules in respect of exempt supplies in the first place. For most smaller businesses who do make a combination of taxable and exempt supplies, it is desirable that as far as possible, these businesses apply the existing rules rather than use an approximation. However, in recognition of the fact that there are some smaller retirement village operators who belong to an industry association, industry bodies will be able to negotiate industry-wide apportionment ratios on behalf of their members. This provides a cost-effective, compliance-saving option for smaller suppliers, although they might not get the apportionment and adjustment method that would be most ideal from their perspective. In this case, these smaller taxpayers still have the option of applying the existing apportionment and adjustment rules. Members of an industry association with a turnover exceeding the $24 million threshold have the choice of using the industry ratio or applying to the Commissioner for their own ratio. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 130 Issue: Lower threshold should apply Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PwC) If the submission to remove the $24 million threshold is not acceptable, as an alternative, proposed sections 20(3EB)(b)(i) and 21(4B)(b)(i) should be amended to apply to those persons who reasonably expect to make supplies of goods and services with a value of more than $5 million in a 12-month period. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) If some threshold is desired, an annual turnover of $3 million (which would match the income tax definition of “low-turnover trader”) would be more appropriate. Such a threshold would be less discriminatory than that presently proposed while excluding taxpayers whose level of trade is generally regarded as “small” by New Zealand’s income tax system. (EY) The eligibility threshold should be lowered, to at least $4 million, to ensure that more businesses are able to benefit from the proposal. (PwC) Comment Lowering the eligibility threshold to $3 million or $5 million could greatly increase the number of businesses that apply for an alternative apportionment method. Because agreeing on an apportionment method with the Commissioner is a resource-intensive activity, a high number of applications could create long delays and inconsistent practices. Extending the method could therefore result in significant additional administration costs for Inland Revenue, and needs to be balanced against the compliance cost savings to taxpayers. The submissions do not provide any specific examples of affected businesses or industries that would benefit from a lower threshold. It would be possible to reduce the eligibility threshold as part of a future tax bill, if compelling cases emerge. There is an expectation that taxpayers should apply the law. Officials note that, for the vast majority of taxpayers, the current apportionment and adjustment rules are already simpler than they were before the rules were significantly reformed in 2011. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 131 Issue: Application of the threshold on a group basis, if taxpayers are registered as part of a group, should be clarified and confirmed Submission (EY) The submitter assumes the $24 million threshold would be applied on a group basis if taxpayers are group-registered for GST purposes. Clarification and confirmation of that aspect would be desirable in any event. Comment Officials confirm that the $24 million threshold will be applied on a group basis if taxpayers are group-registered for GST purposes. This is consistent with the GST principle that a group is treated as an entity. The current drafting of the proposed amendment already provides for this result and will be communicated to taxpayers in the relevant Tax Information Bulletin after the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Publication of apportionment and adjustment methods agreed with the Commissioner Submission (Chapman Tripp) There is a public interest in these agreed methods because they alter taxpayers’ tax liabilities. The statute should require Inland Revenue to publish methods agreed under the new provision in anonymous form. Publishing these methods in anonymous form will help to preserve the integrity of the tax system as defined in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment The agreed apportionment methods are specific to the facts and circumstances of each taxpayer. Officials therefore consider that it would be difficult to publish an agreed apportionment method in an anonymous form without disclosing information which could be commercially sensitive. In addition, publishing taxpayer-specific information would be contrary to the tax secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994. An industry group may decide to publish the ratio agreed on behalf of its members. That said, the submission made about preserving the integrity of the tax system (including the need for consistency and fairness) is noted by officials. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 132 SECONDHAND GOODS, AND GOLD, SILVER AND PLATINUM Clause 304(3), (5) and (6) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (New Zealand Gold Merchants Limited) The submitter supports the proposed changes to the GST treatment of secondhand goods provided for by these clauses. The changes will: • clarify an aspect of GST legislation that has been unclear and has led to disputes with Inland Revenue; • avoid an unworkable outcome that can result in jewellers and traders in gold and precious metal products being subject to the double impost of GST under Inland Revenue’s current interpretation of the law; • produce, in practice, a more uniform application of GST in the affected industry; and • still protect the GST tax base from rorts. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transitional provisions should be included in the legislation Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Clause 304(5) and (6) is a transitional provision for registered persons who have previously applied the definition of “secondhand goods” as it reads before being amended. Clause 304(6) enables registered persons to claim a secondhand goods deduction for goods acquired in the four years preceding the date of enactment. For the sake of clarity the transitional provision should be inserted in Part 12 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Comment While inserting the transitional provision into Part 12 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 would make the provision more accessible to taxpayers, officials note that the ambit of the amendment to which the transitional provision relates is quite narrow and will only apply to a small group of taxpayers who are already likely to be aware of both the proposed change and the transitional period. The transitional period covered by the provision is the four-year 133 period preceding the date of enactment, so the transitional provision will be useful to the affected taxpayers for only a short period of time. We note that the transitional provisions that are already in Part 12 of the Act are of a more fundamental or ongoing nature than the proposed transitional provision in clause 304(5) and (6) of this bill. We therefore see little benefit in inserting the provision into Part 12 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Instead, the transitional provision will be highlighted in the Tax Information Bulletin follow ing enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Monitoring the use of the amendment for tax avoidance Submission (Deloitte) Inland Revenue should monitor the use of secondhand good amendments relating to gold, silver and platinum for tax avoidance. Comment Officials are aware of the fiscal risks associated with allowing input tax deductions for secondhand goods consisting of alloy gold, silver or platinum. Inland Revenue will keep a watching brief over claims for secondhand good deductions to mitigate this risk. We note that the amendment applies only to finished consumer goods that have undergone a manufacturing process. This lowers the associated fiscal risk, since fraud of the type referred to by the submitter would be more likely to occur if secondhand good deductions were allowed for alloy gold, silver or platinum that is in an unfinished state. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 134 SERVICES CONNECTED WITH LAND Clause 311(1) and (3) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (KPMG ) The submitter supports the general expansion of the provisions relating to services connected to land both inside and outside New Zealand where the services are intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Not supportive of the amendment Submission (Deloitte) Proposals relating to the GST treatment of services connected with land should not go ahead. While the submitter understands that the proposals seek to harmonise New Zealand’s GST with other OECD members, they consider there is a good understanding amongst taxpayers of how the current rules operate. The removal of the ability for New Zealand suppliers to zero- rate certain services should only be introduced after careful consideration. Anecdotally, various New Zealand suppliers impacted by these changes expect that a significantly greater number and amount of transactions will be excluded from zero-rating by these changes, rather than will be included in the expanded zero-rating rules. Th is w ill impose additional GS T costs, or cause an increase in the price required to be charged by these New Zealand suppliers. Comment The current legislative test is based on whether the services are “directly in connection” with land. The Court of Appeal, in Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137, has interpreted this test more narrowly than the policy intention. Because of its focus on the physical relationship with land, this interpretation potentially results in a number of professional services with a very close connection to land such as architectural, real estate or legal services failing to satisfy the “directly in connection” test. 135 This interpretation of the current law results in outcomes contrary to the destination principle: the non-taxation of some services that ought to be regarded as consumed in New Zealand and the taxation of some services consumed outside New Zealand. In addition, the New Zealand rules are not aligned with the international approach, which could result in services being taxed in more than one jurisdiction or not taxed in any jurisdiction at all. The proposed amendments are designed to ensure that New Zealand’s rules reflect the policy intent and international practice, as well as better aligning the treatment of non-resident purchasers of New Zealand land with resident purchasers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: More clarity required Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PwC, Quotable Value, New Zealand Law Society) Submitters acknowledge the rationale behind the proposed changes. However, they consider that the legislation needs to be drafted more clearly. The current position has developed through case law over many years, so shifting the boundary has the potential to create considerable uncertainty. The proposed legislation needs to be more explicit, and more detailed explanation and examples should be in the guidance issued by Inland Revenue. Examples of services that will likely have considerable uncertainty and difficulty regarding their GST treatment, include: • advertising or marketing services; • property valuation services relating to land in New Zealand; • legal services relating to the disposal or acquisition, or proposed disposal or acquisition, of land and/or buildings or other improvements in New Zealand; • legal services relating to leases, licences, mortgages and other such rights or interests in respect of land and/or buildings or other improvements in New Zealand; • legal services relating to the procurement of physical works in respect of New Zealand land, including buildings, infrastructure and other improvements; • architectural and design services; • engineering services; • real estate and property management services; and • legal services relat ing to investing in New Zealand, including structuring advice and implementation of investment structures. 136 For example, it is not clear if the following supply of advertising services is standard-rated or zero-rated when a non-resident is selling land in New Zealand and the land is advertised for sale in a New Zealand newspaper. The Commentary includes only two examples of the type of services that can be zero-rated. Detailed guidance and examples are critical to the success of the change. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Clarification, more detailed explanation and examples would be desirable on the use of the phrase “a parcel of land” and the types of services that are expected to be treated as being in connection with a parcel of land or an improvement “intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, or ownership or other legal status, of the land or improvement”. (EY) Specifically, the proposed reference to “ownership or other legal status” of the land or improvement may be too broad and could potentially apply to a wider range of transactions. Further clarity is also required in cases when the consideration includes a range of services, some of which may be subject to standard rating. In those cases, an apportionment exercise may be required. Guidance should be provided on how this can be done. (PwC) Clarification should be given that the GST treatment of property valuation services provided by New Zealand residents to non-resident customers, in relation to New Zealand land are not considered to be services which are “intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land or improvement”. (Quotable Value) Comment Officials have taken note of submitters’ concerns and agree that greater clarity is required in the proposed legislation. We have referred this matter to drafters. The proposed test is intended to encompass services that have a very close relationship with land, such that they are effectively consumed where the land is located. Under the proposed test, the services must be intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land or improvement. The reference to “services intended to enable or assist a change in physical condition” ensures that services that form an integral part of a process of physically changing the land, but do not do so themselves, are captured, and those that only relate to land more generally (such as seeking general advice on land law or the housing market in New Zealand), are not. In the case of general property valuation services which have not been undertaken for a specific property intended for sale, it is likely that these services relate to land more generally and, therefore, are not sufficiently connected with land to fall within the “intended to enable or assist a change in the physical condition, ownership or other legal status of the land or improvement” test. We note the point made in the submission that valuation services do not provide any authority to change the legal or physical status of land or improvements to land, nor do they necessarily assist with the process of such a change. The proposed test is expected to apply to a variety of professional services such as real estate and legal services as part of a land transaction, where the ultimate outcome is to change the legal nature of the land but the services do not involve any physical change or connection to the land. Further guidance and clarification will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. 137 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Supplies of licences to occupy and associated facilitation services Submission (KPMG ) A licence to occupy is not generally legally considered to be an interest in land. Further, the extended definition of “land” in the GST Act only applies for the land zero-rating rules and does not explicitly cover licences to occupy. The supply of accommodation that is closely, clearly and obviously connected with the underlying land should be zero-rated. A supply of land in this circumstance should be covered by both sections 11A(1)(e) and (k). This may be achieved by applying the extended definition of “land” in the GST Act to these two provisions. Services that are in relation to land but which may not affect the physical condition, legal status and ownership of the land (such as facilitation services provided by a travel agent in relation to a booking for accommodation at an overseas hotel) should be zero-rated or not as relevant. Comment Officials understand that the submitter’s primary concern in relation to supplies of licences to occupy (and associated facilitation services) is in the context of bookings for overseas accommodation made through a travel agent or online accommodation booker. As the submitter has noted in their submission, the obiter comment in Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 suggests that the supply of a license to occupy in the context of overseas accommodation booked through a travel agent would be zero-rated (as the supply of an interval holiday in the Malololailai case was considered by the Court of Appeal to be “directly in connection with land”). On the basis that a supply of a licence to occupy is directly in connection with land, facilitation fees charged by travel agents and online accommodation bookers in relation to bookings for overseas accommodation would also be zero-rated under the proposed amendment. However, officials acknowledge that there is some uncertainty about whether or not licences to occupy are indeed supplied “directly in connection with land” (as services that are “directly in connection” with land have been interpreted elsewhere as being those that directly affect a change to the physical or legal nature of land). Given this uncertainty, it is desirable that this issue be addressed as soon as possible to provide taxpayers with clarity. Th is said, the proposed amendments in the current bill are intended to address particular issues that have arisen whereby the current treatment of some professional services that are closely connected with land does not reflect the broad policy intent. We have not consulted on the more fundamental amendments suggested by the submitter, so making such changes could create uncertainty and unintended outcomes. 138 Officials therefore suggest that a better way of ensuring the zero-rating of services provided by travel agents and online accommodation bookers in relation to supplies of overseas accommodation to New Zealand residents might be to amend section 11A(1)(j). Officials note another submission by KPMG on this bill, which suggests making such an amendment to section 11A(1)(j). As noted in our response to that submission, we will consider whether an amendment to section 11A(1)(j) should be put on the Tax Policy Work Programme. Any proposals will go through the usual Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting issue – section 11A(1)(k)(i) and (ii) Submission (Russell McVeagh) There is a drafting issue in clause 311(3) that should be amended. The words “services which are” should be omitted from the proposed amendments to section 11A(1)(k)(i) and (ii), as those words already appear in the introductory sentence to section 11A(1)(k). Comment Officials agree that the words “services which are” in clause 311(3) are an unnecessary repetition of the phrase used in the introductory sentence to section 11A(1)(k), and that these words should be deleted from the clause. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Suggested drafting changes Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Clause 311(1) and (3) should be amended as follows: 311 Section 11A amended (Zero-rating of services) (1) Replace section 11A(1)(e) with: (e) the services are: (i) supplied directly in connection with a parcel of land situated outside New Zealand, or with an improvement to such land:, or 139 (ii) are supplied in connection with a particular parcel of land situated in New Zealand, or with an improvement to any such parcel of land, such land or improvement and are intended to enable or assist a change, or prospective change, into the physical condition, or the ownership or other legal status, of the that parcel of land or improvement; or ... (3) Replace section 11A(1)(k)(i) and (ii) with: (i) services which are supplied directly in connection with a particular parcel of land situated in New Zealand, or with an improvement to any such parcel of land:, or are (ii) supplied in connection with a particular parcel of land situated in New Zealand, or with an improvement to any such land, such land or improvement and are intended to enable or assist a change, or prospective change, into the physical condition, or the ownership or other legal status, of the that parcel of land or improvement:; o r (iii) services which are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property, other than choses in action or goods to which paragraph (h) or (i) applies, situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed:; o r (iiiv) the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity, to the extent to which the activity would have occurred within New Zealand;” Comment As per our response to Russell McVeagh’s submission, officials agree that the words “services which are” should be deleted from clause 311(3). However, we consider that some of the drafting changes suggested in the submission are not necessary, nor do they provide greater clarity. This said, officials have taken note of the suggested changes and of the submission themes generally that greater clarity is required in this area. We have referred these suggested changes to drafters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Post-implementation review Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter notes Inland Revenue’s acknowledgement that the changes may have a negative impact on competitive neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers of services to non-residents in connection with New Zealand land. The post-implementation impact of the changes in this regard should be scheduled for review. 140 Comment Officials do not anticipate that the potential decrease in competitive neutrality should be a significant problem. In reality, a competitive advantage to non-resident businesses over their New Zealand-based competitors supplying services connected with New Zealand land to non- residents is not that likely, given resident businesses’ existing advantage arising from being located in New Zealand (and therefore being closer to the land). Even if a distortion results, officials consider that this is relatively minor compared with the larger distortion created by the existing rules. Inland Revenue will, however, monitor the operation of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of implementation, as part of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Any changes identified as necessary will be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals will go through the usual GTPP. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Consistency between zero-rating provisions relating to services connected with land and services connected with other goods Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Inland Revenue should ensure that there is consistency between the zero-rating provisions relating to services supplied in connection with land and services supplied in connection with other goods. Comment The proposed amendments address particular issues that have arisen whereby the current treatment of some professional services that are closely connected with land does not reflect the policy intent. Officials note that the rules for services connected with other goods largely work as intended. We will, however, monitor the practical operation of the existing rules and review this issue at a later stage if necessary through the GTPP. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 141 SUPPLIES OF LAND LEASES Clauses 310(3) to (6) and 314(7) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposed amendments, which will bring clarity and consistency to this area. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: “Savings” provisions should be included Submission (EY) “Savings” provisions should be included the bill to protect tax positions taken by taxpayers in their transactions with relevant parties, in relation to the issuing of any GST “tax invoices” and GST returns filed up to the date the bill is enacted. A variety of approaches may have been taken by taxpayers in relation to lease surrenders, novations or other transactions relating to leases of commercial property. It is not appropriate for the proposed amendments potentially to render some taxpayers liable now to re-assessment of GST for previous periods at the standard rate or, conversely, to require re-assessment on a zero-rated basis if the parties had previously accounted GST at the standard rate. Comment Officials agree that savings provisions should be included to protect tax positions previously taken by taxpayers. We note that the relevant 2015 issues paper, GST – current issues, stated that these amendments would “provide for past tax positions to be preserved”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 142 Issue: Clarification whether amendment applies only to novations Submission (Russell McVeagh) If it is intended that proposed section 11(8D)(c) applies to any arrangement that consists of a lessee surrendering a lease and another lease being entered into by the lessor with a third party (as reflected in the current drafting), and not merely a novation (as indicated in the bill Commentary), then this should be acknowledged by officials in the Tax Information Bulletin released after the bill is enacted so that the apparent inconsistency between the drafting of the bill and the statements in the Commentary do not result in uncertainty in practice. Comment The Commentary to the bill states that proposed section 11(8D)(c) is intended to apply to arrangements when a lease is “novated”. The Commentary implies that a novation occurs where a new lease is entered into on the same terms as an existing lease. However, this is not technically correct: a novation substitutes the lessor or lessee with a third party, so that the third party takes on either the lessee or lessor’s obligations under the existing lease agreement. We confirm that proposed section 11(8D)(c) also applies to arrangements that consist of a lessee surrendering a lease and the lessor supplying the interest in land under another lease with a third party, and not just novations We will clarify the intended scope of the provision in the relevant Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting issue – section 11(8D) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The wording of the proposed legislation should be simpler. Unnecessary words should be eliminated. For example, the phrases “that is not a regular payment” and “are 25% or less of the consideration specified in the agreement” are unnecessarily repeated several times. Comment Officials have taken note of the feedback from submitters that the wording of the proposed legislation should be simpler. However, we do not agree that the phrases “that is not a regular payment” and “are 25% or less of the consideration specified in the agreement” have been unnecessarily repeated in clause 310(4). To avoid repeating these phrases, it would be necessary to define a new term for each phrase and refer instead to that term. We do not consider that this would be an improvement over the current drafting, especially since the use of the new terminology would be restricted to section 11(8D)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 only, and would not be referenced in other parts of the same Act (or even in other parts of section 11). 143 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Technical/drafting issues – section 11(8D) Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) Submitters have raised a number of issues with clause 310(3) to (6): • Proposed section 11(8D)(b) should apply to determine the GST treatment separately of each successive supply under an agreement. The amendment as drafted places an inappropriate focus on payments made under the agreement. This is inconsistent with the way the GST Act works, which is that GST does not apply to a payment, but rather to a supply (which is triggered under section 9(3) by an amount paid or payable). (Russell McVeagh) • Proposed section 11(8D)(b)(iv) as currently drafted appears to have some missing or incorrect words. We assume it is intended to say that the consideration specified in the agreement should be treated as the amount of consideration under the agreement calculated in respect of the longer of one year and the shortest possible fixed term of the agreement. If so, the provision should be amended accordingly. (Russell McVeagh) • Proposed section 11(8D)(c) should be expanded to include a supply made under an arrangement that “includes”, rather than “consists of” the surrender of a lease and entry into a new lease with a third party. (EY, Russell McVeagh) • The current drafting of subclause (iii) of proposed new section 11(8D)(c) is problematic. The relevant supplies of the interest in land under the lease agreements are unlikely to meet the requirements of section 11(1)(mb), having regard to section 11(8D)(b). This is because, in the normal course, commercial leases do not involve significant premiums or similar upfront payments. Subclause (iii) of the proposed new section 11(8D)(c) should be worded as follows: “(iii) the supplies of the interest in land under the lease agreements meet the requirements set out in subsection (1)(mb), disregarding paragraph (b) of this subsection.” (New Zealand Law Society) • The two references to “land” in proposed section 11(8D)(d) should be replaced with “goods”. The proposed provision relates back to section 11(1)(mb)(i) of the GST Act, which refers to “goods”. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials have taken note of the matters raised by submitters relating to the drafting of clause 310(3) to (6) and will make appropriate fixes for these issues. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 144 Issue: Lease termination transactions Submission ( PwC) Under the proposals, some lease termination transactions which are subject to GST at 15% (early termination payment by tenant) or represent damages/compensation (no GST) are being made subject to compulsory zero-rating (CZR). The CZR rules should only apply if an interest in land is transferred. Comment Officials agree with the submitter that payments that represent compensation for damages will not be subject to GST as these do not represent consideration for a supply. On a principled basis, if a lump sum payment exceeds the 25% threshold, the supply under the agreement to which the payment relates is treated as being equivalent to a transfer of land. Creating a series of exceptions for situations when that treatment is inappropriate would sign ificantly increase the complexity of the rules. Under the proposed amendment, for the CZR rules to apply, the payment (or amount payable) concerned needs to be more than 25% of the consideration specified under the agreement. The 25% threshold is a base protection measure aimed at preventing “phoenix” fraud. This recognises the fact that some commercial leases that include irregular large lump sum payments are essentially substitutable for a transfer of land (and hence the same risk of phoenix fraud associated with sales of commercial land also exists in this situation). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date – section 11(8D)(c) Submission (Matter raised by officials) There is an inconsistency between the stated application date of clause 310(5) in the bill Commentary and that stated in the bill. Comment The Commentary to the bill states that the application date for the supplies of land leases amendments is 1 April 2011, with the only exception being clause 314(7), which is the provision that deals with land acquired by non-profit bodies. However, the application date stated in the bill for clause 310(5) (proposed section 11(8D)(c)) is 30 June 2014. 145 Officials confirm that 30 June 2014 is the intended application date for proposed section 11(8D)(c), as this is the date on which the existing provision came into force. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 146 TIME OF SUPPLY WHEN CONSIDERATION IS UNKNOWN Clause 308 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (EY) The submitter welcomes the proposal to provide taxpayers with a legitimate, practical way of accounting for GST on supplies when the total consideration is not known at the time of supply as determined under the time of supply rule, which would otherwise apply, and which would normally trigger an obligation to account for the total amount of GST. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting issues – section 9(6) Submission (EY) The wording of the proposed replacement section 9(6) of the GST Act should be revised to achieve its objective effectively. Proposed replacement section 9(6) is expressed as applying “subject to the other subsections of this section”. That wording suggests that the other time of supply rules in section 9, including the general time of supply rule in section 9(1), must continue applying, in which case section 9(6) would never apply. In referring to the alternatives of invoice or payment, the wording is confusing (particularly the reference to “a payment, not relating to an invoice”) and does not provide any priority as between invoice or payment. Comment The time of supply determines when a supplier must account for GST on a supply of goods or services. The general time of supply rule in section 9(1) requires the supplier to account for GST at the earlier of the time that a payment is made or when an invoice has been issued in relation to the supply. An existing exception allows suppliers to instead treat a supply as multiple supplies (in relation to any payment or invoice issued) when goods are supplied under an agreement, and the consideration payable is not known at the time goods are appropriated under the agreement. 147 However, the current exception is relatively limited and does not apply to all supplies of goods or to any supply of services. Hence, an issue potentially arises when, at the time of supply, the total amount of consideration for the supply is unknown. The intention of proposed section 9(6) is therefore to allow suppliers to account for GST on a supply to the extent that a payment is made (or an invoice for a payment has been issued) when the total consideration payable is not known at the time of supply. The submitter’s comments will be taken into account in amending the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 148 GOODS AND SERVICES CONNECTED WITH EXPORTED BOATS AND AIRCRAFT – APPLICATION DATE Clauses 310(1), (2) and 311(2) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) There is an inconsistency between the stated application date in the bill Commentary and that stated in the bill. The bill’s Commentary states that clauses 310(1), (2) and 311(2) apply from the date of the bill’s introduction, however the legislation states that the provisions apply from the date of Royal assent. Comment Officials confirm that the intended application date of clauses 310(1), (2) and 311(2) is the date of Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 149 SIX-MONTHLY FILING Clauses 312 and 313 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission ( PwC) The submitter supports the proposed amendment to relax the eligibility for six-monthly filing. The proposed change would reduce the compliance costs faced by businesses that have fluctuating revenue throughout the year (businesses that operate on a seasonal basis). Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amendment should be broadened Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) To maintain greater fairness and equity for all taxpayers who make seasonal supplies, the proposed amendments should not be limited to registered persons who make most or all of their supplies within a period of six months or less that falls near the end of the 12-month period. The amendment should apply to all persons who make all or most of their supplies for a 12-month period during a period of six months or less. The words “that ends with or near the end of the 12-month period” should be excluded. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Taxpayers with seasonal businesses may often have balance dates following the making of the bulk of their supplies so that they could be described as making their supplies mostly within the second six months of a 12-month period. But that may not always be the case. From a policy perspective, we see no reason why six-monthly filing should not be available to all taxpayers with seasonal businesses who make all or most of their annual supplies within a single part of their income year, up to six months. (EY) Comment The amendment grants a concession to seasonal businesses who make taxable supplies which exceed the $500,000 threshold for six-monthly filing. The proposal would allow such seasonal businesses that make almost all of their supplies each year in a period consisting of six months or less (and who prepare their accounts at the end of the season) to file GST on a six-monthly basis. The rationale for restricting the scope of the concession to businesses who prepare their accounts at (or shortly after) the end of the season is that the GST should be 150 returned after the end of the seasonal period as soon as practicable. (The preparation and filing of the GST return relating to period in which almost all of the business’s taxable supplies are made should be more timely when it is undertaken closely following the preparation of the business’s accounts.) It is our understanding that most taxpayers who have seasonal businesses (where most of their annual supplies are made in a period of six months or less each year) have balance dates which follow the making of the majority of their supplies for the year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 151 NOTIFICATION A REFUND IS BEING WITHHELD Clause 322 Issue: Not supportive of the amendment Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Submitters are concerned that, if implemented, the proposed change will lead to longer delays for taxpayers receiving notification that their GST return is being investigated. Anecdotally, it can take two weeks from the time that a notice is issued to when it is received by the taxpayer due to delays in the postal service. Submitters question the necessity of the proposed amendment, suggesting that the notice could be issued electronically under Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, rather than sending a physical letter out. The Commissioner would then have 15 days under the current law to issue the notice, as the date that it was issued would be the same day that it was received by the taxpayer. If the Commissioner issued the notice by post two weeks after filing date, the taxpayer may not receive the notice until four weeks after the return has been filed. This will be a significant change from the current 15-day timeframe. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There are no details provided of the scale of the problem to warrant the change. This proposal sends the wrong message to taxpayers that they are responsible for filing all information/payments on time, but Inland Revenue will not apply the same rule to itself. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Such notification could be legislated for on a “real time” basis (in accordance with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme). When notifications are computer generated and sent out electronically, the proposal’s policy rationale appears moot. On this basis, proposals to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue 15 working days to issue a notification that she was investigating the circumstances of a return or requesting further information should not go ahead and instead this area should be reconsidered once Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme has advanced further. (Deloitte) Comment Electronic issue of these notices will be available for taxpayers who have registered for online services in Stage 1 of Business Transformation. However, the proposed amendment recognises that there are a number of taxpayers who are registered for GST who do not (and will not) use digital channels. In these cases, a physical letter will still need to be sent. Where the notification is sent by post, determining the timing based on when the notice is received creates uncertainty regarding whether a notice or request is issued in time. It also creates dependence on the postal schedule, and is affected by changes to delivery times. 152 The amendment is not expected to alter the times by which the vast majority of GST refunds are received. The amendment is intended to clarify the 15-day timeframe for the minority of taxpayers claiming refunds that are subject to further inspection and represents a minor change only. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Clarification needed on when a notice is “issued” Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Clarification is required on when a notice can be considered to be “issued”, as it is not uncommon for there to be significant differences between the date on an Inland Revenue notice and the date it is received by a taxpayer and/or the date it is postmarked by New Zealand Post. Comment A notice can be considered to have been issued on the date shown on the notice. This will be clarified and confirmed in the relevant issue of the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 153 ALIGNMENT OF THE TIME PERIOD TO REPAY OVERPAID GST Clause 321 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission ( PwC) The submitter supports and endorses the proposed amendment. The amendment ensures the legislation reflects the original policy intent of the provision. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transitional provision should be extended Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The transitional provision should apply for all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005, which was the date from which the current provision applied. Furthermore, the transitional provision should apply to all claims, not just existing claims. Comment Officials note that the purpose of the amendment is to clarify an existing provision (which, as the submitter notes, applied from 1 April 2005) so that the law is aligned with the original policy intent. For this reason, we agree that the amendment in clause 321(1) should apply for all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2005. Instead of extending the transitional provision as the submitter suggests, we recommend instead deleting the transitional provision and making the application of clause 321(1) retrospective to 1 April 2005. This will have the effect of extending the amendment to all claims made in relation to taxable periods beginning on or after that date, instead of just existing claims. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 154 AGENTS ACTING FOR PURCHASERS Clauses 320 and 326 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The Group supports this amendment, however we have some concerns with the application date. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We are supportive of the proposals. We also commend officials’ willingness to listen to prior submissions regarding these proposals. (Deloitte) We generally support the proposed amendment to allow agents acting on behalf of purchasers to opt out of the agency rules for a supply made to a principal. This will allow the parties to account for GST as though the supply was two supplies: between the supplier and agent, and between the agent and principal. (K PMG) Comment Officials welcome the submitters’ support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We submit that the amendment should apply from 17 July 2013 as this would align with the application date of changes which became effective on the same date to allow agents and principals to opt out from the agency rules for agents making supplies on behalf of their principals (contained in section 60(1B) of the GST Act). As the underlying policy behind the current amendment and previous change is similar, it would be appropriate that the application of this amendment is back-dated to align with the application date of the previous change. Comment While the underlying policy behind the current amendment and the previous change is indeed similar, it is not the exact same situation. Because the proposed changes therefore represent a minor policy change rather than a clarification of the existing law, officials consider that a retrospective application date would not be appropriate. We recognise, however, that it is desirable that taxpayers are able to benefit from this amendment as soon as possible. This is 155 why we recommend the date of enactment of the bill as the proposed application date for the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Bad debt deductions Submission (KPMG ) The submitter disagrees with the inclusion of clause 320, which prevents a bad debt deduction being claimed for the supply by an agent to a principal where the principal has not repaid the agent. In the case of non-payment by the principal, the agent should be able to claim a bad debt deduction (subject to existing bad-debt deduction rules) as the agent has already returned output tax on the supply to Inland Revenue. If the agent is unable to claim a deduction for the supply, Inland Revenue will be unjustly enriched. Comment As a base maintenance measure, similar to the existing rules for suppliers and their agents, the agent should not be allowed to claim a bad debt deduction in the event of default by the purchaser. This is because it is possible that, if a bad debt deduction were allowed, an agent could claim a bad debt deduction without having returned the output tax. The amendment is intended to ensure that agents and principals do not need to update their systems and incur compliance costs in doing so, without creating an inadvertent fiscal risk. Officials note that under the existing rules, the agent would not be treated as making a supply, and therefore would not receive a deduction for non-payment by the principal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 156 CROSS-BORDER BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS NEUTRALITY REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Clause 324 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (KPMG ) The submitter agrees with the proposed amendments to make two changes to the non-resident registration rules to ensure: (1) that a non-resident cannot register under the rules when they make supplies that are consumed in New Zealand, and (2) a non-resident that only incurs GST paid to New Zealand Customs Service is able to register under section 54B. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarify “carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The meaning of the phrase “carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand” should be clarified for this context so it is clear that the non-resident registration rules are not intended to be interpreted as narrowly as they are currently. Inland Revenue has been interpreting the new rules in a way that prevents a non-resident from registering under the non-resident registration rules if they have any kind of presence or commercial activity in New Zealand even though that presence or activity is less than a taxable activity which would entitle them to register in New Zealand. As a consequence, some non-residents have been unable to recover GST on any business costs incurred in New Zealand under either the non-resident registration rules or the standard registration rules. The narrow interpretation is inconsistent with the policy intent of the rules and creates a “black hole” for GST purposes. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Section 54B(1)(d) should be amended to replace the phrase “carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand” with “carrying on a taxable activity that involves making taxable supplies in New Zealand”. (K PMG) 157 Comment A non-resident cannot register under section 54B if they “are carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand, or intending to carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand”. There is some uncertainty over when a non-resident is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand for the purposes of section 54B(1)(d)(i). Specifically, it is arguable that when a non-resident receives goods or services in New Zealand (which are a part of their overall taxable activity), some part of that taxable activity is being undertaken in New Zealand (thereby preventing registration under section 54B). For example, if a non-resident business sends its employees to be trained in New Zealand, then some part of its global activity is being carried on in New Zealand. The policy objective was only to prevent non-residents from registering under section 54B if they were making taxable supplies, and so were liable to (or able to) register under section 51. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Non-resident parent registration Submission (KPMG ) Inland Revenue’s current view is that a Head Office and a New Zealand branch are the same legal entity for section 54B purposes. As such, the Head Office with a GST-registered New Zealand branch would not be able to separately register for GST under section 54B on the basis that it has a New Zealand branch that carries on a taxable activity in New Zealand. This outcome is inconsistent with the fundamental principle that GST should not be a cost for business (which is the rationale behind section 54B). The Head Office, which is carrying on a taxable activity overseas and is registered for an overseas equivalent of GST, should not bear the cost of New Zealand GST. Section 54B of the GST Act be amended to explicitly provide that a branch registered for GST is treated as a separate person from its Head Office and any other branches. Such an amendment would allow an overseas company with a registered New Zealand branch to be able to be separately registered for GST under section 54B. This amendment should have a retrospective effect from 1 April 2014, to be consistent with the original policy intent behind section 54B. Comment Officials agree with the submitter’s analysis of the issue and acknowledge that the operation of section 54B in this context has been an area of uncertainty. As the submitter points out, the policy is that non-resident businesses should not have to bear the New Zealand GST cost. Section 54B should therefore be amended to align it with the policy intent by allowing a non-resident parent or branch to register separately under section 54B and claim input tax deductions on a payments basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 158 Issue: Drafting issue – section 54B(1)(b) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current drafting of the proposed amendment to section 54B(1)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 may not achieve the desired policy outcome. Officials are therefore recommending the following clarification so that the amendment will operate as intended. The change suggested by officials is taxpayer-favourable, as it will allow more GST- registered businesses to claim back the New Zealand Customs GST costs charged on goods that have been imported by a non-resident. Comment When a non-resident who is an importer of goods is registered under section 54B, section 20(3LB) and (3LC) deem the Customs GST charged on goods submitted for import entry by the non-resident to have been paid by the recipient of the goods, and not by the non-resident importer. Where the imported goods are received by a GST-registered person for the purpose of making taxable supplies, that registered person should be able to claim the Customs GST back as an input tax credit, so that there is no GST impost on a business-to-business transaction. However, if the non-resident importer (who, under the place of supply rules is not treated as making a taxable supply in New Zealand) is ineligible to register under section 54B, a GST impost will result, as neither the non-resident importer nor the recipient will be able to claim the GST back. Under the current law, it is likely that a non-resident who only has a connection with New Zealand as an importer of goods will be unable to register under section 54B. To address this problem, clause 324 in the bill proposes a new replacement section 54B(1)(b). As it is currently worded, the amendment allows a non-resident who only has a connection with New Zealand as an importer to register if that person’s input tax is likely to consist only of Customs GST charged in relation to the importation of goods that are received by another person. However, the reference to input tax is likely to give rise to an interpretative issue which could prevent the operation of proposed section 54B(1)(b) as intended. This is because of the aforementioned interaction of section 20(3LB) and (3LC) with section 54B. The interaction of these sections means that it is arguable that the Customs GST is not the non- resident’s input tax (because it is deemed to have been incurred by the recipient of the goods, not the non-resident). This could lead to problems with registering non-residents who operate only as importers (and who are not treated under the Act as making taxable supplies in New Zealand), contrary to the intent of the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 159 GROUPING LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS Clause 325(2) Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Deloitte) The submitter is supportive of the clarification amendment that seeks to ensure that limited partnerships can apply the grouping rules and file a joint return with other registered persons who share common control. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Deloitte) This amendment is proposed to come into force on the date the bill is enacted. Given the clarifying nature of the amendment, it should be retrospective to cover non-time bar periods (this approach would be consistent with the proposed application date of bodies corporate amendments). This would provide certainty for taxpayers and be consistent with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s duty to promote voluntary compliance. Comment Officials consider that the combined operational and fiscal impacts of back-dating grouping as suggested by the submitter would outweigh the benefits to the affected taxpayers. Going forward, the new rules will provide certainty for these taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 160 HORSE RACING AND PRIZES Clauses 306(3) and 309 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (New Zealand Racing Board) The submitter supports the purpose of clause 306(3), but believe the clause requires amendment to ensure that it applies equally to greyhound races and also to ensure it provides the clarity required. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Technical points – section 5(11CB) Submission (New Zealand Racing Board) • The section should clarify the GST treatment of prizes paid by both Racing Clubs and Racing Codes. The proposed section refers to only a prize paid by a Racing Club. However a limited number of prizes are currently paid by a Racing Code directly, having regard to the performance of the animal at a Racing Club. It would be simpler for a GST-registered industry participant if the same GST treatment applies to all prizes, rather than creating a distinction (or leaving uncertainty of treatment) based on whether the prize is paid by the Racing Club or the Racing Code. • The section should include dogs in a greyhound race so that it applies equally to each of the three Racing Codes. The New Zealand racing industry consists of three Racing Codes – New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing, Harness Racing New Zealand and Greyhound Racing New Zealand. There is no sound policy reason why this amendment should apply to a horse in a horse race and should not apply to a dog in a greyhound race. • The section should focus on the receipt of a prize rather than who enters the animal in the race. It is common practice in the racing industry that a horse (or dog) may be entered into a horse (or greyhound) race by any of a number of people, including the owner, a lessee, a trainer or a racing manager, for example – all of whom could do so as a registered person in the course of a taxable activity. The treatment of the prize should not be dependent upon which of these individuals (or non-individuals) completes the act of entering the animal. The section refers to a prize paid by a Racing Club for the performance of a horse in a horse race. It is common practice for several persons to receive a prize paid by a Racing Club in this way. 161 Comment Officials recognise taxpayers’ need for certainty and clarity in this area. The legislation should be informed by and recognise common industry practice, so that it anticipates all eventualities and is consistent in the way that it applies to similar situations. We consider that the law should provide certainty in the GST treatment of horse racing and greyhound racing prizes alike. Extending the scope of the amendment to cover greyhound racing prizes and prizes paid by Racing Codes, as well as focusing on the receipt of a prize (instead of the act of entering an animal in a race) should achieve this result. However, on the third bullet point above, officials note that the submitter has suggested some draft wording which would treat the likes of jockeys and trainers as making a supply of services to the Racing Club or Code. Inland Revenue’s position is that, where a racehorse or greyhound is concerned, these persons do not provide any supply to the Racing Club or Code. The amendment should not disturb this position. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Guidance from Inland Revenue Submission (New Zealand Racing Board) It is critical that future guidance from Inland Revenue provides clear commentary addressing these issues. In particular that guidance should clarify that this GST treatment is not limited to owners. As recognised in the Commentary to the bill, these arrangements are GST-neutral, as any GST charged by the winner would be deducted by the Racing Club or Racing Code. In this respect, the guidance from the Australian Tax Office is particularly helpful and instructive. Comment An item on the changes will be published in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Officials will consider, once the provision is enacted, whether further guidance is needed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 162 Issue: Grandparenting provision Submission (New Zealand Racing Board) The submitter agrees that these clarifications should be retrospective in nature and supports the proposed application date of 1 April 2012, to preserve and confirm the treatment of past transactions. However, if a prize has not previously been treated as consideration for a supply, that treatment should be “grandparented”. That is, to the extent that a taxpayer previously did not treat a prize as being consideration for a supply and that supply was not included in a tax invoice or a buyer created tax invoice, then the amendment should not apply retrospectively to alter the GST treatment of that supply. This reflects the previous uncertainty, the desire that reassessments should not inadvertently be required for past periods, and that the GST treatment should remain neutral as between the parties in any event. Comment Given the retrospective application date, officials agree that it is both appropriate and fair to include a grandparenting provision to preserve the past tax positions of taxpayers, given the previous uncertainty about the GST treatment of racing prizes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date – section 10(13) Submission (Matter raised by officials) A correction should be made to the application date of clause 309(1). Comment Clause 309(1) makes a minor clarifying amendment to section 10(13), so that the section refers to subsection (12) (instead of section 12). The current application date of the amendment is the date of enactment of the bill. However, because this is a clarification, the amendment should apply with retrospective effect from the date on which the existing provision came into force, which was 1 August 2003. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 163 SALES UNDER A SECURITY INTEREST WHERE AN INCORRECT STATEMENT IS PROVIDED Clauses 306(1) and 323 Issue: Proposal should be “softened” Submission (Deloitte) Proposals relating to sales under a security interest when an incorrect statement is provided should be “softened” to require the debtor to provide a statement in writing to the creditor confirming that the debtor is not aware of anything that may indicate that the supply would have been a taxable supply. Comment The amendment is intended to ensure that incorrect statements by debtors will mean that those debtors end up being liable for the GST on the mortgagee sale. The wording of proposed section 5(2)(a) makes it clear that the statement by the debtor has to be correct before the exception can apply. We note that amending the proposal in the way suggested by the submitter would potentially send the wrong message, as it could give debtors the impression that they do not need to take much care in providing written statements to creditors, when in fact if the statement turns out to be incorrect the debtor will be liable for the GST. Given that this is the case, it is appropriate that debtors know that they need to take reasonable care in providing these statements to ensure that the statement is correct and fully states the reasons why the supply would not be taxable. Officials note that there is a remedy available for a creditor who has incorrectly paid GST on a mortgagee sale under section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. We also note that EY commented in their submission that the proposed amendments to section 5(2)(a) appear reasonable in tightening the criteria for debtors to notify creditors that the sale should be treated as “non-taxable”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 164 Issue: Drafting issues – section 51B(1)(b) Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) The proposed replacement of section 51B(1)(b) should be revised to enable the proposed amendment to operate appropriately. It should treat those selling the goods (the creditors) as registered if they are required to furnish returns under section 17 or make default in that regard, with the debtors being treated as registered if they have provided inadequate or incorrect notices as to non-taxable status to the creditors. Comment Currently, a creditor who undertakes a mortgagee sale is treated (for the purposes of that sale) as a GST-registered person and is liable to make a special return of GST on the sale. Exceptions to this treatment are when the debtor has provided a written statement to the creditor that the sale would not be a taxable supply if the goods had been sold by the debtor, or, if the debtor has not provided such a written statement, the creditor can nevertheless reasonably determine that the sale would not be a taxable supply if it had been made by the debtor. However, the current drafting of the proposed amendment mistakenly treats the creditor as being GST-registered when these exceptions apply. This would render the creditor liable to file a special return in respect of the sale, even though there should be no actual liability to pay GST on the sale. Treating the creditor as a registered person in these circumstances is clearly not the intended policy outcome, as these circumstances are supposed to be the exceptions where a creditor exercising their power of sale is not required to return GST on the sale in a special return. Another drafting issue with the proposed amendments is that, where the exceptions in section 5(2)(a) and (b) do not apply, proposed section 51B(1)(b)(ii) treats the debtor as a registered person in respect of a mortgagee sale even if the debtor did not make an incorrect statement. When the debtor has not provided the creditor with any statement as to the GST treatment of the supply (and the exception in section 5(2)(b) does not apply), the creditor should be treated as registered and be required to return the GST on the sale. Officials will therefore make appropriate changes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 165 Issue: Creditor should be able to rely upon statement by debtor Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 51B(1)(b)(i) does not clearly shift the deemed registration from the security holder to the debtor in circumstances when the debtor has provided a section 5(2)(a) statement that is, on the face of it, full and correct, but is deliberately false. The security holder should be able to rely on a statement that is ostensibly credible. If a false statement is given by the debtor, section 51B(1)(b) should apply to the debtor, not the security holder. Comment Proposed section 5(2)(a) states that a supply of goods by a creditor exercising its power of sale under a security interest are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity by the debtor unless the supply of those goods would not be a taxable supply if sold by the debtor, and the debtor has provided a statement which correctly states this fact. Where an incorrect statement has been provided by the debtor, section 51B(1)(b) should treat the debtor as a registered person so that they are required to return GST on the sale. However, the current interaction between proposed sections 5(2) and 51B(1)(b) does not necessarily make this entirely clear in the situation when a creditor has relied on a false statement that appeared at the outset to be full and credible. Officials agree that it should be clarified that section 51B(1)(b) applies to treat the debtor as registered (and not the creditor) when the debtor provides a false statement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 166 NO APPORTIONMENT FOR DE MINIMIS EXEMPT USE Clause 314(2) Submission (EY) Clarification is required as to the aim of the proposed amendment as it is not clear what it will really achieve. The Commentary (at pages 98-99) refers to the proposed amendment making it explicit again (to the same effect as the previous section 21(4)) that “the rule removes the need to make adjustments in respect of only exempt supplies (rather than, for example, private use)”. There may be ongoing confusion about what input tax adjustments may be required, when the section 20(3D) de minimis rule may apply and what is intended from a policy perspective. Section 21(2) provides a number of exceptions to the general rule in section 21(1) that adjustments may be required to input tax claims made if there is a percentage difference to the end of an adjustment period in relation to the actual use of items acquired. One exception is when section 20(3D) applies. That section, both as currently enacted and as proposed to be amended, applies only if a person makes both GST-taxable and GST-exempt supplies. On that basis, the section 20(3D) de minimis exception would never apply if a person makes a combination of GST-taxable supplies and private use, but does not make any GST-exempt supplies. If that is the intended position, it should be clarified as the Commentary seems to suggest otherwise. Comment The policy intention is that the section 20(3D) de minimis does not prevent adjustments in cases when the adjustment is due to a change in the ratio of taxable supplies and private use. The de minimis rule should only apply in cases when the person’s input tax adjustment is due to the actual ratio of exempt and taxable supplies being different from the initial estimate (rather than to an adjustment due to private use). This policy intention will be communicated in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. This point may also be considered under a wider review of the apportionment and adjustment rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 167 VALUE OF ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES Clause 318 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter supports the proposed amendment, given it is a more pure outcome from a policy perspective. Comment Officials welcome the submitter’s support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Not supportive of amendment Submission (Deloitte) While the submitter agrees with this change from a pure policy perspective, in this specific case they are not supportive of this change for practical reasons. The proposal would introduce a change in the manner that taxpayers have been making the GST adjustment on entertainment expenses for over 20 years. While the amounts involved are likely to be relatively small for each taxpayer, this proposal would require every single GST registered taxpayer who spends money on entertainment expenses to change the manner in which they perform their annual GST calculation. There is a high chance that a significant number of smaller taxpayers would continue to make the GST adjustment in the manner in which they “did it last year”, and therefore open themselves up to the risk of penalties or audit by Inland Revenue. This is likely to create tension between SME taxpayers and Inland Revenue on a matter that in the larger scheme of the GST Act is not that significant. While this change would be “technically correct”, due to the significant potential practical problems envisaged, and the small amount of GST involved, this proposal should not be enacted. Comment Officials have considered the concerns expressed by submitters and recognise the need for taxpayers to have certainty about how and when the change applies to them. We therefore recommend delaying the date of application to 1 April 2018. This will allow time for an education campaign to take place over a period of several months and thereby reduce the risk of taxpayers being caught unaware by the change. 168 Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Promote new rule Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Submitters are concerned that there will be significant levels of non-compliance with the amended rule, given that it has applied for over 20 years and has been included in various Inland Revenue guides. There is a need for publicity and education around the new rule. Inland Revenue should also exercise leniency if taxpayers do not correctly apply the new rule. Comment An item will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin on the new rule following enactment of the bill. The changes will also be publicised through other channels, and guidance materials will be provided. Officials have suggested delaying the application date, in response to other submissions, to 1 April 2018, which should deal with the leniency issue as there will be period of several months for taxpayers to get up to speed with the change before it takes effect. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) An application date with reference to a specific date rather than the date of enactment would be more appropriate. Given taxpayers must return the GST in the earlier of the month their income tax return is filed or the month it is due to be filed, an application date of 1 April (either 2017 or 2018) would be most appropriate to take into account taxpayers with an extension of time for filing tax returns. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) There may also be taxpayer confusion and uncertainty about when and whether the changed rule applies to them. It should be clear which returns of income will be subject to the changed GST calculations and some time should be allowed to ensure that taxpayers can be made properly aware of the enactment of any change before it applies. The amendments to section 24I(4) should be expressed as applying in relation to supplies deemed to arise in relation to returns of income for the 2016–17 tax year (or some later year if there are expected to be substantial delays in the enactment of the bill). (EY) 169 Comment As the submitters point out, if enactment of the bill occurs before 31 March 2017, there could be many taxpayers who will be affected by the change who (quite legitimately) will not have already filed their income tax returns for the 2015–16 tax year. If the change simply applies to returns filed after the enactment date of the bill, there would therefore be a change in the GST liability relating to the 2015–16 tax year for taxpayers filing after that date compared with others who had already filed their returns. (This is because taxpayers must return the GST in the earlier of the month their income tax return is filed or the month it is due to be filed.) There should not be a difference in GST treatment between groups of taxpayers who are filing for the same period that is based solely on when taxpayers file their returns of income for a past tax year, as this is inequitable. Officials therefore recommend delaying the date of application to 1 April 2018, so that the change applies to taxpayers’ GST returns for taxable periods that fall within or after the 2017–18 year. Th is w ill also allow time for a publicity campaign to take place over a period of several months and thereby reduce the risk of taxpayers being caught unaware by the change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 170 SECONDHAND GOODS AND VARIATION OF PRICE Clause 319 Issue: Time for returning input tax Submission (EY) The time for returning any excessive input tax in relation to supplies of secondhand goods acquired should depend on when the change becomes apparent or known to the registered taxpayer, rather than on when the change occurs. Comment The proposed amendment applies in circumstances when one of the following change events has occurred: • the supply of secondhand goods has been cancelled; • the nature of the supply has been fundamentally varied or altered; • section 11(1)(mb) was incorrectly applied to the treatment of the supply (so that the supply was either zero-rated when it should not have been, or not zero-rated when it should have been); • the previously agreed consideration for that supply of secondhand goods has been altered (for instance, through the offer of a discount); or • the goods (or part of those goods) supplied have been returned to the supplier. This being the case, the date on which the change event occurs should usually be the same date that the change event becomes known to the registered person who contracts with the supplier. Where this is not the case, determining the time for returning excess secondhand goods deductions that a registered person has claimed based on when the change becomes apparent to that person may set the wrong incentives for taxpayers to check the accuracy of the amount of input tax credits claimed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 171 DEFINITION OF “NON-TAXABLE USE” Clause 304(2) Issue: Reference should be to “taxable supplies” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The word “taxable” has been omitted from the definition. The meaning of the phrase in this context should be: “non-taxable use, for goods or services, means use of the goods or services for making exempt supplies or other than for making taxable supplies”. Comment Officials agree that the word “taxable” has been inadvertently omitted from the proposed definition of “non-taxable use”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Input tax deductions for deemed supplies Submission (Deloitte) The submitter expresses some concerns with the proposed definition of “non-taxable use” in clause 304(2). The definition refers to the “use of goods or services for making exempt supplies or other than for making supplies”. Their concern centres around whether this definition could be used to deny an input tax deduction where businesses acquire goods or services for promotional giveaways, prizes and societal impact projects. While these arguably are supplies, defining the term “non-taxable use” in this way places a large emphasis on what is a supply. While supply includes all forms of supplies, the majority of supplies that are provided for no consideration are “deemed” supplies in section 5. This definition may result in input tax for supplies that are not provided for consideration being denied. We note that this definition is not consistent with the use of the term “non-taxable use” in the Commentary to clause 304(2), which refers to non-taxable use as consisting of exempt and private use of an asset. This definition is consistent with the general interpretation of “non- taxable use”. 172 Comment As the submitter points out, supplies provided for no consideration are still supplies (albeit deemed supplies) so taxpayers would still be able to claim input tax in relation to these supplies. It is therefore unnecessary to amend the proposed definition of non-taxable supplies any further beyond the change suggested by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, which will address the second issue raised by the submitter in relation to the inconsistency in the use of the term between the Commentary and the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 173 OTHER GST MATTERS No clause Issue: GST treatment of supplies incorrectly zero-rated Submission (Deloitte) Section 5(23) is not being applied in a manner which is consistent with the wording of the legislation, which currently reads: If section 11(1)(mb) is treated as applying to a supply of goods and, after the date on which the relevant transaction is settled, it is found that the provision does not apply, the recipient of the supply is treated as if they were a supplier making, on the date of settlement, a supply of those goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8(1). Given the large number of property transactions that are undertaken and the substantial value of many of these transactions, having certainty over the GST treatment is causing concern in the market and needs to be resolved urgently. Officials should include a clarification in the bill. Section 5(23) should be amended to read “... treated by the vendor as applying...”, that is, insert the words “by the vendor” to ensure consistent application of the legislation. Given this is a clarification of the law, rather than a change, we recommend that the amended wording apply from 1 April 2011 when the provision was first introduced. Comment The compulsory zero-rating of land (CZR) rules were introduced to help combat “phoenix” fraud whereby a supplier of commercial land absconds or is wound up without returning the GST, but the purchaser (often a related party) is still entitled to a deduction. Under the CZR rules, certain supplies of land must be treated as zero-rated rather than standard rated. The rules do not allow the parties to a land transaction covered by the CZR rules to agree to the GST treatment of the supply, as this would render the zero-rat ing rules ineffective as a means to combat phoenix fraud. The CZR rules therefore operate by requiring the vendor to make a unilateral decision to zero-rate or standard rate the supply of land based on their interpretation of the law. The matter raised by the submitter is complex and should be considered for a later bill. We note that the submission is out of scope of the bill under consideration, and that an attempt to deal w ith this complex issue now through an amendment could lead to unintended consequences. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 174 Issue: Travel insurance and facilitation of services performed offshore Submission (KPMG ) Section 11A(1)(j) previously stated that services can be zero-rated if they involve the arranging of services that are physically performed outside New Zealand. However, the recent change to section 11A(1)(j) as part of the GST on remote services amendments appears to have had the inadvertent consequence of changing this outcome for remote services which relate to something physically done offshore. The arranging of a supply which is physically performed outside New Zealand and which is not itself a remote service should be able to be zero-rated. Section 11A(1)(j) should be amended accordingly to provide for this outcome. Section 11A(1)(f) should be amended so that services in connection with moveable personal property outside of New Zealand are also able to be zero-rated. Given the uncertainty raised by the remote services rule for insurance services, we submit, consistent with the policy intent, that such supplies be clearly zero-rated. A specific amendment to section 11A(1)(d) should be made to cover the insurance of persons and goods while outside New Zealand or in connection with international travel. Comment The policy change referred to in the submission is not an inadvertent one, but is a deliberate policy change to align New Zealand’s GST treatment of remote services supplied by non- residents to New Zealand-resident consumers with the OECD’s VAT/GST Guidelines. This change to the GST framework in the context of remote services does not amount to abandoning the destination principle, but instead is a modification to how the destination principle operates in this context, where the residency of the person who contracts with the supplier is used as a proxy for where the service is consumed. However, officials recognise that there has been a possible overreach in the specific cases of travel insurance and remote services which involve the facilitation or arranging of services that are physically performed offshore (when the services that are being arranged require that the recipient is in the same location as the physical performance of those services – such as an overseas concert or overseas accommodation, for instance). In this particular case, it seems that the insurance or facilitation service should be zero-rated because the underlying service (which is not a remote service) is consumed outside of New Zealand. While we acknowledge the desirability of a speedy response to the issues set out in the submission, we note that the submission is outside the scope of the bill under consideration, and that these are substantive policy issues that have not been consulted on. An attempt to fix these issues through an amendment to this bill could lead to unforeseen consequences. We therefore consider that it would be more appropriate to consider these issues outside of the process of this bill and undertake public consultation at a later date, if necessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 175 Issue: Drafting issues with remote services provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials would like to raise a number of drafting issues with the new cross-border services rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Comment Section 8B(1) and (5) outlines special rules that non-residents must use to determine whether recipients of remote services are New Zealand resident, GST-registered businesses or not. These sections apply to non-resident electronic marketplaces under section 60C. An amendment should be made so they also apply to non-resident non-electronic marketplaces under section 60D. Sections 8B(5), 24(5B) and (5D) mistakenly refer to section 8(4), a provision that allows non- residents to agree with recipients to treat certain supplies as being made in New Zealand. These sections need to be updated to refer to the new section 8(4D) to reflect the fact that non-resident suppliers of remote services can independently choose to zero-rate the supply. The title of the rules that allow non-residents to register and claim back New Zealand GST (sections 54B and 54C) were amended when the new remote services were introduced. The new title refers to certain non-resident suppliers. The new title mislabels the types of non- residents that can register under these rules. This is because in order to qualify under the rules, non-residents cannot make supplies in New Zealand and therefore are not suppliers. The new titles under section 54B and 54C should be amended to remove the reference to suppliers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Resident suppliers and non-resident marketplaces Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 60(1C) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, that treats supplies of remote services by resident suppliers through non-resident marketplaces as two separate supplies, does not operate as intended. An amendment is required to ensure the supply from the resident to the non-resident marketplace is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). Comment New section 60(1C) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, that was introduced as part of the remote services rules, may not apply as intended. The section applies to New Zealand- resident suppliers of remote services that operate through a non-resident marketplace. The new marketplace rules require non-resident marketplaces, and not underlying suppliers to register and return GST on remote services supplied to New Zealand residents. 176 These resident underlying suppliers may already be registered for GST under the standard rules. If these suppliers were subject to the general marketplace rules under new section 60C or 60D, the services they supply through the marketplace would no longer be taxable, as the operator of the marketplace will have been treated as the supplier. This would mean that GST incurred by the underlying supplier in making these supplies would be irrecoverable. To address this issue, section 60(1C) treats the supply of remote services as two separate supplies – a supply of services from the underlying supplier to the operator, and a supply of those services from the operator of the marketplace to the recipient. This will allow the resident underlying supplier to recover the GST costs incurred in making the supply. It was intended that the supply to the marketplace would be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k) (as the supply is made to a non-resident outside New Zealand). However, in some situations the supply may not be zero-rated as the service provided by the marketplace may be received by a person in New Zealand (see the exception to the zero-rating rules under section 11A(2)). This would mean the resident underlying supplier would be required to standard- rate the service to the marketplace and the marketplace would need to recover the GST in their GST return. The supply between the two registered persons will remain GST-neutral. The marketplace, however, will be required to file a full GST return as opposed to the simplified “pay-only” GST return. This may impose some compliance costs on non-resident marketplaces, and consequently, an amendment is required to ensure the supply from the resident to the non- resident marketplace is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exception to requirement to have a bank account in order to obtain an IRD number Submission (Matter raised by officials) A new exception to the requirement to have a bank account in order to obtain an IRD number was introduced when the Residential Land Withholding Tax (RLWT) rules were introduced (see section 24BA(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). The exception was intended to cover non-residents applying for an IRD number in order to register for GST. It is arguable that the wording of the exception may not cover all non-residents applying to register for GST, as the exception refers to a non-resident supplier of goods and services. This is problematic because non-residents applying to register under section 54B are prohibited from making supplies in New Zealand. The exception to the bank account requirement should therefore be amended to remove the reference to a supplier of goods and services. 177 Comment Non-residents can register under section 51 of the GST Act if they carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand. However, registration under section 54B prohibits a non-resident from making taxable supplies in New Zealand. This means that a non-resident who is registered under section 54B is not a supplier of goods and services under the GST Act. Hence, the exception in section 24BA(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not cover non- residents who are registered under section 54B as was intended. The requirement to open a New Zealand bank account (in order to obtain an IRD number) therefore presents a barrier to registration under section 54B for a non-resident who does not make taxable supplies in New Zealand, but who carries on a taxable activity elsewhere in the world. For a non-resident in this category, being unable to register under section 54B means that they cannot claim back the GST incurred on goods and services used in making their worldwide supplies. This results in a GST impost on a business-to-business transaction, which conflicts with the purpose of GST as a tax on final consumption in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 178 Other policy matters 179 180 RELATED PARTIES DEBT REMISSION Clauses 16, 22(1) and (9), 39, 41(1) and (6), 57, 58, 59, 262(17) to (19) and (75), 337, 338, 342 and 343(2) to (5) Issue: Support for the proposal Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC, Russell McVeagh) The tenor of the proposal is supported (and in a number of submissions, strongly supported). Comment Officials welcome support for the proposals. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: The core debt remission rule should be rewritten Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PwC, Russell McVeagh, Staples Rodway) The core rule is complicated and may not achieve its stated purpose. It should be rewritten. Sister companies are given as an example. The submitters suggest that there should be an explicit wholly owned group company rule, and the pari passu and other situations be dealt with separately. Comment Officials agree that the core rule may be, upon reflection, trying to do too much too briefly and is therefore unnecessarily complicated. Further, it may not work as intended. It can be restructured so that it is clearer and its application is more certain. For example, the rewritten provision could deal separately with: • if the debtor (borrower) and the creditor (lender) are in the same wholly owned group of companies, except when the remission results in a transfer of value from a New Zealand company or CFC to a foreign shareholder of the New Zealand company; • where the creditor owner(s) (directly or indirectly) of the debtor (company, look- through company, partnership or limited partnership) all contemporaneously remit debt pari passu with ownership (in proportion to, or pro rata with ownership); 181 • where the creditor is associated with the owner the pari passu rule will continue to apply when the creditor: – is in the same wholly owned group of companies as the owner (with the same caveats about transfers of value to non-residents); or – is a person who, if they had advanced the loan to the owner, could forgive the debt tax free for natural love and affection under section EW 44. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Partial or full debt remission Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) It should be made clear that the proposed core rule deals with partial debt remission as well as full debt remission. Comment Given the deemed loan repayment concept inherent in the core rule, officials agree th is is conceptually correct and will produce the intended outcome later when the debt ceases and the base price adjustment is performed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Pari passu debt should be measured when remitted Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh, Staples Rodway) The pari passu rule should measure debt that is remitted, not total owner debt held. Comment The intention was to require the debt to be pari passu at all times, but further consideration suggests this is a step too far, and as long as it is remitted pari passu, this satisfies the proportionality requirement. Officials agree with the submission. 182 Further, this should be extended so that when owners contemporaneously remit debt, to the extent that debt is pari passu, the debt remission rule should apply. This could be particularly relevant when look-through companies or partnerships are wound up. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Pari passu examples Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) Examples of the application of the proposed pari passu rule should, in the core rule, be included in guidance provided by Inland Revenue. Comment This point will be addressed in the Tax Information Bulletin that details the application of the changes in the bill following enactment. A number of examples are planned. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification – “terms of art” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, Russell McVeagh) A number of the “terms of art” (such as “direct ownership interest and ownership interest” and “member debt”) in the core rule should be clarified. Comment Officials agree. Rewriting the core rule as proposed in the analysis of the previous submission should address this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 183 Issue: Nominal shareholdings Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Nominal shareholdings should be ignored when calculating ownership and debt percentages. Comment Nominal shareholdings, especially in the context of family companies, are common. When they are truly nominal they should be ignored – the model for this is the 3% criteria allowed by section IC 4(2) (employee shares in wholly owned group companies), but this would also need to pick up nominal holdings of shareholder-employee salary access shares, which should also be ignored. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of means of debt remission Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp) The term “the means by which debt is forgiven is immaterial” should be clarified. Comment The term is copied (with minor amendment) from long-standing section EW 44 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (which deals with debt forgiven for natural love and affection). Given that it has not caused problems in that context, officials believe it is sufficient ly clear. However, this point will be addressed in the Tax Information Bulletin that details the application of the changes in the bill following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 184 Issue: The scope of the core rule should be wider Submiss ion (KPMG ) The scope of the debt remission rule should be wider and should include: • family trusts; and • situations when the owner debt is not pari passu with ownership. Comment The proposals have always only concerned owner debt that is pari passu with ownership. Given the scope, debt remission by family trusts is excluded (except where they are owners and creditors of the debtor). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The scope of the debt to which the core rule applies Submission (Staples Rodway) The core debt remission rule should apply more widely and to different types of debt, including trade creditors and current accounts. Comment Officials understand the point the submitter is making, but note that at this late stage it would add a significant degree of complexity, and may not be able to be adequately reflected in legislation anyway. Further, the consultation to date has been directed at financial arrangements only. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 185 Issue: Available subscribed capital Submission ( PwC, EY, Matter raised by officials) The proposal to allow a debtor who gains from a debt remission to have available subscribed capital (ASC) of the amount of debt that is remitted is too broad. ( PwC) When the debtor receives ASC as a result of the debt remission, the owner or the creditor should get cost base for that investment. (EY) When the debt remission does not lead to ASC, the debtor’s gain should not be regarded as a capital profit. (Matter raised by officials) Comment ASC is share capital of a company that, in appropriate circumstances, can be returned tax-free to shareholders. For example, when a person subscribes $100 cash for shares issued by a company, the company can attribute $100 ASC to those shares. This means their redemption, on liquidation, or in other appropriate circumstances, is not regarded as being a dividend and is therefore tax-free. When a direct or indirect shareholder that is owed money by a company remits that debt, it is equivalent to that shareholder subscribing for more shares and the proposed amendment does this. However when the creditor that forgives the debt is not a direct or indirect shareholder in the debtor (for example, sister companies or inside a wholly owned group of companies) this is less appropriate. This is particularly the case when the debt remission is between sister companies that are owned by a non-resident or persons not in the same wholly owned group of companies as the sister companies. We agree with the submission that when ASC is created, the owner should receive an uplift in their carrying cost of their shareholding in the debtor. If a debt remission does not result in ASC, it should also not result in the debtor receiving a capital profit as this could lead to the artificial conversion of retained earnings (taxable on distribution) into capital gains (it can, in appropriate circumstances, be returned tax-free). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Available subscribed capital Submission (E Y, K PMG) The proposal to allow a debtor who gains from a debt remission to have available subscribed capital (ASC), while conceptually correct, is not technically effective and should be refined. 186 Comment Officials agree with the technical points made in the submission and recommend that the ASC be attributed to the class of shares that the shareholder owns (either directly or indirectly) that carries the most rights in the company. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Dividend if remission of debt owed by foreign debtor Clause 16 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) The proposed wholly owned group dividend adjustments when debt owed by a shareholder is forgiven should be limited to prevent cross-border opportunities. Comment Officials agree that the remission of debt owed by a foreign shareholder in a New Zealand creditor company should continue to be taxed as a dividend. We recommend an amendment to the proposed exception to section CD 5(2) so that it applies when: • the dividend is derived by a company that is resident in New Zealand or a subsidiary thereof wheresoever resident; and • is derived from a company that is in the same wholly-owned group of companies as the recipient at the time the dividend is derived. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The dividend exclusion Submission (Russell McVeagh) The dividend exclusion should be widened beyond the wholly owned group company exclusion proposed. There are unusual circumstances in which a qualifying debt remission could result in a dividend under section CD 27 and this is inappropriate. 187 Comment In the time available officials have been unable fully analyse this complex and technical issue. However, we will continue to analyse this and if further amendments are appropriate we will recommend that they be done, retrospectively if necessary. Liaison with the submitter will continue. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Wholly owned group dividend exemption Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Section CW 10(4) should be repealed as it is now redundant. Comment Officials agree that section CW 10(4) should be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Accrued and unpaid interest and bad debts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposed approach of deeming accrued and unpaid interest to be paid is inappropriate. Alternat ively, such an approach should be prospective only, as it is a fundamental change. Comment The primary submission results from the proposal to deem loans that are remitted to be repaid (and often the proceeds will be deemed to be reinvested in the debtor as equity). This is largely a cross-border issue. Appropriate cross-border rules (thin capitalisation, transfer pricing and non-resident withholding tax (NRWT)) apply to govern interest expense incurred by New Zealand subsidiaries of overseas companies. The approach of deeming the repayment reinforces the NRWT aspects of these rules. 188 However, officials agree that the alternative submission has merit and, as is reflected in the bad debt amendment, it was not intended to apply this aspect (the deemed interest income) retrospectively, and therefore it should apply from 1 April 2017. Recommendation That the alternative submission be accepted. Issue: Limiting the application of the bad debt rule amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amendment to the bad debt rule (to limit the deduction for a bad debt for interest accrued) should be limited to situations when the debtor has obtained a tax deduction in New Zealand – that is, the debtor is New Zealand-resident. Comment Officials agree w ith the submission as it addresses inappropriate tax deductions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Refocusing the bad debt rule amendment Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Matter raised by officials) The proposed bad debt amendment should be refocused given the proposed change to the core debt remission rule, which we propose will now focus on pro rata debt remitted, instead of pro rata debt held and remitted. (Matter raised by officials) The rule, as drafted, technically does not work. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Associated persons can only claim a bad debt deduction for interest accrued (not principal). Typically this claim will be made before any debt remission, and so cannot be guided by that remission. The proposed bad debt amendment is primarily intended to address situations when the debt and creditor can, between them, claim two deductions and only have one amount of income. The debtor claims an interest deduction, and the creditor returns the interest income and as well takes a deduction for a bad debt. Examples of this include situations when the owner is the creditor and the entity (a company, look-through company, partnership or limited partnership) is the debtor. 189 This is especially inappropriate given the tenor of the proposed debt remission rule, which, if it applies, will deem the interest to be paid so that there is no bad debt. The proposed bad debt amendment as introduced focuses on situations when the debt is held pro rata to ownership. As noted above, submitters recommended (and officials agree) that the core debt remission rule should focus on debt that is remitted pro rata to ownership, not debt held pro rata to ownership. The proposed bad debt amendment should be consequentially amended. The simplest way to do this is to replace the bad debt pro rata requirement with an extension to the associated person denial of a deduction for a bad debt on principal to cover interest. This will also address the technical matter raised by the New Zealand Law Society. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The denial of the bad debt deduction should not proceed Submission (Chapman Tripp) The amendment to the bad debt rule to limit the deduction for a bad debt for interest accrued should not proceed. Comment This amendment is primarily intended to address situations when associated persons can claim two deductions and only have one amount of income as discussed above. The submitter seemingly has no objection to this intention. A by-product of this will be that taxpayers will have to take care not to overload a company with debt where the company (or its group members) cannot use the interest deduction (that is, they are in a loss position). For direct inbound investment this is not relevant as the non- resident creditor is not subject to New Zealand’s bad debt deduction rules. However, the transfer pricing, thin capitalisation and NRWT rules address this. But, and this is the point the submitter is making, there will be some situations when a shareholder/creditor is an associated person and other shareholders/creditors may not be. If the associated person is New Zealand-resident this may appropriately constrain the debtor’s interest deduction in some circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 190 Issue: Clarification of the proposed bad debt deduction amendment Submission (EY) The amendment is incorrectly framed. Comment The refocusing of the bad debt amendment as above addresses this concern. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The amalgamation rules should be consequentially amended Submission (Chapman Tripp) The amalgamation rules, which contain specific debt valuation and remission rules, should be consequentially amended. Comment Officials agree as this follows the core amendment proposals. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of NRWT to deemed debt repayment Submission ( PwC) Existing legis lat ion should be checked to ensure that appropriate NRWT is payable on any deemed repayment that includes interest. Comment We agree that a further amendment is necessary to ensure the correct outcome. This should apply from the commencement of the 2017–18 tax year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 191 Issue: Debt guarantees Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY) The debt guarantee proposal should be reconsidered in situations when the guarantor explicitly has no recourse to the debtor. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposed debt guarantee amendments should be clarified as to both scope and the reference to “creditor’s associate”. (EY) Comment The key issue here is the guarantor obtaining an inappropriate deduction for a pay-out under the guarantee in inappropriate circumstances. Allied with this is that often the guarantor will not be solvent and therefore will not be able to pay any tax due on the debt remission caused by the guarantor meeting their obligations. This leaves a one-sided result of a net deduction. For example, when the guarantor is in the same wholly owned group of companies, the guarantee pay-out is just the group as a whole repaying the loan or, alternatively, the group buying the creditor’s interest in the loan – either way the guarantor should not obtain a tax deduction. The analysis is similar to the bad debt deduction. Under these bad debt rules a bad debt deduction for a bad loan is available to a person who is in the business of lending and who is not associated with the debtor. When the guarantor is associated with the debtor there should be no deduction for a guarantee pay-out. Further, given the ability that exists to argue that anyone can obtain a guarantee pay- out deduction, such deductions are logically limited to guarantors who are in the business of offering such guarantees. This preserves the capital revenue boundary appropriately. Under a traditional financial guarantee, if called, the guarantor ends up with a bundle or rights in the debtor. This bundle can logically be characterised as a loan “owned” by the guarantor. Financial reporting would consider that there is a loan from the guarantor to the original debtor. However, if the guarantor has no recourse it is reasonable to conclude that the original loan has ended. When the guarantor is an associated person of the debtor and has recourse we propose that the debt-parking treatment apply – that is, the loan is treated as having been repaid by the debtor at the amount the guarantor paid the original creditor and that a new loan for the same amount is deemed to exist. When the guarantor is an associated person of the debtor but has no recourse we propose that the debtor’s loan is deemed to come to an end with a payment equal to the amount the guarantor paid to the original creditor. Both of these treatments could produce base price adjustment income to the debtor – conceptually this is correct. 192 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date Submission ( PwC) The application date of the changes to the Income tax Act 2007 should be further backdated to the commencement of the 2006–07 tax year. Comment We have discussed this submission with the submitter and they have agreed that it should not be considered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 193 LOSS GROUPING AND IMPUTATION CREDITS Clauses 167, 175, 180 to 182, 186, 187(4) and 188(4) Issue: Support for proposals Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) Submitters expressed their support for the proposal, which will remove a tax inefficiency and ensure that, when there are good commercial reasons to retain minority shareholders in a company on a takeover, the group will not be disadvantaged from a tax perspective. Comment Officials welcome the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: 66 percent commonality for loss grouping Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Tax losses can only be offset between companies when there is at least 66 percent commonality of shareholders. When there is control by a group of shareholders they should be allowed to offset tax losses. That is, the 66 percent test should be reduced down to where the common shareholders have more than 50 percent of the two companies. Comment Changing this threshold would be a large project that would require significant resources and is not currently on the Tax Po licy Work Programme. Officials note there are also arguments that this threshold should be raised rather than lowered and that a number of other countries, including Australia, allow loss grouping only within wholly owned groups. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 194 Issue: Drafting of section OB 83(5) Submission (EY) Proposed section OB 83(5)(d) prescribes a continuity period to run “from the end of the income year in which the tax loss is made available...” while the proposed section OB 83(5)(e) requires the imputation credit transfer to occur in a period of four income years “beginning from the end of the income year in which the election is made”. Elections to transfer losses are not generally made within the income year to which they relate and are applicable, but are usually made within the following income year as part of the preceding year income tax return preparation and filing process. We assume the proposed continuity period requirements and the four-year period are intended to run from the end of the income year for which the losses are used, rather than from the end of the following (or later) income year when elections are actually made and notified to the Commissioner. On that basis we suggest the word “for” be substituted for the word “in” so that section 83(5)(d) and (e) would respectively read “from the end of the income year for which the tax loss is made available...” and “beginning from the end of the income year for which the election is made”. Comment As noted by the submitter the four-year period is intended to be from the end of the income year the loss offset and imputation transfer relate to rather than the following year in which the election is made. For example, a loss offset and imputation transfer relating to the year ended 31 March 2018 may be filed with the income tax return on 31 March 2019 and the four-year period to pay a dividend would expire on 31 March 2022. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Agreement between companies and irrevocability of elections Submission (EY) The Commentary to the bill states that elections to make imputation credit transfers will be irrevocable (at page 110) and that the profit company, loss company and imputation source company (if applicable) must all agree to undertake an imputation credit transfer (at page 112). The provisions as currently drafted in the bill do not appear to specify such requirements. Stipulating irrevocability would not seem to be consistent with the flexibility as to timing and amounts provided by the proposed section OB 83(5)(e) and OB 83(7), nor with the possibility of failing to meet the ongoing grouping and shareholder continuity criteria or to transfer all credits with in the proposed four-year period. We assume any imputation credits that have not been transferred pursuant to a section OB 83 election within the four-year period would 195 simply remain with their source company. Clarification and confirmation would be desirable as to intended requirements and as to the consequences of full or partial failure to transfer elected credits. Comment Officials consider it unnecessary to make the elections irrevocable as the election is the amount given by the formula in proposed section OB 83(3) where all variables are determined by the numbers in the income tax return. Once this election has been made the group continues to have control over the number of imputation credits transferred and attached to dividends up to the maximum amount given by the election. As noted by the submitter any credits not transferred by the end of the four-year period will remain with the source company. Including a requirement that all parties must agree to the imputation credit transfer added a further unnecessary step. Officials expect that a commonly owned group would already take each party’s individual circumstances into account and would only make an imputation credit transfer election when they decided it was worthwhile to do so. Th is policy is already reflected in the proposed legislation and will be incorporated into guidance provided in the Tax Information Bulletin once the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Imputation shopping rules Submission (EY) Clauses 180 to 182 propose amending sections OB 71, OB 72 and OB 72B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Proposed new sections OB 71(1)(c) and OB 72(2)(c) refer to a non-wholly owned group situation when “company A has transferred imputation credits under section OB 83 to a company in the former group”. Proposed new section OB 72B(1)(ab) refers to a similar situation when “the ICA company has transferred imputation credits under section OB 83 to a company in the former group”. Under proposed section OB 83, the company which would transfer the imputation credits would not necessarily be the loss company and there may be a time lapse between the initial election and any or all transfers. It should be clarified and confirmed that: (a) The proposed section OB 71(1)(c) and OB 72(2)(c) references to “company A” and the proposed section OB 72B(1)(ab) reference to “the ICA company” are intended to refer to the company that actually transfers the imputation credits; and (b) The relevant circumstance is the actual transfer of the credits by that company, rather than the making of any election by the loss company that credits be transferred. 196 Comment The submitter is correct that references in sections OB 71(1)(c) and OB 72(2)(c) to “company A” and section OB 72B(1)(ab) to “the ICA company” are intended to refer to the company that actually transfers the imputation credits. The company that transfers the imputation credits will have recorded an imputation credit account debit when the credits are transferred so is the only company in the former group that could benefit by entering into an imputation credit shopping arrangement if not for these, and other, anti-avoidance provisions. Proposed sections OB 71(1)(c), OB 72(2)(c) and OB 72B(1)(ab) only apply when imputation credits have been transferred. This transfer only occurs, under proposed section OB 83(6), when an imputed dividend is paid. Until the dividend is paid and the transfer occurs the imputation credit shopping rules will not apply solely due to an election under proposed section OB 83(1). Officials consider the sections proposed in the bill already achieve this result. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Māori authorities Submission (KPMG ) The proposal should be extended to Māori authorit ies, which have similar mechanisms to imputation, as they face similar issues. A similar problem exists for Māori authorities, particularly in a sister company situation, when a Māori authority is the parent and owns more than 66 percent of a profit company and a loss company. There would be an imputation shortfall if the Māori authority is the recipient of a dividend and if it is unable to transfer credits to make up for the imputation credit shortfall. Māori authorities should be able to make an imputation credit transfer (this would create the relevant debit and credit entries in its Māori authority credit account) to a profit company on behalf of a loss company. This would then allow the profit company to pay a fully imputed dividend to the Māori authority and any minority shareholders. Comment As a Māori authority cannot transfer losses to a non-Māori authority this submission relates to two non-Māori authority sister companies owned by a Māori authority. As a Māori authority does not maintain an imputation credit account, it would be necessary for them to transfer Māori authority credits and treat them as imputation credits. While existing provisions convert imputation credits to Māori authority credits, there is no equivalent provision to convert them in the other direction. 197 Further complications arise due to the profit company being taxed at 28%, whereas the Māori authority would only be taxed at 17.5%. Consequently, if credits were transferred at 17.5% the profit company would not have sufficient credits to fully impute the dividend, which would be particularly relevant to any minority shareholders that were not Māori authorities. If the credits were transferred at 28%, this would allow the Māori authority to shelter additional income above the dividend. While the payment of an imputed dividend to a Māori authority (or an individual taxed at less than 28%) will always have this result in this case, the credits would be more valuable when received by the Māori authority than when they originally transferred them. Therefore, officials do not recommend the extension of these proposals to Māori authorities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Four-year time bar Submission (KPMG ) We understand the rationale for the four-year time limit is to align with the statute bar. This is not a valid comparison. Assuming the minimum 66 percent shareholding commonality is met between the time of loss grouping and the imputation credit transfer, there should be no time-based restriction – particularly if the loss company is required to provide information to Inland Revenue at the time the imputation credits are transferred. Comment Officials agree there is no direct link between the four-year statute bar and a four-year limit for completing an imputation credit transfer. The four-year statute bar was chosen as an acceptable period after which to draw a line and move on. The same arguments can be made for an imputation credit transfer. We also consider having a time limit will simplify monitoring of these transfers by both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consolidated imputation groups Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) There are rules that apply to ICA companies, but there are no equivalent sections to apply the same rule to consolidated imputation groups. This can give rise to issues if the ICA company has a nil balance and all imputation credits are instead recognised in the consolidated imputation group. 198 In particular, section OB 72B (Limit on using entitlement to refund after joining wholly owned group) is part of the imputation credit shopping rules in sections OB 71 to OB 72. Section OB 72B applies to an “ICA company” and refers to the credit balance of the “ICA company’s imputation credit account”. There is no equivalent section to section OB 72B for ICA companies that are part of a consolidated imputation group. Section OP 6 (Provisions applying to consolidated imputation groups) requires certain provisions to be applied as if the company referred to was the consolidated imputation group. It explicit ly lists sections OB 71 and OB 72, but does not mention section OB 72B. There does not appear to be any policy rationale for section OP 72B not to have a consolidated group overlay. The imputation credit shopping rules in sections OB 71 and OB 72 were introduced with application from November 2004 and section OB 72B was only introduced with effect from March 2010. We therefore consider that it is likely that the extension of section OP 6 to section OB 72B was overlooked in the drafting and section OB 72B should equivalently apply to consolidated imputation groups. An equivalent of section OB 72B should be included in subpart OP to apply to consolidated imputation groups. A similar issue also arises in section OB 62 (Retrospective attachment of imputation credits) when the provision only refers to the “company’s imputation credit account” and does not refer to the consolidated group imputation credit account which the company has access to. Section OB 62(3) should apply based on the credit balance of the consolidated imputation group’s imputation credit account if the company is a member of a consolidated imputation group. There may be other provisions in subpart OB (company imputation credit accounts) that should be extended for companies in consolidated imputation groups in subpart OP. We recommend a review is undertaken in this regard. Comment Officials agree that, in most instances, there is no policy rationale for a consolidated imputation group to be treated differently to an ICA company. The submitters have identified a number of problems with consolidated imputation groups, both within the existing legislation and the loss grouping and imputation credit proposals in the bill, and suggested that a review should be undertaken. A review cannot be undertaken within the timeframe of the select committee process but officials note this could be considered for inclusion on the Tax Policy Work Programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 199 REMISSION INCOME, TAX LOSSES AND INSOLVENT INDIVIDUALS Clause 121 Issue: Pre-discharge tax losses Submission (EY) Pre-discharge losses should remain available for use in relation to shortfall penalties that may relate to the period before the “loss cancellation date” or to any income which may be derived prior to that date. Comment Officials consider the circumstances on which the submission is based are unlikely to occur. In relation to a bankrupt person, the Commissioner is obliged, under the Tax Administration Act 1994, to write off debts for tax that have been proved in bankruptcy. In this context tax includes shortfall penalties. Officials agree that the proposals clarify that the bankrupt must attend to all income tax obligations during the period of bankruptcy. However, those actions remain subject to the oversight of the Official Assignee. This is because one of the roles of the Official Assignee is to ensure that a bankrupt does not incur additional debt that cannot be paid during bankruptcy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of commencement date Submission (EY) Clarificat ion is required of the commencement date for proposed section 42C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as to which tax year it first applies. Comment Inland Revenue’s practice is that a bankrupt is already required to file a return of income up to the date of bankruptcy and a separate return of income for all periods during bankruptcy. The proposed amendment only codifies existing practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 200 Issue: Tax treatment of property and unallocated deductions on adjudication of bankruptcy Submission (EY) Clause 78 should be revised to: (i) remove the reference to “words before paragraph (a)” as there is no paragraph (a) in current section FC 2(1); (ii) amend section FC 2(3) to ensure that the provisions in the proposed new section FC 10 will override the general section FC 2(1) market value rule in bankruptcy situations; (iii) clarify who derives any income, can claim any relevant deductions, and is required to file returns post-adjudication or Court approval of any relevant procedure under Part 5 of the Insolvency Act 2006. Comment Officials agree that submissions (i) and (ii) correctly identify cross-reference errors in the drafting. Under the Insolvency Act 2006, income earned during bankruptcy is property that vests in the Official Assignee, subject to the common law reservation that income required for personal maintenance is retained by the bankrupt. The Official Assignee’s practice recognises this common law principle and generally employment income is permitted to be retained by the bankrupt. Officials consider that the Official Assignee’s practice is based on the common law, and is intended to have the effect that the employment income is derived by the bankrupt. Therefore, officials consider no further legislative clarification is necessary. Other non-bankruptcy procedures under the Insolvency Act 2006 do not result in income earned by an insolvent person who is not bankrupt being property of the Official Assignee. As a result, no clarification is required. Recommendation That submissions (i) and (ii) be accepted. That submission (iii) be declined. 201 AIRCRAFT OVERHAUL EXPENSES: DEDUCTIBILITY AND TIMING Clauses 28, 37, 42, 43, 47, 53, 72, 74 to 76, 262(2), (95) and (111) Issue: The “as incurred” method should be retained Submission (Airwork Holdings Limited, Aviation New Zealand Limited) The “as incurred” method: • should be retained as it is consistent with the general deductibility and timing rules of the Income Tax Act 2007; • is well-known and understood by taxpayers; • is simple to apply and carries the lowest compliance cost compared with other methods; and • presents no fiscal cost when compared with the status quo. There is nothing special about aircraft and aircraft engines that warrants the current ability to deduct overhaul expenditure being taken away on the basis of economic purity. Comment Background to the proposals The proposed spreading rules in the bill arose from the withdrawal of a long-standing technical ruling of the Commissioner that permitted aircraft operators to use provisions for future overhaul expenses to calculate and time deductions for aircraft overhaul expenses (a spreading method). This ruling was withdrawn because case law arising since that ruling was issued held that provisions of this nature do not satisfy the legal test of deductibility. A review of the timing of deductions for aircraft overhaul expenses, including targeted consultation, was undertaken to determine an appropriate policy for the deductibility and timing of aircraft overhaul expenses. This review identified that: • all aircraft operators are required by Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regu lat ions to keep records of maintenance and overhaul requirements and time in service for each aircraft’s system modules, parts and components; • about 61 percent of SME aircraft operators used this information to determine their deductions in each year using the provisioning method permitted under the now- withdrawn technical ruling; • of the other 39 percent of operators in the SME sector, many used the information from their CAA record-keeping requirements in planning the timing of their overhauls and associated cash outflows; • allowing deductions for provisions of future expenses is inconsistent with broad base, low rate (BBLR) tax settings, which generally do not permit provisions for future expenses to be deductible; 202 • provisions are generally used in accounting to recognise the decline in value of assets that are not recorded in the balance sheet (which is not the case for most aircraft operators in New Zealand); and • a technical issue raised in submissions was whether the cost of restoring a major aircraft system to full operational life was capital in nature. The proposals address this by overriding the capital limitation on deductibility. This is acknowledged in discussion with Airwork Hold ing Lim ited as being a helpful clarification. The initial consultation involved an officials’ letter provided to some IFRS taxpayers, the Aviation Industry Association Inc. (now Aviation New Zealand), and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and state agencies involved with the aviation sector. Submitters favoured introducing legislation to implement a timing regime outside the depreciation rules to better match aircraft overhaul expenses with revenue earned as the aircraft is flown. Main points made by submitters during the initial consultation phase included: • An aircraft operator suffers loss and expense as an aircraft is flown, and agree that this is reflected in the economics of aircraft maintenance. • Tax deductions for major aircraft overhaul expenses should be appropriately matched to revenues earned. • The policy review of deductibility and timing of aircraft overhaul expenses should be restricted to overhaul of aircraft engines. • It is intended that the aggregate amount of the cost of the maintenance value at acquisition and the cost of subsequent overhauls would be spread by a single appropriate use measure (time, hours on wing or flight cycles) determined by each operator according to their individual circumstances and each aircraft type’s actual experience. Accordingly, these points were reflected in the proposals in the bill, as follows: – Use of examples in the Commentary on the bill. – The proposed approach allows taxpayers to adjust their rate of amortisation if the appropriate use measure changes due to high levels of use (for example, from time to hours, as noted by KPMG in its submission). – It allows taxpayers to choose the level of compliance for determining the amounts to be spread for each tax year from acquisition or after an overhaul. – It is consistent with BBLR settings for timing rules (including depreciation) in the Income Tax Act, and gives an accelerated deduction for the maintenance value at acquisition compared to current law. – It is not intended that a taxpayer should amortise the cost for each single component or part in a taxpayer’s asset management register. It is unclear whether the submitter is referring to an overhaul of an engine or lift and propulsion system of a helicopter or the replacement of limited life parts. During consultation, it was clear that taxpayers were already identifying the total cost of the overhaul of an aircraft engine (fixed wing aircraft) and for each of the lift and propulsion systems of a helicopter. The proposals in the bill are to amortise those total costs and not to require identification of individual life-limited parts and the cost of their replacement. For taxpayers currently using the “as incurred” method, the main compliance impact is to spread that total overhaul cost on a use basis. Taxpayers and advisors engaging with officials during the consultation process indicated this does not carry a high compliance cost. 203 – The timing of deductions for replacing life-limited parts is intended to be determined under the general deductibility and timing rules, which is the same as the current law. – Officials can explain this d ist inction in a future Tax Information Bulletin to ease any concerns about compliance impact. • Accounting methodologies for spreading expenses are well understood, and are consistent with the record-keeping required by the CAA. • Tax depreciation for aircraft and the “as incurred” method of timing deductions for overhaul expenses taken together do not appropriately reflect the real decline in value of some overhaul components as an aircraft is used. • For small and medium-size aircraft operators, appropriate matching of major aircraft overhaul expenses in financial reporting enables more informed financial and business decision-making. • Many aircraft operators use their accounting systems to forecast and predict when overhauls are required and the expected cash outflow for each overhaul and for the replacement of components that must be replaced at specific points in their use (time, hours on wing or flight cycles). • Unexpired time left on overhaul/time-life components are taken into account in valuing an aircraft in the marketplace and it would be appropriate for taxation rules to recognise this effect. • Aviation New Zealand and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand submitted that a consistent timing frameworks for overhaul expenditure was desirable, but that a threshold should be set to allow some operators to elect for the “as incurred” method. This is provided for by permitting single-aircraft operators to elect out of the spreading method. We note that Airwork Holdings Limited acknowledges the proposed spreading method is consistent with the economic effect of maintenance of engines. The nature of overhaul costs for aircraft Airwork Ho ldings Limited considers there is nothing unique about aircraft and aircraft engines that warrants moving from the “as incurred” basis. As noted earlier, we estimate about 61 percent of aircraft operators already use a spreading basis for timing overhaul deductions, and that they favour a timing regime that appropriately recognises the varying rates of decline in value of major overhaul systems from acquisition of the aircraft. The safety rules contained in CAA regulations are rigorous and differ significantly from other sectors in the economy, including the marine and rail sectors. The safety systems in those sectors were analysed during the policy review, and identified that a major distinction in the safety regulations is that aircraft operators are required to restore major systems to full operational capacity on a cyclical basis based on a use measure such as time, flying hours, flight cycles or the earlier of a combination of any two or more of those measures. Analysis of industry data identified that these systems are restored over time periods ranging from 5 to 12 years, depending on the system. This requirement to restore major systems to full operational capacity is not a feature of safety regulations in either of the marine or the rail sectors. 204 By way of example, we noted that KiwiRail’s 2014 annual report stated that ships in its fleet are dry-docked at two-yearly intervals for regular maintenance, mainly involving scraping and painting of the hull, and a survey of the ships systems by a certified marine surveyor. The role of the surveyor is to ensure the ship is seaworthy, or if not, to identify from the survey which repairs to the ship are necessary. Analysis also identified that ship’s engines are generally maintained on an on-condition basis rather than requiring a restoration to full operational performance. Deductions for on-condition maintenance are timed under the general tim ing rules and this is the same treatment that applies to aircraft on-condition maintenance. Analysis of the economics of aircraft maintenance indicated that the value of overhaul systems included in an aircraft at acquisition decline at different rates from the tax depreciation rate (7% SL 3 in the graph). This is illustrated in Graph 1 (using maintenance data profile from an Airbus A320). Graph 1: Decline in value of overhaul components for an Airbus A320 compared w ith tax depreciation (SL) An overhaul is defined in CAA regulations as the process of dismantling, testing and reassembly in which the system is restored to full operational capacity. After an overhaul, the aircraft is returned to service with an airworthiness certificate. Following our analysis of submissions on the initial consultation, we carried out further consultation on implementation and compliance issues. Those consulted agreed that: • The “as incurred” method does not appropriately recognise the decline in value of overhaul components from acquisition. • It is appropriate to adopt a spreading regime to match the cost of overhaul components at acquisition and subsequent overhauls with revenue earned as the aircraft is flown if the cost is significant and the period between overhauls is relat ively long-dated. 3 Straight line depreciation method. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Acq61218 Engine module Airframe Limited Life Parts Landing Gear Auxiliary Power Unit Tax depn SL % years 205 • Each aircraft engine overhaul for a fixed-wing aircraft and the overhaul of each helicopter lift and propulsion systems were a significant cost relative to the value of the aircraft as a whole and that it was appropriate to amortise the total cost of each overhaul to match expenses with revenue earned. • “Non-engine” overhaul costs and replacement of limited life components for all aircraft (apart from rotor blade replacement in helicopters) and on-condition maintenance were not a significant cost relative to the value of the aircraft as a whole and that it was appropriate to allow these to be deducted on the basis of “as incurred”. • Overhauls may occur on an unscheduled basis because of damage and unamortised deductions should be expensed at that time. This is consistent with the concept of loss on disposal used in the depreciation rules. • For compliance cost reasons, we agreed with submitters to restrict any policy recommendations on the spreading of deductions for overhauls to the aircraft engine and helicopter lift and propulsion systems. This is on the basis that the actual costs are either: – relatively low compared with the value of the aircraft as a whole, and that the timing of these deductions are not significant to financial and business management decision making; or – are sufficiently long dated that the tax depreciation curve gives a reasonable rate of depreciation (for example, life-limited parts and landing gear). Compliance and fiscal impact Airwork Ho ldings Limited submits that the “as incurred” method has a neutral compliance and fiscal impact. Officials do not agree with this view. Analysis shows that approximately 61 percent of taxpayers would be required to change their tax accounting method from a spreading method to the “as incurred” method. On this point, Aviation New Zealand submitted during consultation that one-off compliance costs would occur to ensure relevant information was recorded for financial and business management decision-making reasons as follows: The operators would need to extend their fixed asset schedule to reflect a detailed breakdown of components and presumably they are depreciated over its finite life period. \[A\] d ifficu lty arises w ith on-condition components and overhauled components verses replacement. IFRS taxpayers submitted that IFRS results for engine overhaul components should be able to be used for tax purposes to reduce compliance costs rather than using the “as incurred” approach. They agreed this would mean tax depreciation would be based on a lower value for the aircraft as the engine components that received a faster rate of depreciation outside the depreciation regime should not be part of the depreciable asset. We also consider that adopting the “as incurred” method would impact on tax imposts for taxpayers as follows (again this is consistent with submissions made during the consultation process): • fluctuating taxable incomes would arise, resulting in under- and overpayments of tax in tax years between overhauls; and • operators would be exposed to the estimation provisional tax regime and its associated underestimation penalties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 206 Issue: Spreading method Submission (Airwork Holdings Limited, Aviation New Zealand Limited) • The spreading method does not require legislative provisions specific only to aircraft engines, rather generic and flexible change can be implemented under the existing tax depreciation rules. • The spreading method should be available for aircraft hulls, engines, landing gear and other major components, all of which are subject to the same civil aviation maintenance requirements and require significant overhaul expenditure. • All taxpayers should have the choice of whether to use the spreading method or another method. Comment The tax depreciation rules require the use of a single rate of deprecation applied to either an individual asset or a pool of assets. This depreciation rate is set by reference to an estimated useful life, on an asset by asset basis, which is set by the Commissioner. Addressing spreading for aircraft overhaul components (or for aircraft engines and helicopter lift and propulsion systems) would require the Commissioner to set estimated useful lives for a wide range of aviation systems, based on aircraft type and individual unit performance instead of by reference to changes in asset prices (as is currently the case). This suggested approach carries a very high administrative cost on an ongoing basis as the rates are not set by reference to market prices for the individual components but by performance measures and manufacturer-recommended thresholds for performing an overhaul. In contrast, the spreading rules proposed in clause 53 provide for the flexibility suggested in this submission. This is recognised in the submission by KPMG on behalf of Helicopters New Zealand, seeking more certainty that the proposed spreading rule provides the envisaged flexibility. The submission by KPMG sets out an example that illustrates this intended flexibility under the spreading rule. This flexibility would not be possible if spreading were provided under the depreciation rules. The proposed legislation treats non-engine overhaul costs and the replacement of life-lim ited parts outside an overhaul of an engine as deductible when incurred. This represents the consensus of views promoted by submitters during all phases of consultation. Allowing a choice of timing methods could lead to arbitration opportunities, unless choice can be justified on the grounds of excessive compliance costs. For example, a taxpayer is incentivised to adopt the spreading method in transition or for a year in which an aircraft is acquired and then elects to use the “as incurred” method from the year of the first overhaul. This arbitrage would result in the taxpayer obtaining the faster rate of depreciation at acquisition (and in transition) while not being required to match overhaul costs with revenue earned from the aircraft time in service after the overhaul. We have discussed with Airwork Holdings Limited whether there is a need to determine the spreading of overhaul costs by detailed reference to costs of individual items recorded in their asset management system. They have indicated that the main issues relate to the way helicopter lift and propulsion systems are required to be overhauled. 207 The proposed timing rule requires, at a minimum, the aggregate cost of an overhaul to be allocated under the most relevant measure of use. If the aggregate cost of an overhaul for an aircraft covers hull, engines and other major systems, the intention is that it would be acceptable to apportion that total cost between the overhaul of the engine system and other overhauls on a reasonable basis (for example, for an IFRS taxpayer, this is considered to be available from their IFRS accounting). It is not intended that a taxpayer need determine this allocation from an ongoing and detailed analysis of all parts and components included in the overhaul. Airwork Hold ings Limited asked if further compliance guidance would be forthcoming in the Tax Information Bulletin. We confirmed that detailed examples of the minimum compliance requirements for both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters would be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin. We note that IFRS taxpayers can elect to use their IFRS accounting for spreading aircraft overhaul costs. For a taxpayer using the “as incurred” method, we consider a minor increase in compliance costs will occur by determining the overhaul cost for the engine systems either on an reasonable apportionment basis or by actual identification. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: IFRS method Submission (Airwork Holdings Limited, Aviation New Zealand Limited) IFRS taxpayers should have the option to use the IFRS method for tax purposes for the entire asset. This would require changes to the tax depreciation rules and this has the potential to significantly simplify compliance for IFRS taxpayers. The IFRS method should apply to the IFRS treatment for the whole aircraft Comment The proposed legislation includes a provision in proposed section EJ 25 that would allow IFRS taxpayers to elect to apply IFRS for tax purposes. Several IFRS taxpayers have already indicated their intention to make use of this election. The consultation process addressed implementation and compliance cost concerns for a range of taxpayers, from large IFRS taxpayers to a taxpayer with two aircraft. The general view in submissions was that the spreading regime should be constrained to engine overhauls. The main reason given was that, in general, the costs of overhauling non-engine systems (for example, landing gear) was not significant relative to the value of the asset and that consequently compliance costs arising could outweigh benefits from achieving consistency with BBLR settings. Officials agreed with these submissions during consultation. 208 It was also identified that the aviation sector has an active market for sale and lease of engines separately from an aircraft as a whole. This indicates that it is a normal practice in the aviation sector to consider engines can be viewed as a separate asset. For example, we have identified that an aircraft operator may swap an engine to a different aircraft in their fleet, hold spare engines to expedite the return to service after an unscheduled overhaul (for example, due to engine damage), and sold or leased as an independent asset. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Compliance costs Submission (Airwork Holdings Limited, Aviation New Zealand Limited) The provisions in the bill proposing changes to the timing of aircraft engine overhaul costs carry significant compliance costs. Comment Compliance costs arising from the proposals changing the timing of deductions for aircraft engine overhaul costs have been consulted on within the sector. Officials consider there is no requirement in the proposals to separately identify and record costs on an item-by-item basis as suggested in this submission. Our analysis of compliance costs is based on information obtained during consultation with aircraft operators about existing practices under which they: • already identify the total cost incurred for an overhaul of an aircraft engine overhaul to determine the timing of that deduction; and • already know and use relevant use measures for determining when the next scheduled overhaul is likely to be required for asset and cashflow management purposes (or under the formerly approved spreading method). We have also consulted with some aircraft operators on compliance and implementation costs arising from the proposals both before and after the bill was introduced. Compliance issues were resolved to the satisfaction of those operators. The proposals are intended to require the total cost of an overhaul to be spread, and does not require any subdivision of that amount nor is intended that it would require any detailed record-keeping requirements in addition to those already required under CAA regulations. As noted earlier in this report, it is intended that apportionment on a reasonable basis of overhaul costs between engines and non-engine systems would be permitted. For example, IFRS taxpayers already apportion combined overhaul costs between engines and other non-engine systems for accounting purposes. It is intended that this approach would be acceptable for income tax purposes. Examples in the Commentary on the bill illustrate that the timing proposals relate to the total cost (and not discrete parts and components) of an overhaul of an engine. 209 Officials consider that if a taxpayer chooses to adopt a more intensive compliance framework for their own commercial reasons, any compliance cost impacts for that more intensive framework would not arise from the proposals in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Grandparenting of tax treatment for existing aircraft Submission (Airwork Holdings Limited, Aviation New Zealand Limited) In the interest of minimising compliance costs, the existing rules in relation to tax depreciation of aircraft and deduction of overhaul costs under the “as incurred” method should be retained for aircraft currently owned or leased, and the proposals apply only to aircraft acquired from the 2017–18 income year. Comment We agree there is a one-off compliance cost in transition under the proposal to accelerate depreciation deductions in the bill. Taxpayers with whom we have consulted have welcomed these transitional proposals and the objectives they seek to obtain. The transitional provisions under the bill have two objectives: • Acceleration of depreciation deductions for existing aircraft to align tax values with the proposed spreading rules. This proposal requires appropriate apportionment of tax book value of the aircraft at transition to identify the deductible amount and the amount by which depreciation values are to be reduced. This proposal provides a significant benefit to the aviation sector through the acceleration of tax deductions. We have consulted with some taxpayers on this proposal and have agreed some principles that serve to minimise the compliance costs for this one-off calculation. We consider it would be useful to set out those principles in the Tax Information Bulletin to assist taxpayers more widely in transition. • Spreading the reversal of past accrued provisions for future overhaul expenses against the actual cost of those overhauls (to prevent double deductions occurring) or, if the aircraft is disposed of prior to the next overhaul, the amount of the provisions are income on disposal. For both circumstances, this reflects existing practice and no compliance cost change occurs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 210 Issue: Consultation Submission (Airwork Holdings Limited, Aviation New Zealand Limited) Airwork Hold ings Lim ited was not consulted on the proposed changes. Comment At the time of consultation, the Aviation Industry Association Inc. (now Aviation New Zealand Limited) indicated it would circulate officials’ consultation letter to its membership for comment, collate those responses and submit on that basis. At the time of consultation, we identified that Airwork Holdings Limited was listed as a member of the agricultural division of Aviation New Zealand (and this continues to be the case). At that time, officials had an expectation that Aviation New Zealand would have provided its members with the targeted consultation letter for their comment. We do not agree that the issues raised in consultation have generic application across other sectors of the economy due to the unique requirements of CAA regulations to restore full operational performance of major systems on a cyclical basis, as well as replace life-lim ited parts according to manufacturer recommendations. This level of regulation does not exist in other sectors of the economy and results in it being illegal to operate an aircraft without a current airworthiness certificate. Officials do not consider the proposals in the bill set a precedent for this reason. We acknowledge that Airwork Holdings Limited was not directly consulted during the consultation process. Officials provided Airwork Holdings Limited a briefing on the proposals to be introduced in the bill in December 2015 and have indicated that we are willing to engage to address compliance concerns (as we have done with other IFRS taxpayers). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Measures of use Submission (KPMG on behalf of Helicopters New Zealand) The legislation should clearly state that the measure of use on which spreading is based can be elected by the aircraft owner for each aircraft and may be changed from year to year as the relevant measure may vary from year to year. 211 Comment We agree with the submission as the policy intention is that if the relevant use measure for a helicopter lift and propulsion system is based on the lesser of two measures, the allocation of the overhaul deduction should be determined at the end of each year on the basis of the most relevant use measure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Pragmatic solution Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed amendment to the tax treatment of major aircraft engine overhauls is a pragmatic solution. Comment Officials acknowledge the submission. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Grandparenting of accounting provision method Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The existing accounting provision method should be grandparented for the option of aircraft operators who carry out scheduled overhauls on aircraft from time to time. Comment The existing accounting provision method that treats a provision for the cost of a future overhaul as a deductible expense does not give rise to an allowable deduction under current or proposed law. Officials accept that in the absence of tax depreciation, the use of provisions can be argued to give a reasonable estimate of the decline in value of an overhauled engine. This is because provision accounting is used to reflect the decline in assets that are not recognised in the balance sheet of the taxpayer. If deductions for both engine overhaul provisions and tax depreciation on the engine overhaul component were allowed, taxpayers would have a significant timing advantage compared with other taxpayers using the spreading approach. 212 If the use of provisions for future overhaul expenses were consistent with BBLR settings (which they are not), it would be still be necessary for taxpayers electing this option to exclude the engine overhaul component from tax depreciation. Smaller aircraft operators in the SME market may elect to apply the “as incurred” method. This measure is considered to address the risk of non-compliance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (EY) The proposed new timing rules apply from the first income year commencing after enactment of the bill. Comment The main points raised on this submission relate to applying the timing rule at the end of the 2017–18 income year and in calculating the transitional deduction. The submitter also points to other submissions in which it suggests technical drafting improvements to clarify inter- relationships between the proposed timing rules and other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007. We do not consider there are any aspects to the recommended technical amendments that would require any significant change to the proposed timing rules. Officials consider that compliance with the proposed timing rules and calculation of the transitional deduction is generally first required when the taxpayer completes their return of income for the 2017–18 income year, which under extension of time arrangements, will not be finally due until 31 March 2019. We have consulted with some taxpayers on a process for calculating the transitional deduction. We have identified that, as submitted in another EY submission, a minor technical adjustment to the proposed rule for calculating the transitional deduction is necessary to clarify that the adjustment is an apportionment of tax values in the deprecation rules on a reasonable basis (based on either the taxpayer’s own data or on industry data) in order to minimise the compliance cost for this calculation. This can be addressed in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Consequently, officials do not consider there is any need to defer the implementation date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 213 Issue: Spare parts, repairs and maintenance, and overhauls Submission (EY) Clarification is required, particularly in relation to helicopter owners, to distinguish between the income tax treatment of aircraft engine components (as proposed to be defined) that are required to be held for repairs and maintenance outside regulatory overhauls, and those acquired as part of such overhauls. Comment The relevant definition for proposed new section DW 5 is “aircraft engine overhaul” and not “aircraft engine component”. The term “aircraft engine component” is not a defined term in the bill proposals. An engine overhaul may occur on a scheduled basis or on an unscheduled basis (for example, because of bird strike). The proposed new section allows a deduction for the cost of an overhaul for an engine (fixed wing) and for the overhaul of listed major systems for a helicopter operator. An aircraft engine overhaul is defined as a process of disassembly, testing, restoring to specified operational conditions, and reassembly and testing. The cost of carrying out that process is the allowable deduction referred to in proposed section DW 5. Officials consider this submission relates to a general timing rule that applies to spare parts held in inventory. Under this rule, the deduction for the cost of a part in inventory is timed to the year in which that part is used (for example, it is used to replace a part in the aircraft or helicopter) whether the part replacement is due to the use-by life expiring or due to on- condition maintenance (for example, replacement required as normal repairs and maintenance). It is intended that spare parts included in the overhaul process should form part of the cost of the overhaul and not be timed to the year of the overhaul but spread as part of the cost of the overhaul. The intention is that the deduction for the cost parts held in inventory, and used for normal repairs and maintenance or replacement, is timed to the year the part is used in this way. This is no change from current law and practice. Officials agree with the submission that it requires a minor technical amendment to clarify that the parts included in the overhaul process form part of the cost of the aircraft engine overhaul instead of being timed under the general timing rule that applies to normal repairs and maintenance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 214 Issue: Alternative methods, CIR agreement, and relationship with transitional adjustment provisions Submission (EY) Clarification is needed or desirable in relation to: • the process for making relevant elections and agreeing methods and adjustments under the IFRS alternative method; • the CIR’s expected approach to approving apportionments of consideration on disposal; • whether or how the proposed transitional adjustment provisions apply if taxpayers elect to use the IFRS alternative method or the proposed single aircraft owner method. Comment Processes making relevant elections and agreeing methods and adjustments under the IFRS alternative method Officials agree that the time by which relevant elections and agreement on methods should both be stated in the legislation. The processes are an operational matter rather than a matter for legislation. We have worked with our operational staff on these issues and anticipate outlining those processes in the Tax Information Bullet i n. The CIR’s expected approach to approving apportionment of consideration on disposal This is an operational matter. Again we are working with our operational staff to set out the expected approach in the Tax Information Bulletin. The main policy objective is to ensure that taxpayers are aware that apportionments are to be consistent with industry data. The proposed transitional adjustment provisions apply for taxpayers electing to use either the IFRS alternative method or the single aircraft owner method The transitional adjustment provisions are intended to apply to all taxpayers other than those who elect to use the single aircraft owner method. Officials agree that the legislation should be clearer that the single aircraft owner method does not obtain the transitional deduction because they are electing out of the spreading method. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 215 Issue: Transitional deduction Submission (EY) Clarificat ion is required of proposed sections DZ 22 and EZ 23BA, especially in relation to “unpriced aircraft engines”, and in relation to situations when taxpayers have previously capitalised all aircraft overhaul costs. Comment We agree with the submission that the provisions should clarify that the apportionment of the tax depreciation values should be on a reasonable basis. The intention is that a “reasonable basis” is one that either uses the taxpayer’s own historic information (for example, IFRS taxpayers already have appropriate ratios for their aircraft) or by reference to relevant industry data for that aircraft type. We were advised by taxpayers during consultation that: • relevant cost data and aircraft values are readily obtained from commercial sources; and • this data is already used by taxpayers using provisioning accounting and for asset and cashflow management. Officials have seen no evidence that any taxpayers have previously capitalised past overhaul costs for income tax purposes. It is accepted that IFRS taxpayers have capitalised overhaul costs for IFRS purposes but not for income tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials' comments. Issue: Interface of definition of depreciable property with defined terms in the depreciation rules Submission (EY) Amendments are required to clarify the relationship of the proposed amendment to depreciable property with sections EE 29(2), EE 37, EE 56 to EE 60, EE 61(3) and terms such as “aircraft” and “international aircraft”. Comment The amendments are technical in nature and are intended to provide greater clarity and certainty on how the tax depreciation rules operate after implementation. The submission is to make technical adjustments to improve the relationship between certain terms in the depreciation rules and: • the amendment to the definition of depreciable property; and 216 • the transitional deduction. Officials agree w ith this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Leased aircraft Submission (EY) Appropriate cross-referencing should be included to ensure that any disposal consideration for an aircraft (or aircraft engine) cannot be taxed twice. Proposed section EJ 27 also applies to subsequent disposals of a leased asset by associates to ensure that it applies in the same manner as section FA 9. Comment Officials agree that: • cross-referencing would clarify that no double taxation arises; and • proposed section EJ 27 is intended to apply to a disposal of a lease asset by an associate in the same manner as existing section FA 9. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 217 CLARIFICATION OF EMPOWERING PROVISION FOR NEW ZEALAND’S DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS Clause 6 Issue: International obligations and overriding of treaties negotiated in good faith Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PwC) It is not necessarily the case that other countries would interpret a double tax agreement (D TA) in the same way as New Zealand would, given our relatively broad interpretation of our general anti-avoidance rules (GAAR). This runs the risk that our domestic law would override the treaties negotiated in good faith with other countries. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) A practical impact of this will be that application of section BG 1, pursuant to the proposed amendment to deny benefits otherwise arising under a DTA, may constitute a breach of New Zealand’s obligations under international law (being those obligations owed to the other jurisdiction with which the DTA is entered into). ( PwC) It is also unclear whether parties to DTAs entered into by New Zealand before 2003 accept that section BG 1 overrides the relevant DTAs. (K PMG ) Comment Inland Revenue’s view of the existing law is that the provision that empowers New Zealand’s DTAs does not prevent the anti-avoidance rules contained in income tax legislation from applying to counteract a tax advantage arising under a tax avoidance arrangement in respect of which a DTA applies. The proposal in the bill would make this explicit. New Zealand’s DTAs are based on the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. The OECD’s Commentary to the Model Tax Convention (the OECD Commentary) is an important part of the context in which these DTAs are internationally understood. The OECD Commentary states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between GAARs and the provisions of tax conventions. It also confirms that States are not obliged to grant the benefits of a DTA if the DTA has been abused (noting that it should not be lightly assumed that the DTA has been abused). The OECD’s 2015 Action 6 (“Preventing the Granting of Treaty Benefits in Inappropriate Circumstances”), which will update the OECD Commentary in light of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, has also confirmed this position. Accordingly, in almost all cases, no conflict will arise between a DTA and the GAAR. While a conflict could theoretically result in a breach of international law, this issue is largely academic and arises for all countries that have the same law regarding their GAAR. These countries include Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, who have also clarified in their domestic legislation that their GAAR overrides DTAs. 218 Inland Revenue has consulted on this proposal with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has raised no concerns with the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The amendment is a change not a mere clarification Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC) In our view, this proposal is not a “clarification” of existing law but represents a change in the law. It is mis lead ing to describe these proposals as a mere clarification, and runs the risk that these proposals do not receive sufficient scrutiny during the Select Committee process. Rather, it arguably alters the current position that in the event of inconsistency between a DTA and domestic law (the GAAR being part of the domestic law) the DTA prevails. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) In our view it is very doubtful whether the proposed amendment is in fact a clarification of the relationship between section BG 1 and New Zealand’s DTAs entered into before 2003. Rather, we consider that the proposed amendment will constitute a change in the position in respect of these earlier DTAs, and this amendment needs to be acknowledged as a change. ( PwC) Comment On the face of the legislation there is a potential conflict between the GAAR and the provision that empowers New Zealand’s DTAs. The provision in the Income Tax Act 2007 that governs the domestic implementation of DTAs states that DTAs override the other provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, the Income Tax Act 2007 also states that the GAAR has overriding effect. The legislation is not explicit about the ordering between the provisions that govern the domestic implementation of DTAs and the GAAR. As noted above, Inland Revenue’s view of the existing law is that the provision that empowers New Zealand’s DTAs does not prevent the GAAR contained in income tax legislation from applying to counteract a tax advantage arising under a tax avoidance arrangement in respect of which a DTA applies. This is how Inland Revenue has applied the law in previous disputes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 219 Issue: Creates uncertainty Submission (OliverShaw) It creates the potential to considerably reduce the certainty for foreign investors that DTAs try to achieve. The problem it aims to fix has not been articulated. Comment The problem the amendment aims to fix is the uncertainty, on the part of some taxpayers, about whether the GAAR has overriding effect in respect of DTAs. The uncertainty arose because the relationship was not explicitly addressed in the legislation. As noted above, Inland Revenue’s current practice and interpretation of the law is that the GAAR does apply in the context of a treaty. Officials’ view is that this amendment will reduce uncertainty by making it explicit that anti-avoidance rules can apply in the context of a DTA. Further, we note that the GAAR applies to all other situations and the growing body of case law on the GAAR generally provides considerable guidance to taxpayers. Additionally, there is comprehensive guidance in the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 “Tax Avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007”. The lack of clarity in New Zealand’s legis lat ion contrasts with Canada and Australia, who amended their legislation to explicitly ensure that DTAs do not override the GAAR. As New Zealand’s legislation is silent on whether DTAs override the GAAR, it has been suggested that there might be a possible inference that “the New Zealand Parliament is content to allow New Zealand taxpayers to use structures that employ the provisions of tax treaties to avoid New Zealand income tax”. 4 More recently (2014) the United Kingdom also amended its legislation to explicit ly provide that DTAs do not override the GAAR. Accordingly, if no similar amendment is made to New Zealand’s tax legislation, a lack of action by the New Zealand Government may lead some taxpayers to infer that DTAs override New Zealand’s GAAR. In other words, a lack of legislative action is likely to increase the uncertainty given the responses from Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 See discussion in Elliffe, Craig and Prebble, John (2009) “General Anti-Avo idance Rules and Double Tax Agreements : A New Zealand Perspective,” Revenue Law Journal: Vo l. 19 : Is s . 1, Artic le 4. 220 Issue: Not a current priority Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We submit that rather than introducing this change, given this is not a pressing issue, it would be more appropriate that when our treaties are re-negotiated over time, the particular DTA can be updated to deny DTA benefits in cases of tax avoidance (as has been done in more recently negotiated DTAs). Comment Officials consider that it is a priority issue, especially in light of the OECD work on the BEPS project and the Action 6 Final Report. While the amendment is consistent with how Inland Revenue currently interprets the law, there is a current uncertainty in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Lack of consultation Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw) The proposed amendment to section BH 1 should be deferred until there has been more extensive consultation on the effect and potential implications of the change, including the effect of the proposed amendment on New Zealand’s international law obligations, and that such consultation should expressly acknowledge and address: • the lack of consensus as to the interaction between domestic anti-avoidance rules and DTAs in relation to DTAs entered into before 2003; • the position in respect of DTAs entered into before 1992; and • the potential for the proposed amendment, if applied in respect of pre-2003 DTAs, to contravene New Zealand’s obligations under the Vienna Convention. (New Zealand Law Society) This proposal has not been subject to consultation. These proposals should not proceed at least without full consultation and consideration of the need for it and the consequence of having such an override. (OliverShaw) Officials approached the Group for pre-consultation on this issue however we never received any response to the concerns we raised. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 221 Comment Inland Revenue advised key stakeholders (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, and the Corporate Taxpayers Group) in July 2015 on the proposal, and received responses. Inland Revenue considered the issues that were raised in these responses, and had follow-up phone conferences with stakeholders. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were also consulted in relation to New Zealand’s international obligations. No public issues paper was released. The process that was followed was to engage with key interested stakeholders on the proposal, bearing in mind that the amendment makes explicit the law as Inland Revenue currently interprets it. This change is consistent with international norms and with countries that have GAARs. Accordingly, officials believe that the level of consultation in this context was appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application to treaties entered into before 2003 Submission (New Zealand Law Society, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) In light of the 2003 amendments to the OECD Commentary, there seems little scope to argue that benefits under DTAs that were concluded after 2003 could not be justifiably denied in appropriate circumstances. However, it remains an open question as to the position in respect of DTAs concluded prior to this date. Whether the OECD Commentary would permit the application of section BG 1 to deny benefits under a DTA concluded prior to 2003 would turn on the following issues: • whether DTAs concluded prior to 2003 should be interpreted consistently with the 2003 amendments to the OECD Commentary with respect to DTA abuse; and if not • whether the relevant OECD Commentary at the time the DTA was concluded would permit such application. With respect to the first issue in particular it is noted that there is a general consensus among academics and other expert commentators that DTAs should be applied consistently with later Commentary where the later Commentary serves to clarify Commentary existing at the time the DTA was concluded, but not where the later Commentary contradicts this earlier Commentary. However, there is a lack of consensus as to which of these two categories the 2003 amendments fall into, and therefore whether the first principle cited in RIS9 can apply in respect of pre-2003 DTAs. It is also doubtful that either principle could apply in respect of DTAs entered into prior to 1992. (New Zealand Law Society) There is some uncertainty regarding whether section BG 1 applies to DTAs concluded before 2003. The proposed unilateral amendment to section BH 1 does not alter the position in this respect. (K PMG) 222 Our concern is as follows. It seems clear that the OECD Commentary has changed from a view that for the GAAR to apply to a DTA it needed to be expressly incorporated into the DTA, to a view, more recently, whereby it is understood that a GAAR applies to a DTA. The proposed legislative amendments make it clear that the GAAR applies to DTAs. It is not, however, clear whether the proposed amendments are intended to be a deliberate override of older treaties entered into by New Zealand. If it is intended that the bill proposal amends these earlier DTAs unilaterally, we suggest this should be made very clear. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The views expressed by submitters around whether section BG 1 applies to DTAs concluded before 2003 (or 1992) illustrate the current uncertainty in the legislation regarding the interaction between the provision which empowers treaties and section BG 1. The proposed amendment is intended to apply in respect of all treaties regardless of the date they entered into force. Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the law is that the GAAR applies in the DTA context regardless of the date the treaty was concluded. In other words, Inland Revenue does not currently take a different approach to avoidance cases depending on the date the treaty was concluded. Accordingly, the change to the legislation is merely to clarify the domestic law and resolve any uncertainty on this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Specific anti-avoidance rules Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Do officials intend for the other specific anti-avoidance provisions in subpart GB to override the effect of a DTA when there is a conflict? Comment The amendment applies only to the GAAR, not to the specific anti-avoidance rules (SAARs). In relation to SAARs contained in, for example, subpart GB of the Income Tax Act 2007 there is not the same legislative issue that exists in respect of the GAAR – that is, DTAs and the GAAR are both expressed as having overriding effect, whereas subpart GB is not. Notwithstanding that this amendment does not deal explicitly with SAARs, it is intended that they can still apply when there is a DTA in accordance with the OECD Commentary. 223 The OECD Action 6 Final Report provides that conflicts between SAARs and DTAs will be avoided by a proper construction of both. New Zealand follows relevant OECD Commentary in determining whether there is a conflict between a SAAR and the DTA. In rare cases where a proper construction of the SAAR and the DTA nevertheless results in a conflict, the provisions of the DTA would prevail. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: No treaty relief is available if section BG 1 applies Submission (Chapman Tripp) Under the proposed wording, DTAs arguably have no effect if section BG 1 applies – that is, no treaty relief is available if section BG 1 applies. The intended outcome is that a treaty should be applied to the reconstructed income under a tax avoidance arrangement, with the effect that the tax on the reconstructed income is subject to the limits in the treaty. A new provision is required to make it clear that, when section BG 1 applies, the treaty should be applied having regard to the reconstructed income and any treaty relief should be available with respect to that reconstructed income. Comment Under the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1, a tax avoidance arrangement is void as against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue may then reconstruct the arrangement to counter tax advantages under section GA 1. The Interpretation Statement on the interpretation and application of the GAAR (IS 13/01 “Tax Avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007”) contains a detailed analysis of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s power of reconstruction, including a discussion of when the Commissioner will reinstate legit imate tax outcomes voided by the arrangement. If the transaction has been reconstructed by the Commissioner as a result of applying the GAAR, a legitimate treaty benefit can be reinstated in the same way as in the case of a domestic tax law benefit. For example, if the proceeds of a share sale are recharacterised as a dividend under domestic law due to the application of the GAAR, then subject to the requirement that the provision of treaty benefits is a legitimate tax outcome, the dividend article of the relevant DTA would apply. In other cases, no relief will be available. For example, a person who artificially inserts an entity into a country that has a DTA with New Zealand in order to get a lower withholding tax rate under a DTA (“treaty shopping”) will not be entitled to treaty relief under that D TA. 224 It should be noted that the Commissioner is not obliged to reconstruct a transaction. For example, the Commissioner can simply treat the transaction as void (that is, assume the transaction did not take place). In that case, no treaty relief will be available in New Zealand as no transaction took place. Officials consider that the current drafting provides for the outcome outlined above. We consider it would be difficult to make this clearer in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Would any law change be prospective only? It should apply only to arrangements entered into after the date of enactment or (in the alternative) to income years commencing after enactment. Comment The application date of the change will be prospective (that is, it will apply from the date of enactment). Inland Revenue’s view of the existing law is that the provision that empowers New Zealand’s DTAs does not prevent the anti-avoidance rules contained in income tax legislation from applying to counteract a tax advantage arising under a tax avoidance arrangement in respect of which a DTA applies. This is how Inland Revenue has applied the law in previous disputes. Accordingly, there will be no change in how Inland Revenue has been applying the law. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Further guidance and clarification Submission (KPMG, EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Further guidance is needed on what the position is in a case when there is a conflict between the domestic law position and the treaty position. 225 Comment As previously noted, Inland Revenue’s view of the existing law is that the provision that empowers New Zealand’s DTAs does not prevent the anti-avoidance rules contained in income tax legislation from applying and Inland Revenue has been applying this approach to date. Further, the updated OECD Commentary states that in the vast majority of cases there is no conflict between the treaty provisions (under a proper interpretation of the treaty), and the domestic GAAR. Appropriate policy guidance will be provided in a future Tax Information Bulletin. It should also be noted that the OECD’s Action 6 Final Report considers the interaction of GAARs and DTAs in princip le. As noted above, in the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view, the practical outcomes from an application of section BG 1 in this context are effectively determined in the same manner as where the avoidance is in respect of domestic provisions. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has previously issued a substantial Interpretation Statement on the interpretation and application of the GAAR (IS 13/01 “Tax Avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007”). It is not considered that further general guidance on how the GAAR will apply in the DTA context would be helpful, and specific cases will depend on particular facts and circumstances. Officials note that binding rulings, which are intended to provide certainty to taxpayers, are available to taxpayers who are concerned that a transaction may be subject to the GAAR. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 226 CHARITIES WITH OVERSEAS PURPOSES Clause 272 Submission (New Zealand Red Cross Incorporated) Reference to “The Red Cross Society Incorporated” should be updated to reflect the charity’s correct legal name “New Zealand Red Cross Incorporated”. Comment Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are entitled, as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit or 33⅓ percent of monetary amounts donated, up to the value of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. Charities on the list have purposes directed at providing overseas aid and relief. The submitter has requested a revision to the list to reflect a legal name change made in 1993. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Remove reference to “The Red Cross Society Incorporated” and replace with “New Zealand Red Cross Incorporated” in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The change should have effect from 14 December 1993. 227 LAND TAINTING AND COUNCIL CONTROLLED ORGANISATIONS Clauses 9, 10, 11 and 12 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (PwC, Auckland Council, Deloitte) The submitters support the proposal to exempt entities controlled by local authorities from the land taint ing ru les. Comment Officials welcome support for the proposal. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (Deloitte) The Dunedin City Council group had a council controlled organisation that commenced a property development business during the 2007 calendar year. Because the proposed amendment to exempt council entities from the land tainting rules in section CB 15C applies from 1 September 2015, land acquired by the Dunedin City Council group after the commencement of the group’s property development activities and disposed of before 1 September 2015 would be subject to the land tainting rules, and would potentially be taxable. To prevent an overreach of the rules for the Dunedin Council, and to ensure all local authorities are treated equally in relation to land held within their groups, proposed section CB 15C should apply from 1 April 2008 or at least 1 July 2010 to ensure that the proposed amendment applies to all periods not currently statute barred. Comment Officials accept that the land tainting rules are overreaching in the context of council groups by taxing capital account land in situations when there is no tax avoidance concern. However, officials do not agree that the amendment should be backdated, for the following reasons: • The current amendment is prospective in a sense because Auckland Council’s tax advisors sought an amendment from officials in April 2015, prior to any tainting implications occurring. Because of the legislative timetable an amendment was not able to be enacted prior to 1 September 2015. In order to provide a pragmatic solution for Auckland Council that would give them certainty of tax treatment, a retrospective amendment was included in the next available tax bill. 228 • Council groups knew the tax position at the time and entered into transactions (or refrained) on that basis. • Backdating the amendment would provide no relief to council groups who refrained from entering into transactions because of tainting implications and would therefore be inequitable. • Backdating the amendment would provide a windfall gain for those councils who paid tax on such land sales. • The current amendment is equitable as it applies from the same date for all council groups. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consolidated groups Submission (Deloitte) Sections CV 2 and/or FM 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure that taxable income does not arise under the consolidated group rules for transactions that would otherwise be exempt under proposed section CB 15C. If not, the intent of the proposed amendments would be defeated as it is common for council-controlled organisations to be part of a consolidated tax group. Comment The consolidation regime was introduced in 1992 (with application from 1 April 1993) and allows wholly owned groups of companies to be treated as a single company for tax purposes. This simplifies the tax affairs of a group of companies by ensuring that intra-group asset transfers are tax deferred, by allowing imputation credits to be offset within the group, as well as ensuring losses are utilised by reference to the shareholder continuity of the group, not of individual members. Section FM 9 applies when a company that is part of a consolidated group derives an amount that would not ordinarily be income of the company but would be income of the consolidated group if it were one company. The section provides that the amount is income of the company under section CV 2. This provision is intended to prevent intra-group arrangements where assets are transferred and re-characterised to avoid tax. Officials agree with the submitter that the consolidated group rules would defeat the intent of the land tainting amendments, because any land disposed of that would be exempt under proposed section CB 15C would be taxable to the group because of the development activities of another group member. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 229 Issue: Extension of the exemption to other entities should be considered Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Consideration should be given to extending the exemption to other entities – for example, entities associated with social housing providers. Social housing providers may be considered property developers. The disposal of capital account land held by entities associated with a social housing provider may be subject to tax under the land tainting rules when there is no tax avoidance concern. Comment While officials support the submission in principle, competing priorities mean that this issue cannot be advanced at this time. A review will be considered for inclusion in a future tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The exclusions in part CB should be revised Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) The meaning of the word “premises” in the business premises exclusion from the land tainting rules in section CB 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is uncertain - whether it should be regarded as restricted to buildings and their immediately surrounding land, or whether it might be regarded as applying to the property as a whole. The exclusion should be reviewed to ensure it can apply to land, as distinct from arguably being limited to buildings and their immediate surrounds, which is used within the normal scope of a taxpayer’s business activities (EY). The scope of the exclusions (the residential land exclusion in section CB 16 and the business premises exclusion in section CB 19) from the land tainting rules should be reviewed, to ensure that the land tainting rules do not unnecessarily catch disposals of land held on capital account in other contexts (New Zealand Law Society). Comment While officials support the proposals in principle, competing priorities mean that a review of the exclusions cannot be advanced at this time. A review will be considered for inclusion in a future tax policy work programme. The meaning of the word “premises” in the business premises exclusion is a question of interpretation. The points the submitter has raised have been passed onto Public Rulings to consider for inclusion in their work programme. 230 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Expanding the local authority tax exemption to cover income derived from an unrelated CCO Submission (EY) There should be an extension of the local authority income tax exemption in section CW 39 to cover income derived by local authorities from transactions with unrelated council-controlled organisations, port companies or energy companies. This should apply to land sales, other income from land use and other types of income more generally. Without an extension, if a local authority were to develop land, its sales to private buyers would be exempt from tax but any sale to an unrelated entity, which happened to be a council-controlled organisation, port company or energy company (as described in section 6(4) of the Local Government Act 2002) because of some other local authority’s ownership or control, would be taxable. Comment Under section CW 39(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007, an amount of income a local authority derives from a council-controlled organisation (CCO) or a port or energy company (that would be a CCO in the absence of section 6(4) of the Local Government Act 2002) is taxable. This represents an exclusion from the general income tax exemption afforded to local authorities by section CW 39(2). This exclusion was introduced in 1989 to ensure that a CCO is treated as an ordinary company for tax purposes in relation to its commercial operations. The policy intent was to ensure competitive neutrality of CCOs with the private sector. Without this provision, this policy intent was able to be defeated as income from a CCO could effectively be extracted tax-free by the local authority charging the CCO rental or management fees, which would be deductible to the CCO but not taxable to the local authority due to its tax-exempt status. Officials agree with the submitter that the exclusion should only apply to related entities – for example, entities within the council group, not to unrelated entities (such as a CCO within another council group). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 231 Issue: Suggestions to improve drafting of proposed new section CB 15C Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The drafting of section CB 15C should be amended to: • make clear that the exclusion may apply to disposals not only by council controlled organisations (CCOs) and other local authority-controlled entities but also by local authorities (if the income tax exemption under section CW 39(2) would not apply to the disposal); and • remove the additional references to a CCO or entity being “controlled” by a local authority (which imply greater than 50 percent control, whereas the CCO control tests and the Commentary on the bill indicate that joint (50/50) control should be sufficient). Comment In relation to the submitter’s first point, officials consider that the current drafting is clear that the exclusion does apply to disposals by local authorities. However, there may be some room to improve drafting clarity. Officials agree with the submitter that references to a CCO or entity being “controlled” by a local authority should be removed so as not to imply greater than 50 percent control. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 232 INFORMATION SHARING Issue: Repeal of legislative information sharing provisions on commencement of an Approved Information Sharing Agreement No clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials are progressing work to amalgamate the current legislative information sharing provisions into one Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) under the Privacy Act 1993. This agreement will enable the two agencies to share the information they need to determine entitlements to benefits and subsidies, and for assessing tax obligations. Officials propose that the current rules be repealed with effect from a future date to be determined by Order in Council, to enable the AISA to come into force as soon as possible. Comment The AISA will amalgamate seven information-sharing provisions under three Acts: the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and the Child Support Act 1991, into one agreement. This agreement will be enacted by way of Order in Council, which is expected to occur in mid-2017. When the AISA is enacted, there will be an overlap between the current legislative provisions and the AISA agreement. The current legislation will be the authorising legislation for information sharing, not the AISA, which would make the AISA inoperable. Officials therefore recommend that the current rules be repealed with effect from a future date to be determined by Order in Council. The date specified in the Order in Council will be the date the AISA comes into force, once that date is known. This amendment will ensure that there is only one authorising provision in force at a point in time, and once the AISA comes into force, it will be the authority to enable information sharing between the two agencies to take place. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section 81A amended (Disclosure of information under approved information sharing agreement) Clause 292 Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) The submitter supports the amendment proposed in clause 292 as it will ensure Inland Revenue can take full advantage of the intended flexibility of the approved information- sharing mechanism provided for under Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. 233 Comment Currently, an exception to the tax secrecy rules allows Inland Revenue to share information in the context of AISAs approved under the Privacy Act. However, the exception refers only to personal information. This means Inland Revenue cannot share information that is not personal information (for example, information about companies or partnerships). The amendment proposes an information-sharing agreement under the Privacy Act enabling the sharing of information, irrespective of whether the sharing also includes information that is not personal. The submitter supports the proposed amendment as it will clarify that Inland Revenue may share both personal and non-personal information under an AISA without breaching its secrecy obligations to taxpayers. This will enable Inland Revenue to take full advantage of the intended flexibility of the approved information-sharing mechanism provided for under Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 234 ANCILLARY TAXES AND THE TIME BAR Clause 295 Issue: Support for the proposal to extend the time bar to ancillary taxes and AIL Submission (EY, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Chapman Tripp) The submitters support the proposal to extend the time bar to ancillary taxes and the approved issuer levy. Comment Officials note the support for the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Time bar should apply when no return has been filed Submission (EY) Currently, the time bar can apply only if a return has been filed. That requirement may make sense in the context of returns of income, as most business taxpayers and entities are required to file these returns for each tax year. The requirement does not make as much sense in relation to ancillary taxes or the approved issuer levy (AIL). Taxpayers are not required to file returns for ancillary taxes or AIL if they do not consider any of these taxes or levies are payable, but they still take tax positions by not filing those returns for any given period, just as they take tax positions by filing returns (or other documents treated as returns) for those purposes. There appears to be no policy reason why taxpayers taking a tax position in relation to ancillary taxes or AIL by not filing a return for any relevant period should not be able to apply the general time bar when taxpayers filing some sort of return, such as a nil return, would be able to do so (unless either of the section 108(2) exceptions applied). The proposed amendment will encourage the filing of numerous nil returns for all sorts of ancillary taxes simply so taxpayers may obtain time bar protection in due course. Given the above, as well as the context of self-assessment and the ongoing move to electronic filing, which tends to require simple numbers in boxes, rather than detailed information, explanations or calculations, it is suggested the wording of section 108 should be reviewed more generally, with a view to providing expressly for situations where tax positions have been taken in not filing returns for ancillary taxes or AIL. 235 Comment The proposal is intended to be consistent with the current law on the time bar, which requires a return to be filed before the time bar applies. The purpose of the requirement to file a return is to ensure that the Commissioner has adequate information to decide whether the relevant assessment is correct. The issue of whether the Commissioner could obtain the relevant information through a different channel is outside the scope of the current proposal. Inland Revenue is currently considering how the time bar will apply in the future under its Business Transformation programme. Officials consider that the issue of whether a return should be filed to trigger the time bar should be considered as part of that wider review of the time bar. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to the issue being referred to the broader review of the time bar. Issue: Application of the exceptions to the time bar Submissions (EY, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society, Chapman Tripp) The current time bar prevents the Commissioner from increasing an assessment after four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the return is filed. However, exceptions in section 108(2) allow the Commissioner to increase the assessment in certain circumstances. Submitters raised some issues with the application of the exceptions to the time bar in relation to ancillary taxes and AIL. The references in the “omission of income” exception to income of a particular nature or derived from a particular source are inapposite in relation to ancillary taxes or AIL, particularly in relation to FBT and fringe benefits, which are not anyone’s “income”. (EY) There is insufficient guidance on the meaning of the “particular nature” of an amount in section 108(2) in a withholding tax context. It seems clear that section 108(2)(b) should be concerned with whether or not an amount is interest, a dividend or a royalty, and not with the character of the recipient for tax purposes (or, indeed, the circumstances surrounding the receipt or payment). In an AIL/NRWT context, section 108(2)(b) should not apply when a taxpayer who has paid interest discloses the payment as interest in its AIL return provided that the payment remains interest. In particular, it should be clarified that arguments about the status of the recipient as an associate, and therefore whether NRWT applies instead of AIL, should not prevent section 108(1) from applying. This issue is broader than AIL. It was submitted that section 108(2)(b) should be amended to clarify that “particular nature” does not include the characteristics of payees, or the circumstances surrounding an amount. (Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society) 236 It is not entirely clear whether section 108(2) would apply in a situation where an AIL return has inadvertently been filed. There is a risk that Inland Revenue could take an interpretation that the time bar does not apply as interest paid to an associate is of a different nature to interest paid to a non-associated person, and therefore section 108(2) applies to enable a prior assessment to be amended despite the application of the time bar. To ensure that the time bar will apply in this situation, it is submitted that section 108(2) should be amended to provide that this subsection does not apply where AIL has been paid in respect interest income, where NRWT should have been paid instead. This will provide certainty to taxpayers that the time bar will apply in this instance (provided that four years have passed from the end of the income tax year in which a taxpayer has filed their return). (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The proposal is intended to be consistent with the current law on the time bar, including the current definitions of the terms in the exceptions to the time bar. Officials note that the current exception to the time bar is long-standing, and there is case law on the relevant terms in the provision. The current proposal is not intended to affect those interpretations of the relevant terms. The current time bar and the exceptions to the time bar are currently being reviewed as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Officials consider it to be more appropriate to review the current exceptions to the time bar as part of that broader review, which will be able to consider the changing nature of the information required to be provided and the role of the exceptions to the time bar. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, subject to the issue being referred to the broader review of the time bar. Issue: Starting date for the time bar Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, McIsaacs Ltd) The time bar should apply four years from the date an income tax return has been filed rather than four years from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return. Alternatively, the ancillary tax return should not be treated as an income tax return so that the time bar is linked to a “tax year”. Like GST, many ancillary taxes relate to periods that are shorter than a tax year. They should be treated in the same way as GST for time bar purposes, with the time bar commencing in the next period after the return is filed rather than from the beginning of the following tax year. Submitters noted that under the current proposal the time bar could operate after five years has elapsed in some situations, rather than four years. 237 Comment The broader issue of when the time bar should apply generally for income tax returns is outside the scope of the current amendment, and will be considered as part of the broader review of the time bar as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Officials agree with the narrower submission that a different rule (to the general rule that applies to income tax returns) should apply for ancillary taxes and AIL. Recommendation That the submission be accepted that the time bar for ancillary tax and AIL should commence in the next period after the return is filed. Issue: AIL returns should be treated as NRWT returns for other purposes Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As AIL returns will be effectively treated as NRWT returns for the purposes of the time bar, further amendments should also be made to confirm that AIL returns are NRWT returns for the purposes of the types of decisions that are deemed correct (and can only be challenged in challenge proceedings). If this amendment is not made, it would be open for the Commissioner to challenge a tax position taken by a taxpayer in an AIL return outside of the current dispute mechanisms. Comment The proposed amendment treats the filing of an AIL return as having met the requirements for filing a NRWT return only for the purposes of the time bar. The broader issue of how AIL returns should be treated for the disputes process under the Tax Administration Act 1994 is outside the scope of the current proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Imputation credits should be included under the time bar Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Imputation should be included as an ancillary tax for the purposes of the statute bar. Comment The proposal is only intended to apply the current time bar rules to ancillary taxes and AIL. This means that further income tax and imputation penalty tax, which relate to the imputation regime, would be subject to the time bar under the proposals. 238 However, the current proposal does not extend the time bar to tax credits, such as imputation credits. Officials consider that imputation credits are of a different nature to ancillary taxes and AIL, and so are outside the scope of the current proposal. Officials consider that it is more appropriate to review whether tax credits should be subject to the time bar as part of the broader review of the time bar being undertaken as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to the issue being referred to the broader review of the time bar. Issue: Consequences of amendments to losses or tax credits Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) When an amendment to a loss or other credit is outside the statute bar any consequential adjustment to an ancillary tax should be subject to the time bar. The current prohibition on decreasing a net loss prevents the Commissioner from amending an earlier year to reduce a loss and thereby effectively increase the amount of tax payable in a later year. The proposed amendment does not alter this in relation to ancillary tax. For most ancillary taxes an earlier return does not affect a later return so this is of no consequence. However, this is not the case in relation to further income tax, imputation penalty tax, foreign dividend payment (FDP), further FDP, FDP penalty tax and research and development tax credits. Alternatively, a section similar to section 108(1B) should be included so it is clear it applies to imputation penalty tax, further income tax, further FDP, FDP penalty tax, and research and development tax credits. Comment Officials note that the remaining FDP provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 are being repealed as part of the current bill, as the FDP regime is being repealed. This issue will, therefore, not arise for FDP, further FDP, or FDP penalty tax. Officials consider this issue should be considered as part of the broader review of whether tax credits should be subject to the time bar. As noted above, officials consider that imputation credits are of a different nature to ancillary taxes and AIL, and so are outside the scope of the current proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to the issue being referred to the broader review of the time bar. 239 Issue: Description of application date in the Commentary Clause 295 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The language used when describing the application of the time bar reforms in the Commentary to the bill is unclear. It could be read as requiring four years to have passed from the date of introduction of the bill for the time bar to apply to an ancillary tax. The submitter subsequently confirmed with officials that the intended effect of the proposal is that the Commissioner will not be able to increase an amount in an ancillary tax or AIL return after the date of introduction of the bill, provided the requirements of the time bar are met. This means that once the bill has been enacted the time bar will apply to ancillary or AIL returns filed four or more years prior (subject to the other time bar exceptions). The submitter noted this interpretation is consistent with the wording of the current legis lat ion. Comment The Commentary noted that: The proposed amendment will apply from the date of introduction of the bill. This will mean that the Commissioner cannot increase an amount in an ancillary tax or AIL return if four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the relevant return and the introduction of the bill (unless one of the existing exemptions applies). Officials acknowledge that while the first sentence detailed the application date for the proposed amendment, the second sentence explaining its application could have been clearer. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 240 RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE MAXIMUM FBT RATE RULE Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Section MB 7B(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and Schedule 3, clause 12A(4) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 should be amended to include a savings provision for past calculations of the FBT rate applied (other than the maximum rate) to employees’ short term charge facilities used in the calculation of adjusted net income and family scheme income. Comment From 1 April 2014, employees have been required to include short-term charge facilities (such as vouchers) from their employer in their family scheme income (used to determine Working for Families tax credits, community services card and student allowance entitlements) and in their adjusted net income (used to determine student loan repayments). Included in the calculation of the value of an employee's short-term charge facility is the amount (if any) of FBT paid by their employer. The bill proposes to retrospectively give employees an option to apply the maximum FBT rate in situations when they are unable to obtain the FBT rate their employer used. This means if an employee applied the maximum FBT rate in order to finalise their social policy assessments (and determine their obligations and entitlements) quickly, they will not have breached the law. It does not require employees to apply the maximum FBT rate if they know the rate used by their employer. If an employee chooses the maximum rate, but at a later date they are able to obtain the rate their employer applied, their obligation or assessment can be amended (within the time bar rules). Providing an option to apply a default maximum FBT rate enables employees to quickly finalise assessments without undermining the fairness and integrity of the social policy schemes as short-term charge facilities are equivalent to cash wages. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 241 242 Remedial amendments 243 244 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO TAX POOLING PROVISIONS Clauses 163, 169, 204 and 209 Issue: Tax pooling should be available to taxpayers who have filed an AIL return and were then reassessed for NRWT Summary of submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society, Tax Pooling Intermediary Association) The pooling rules should be made available to taxpayers who have filed an AIL return and were then reassessed for NRWT. This would be in line with other amendments in the bill which clarify that a taxpayer who has incorrectly paid AIL instead of NRWT will have assessments raised for the unpaid NRWT. From a policy perspective, a taxpayer should be able to use tax pooling to meet a NRWT liability when they have mistakenly filed an AIL return. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Law Society) The logic of applying the time bar protection by treating an AIL return as an NRWT return should also apply to the tax pooling rules. Not to extend the amendment would create an unprincipled inconsistency in the Act. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Inland Revenue has not interpreted the existing legislation in the spirit in which it has been intended. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) If taxpayers are not allowed to utilise tax pooling in these circumstances, they are encouraged not to inform Inland Revenue that they have taken an incorrect position and file a voluntary disclosure. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The policy behind the amendments relating to ancillary taxes and the time bar is different from the policy for allowing the use of tax pooling funds for reassessed returns. Further consideration would be necessary to determine the full implications of submitters’ proposals to allow tax pooling to be used to meet the NRWT liability when an AIL return has previously been filed. This cannot be achieved within the timeline for this bill. The matter could, however, be considered for future inclusion in the Tax Policy Work Programme. Officials consider that the existing legislation has been interpreted consistently with current policy. Failure to disclose the correct tax position is a breach of taxpayers’ obligations under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 245 Issue: Timing of debits and credits Summary of submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Tax Pooling Intermediary Association) The drafting of the amendment to section OB 26 does not work as intended in all circumstances to create an offsetting credit for (and eliminate) the second debit on the same date that the debit arises. A timing issue could arise where there is a sale of tax and the date of the credit to eliminate the debit from the sale does not match the date of the debit for the sale of tax. There is a risk of a debit balance inappropriately arising at the end of the prior tax year. The credit date for the elimination of the double debit under section OB 26 should be the day the imputation debit arises under section OB 35(4). (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) We do not consider this to be the policy intent of the proposed amendments. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The wording of the provisions determining when the credit arises (for individuals, companies or consolidated groups) is unclear as it could be interpreted as either the effective date the purchaser acquires the tax or the date of the transaction. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Tax Pooling Intermediary Association) If it is the former, there is a risk that the credit is reinstated before a continuity breach and is ineffective. (Tax Pooling Intermediary Association). The same matching rule should apply for refunds of pooling funds. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Section OB 26 should apply when section OB 41 cancels an imputation credit under section OB 6. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Subpart OP relating to consolidated imputation groups should be updated consistently with the above. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Section OP 23 should also apply when an imputation credit in the consolidated imputation group’s imputation credit account under section OP 42 cancels an imputation credit under section OP 9. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) When a company that has a shareholder continuity breach pays tax prior to joining a consolidated imputation group, and when there is a refund or sale of tax relating to tax paid in a pre-continuity breach period, the rules do not appear to work in a non-tax pooling context in section OP 30 nor in a tax pooling context in section OP 23. Sections OP 30 and OP 23 should recognise the credits and debits in sections OB 5 and 6 and OB 41 as relevant. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment The tax pooling amendments that are part of this bill are of a remedial nature only, and are consistent with the current policy on imputation rules as they apply to tax pooling transactions. 246 Tax pooling imputation credit issues in relation to both individual companies and consolidated groups that have been raised by submitters could be considered for future inclusion in the Tax Policy Work Programme. Making changes to the current tax pooling imputation framework to deal with isolated issues may have implications for the totality of the imputation rules applicable to tax pooling. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 247 ZERO PERCENT AIL RATE FOR SECURITIES ISSUED VIA A LIMITED DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT No clause Submissions (ANZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Chapman Tripp) At present, for offers of securities under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 to access the 0% rate of AIL under section 86IB(1)(b)(i) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 the issue of a security must be either: • a regulated offer for the purposes of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013; or • an offer referred to in clause 19 of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Registered banks are exempt from the regulated offer regime as they are not required to issue a product disclosure statement. Therefore a registered bank can only access the 0% rate of AIL if the issue of a security is an offer referred to in clause 19 of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Clause 19 of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 requires the offer of a quoted financial product – in essence an offer of the “same class” as a previously issued security quoted on a licensed market. If a registered bank does not issue under an offer of a quoted financial product, it will be required to issue via a limited disclosure document process. This may occur when the registered bank amends the documentation of a security issue, such that the issue will not be of the “same class” as a previously issued security quoted on a licensed market. However, subsequent security issues of the same class as those offered via a limited disclosure document can be an offer of a quoted financial product. The only material difference between a limited disclosure document and a product disclosure statement is that a limited disclosure document is not required to disclose certain financial information about the issuer. A limited disclosure document contains greater disclosures than that required for a quoted financial product. However, a limited disclosure document issue will not qualify for the 0% rate of AIL as it will not be a regulated offer or an offer referred to in clause 19 of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. This appears to be an unintended gap in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act. If the gap is not remedied, then whenever a registered bank issues a new class of listed securities, the first offer will not qualify for the 0% rate AIL, but all subsequent offers (being offers of quoted financial products), would qualify for the 0% rate AIL. The Stamp and Cheque Duties Act should be amended to allow limited disclosure document offers to access the 0% rate of AIL. Given this clear and unintended gap in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act, any amendment should be retrospective for any interest paid on lim ited disclosure document offers post 1 December 2014, or at least when the bill was introduced to Parliament. 248 Comment Officials agree that there is no policy rationale to prevent a security issued under a limited disclosure document from qualifying for 0% AIL when an otherwise identical security issued under a quoted financial product would qualify. This was an unintended omission and should be rectified, with retrospective effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 249 TAXABLE BONUS ISSUES AND AVAILABLE SUBSCRIBED CAPITAL Clause 22 Submission (Chapman Tripp) There is no policy reason why the amendment that clarifies that imputation credits attached to a taxable bonus issue are not included in the available subscribed capital should not apply retrospectively. Comment Officials do not consider that a sufficient case has been made to depart from the standard approach of applying amendments prospectively. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 250 CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS Issue: Interest deductibility when life insurer receives exempt income Clause 38 Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The submitters supports the proposed change and application date. Comment The bill proposes an amendment to section DB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 confirming that groups of companies that include a life insurer, including the life insurer itself, are able to deduct interest expenses notwithstanding that the life insurer may have received tax-exempt income from a life reinsurance treaty with a non-resident. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Treatment of fees for managing policyholder investments Clauses 61 to 63, 65 and 66 Submission (AMP, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Financial Services Council, KPMG) A range of comments have been expressed on the proposed changes codifying the treatment of transfers of value (not related to life risk) from the policyholder base to the shareholder base by a life insurer when the transfer relates to the management of policyholder funds (investments) by the life insurer. Submitters’ comments include: • support for the proposed changes; (AMP, K PMG ) • the scope of the proposed charges: – should take into account explicit and implicit charges, and (AM P) – is too narrow and should be expanded to include “management, distribution and administration related services”; (AMP, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Financial Services Council) • additional consequential changes are needed to provide further certainty regarding the interaction of the proposed changes with the wider taxation rules for life insurance; (AMP, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) 251 • the application date of sections EY 2 and EY 3 should be backdated to 1 July 2010. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Historical tax positions from 1 July 2010 to 1 April 2005 not covered by the proposed amendments should be provided for. (KPMG) Comment Each of the submissions points are considered in turn. Support for the proposed changes Support for the change is noted. Scope of the change: consideration and services covered by the proposed amendments The scheme and purpose of the taxation rules for life insurance means that the life insurer is required to assess its tax liabilities using separate calculations to reflect two bases of taxable income: • a shareholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of the life insurer’s shareholders); and • a policyholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of policyholders). Income and deductions are recognised using the general income and deduction rules in parts C and D of the Income Tax Act 2007, with the addition of special rules in subpart EY to deal with unique timing and allocation issues inherent with life insurance products. All references in this section are to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the new life insurance rules that took effect from 1 July 2010. The changes proposed in this bill codify the treatment of transfers between the shareholder base and policyholder base in response to the structure of the Income Tax Act. For income tax purposes, there are two bases of calculating taxable income within the one taxpayer (the life insurer). As such, the proposed changes set the tax treatment of certain intra-entity transactions and ensure symmetry. The charges in question do not relate to life risk, the taxation of which is specifically integrated into the Income Tax Act, but instead concern the life insurer’s management of funds set aside to meet in whole or in part future policyholder claims from life insurance policies. The “investment management services” referred to in the proposed amendments are those services provided by the life insurer to policyholders in respect of those pooled policyholder funds. The proposed amendments apply to life insurance policies that are savings product policies and not profit participation policies. The proposed changes deal with charges that have two critical elements: • The charge is based on a contractual relationship between the life insurer and the policyholder (and should be documented in the life insurance policy). • The charge or “consideration” is related to managing policyholder investments. The charges are typically sourced from premiums. 252 Officials consider the term “consideration” is sufficiently comprehensive to deal with all situations where there is a contractual obligation on the policyholder to pay or otherwise compensate the life insurer for providing administrative and other financial intermediat ion services related to managing funds set aside to meet future policyholder claims (“policyholder funds”). Submissions recommend that the scope of the change be expanded to include “management, distribution and administration-related services”. Submissions also note that deductions for these types of costs are allowed for comparable savings-vehicles such as unit trusts and superannuation schemes. Officials note that external costs of the nature described in submissions allocated to the policyholder base under section EY 16 are generally deductible under Part D when there is a nexus to those costs to investment income (section EY 15). A more likely situation, however, is that these costs are allocated to the shareholder base under section EY 20 if they are deductible under Part D. The shareholder base would then seek reimbursement for these costs, including any fee for financial intermediation associated with managing the pool of policyholder investments, from the policyholder base via an internal charge, (to which new sections EY 16B and EY 19B now specify the tax outcome). The composition of the charge is of itself not material. What is material is that the charge by the life insurer (the shareholder base) on the policyholder base is for investment management services for managing policyholder funds and supported by the life policy documentation. This can include the on-charge or cost-recovery of expenditure incurred by the life insurer and allocated to the shareholder base as well as a margin or fee for financial intermediation services provided by the life insurer. To assist users of the legislation, officials recommend the term “investment management services” be defined by reference to the financial intermediation services contractually provided by the life insurer in administering policyholder funds attributable to non-participat ion policies. Need for consequential changes Submitters have noted that the proposed changes introducing new sections EY 16B and EY 19B require integration into the wider life insurance rules, specifically: • the link between sections EY 16 and proposed EY 16B; (AM P, EY, Financial Services Council) • the link between sections EY 19 and proposed EY 19B; and (Financial Services Council) • the link between proposed sections EY 19B and section EY 20. (AM P) Given the scope and application of proposed sections EY 16B and EY 19B discussed above, officials consider a consequential change to section EY 16 could be made to ensure that deductions are not double counted. The effect of the change to section EY 16 would be to remove from its scope deductions claimed under section EY 16B. The new scheme and purpose would be created whereby the calculation of tax for the policyholder base would be based on: income allocated to the policyholder base (section EY 15) less \[deductions for allocated third party expenditure (section EY 16) plus deductions for internal charges by the shareholder base (section EY 16B)\] 253 This formula broadly replicates the proposed legislative structure that the bill creates for the purposes of recognising shareholder base income, whereby income to the shareholder base arising under proposed section 19B is excluded from the scope of section EY 19. The proposed amendment excluding such income from the scope of section EY 19 (clause 65) is supported by AMP. It is intended to respond to the concern identified by the Financial Services Council and prevent double counting of income for the shareholder base. Officials consider, however, for completeness, a rule preventing double counting of income could assist interpretation of the new rules. Officials consider that section EY 20, in its current state, allows life insurers to allocate allowable deductions under Part D to the shareholder base. A direct reference to section EY 19B in section EY 20 is not necessary to facilitate deductions allocated to the shareholder base. Application date and historical tax positions The objective of the application date is to confirm, from the 2015 income year, the treatment of such charges. The objective is not to require life insurers to revisit earlier tax positions. Submissions argue that the proposed application date for the changes to sections EY 2 and EY 3 (which describe for tax purposes what is shareholder base income and deductions and policyholder base income and deductions) should have the same application date proposed for sections EY 16B and EY 19B. Officials agree. The issue raised by KPMG in its submission raises wider issues about when the Income Tax Act should describe an amount as not income. From a scheme and purpose analysis, this would be unusual and outside the scope of the amendments to the life insurance rules proposed in this bill. These wider matters mean that officials would like to defer consideration of this submission for a later bill, should a legislative solution be necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. The following changes are recommended to the proposed treatment of fees for managing policyholder investments: • That the term “investment management services” be defined by reference to the financial intermediation services contractually provided by the life insurer in administering policyholder funds attributable to non-participation policies. • That a general rule be provided that prevents double counting in connection with the interactions of sections EY 16 and EY 16B, and EY 19 and EY 19B. • That the changes to sections EY 2 and EY 3 validate earlier tax positions if a life insurer has applied sections EY 16B and EY 19B in a tax position taken between 1 July 2010 (the start date of the life insurance rules) and before 1 April 2005. 254 Issue: Discount requirements for future amounts Clauses 64, 67, 70 and 71 Submission (AMP, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Financial Services Council, EY) The submitters support the proposed change. Earlier tax positions that have used discounted future amounts as described in the proposed changes should be validated. Comment The life insurance rules require future amounts to be discounted and, when appropriate, net of tax. The bill proposes to update these references in sections EY 17(2), EY 21(2), EY 28(6) and EY 29(8) so that future value is consistent with values the life insurer used in its financial reports. The change means that future values will not be calculated by reference to a risk-free rate. References to discounting in connection with reinsurance premiums and claims are also removed by the bill in sections EY 28(5) and EY 29(6). The changes apply from the first income year beginning after the day the bill is enacted. Submitters note that some life insurers have already taken tax positions using a discount method described in the bill as it produced more accurate and appropriate cashflow values. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Tax positions taken in earlier income years as if the changes in clauses 64, 67, 70 and 71 had application should be validated. Issue: Treatment of excess policyholder allowable deductions Clause 61 Submission (AMP, Financial Services Council) A further change is needed to clarify the treatment of excess policyholder deductions on the transfer of life insurance business between life insurers. Comment Submitters have recommended that the Income Tax Act specify the tax treatment of excess policyholder allowable deductions (“excess deductions”) that are the subject of a transfer of life insurance business. While this is a new matter, it is closely related to the proposed amendment to section EY 2(5) that establishes that excess deductions that cannot be subtracted from policyholder income for an income year are carried forward as policyholder base allowable deductions for the next year. 255 As excess deductions are not subject to any continuity requirement when life insurance business is sold to another life insurer, any excess deductions attaching to that business should, in principle, also follow. The submitters recommend the insertion of a new rule into the Income Tax Act that codifies the treatment when excess deductions are transferred. To ensure the excess deductions are correctly carried over, officials recommend that the Income Tax Act specify that the transfer does not affect the excess deduction carried forward in the policyholder base. It will be necessary, however, for the life insurers concerned to calculate the closing and opening balance for the excess deduction. It will also be necessary for life insurers to hold records on the composition of the excess deduction (that is, what deductions make up the quantum). Officials are aware of only one transfer where the question of excess deductions has been identified as a concern. Given the record-keeping requirement and calculation of opening and closing values, officials recommend that the change should not apply retrospectively to 1 July 2010, but instead apply from the 2016–17 income year (starting 1 April 2016) as suggested by submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. A new set of rules should be inserted in the Income Tax Act that provides that the carry- forward of policyholder base allowable deductions is unaffected by the transfer of life insurance business. The change should apply from the start of the 2016–17 income year. Issue: Miscellaneous technical matters Clauses 61(2), 70(2), (3) and (6), 71(2) and (3) Submissions (Matters raised by officials) A number of changes are recommended to improve readers’ understanding of the proposed changes to the taxation rules for life insurance business. These are set out below: Section EY 2(5): Policyholder excess allowable deductions – ordering rule Clause 61(2) clarifies when excess policyholder allowable deductions (section EY 2(5)) should be used. To further assist readers, officials recommend an additional rule that specifies that the deductions that make up the quantum of excess deductions should be applied in the order in which they were incurred. The change should also support the operation of the recommendation to clarify the tax consequences when life insurance business is transferred. The change should apply for income years beginning on the day the bill is enacted. 256 Sections EY 28(5) and EY 29(6): Shareholder base other profit – valuation and attribution of amounts related to life reinsurance Clauses 70(2) and (3), and 71(2) and (3) amend the measurement of amounts related to life reinsurance premiums and claims. A technical change is recommended that ensures that the amounts relate to the current income year. The change should apply for income years beginning on the day the bill is enacted, to align with the substantive changes. Section EY 28(6): Shareholder base other profit – description of bonus declarations Clause 70(6) amends the definition of “policy liability” in section EY 28(6). A change is recommended to rephrase the expression about future bonus declarations by removing the word “anticipated” to instead refer to “future vestings”. The change should apply for income years beginning on the day the bill is enacted, to align with the substantive changes. Section DB 23: Cost of revenue account property Officials recommend a new clause to ensure that life insurance rules are fully integrated into the rest of the Income Tax Act. The application of section DB 23 does not currently take into account that subpart EY apportions a life insurer’s expenditure between a shareholder base and a policyholder base. As drafted, section DB 23(2) denies a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving income that is tax-exempt under section CX 55 (proceeds from the sale of investments held by a portfolio investment entity). It is possible that expenditure to which section DB 23(2) applies could be allocated under section EY 20 to the shareholder base. Officials consider that this expenditure should be deductible when it relates to a life insurer’s shareholder base under section EY 19 or deemed income under section EY 19B. Officials recommend that the application of section DB 23(2) be clarified so that it does not have effect on expenditure allocated to the shareholder base under the life insurance rules. The change should apply from 1 July 2010 or income years that include 1 July 2010, the date the life insurance taxation rules were substantively amended. Comment The purpose of the recommended changes is to help life insurers meet their obligations and deal with legislative housekeeping matters. The changes do not affect current policy settings. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 257 TAXABLE BONUS ISSUES – COST BASE Clause 45 Submission (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) All taxpayers that hold shares received from taxable bonus issues should be able to recognise a cost base for those shares. Comment The bill proposes to insert a rule that recognises, on disposal of shares received from a taxable bonus issue, a cost for those shares. The change applies to shares received from taxable bonus issues made on and after the date of enactment. Submissions consider that this application date will continue to maintain double tax on existing taxable bonus issues. Officials acknowledge the concern but do not have a sense of the scale and likelihood of the problem for taxpayers. Officials are also aware that transactions involving the transfer of shares by a company to its shareholders can be structured under existing law in such a way that it eliminates the double tax problem described in submissions. The application date proposed in the bill recognises that the proposed amendment comes with certain compliance costs associated with holding information about the cost of the shares. It was not considered reasonable to impose those costs on existing share stocks. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 258 PRE-AMALGAMATION LOSSES Clause 124 Issue: “Savings” provision Submission (EY) The proposed amendment to section IE 3 should not be retrospective but should apply for income years commencing after enactment of the bill. A lternat ively, a “savings” provision should be included to protect the position of taxpayers who have taken tax positions, used losses and filed returns based on the legislation as it has stood since enactment of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment The amendment proposed is to correct an unintended change occurring in the rewrite of income tax legislation. The amendment validates tax positions taken on the basis of the policy but officials agree that it is appropriate to include a savings provision to protect tax positions taken on the basis of the wording of the provision before enactment of this amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 259 LIMITS ON REFUNDS FOR ICA COMPANIES Clause 257 Issue: Clarification of drafting Submission (EY) Clarification is required to confirm that taxpayers may continue to obtain refunds based on the credit balances shown in: • annual imputation credit account (ICA) returns to the latest 31 March filed before and separately from, their returns of income for the equivalent income year; and • part-period returns up to a current date under section 70(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment Under the general rule applying to ICA companies, if an ICA company is due a refund of income tax at 1 August 2016 and had not filed its annual ICA return for the tax year ending 31 March 2016, it would not be able to receive that refund of income tax. However, the general rule is relaxed by section RM 13(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for companies having extension of time arrangements and who have not filed their annual ICA return by 31 March 2016 to permit the amount of the refund to be compared with the ICA balance at the preceding 31 March (in this example, 31 March 2015). Officials consider that the first point of the submitters needs no additional clarification as the amendment only applies if the annual ICA return for the latest 31 March has not been filed, irrespective of whether the ICA return is filed with the annual return of income or separately. Officials agree that is would be useful to clarify the relationship of the amendment with the general rule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 260 THIN CAPITALISATION AND THE POTENTIAL NEW OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF KIWIBANK No clause Submission (Kiwibank, New Zealand Post) Sections FE 2(5) and FE 36B of the Income Tax Act 2007 are intended to ensure the thin- capitalisation regime applies appropriately to the New Zealand Post group. They do this by splitting the group for the purposes of applying the thin capitalisation regime and ensuring that the non-banking part of the group is subject to the thin capitalisation rules for non-banks. In the absence of these sections the thin capitalisation rules for banking groups would have applied to the entire New Zealand Post group. Section FE 36B(1)(a) requires that “Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand has a voting interest of 100% in the registered bank”. On 6 April 2016 it was announced that New Zealand Post had commenced a sale process that could see New Zealand Post selling a 25 percent share of Kiwibank to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and 20 percent to ACC. Assets forming part of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund are owned directly by the Crown. However, ACC is treated as a separate public authority whose shares are held by a notional single person that does not hold anything else. Therefore, even though Kiwibank would remain wholly owned by the Crown or Crown entities, section FE 36B(1)(a) would no longer be satisfied. Accordingly, section FE 36B(1)(a) should be amended to include voting interests in the registered bank held by a public authority. It is expected that the transaction involving the sale of shares to ACC and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund will be completed prior to enactment of the bill. The suggested amendment should apply from 1 July 2016, being the start of New Zealand Post’s current income year. Comment Officials agree with the submitters and support the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 261 FBT AND SPECIFIED INSURANCE PREMIUMS Clauses 25, 31 and 32 Submission (EY) Clarificat ion is required on the intended scope of the proposed definition of “specified insurance premium”, especially the nature and extent of any employee benefits required to bring a policy within the definition. Clarificat ion would be desirab le for any different treatment between policies taken out by employers and those taken out by trustees of employment-related superannuation schemes. The scope of the definition should be limited to situations when employees have enforceable direct or contractual rights to benefit under a policy. Comment Intended scope The intended scope of the proposed legislation relates to: • premiums paid when the benefit of the policy passes to the employee (that is, the employee is entitled to receive claims under the policy); and • premiums paid for life, accident, and medical insurance, and accident, disease or sickness insurance (whether or not fatal) if the insured person is either the employee or the employee’s spouse, civil union partner, de facto partner or their child. We consider the provision is sufficiently clear about its scope and that the above information would be set out in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Employment-related superannuation schemes Further legislative clarification is not thought necessary at this stage. Premiums paid by an employer for a group life policy taken out by the trustees of a superannuation scheme for the benefit of employees who are members of that scheme is a fringe benefit. However, if the scheme is a superannuation fund (broadly, a superannuation scheme registered under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) the payment is not subject to FBT but is subject to employer superannuation contribution withholding tax. Limiting the scope of the definition to situations when enforceable rights exist Officials consider that limiting the scope of the definition to situations when employees have enforceable direct or contractual rights to benefit under a policy would exclude policy benefits routed to employees through the employer. It is intended that benefits of this nature should be subject to FBT. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 262 R&D LOSS TAX CREDIT REMEDIAL CHANGES Clause 148 Submission (EY) Clause 148(3) proposes amending section MX 7(4) to clarify that all equity disposals and transfers from the year a credit was first taken should be included in calculating R&D repayment tax. However, as currently drafted, new section MX 7(4) could capture disposals or transfers of shares in a company from the date the company was formed. There is nothing in the rest of section MX 7(4) that would limit the period or scope to the year a credit was first taken, which is the desired policy intent as stated in the Commentary to this bill. The submission suggests various drafting changes to address this potential overreach. Comment The amendments in clause 148 concern the R&D repayment tax, which is payable if one of three reinstatement events occur. Two of the amendments add an ordering rule for which reinstatement events apply to a given situation if more than one event occurs to the same company. This is necessary because for one reinstatement event (breach of continuity from the effective sale of the company), the company may not have to repay the entire R&D loss tax credit, whereas for the other reinstatement events (if the company is liquidated or migrates) the entire amount of the R&D loss tax credit is required to be repaid. The amendments also seek to clarify the meaning of “shares’ market value” in section MX 7(4)(b), which is used to calculate the R&D repayment tax amount when a breach of continuity takes place. The amended definition clarifies that “shares’ market value” includes all shares disposed of or transferred in the continuity period, not just the disposal or transfer which breached continuity. Officials agree that the wording in clause 148(3) should be clarified so that the calculation under section MX 7(4)(b) applies to transfers or disposals of shares which occurred from the year a credit was first taken, up to and including the reinstatement year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 263 EXEMPT INCOME FROM PERSONAL SERVICES (92 DAY RULE) Clause 30 Issue: Proposed amendment should be expanded Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) That the proposed amendment may create a barrier for New Zealand businesses employing non-residents on a short-term basis, particularly in relat ion to Australian and New Zealand businesses engaging in business with each other. That the 92 day exemption rule should be expanded to 183 days. That the proposal should apply from the 2018–19 income year. Comment Under this provision, New Zealand provides an exemption for income derived from personal services provided in New Zealand by a non-resident if the person is not present in New Zealand for more than 92 days in a tax year. It is possible that two visits across two consecutive tax years may total 184 days within a 12 month period. However, this is inconsistent with the count tests in our network of double taxation agreements and the domestic test of tax residence. The domestic tax residence test contains a personal presence rule, which focuses on whether a person is present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12 month period. The original policy intention and legislation for this exemption was crafted in a period when New Zealand did not have a count test (that is, presence in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12 month period) for determining residency. At that time, the only test of residence was by reference to whether the person had a permanent dwelling place in New Zealand. The proposed amendment updates the law and improves the integrity of the tax system by bringing the count test into line with the domestic residency rule and the similar count test in double taxation agreements for individuals. We do not agree with the submission that unilateral relief provided by the current rule should be expanded to 183 days, as the submission is inconsistent with DTA policy settings. Officials agree it is appropriate that the rule change apply prospectively from a stated tax year. Officials consider the proposal should apply to visits commencing on or after 1 April 2017. This would allow non-residents to be aware of how the 92 day exemption applies to their circumstances. If the amendment applied from the date of assent, a non-resident individual may need to more fully consider the effect of the proposed change on visits commencing before the bill is enacted. We do not agree the proposal should be deferred until the 2018–19 income year. 264 Recommendations That the submission that the period of relief be expanded to 183 days be declined. That the submission on the application date be, subject to officials' comments, accepted, Issue: Proposed amendment should not proceed Submission ( PwC) That no change be made to the current drafting of section CW 19 and that the measurement of the 92 day exemption threshold continues to be on a 31 March tax year basis. Comment The submission considers that this amendment will give rise to increased compliance requirements for employers and individuals. Officials consider that as the proposed amendment is prospective, it is unlikely to have significant impact on compliance costs. Existing guidelines for non-resident employees and employers of non-resident persons are not affected by the proposals. Non-resident individuals coming to New Zealand to perform personal services prior to coming to New Zealand will continue: • to be aware of the 92 day count test and its proposed amendment; • to be able to apply for an exemption certificate if they do not wish to have their New Zealand income subject to PAYE; and • to be aware of the circumstances in which they will be required to file an income tax return. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 265 DRAFTING ISSUE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 81(4)(ec) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to refer to section 191 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 rather than section 28B of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. Comment The Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016 amended section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to share information with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and with WorkSafe for the enforcement of employment standards. The amendment referred to section 28B of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. This Act has been repealed. The provision should be amended to refer to section 191 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. The amendment should apply from 2 June 2016, the date the amendment to section 81(4)(ec) came into force. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 266 CLAUSE 82 (AMENDED SECTION FE 28) BE OMITTED Submission (Matter raised by officials) Submission Clause 82 (amended section FE 28) should be omitted as the amendment is no longer necessary as it overlaps with an earlier amendment made in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 267 AVAILABLE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTION AMOUNT AND CAPITAL LOSSES Clauses 23(1) and 339 Submission (EY, Russell McVeagh) That the proposed changes need revising to deal with situations where the deficit between the cost of the property and its sale price is less than the depreciation deduction losses. Comment Officials agree with the submission that the calculation should not result in a capital loss being less than zero. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 268 GENERAL DRAFTING AND COMMENTARY MATTERS Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Various submitters raised general observations relating to discrepancies between the proposed legis lat ion and information provided in the Commentary to the bill. These principally relate to discrepancies in section references and application dates. Comment Although not mandatory to provide, commentaries have been made available when tax bills are introduced and are intended to provide useful background to the proposed legislation. While every endeavour is made to ensure that commentaries are correct in every way at publication, variances between the Commentary and the proposed legislation can, regrettably, sometimes occur. To help address matters raised by the submitters, additional steps have been added to the quality control processes in place around the compilation of bill commentaries. Where appropriate, discrepancies between application dates referenced in the Commentary and the proposed legislation, as identified by submitters, have been clarified under the relevant items in this officials’ report. There was found to be no discrepancy between the Commentary and the proposed legislation in relation to clause 239(3). Recommendation That the submissions be noted, and addressed where appropriate. 269 MISCELLANEOUS DRAFTING AND MINOR TYPOGRAPHICAL MATTERS Submiss ion (EY, Russell McVeagh) The submitters made a number of minor drafting suggestions relating to various provisions. Comment The submissions have been noted and changes made where appropriate. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 270

The main change in the package is the introduction of the Accounting Income Method (AIM). AIM allows businesses to pay their provisional tax based on a calculation prepared by their accounting software. Submitters were highly supportive of AIM and believed it would ease the burden of provisional tax and make tax simpler for small businesses. Submitters considered that the success of AIM depends on ensuring that its final design is simple and submitted that Inland Revenue will need to sacrifice accuracy to achieve this. The other measures in the package: • extend the safe harbour for use-of-money interest (UOMI); • remove UOMI from the first two instalments for standard uplift taxpayers; • enable companies to make tax payments on behalf of shareholder-employees; • allow contractors subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate and expand the rules to labour-hire firms and enable voluntary withholding agreements; • reform the late payment penalty by no longer imposing the 1% incremental late payment penalty from new GST, income tax, and Working for Families tax credit debt; • enable Inland Revenue to share tax for significant debts with credit reporting agencies and share information with the Registrar of Companies about certain offences; and • provide a number of supplementary simplification measures to make the tax rules simpler. Submitters were generally supportive of these measures. In particular there was strong support for the extension of the safe harbour and the removal of the incremental late payment penalty. Submissions focused on the technical detail of all the measures in the package. In response to these submissions we are recommending a number of changes to the detail of the proposals, with the majority of the changes intended to provide greater certainty about how the proposals are intended to apply. The main four changes proposed are to: • clarify the ability of taxpayers using the standard uplift method to “square up” their provisional tax at the third payment date; • simplify the design of the provisional tax attribution rule; • provide an extension of time for labour-hire firms to implement the withholding tax changes; and • make changes to the drafting of the threshold for reportable unpaid tax to address “Henry VIII” concerns raised by the Regulations Review Committee. 4 5 Provisional tax: accounting income method 6 7 ACCOUNTING INCOME METHOD (AIM) Clauses 27-54 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Deloitte, Rightway, EY, TaxLab, AIM Working Group Software Providers (MYOB, XERO, CCH and Reckon), Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC) All submitters supported the amendments proposed in the bill to introduce a new provisional tax method based on accounting income as calculated by accounting software. As the amendments proposed will ease the burden of provisional tax they are encouraged and supported by submitters. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Design and introduction of AIM method Submissions (PwC, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, TaxLab) All submitters agreed that the successful introduction and implementation of the accounting income method (AIM) depends on ensuring its final design is simple. The submitters maintain that Inland Revenue will need to acknowledge it will have to sacrifice a certain level of accuracy to achieve this. The introduction of AIM needs to be well publicised with clear guidance given, in line with the user-friendly nature of the software. It must also acknowledge the important role the accounting industry has in assisting their clients with the use of accounting software. Inland Revenue should also be careful in communications regarding AIM not to create the impression of actual cost reductions to taxpayers when they use AIM as these may not actually eventuate. Comment Officials agree that the design of AIM must be based on simplicity. It is accepted that there will be an accuracy trade-off to achieve this. To ensure the design of AIM is kept simple and effective for those using it, Inland Revenue has a working group made up of software providers and accounting industry representatives to assist Inland Revenue in designing industry-led solutions. There is also a strategic input group made up of members of the business and accounting professions to provide oversight and a practical perspective on the design of AIM and its use in business. 8 Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Implementation date of AIM Submission (TaxLab, AIM Working Group Software Providers) Submitters supported the later implementation date of 1 April 2018 for AIM. One submitter wanted to note that while it would be achievab le, it is still ambitious. (TaxLab) Tax functionality is complex, time consuming and expensive to develop and there is need for constant communication between software developers and Inland Revenue. Comment Officials have committed to working with software providers through the use of its AIM software providers working group, and provide regular communication through that group. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Date of election to use AIM Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposals require a person to have chosen to use the method before the first instalment date. The submission proposes this be extended to be “on or before” the first instalment date. Comment Officials agree that adding “on or before” to the wording would enable taxpayers to select to use the AIM on the first instalment date. An amendment to address this has been proposed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 9 Issue: Self-certification process Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, AIM Working Group Software Providers, TaxLab) Some submitters expressed concern with regard to the risks to the integrity of the tax system through the possibility of incorrect calculation of provisional tax by an AIM-capable accounting system that incorrectly self-certifies. It was also suggested that the Commissioner should take responsibility for ensuring AIM-capable providers meet the criteria rather than a self- certification process as this would improve certainty and reliability. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The Commissioner should publish a comprehensive register of approved AIM providers on its website that a taxpayer can access. (K PMG) Other submitters supported self-certification as a method of certifying software providers as it is the most efficient method of certification for their industry and is consistent with the current e- filing approval processes. (AIM Working Group Software Providers, TaxLab) Self-certification does require some level of auditing to be effective and Inland Revenue will need to ensure it has the skills and capability to audit given the reliance that small taxpayers place on certified systems. (TaxLab) AIM can be used successfully by larger businesses however the certification process described for businesses with a turnover of under $5 million will not be suitable for larger taxpayers. If the Government considers extending AIM to larger taxpayers, basing the approval on the software itself is not going to be a suitable basis. Approving the process by which the provisional tax payments are calculated should be used instead. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials consider the process of self-certification through statutory declaration to be the most effective and efficient way to certify software providers. It is consistent with other approval processes. The alternative is for Inland Revenue to audit each system, which places an undue burden on resourcing and may result in delays in certification that can cause bias to the delayed providers and taxpayers who wish to use those products. The use of a statutory declaration and the resulting criminal implications of falsifying or misleading Inland Revenue about the certified status of a software provider will ensure there an incentive to maintain their certified status. Inland Revenue is engaged in consultation with interested parties on how it might extend AIM to larger taxpayers and continues to engage with that submitter on a modified process. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 10 Issue: AIM-capable accounting system definition Submission (AIM Working Group Software Providers, TaxLab) The submitter supported the definition of what an AIM-capable accounting system must be before it can offer AIM to its customers. (AIM Working Group Software Providers) The requirement to have an up-to-date software package should not force a package to update if that update has no impact on AIM calculations themselves. Many software products are made up of a system of connected products. As drafted, the tax calculation functionality required must be part of a core software accounting package so separate tax calculation products will not qualify. (TaxLab) Comment Officials note the comments regarding the update of accounting software and will review the legis lat ion to consider clarifyin g that a failure to perform an update that does not relate to the AIM calculation will not mean the software ceases to be AIM-capable. With regard to the meaning of the term “core accounting package”, it was intended that the term “package” be broad enough to include a system of connected products. Officials will review the drafting and consider clarifying that a core accounting package can include one or more connected software products. Recommendation That the submission regarding the update of software be accepted. That the submission referring to the term “package” be referred to the drafters for consideration for clarification. Issue: Removal from AIM during an income year Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Use of the estimation model in revocation When a taxpayer is disqualified from using AIM, the proposals is that they are shifted into the estimate provisional tax method. Submitters suggest they should be able to use the uplift method in the instance that their amounts already paid under AIM are sufficient to cover their uplift liab ilit ies. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) In the instance a taxpayer is placed into the estimation provisional tax method, the UOMI implications of that should be limited to a prospective basis, rather than applying retrospectively to the whole year. (K PMG) 11 The Commissioner should not have the ability to recalculate liabilities where the Commissioner determines the amount of provisional tax as calculated under AIM is not reasonably accurate. It is unfair to put in place a provisional tax methodology which is designed to be simple, and yet penalise taxpayers when they fail to consider complex tax obligations. If a taxpayer has not acted in good faith, gross carelessness penalties provide sufficient penalties. (K PMG) Revocation due to lack of provision of statement of activity When a taxpayer has not provided the required statement of activity twice in the year they should not be excluded from AIM if the reason for the failure was out of the taxpayer’s control. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Use of the estimation model in revocation The use of AIM removes the exposure to UOMI. A taxpayer would, however, be disqualified from using AIM in a year when they have failed to meet the requirements for AIM. Being able to transfer into the standard uplift method would effectively allow taxpayers to switch methods mid-year and use this opportunity to reduce their tax liability. Being transferred into the estimation method would place this UOMI exposure back onto the business and is an effective deterrent from switching between methods by intentionally failing to meet the requirements of AIM. Revocation for failing to provide a statement of activity Provid ing a statement of activity is an important requirement of AIM and will be hard coded into the accounting software. The mapping and collection of the information contained in the statement of activity will be processed by the software. The user will then submit the information to Inland Revenue. A statement of activity is required each period. There will be instances when no actual payment of provisional tax is required or a refund is requested and the statement of activity is required to support these circumstances, which are why it is required each period. Failure to provide the first statement will cause Inland Revenue to consult with the taxpayer and failure to provide the second statement will result in removal from the AIM method. A taxpayer would not be held to account for a software failure that caused a statement of activity error. The revocation from AIM into estimate is intended to only apply in the worst cases. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 12 Issue: Disqualification from AIM due to consistently inaccurate assessment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The proposals are that a person is disqualified from using AIM when they have consistently and systematically returned inaccurate assessments of their tax liabilities. This is inappropriate and should be removed. If the purpose of this section is to apply to situations when the taxpayer has deliberately misused AIM, then this would be better dealt with under the gross carelessness provisions and associated penalties. Comment Officials consider that there is a possibility for an inaccurate provisional tax payment amount to be produced despite the business in question using AIM correctly. AIM is designed to match the cashflow of the business and assist business to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. However, some businesses by their very nature may result in inaccurate payments of tax using AIM, despite using AIM correctly. This clause enables Inland Revenue to engage with taxpayers in this situation when their payments result in regular inaccurate payments of tax and steer them towards another provisional tax payment that works better for their business. This is not an immediate response and will instead take into account variances that arise over several income years. Therefore it is not intended to be used to revoke eligibility due to a simple arithmetic error. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Revocation of AIM eligibility for taxpayer Submission (KPMG) The bill should be amended to include a process for revoking AIM eligibility due to the taxpayer ceasing to meet eligibility requirements part-way through a year. The bill is currently silent on this and a provision will help provide certainty. Such a provision should involve requirements on the Commissioner to consult with the taxpayer to rectify any failures. Comment Officials agree clarity is required on the process of revocation during the year however disagree that legislative change is required to confirm this. Consultation with taxpayers is important in this situation and it is standard Inland Revenue procedure to do so in these circumstances. Officials note the concern and requirement for clarity and will ensure consultation is built into the practices and procedures for AIM internally. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 Issue: AIM technical determinations process Submission (Deloitte, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, AI M Working Group Software Providers, TaxLab) Submitters support the Commissioner’s process for making determinations but want public consultation on the content of the determination. They are concerned that commercial software providers may be seen to have too much power or influence over tax policy, which should be driven by the Government and not software providers. Comment The process of developing the technical determination for AIM will engage with the AIM software providers group and Strategic Input Group for consultation on content. The Strategic Input Group comprises leading tax practitioners and members of relevant industry bodies. Officials are happy to discuss the content of these determinations with submitters and have made contact with them. Inland Revenue has not included software providers in the Strategic Input Group to ensure that software providers do not have undue influence over the design of the determination. Recommendation That the submission be noted, and officials discuss the content of the draft determination with submitters as it is developed. Issue: Proposed adjustments within AIM technical determination Submission (PwC, KPMG, TaxLab) The Commentary to the legislation included a summary on the proposed Inland Revenue process for developing the content of the AIM technical determination. Officials must continue to balance the need for absolute accuracy with the benefits of having a simple and easy to apply method. Inland Revenue should only require adjustments shown to generally cause significant differences between accounting and taxable income and not be too pedantic in what it requires from taxpayers during the year. Comment Officials have made contact with the submitters to discuss their comments in more detail as they prepare the technical determination. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 14 Issue: Notice of changes to AIM technical determination Submission (TaxLab) The submitter supports the 120-day lead time built into the determination process. It considers this to be acceptable when it relates to a minor change but Inland Revenue must understand how software development processes work, including business case requirements. For wholesale policy changes, Inland Revenue should ensure software developers are involved from the beginning. Comment Officials appreciate that the software development processes are distinct from its own design processes and that they hold their own challenges with regard to timing and implementation. The quality of the policy design to date has benefited from early engagement with software providers and it is considered this engagement with software providers will continue, especially with regard to any large scale reviews of AIM processes as standard practice. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Adjustments not covered by the AIM technical determination Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amendments allow an AIM-capable accounting system to make adjustments for amounts not included in the Inland Revenue determination relating to tax adjustments for AIM. This is not practical for off-the-shelf accounting systems as reasonable accuracy will depend on the individual circumstances of the business. Comment The determination contained in the proposals will outline the key tax adjustments officials consider necessary for the implementation of AIM. These adjustments are coded into the AIM- capable software packages used by taxpayers. There will possibly be adjustments that would not be compulsory but the user of the software may want to make as part of their provisional tax process. It is at the software provider’s discretion whether they offer this additional capability within their software. The “reasonable accuracy” referred to in this clause is intended to apply when a software provider chooses to code any additional adjustments. It ensures they code these to take the taxpayer closer towards reasonably accurate assessments of tax. This clause applies to the software providers coding and not the use of the software by the taxpayer themselves. It is intended to protect the integrity of the tax system to ensure that the development and coding of AIM-capable accounting software works towards a reasonable accurate tax assessment. 15 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax pooling be allowed for provisional tax payments under AIM Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Tax Pooling Intermediary Association) The taxpayers using AIM should be able to use tax pooling as it will assist with cashflow management in the instance where a business has insufficient cash to make their payments. In particular taxpayers should be able to use tax finance products marketed by the pooling providers. Comment The use of tax pooling for provisional tax payments throughout the income year provides certainty to taxpayers when payments are uncertain. It also assists in situations when provisional tax payments made under the estimate or uplift methods are not matched to the income flows of the business. Provisional tax payments made under AIM would have certainty, would more closely match the income flows of the business and have no UOMI exposure to the taxpayer. AIM aligns the payment of provisional tax with other tax payments like GST and PAYE, for which tax pooling does not apply. Officials therefore believe that AIM effectively removes any benefit to a business from using tax pooling during the income year. The issues of mismatched cashflow to tax payments occur when tax adjustments move the taxable profit further away from accounting profit. Most small businesses keep tax adjusted accounts for simplicity reasons and the adjustments required under the proposed determination have intentionally been kept simple and matched to accounting income to ensure there is minimal movement away from accounting profit to keep AIM payments in line with cashflow. In the instance where a business does have cashflow concerns during the year, they may be able to use their standard banking facilities or when it is a continued issue, choose to use a provisional tax method that better aligns to their cashflow. Pooling itself does not operate as a pure financial institution with regard to short-term loans, rather it facilitates the sale and purchase of tax paid at different dates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 Issue: Tax pooling be allowed for tax disputes giving rise to an additional liability Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) Tax pooling should be permitted to be used for reassessments of year-end residual income tax liability. Comment The proposed legislation is intended to remove AIM taxpayers from using tax pooling for AIM provisional tax payments only and does not exclude those using it for year-end tax disputes or a taxpayer’s year-end terminal tax payment. Officials agree that in both these situations because the amounts are uncertain due to the application of UOMI, a taxpayer can continue to use tax pooling in these occasions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and referred to the drafters for review. Issue: Use-of-money interest, and penalties in AIM Submissions (TaxLab, EY, KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Use-of-money interest Inland Revenue should consider making AIM payments subject to use-of-money interest (UO MI) as it has a low administrative cost for Inland Revenue to administer and has the benefit of providing an incentive to taxpayers to take reasonable care. Another supported the removal of UOMI from AIM. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Reasonable care penalty clarification An AIM taxpayer should not be penalised because an AIM provider’s approval is subsequently revoked. Reasonable care penalties should not be imposed in these circumstances. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Clarification is sought on what “reasonable care” means for AIM. The Commissioner should take a lenient approach in the first few years of AIM. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 17 Comment UOMI Officials consider the removal of UOMI to be a positive step in the development of AIM. It reflects the likely increased number of payments under AIM and gives taxpayers certainty in the amounts they are paying for AIM. The administrative costs to Inland Revenue administering UOMI are irrelevant when compared with the reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers “Reasonable care” penalty clarification Reasonable care in relation to AIM applies to the taxpayer in their use of the software, not in the software itself. The current test for “reasonable care” is whether another taxpayer in similar circumstances would have made the same error. In the first few years it is likely that this comparison will take into account the learning curve that many taxpayers may have in relation to a new method. However, the Commissioner will develop and publish guidance on what would be considered reasonable care under AIM. This penalty is likely to be used rather than loss of AIM eligibility as a sanction against taxpayers who fail to treat items correctly or whose adjustments are not sufficiently accurate. Reasonable care penalties would not be imposed in the situation where an AIM provider’s approval is subsequently revoked. It refers to the use of the software and not the software itself. Recommendation That the submission on making AIM payments subject to UOMI be declined. That the submission on clarification of what “reasonable care” means be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Statement of activity Submission (PwC, TaxLab, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) One submitter expressed concern about overreach in designing the statement of activity, as Inland Revenue does not bear the cost about possible development. The more cost imposed the less possibility there will be for innovation and competition by the software providers. (PwC) Any statement of activity will not provide evidence of robustness of the system, and instead its main role is for statist ical information for Inland Revenue. As such, any objective of robustness should be removed. (TaxLab) The bill does not outline the process by which the Commissioner will determine the information required by taxpayers under the statement of activity. This information is sensitive for taxpayers and should have a consultation process prior to the setting, revocation or amendment of any information requirements. (K PMG) 18 Comment Inland Revenue is working with software providers on the design and content of the statement of activity and has a strong relationship with the AIM providers working group and the strategic input group to ensure that any solution developed has a practical design component. The statement of activity will have purposes beyond statistical information in that it will provide the Commissioner with the information required to discharge her duties in relation to key ratio data, industry outliers, targeted services, further policy design and determining audit selection criteria. As the drafting currently stands, there is no consultative process built into the development of the data to be provided to Inland Revenue by the software providers. Due to the interest shown in this data, officials propose that the scope of the determination be extended to cover the data made available to the Commissioner, and as such, its development will be included in the extensive process outlined for the other matters included in the determination. Recommendation That the submissions be: • noted with regard to potential overreach of Inland Revenue; • declined with regard to removing the objective of robustness from the statement of activity; and • accepted with regard to the process for decisions on data included in the statement of activity and that the legislation be amended to alter the scope of the determination to include the development of the statement of activity. Issue: Use of AIM by partnerships Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) AIM should be available to individual members of a partnership. Comment Officials agree that partnerships would benefit from the option of using AIM to make payments of provisional tax on behalf of their partners during the year. The implications and mechanisms required to extend AIM to partnership structures require detailed policy consideration and public consultation, and therefore officials propose it be included in a later tax bill. Recommendation The submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 19 Issue: Use of AIM by larger taxpayers Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, EY) Submitters suggested that AIM be available for taxpayers with gross income greater than $5 million and it could be set at $10 million. It should be the complexity of adjustments required rather than turnover which is the appropriate eligibility criterion. When considering the impact of extending AIM to a larger taxpayer, the net revenue over time referred to in these sections should be clarified so that it only refers to core tax rather than UOMI or penalties. (EY) Comment Ninety percent of small businesses in New Zealand have a turnover of under $1 million and therefore the upper limit of $5 million turnover will include the majority of small businesses within New Zealand. The next group of taxpayers who have turnover above $5 million hold a far greater proportion of the income tax revenue and as such there is a much larger fiscal risk for extending AIM into this group. Small businesses with simple structures are able to use the standardised “off the shelf” accounting software packages, however larger businesses with more complex business structures and transactions use more bespoke software tailored to their individual business needs. Officials are currently considering how AIM might apply to larger taxpayers in the future and are interested in continuing to expand the opportunity to pay provisional tax on a real time basis to all taxpayers. The legislation does include the ability for businesses with turnover over $5 million to use AIM in two instances. First, when they have been using AIM successfully and their business has grown over $5 million they can apply to the department to continue using it, and secondly, in the instance when it is a member of a class of taxpayers using software that has been approved for large businesses. As an example, a software provider develops software suitable for the supermarket industry, which was approved by Inland Revenue as being AIM-capable. In this instance, any supermarket using the software with a turnover of over $5 million would be able to use AIM for its provisional tax payments. With regard to the submission related to the net revenue collected over time, the phrase “net revenue” is to be interpreted in light of section 6(A)(3), which refers to the duty of the Commissioner to collect the highest net revenue. Ensuring taxpayers are on the right provisional tax payment mechanism for them and paying an accurate amount of tax is the intention of the Commissioner. This does not include the ability to maximise revenue through collection of UOMI and penalties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 Issue: Refunds Submission (Deloitte) Section RM 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 places requirements on companies before a refund of tax can be paid. It is unclear why it will not be necessary for companies using AIM to comply with section RM 13. This should be clarified. Comment It is intended that a refund of overpaid provisional tax under the AIM method does not require an AIM company to file an imputation credit account return but it will for all other cases of refunds of income tax. Section RM 13 will be updated to clarify this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Defective software Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commissioner may wish to consider including a provision that requires an AIM provider to fix defective software. Revocation does not apply till the following year after notification; if there is a defect it will need to be fixed quickly. Comment It is current practice to engage with software providers as soon as Inland Revenue is alerted to a defect in software which interacts with the department. At this time the approval for AIM software is able to be revoked but it is good practice for Inland Revenue to engage with the software provider to correct the error in order to maintain their approval status. It is officials’ view that this standard practice is robust to ensure defective software is fixed in a timely manner and as such a separate provision is not required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 Issue: Publication of notices Submission (KPMG ) The Commissioner should be required to publish notices regarding AIM eligibility approvals and revocation rather than it being discretionary. Comment The amendments currently propose that the Commissioner may publish notices regarding all approvals and revocations of AIM providers. Officials consider this be kept as a discretionary power to prevent the incidence of inadvertently releasing information that might be taxpayer- sensitive or hold commercial sensitivity for the taxpayers and software providers themselves. It is intended that the names of software providers who hold an AIM approval will be published on Inland Revenue’s website and the Commissioner would also publish the name of the providers whose eligibility has been revoked. Having a blanket requirement to publish all information in these sections may have unintended consequences. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of AIM in transitional years Submission (TaxLab) Further consideration must be given to the impact of transitional and non-standard balance dates. The submitter wants clarity on how eligibility criteria and GST filing would apply in a transitional year. Comment Officials consider that AIM cannot be used effectively in a transitional year for a business as the complexity to make it work effectively would outweigh the benefits of AIM to the business. The decision to change balances dates is a conscious decision made by a business and therefore reverting to a more simplistic provisional tax method during that period of transition would be easier for the business. AIM will utilise prior year figures during adjustments to accounting income and when it is used in a subsequent year to a transitional year, any prior year adjustments amounts would need to be annualised over a 12-month period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and legislation updated to reflect changes. 22 Issue: Tax rate on individuals in AIM Submission (Matters raised by officials) The use of AIM is open to individual taxpayers, however, using the flat company rate may result in overpayments of provisional tax for individuals. Therefore officials consider that an alternative calculation method to allow for a more accurate determination of tax rate for individuals is required. Comment Officials’ discussions with software providers have highlighted that the software has to develop calculations that will result in a more accurate figure for income and tax during the year. The software could also develop the capability to calculate a tax rate based on a rolling balance of figures; mixing the current year income with past year income while taking into account income from other sources and prior year rates. This option would result in the calculation of a tax rate that more accurately reflects the current year status of the business, which is the overall intention of AIM. This issue needs consultation with the software industry to determine available calculation methods and undertake modelling to ensure they result in accurate results for the majority of taxpayers. This calculation would be embedded within the software itself and require little user intervention. For this reason, officials propose extending the scope of the technical determinations from tax adjustments calculations to also include different ways of calculating the tax rate that applies to that taxpayer. Using the determination provides more flexibility enabling officials and software developers to calculate a more accurate tax rate. Including this in the current determination means it would become subject to the consultation process with the AIM working group and strategic industry Officials also propose that taxpayers have the option of choosing their own marginal rate in their first year of AIM. This ensures there is a simple option available to taxpayers should they require it. This rate choice would be subject to a requirement of reasonable care in choosing a rate (with a minimum of 10%) and the Commissioner would have the authority to override the rate when it was found to be deliberately set too low. The principle of AIM is to ensure that businesses pay the right amount of tax at the right time; enabling the use of a marginal rate gives the taxpayer more flexibility to do this in the instance that complexity in their income year cannot be captured by a formula. We also propose that taxpayers are able to approach Inland Revenue for a special tax code in the instance that no other option gives them accurate tax payment during the year. Recommendation That the drafting of the scope of the technical determination be extended to include the development of an individual’s tax rate calculator. 23 Issue: Minor drafting issues Submissions (EY, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) Several minor drafting issues are described in the submissions. The suggested amendments relate to the following sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994: • With regard to a failed instalment, there is a formula missing from proposed section 120KBC on how the UOMI will be calculated. • Proposed section 91AAX(1) refers to determining adjustments for the purpose of proposed section RC 7B (3)(iv). It was suggested that the cross-reference should be to subparagraph (ii) instead of, or as well as, to subparagraph (iv). • Proposed section 2C(b) changes the wording from “the amount of the shareholder’s tax credit under section LB 2 for the tax year less the shareholder’s residual income tax for the tax year, treating a negative amount as zero”. It was submitted that this should be changed to “the amount of the shareholder’s residual income tax under section LB 2 for the tax year less the shareholder’s residual income tax for the tax year, treating a negative amount as zero”. • For proposed schedule 3, Part AB, insert the words “or section RC 9 (4B)(b)”. • Proposed section 45C is currently placed within Part 3 – Information, Record Keeping and Returns and would be better situated in Part 2B – Intermediaries for PAYE, Provisional Tax and Resident Passive Income around section 15. • The use of a statutory declaration in the eligibility process currently requires providers to declare that the product is updated regularly. A statutory declaration should not require a declaration to future actions. This should be changed to reflect their intent to keep it updated regularly. Recommendation That the submissions be noted and referred to drafters. 24 25 Other business tax 26 27 INCREASE AND EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT SAFE HARBOUR FROM UOMI FOR TAXPAYERS WHO USE THE STANDARD UPLIFT METHOD Clause 110 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) Submitters expressed support for the proposal to increase and expand the current safe harbour from UOMI for those taxpayers who use the standard uplift method and have residual income tax of less than $50,000. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 28 SAFE HARBOUR FOR ALL PROVISIONAL TAXPAYERS USING STANDARD UPLIFT METHOD Clauses 80, 109 and 114 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) Submitters expressed support for the proposal to remove UOMI for all provisional taxpayers using the standard uplift method for the first two instalments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Estimating at the third instalment date Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) Six submitters believed taxpayers should be permitted to switch from the standard uplift method to the estimation method at or before the third instalment of provisional tax. This would enable the policy intent where a person pays their entire residual income tax by the final instalment of provisional tax without the imposition of UOMI to be reflected in the legis lat ion. The current drafting of the legislation continues to require a person to make a final instalment of provisional tax based on the standard uplift amount, which could result in a taxpayer overpaying their tax for a particular income year. Although the calculation of UOMI does reflect the policy intent it requires an assumption by taxpayers that they can pay less than the standard uplift amount. This should be specifically legis lated. Comment Current rules allow a taxpayer to switch methods up until the last instalment date which is generally the third instalment. The bill proposes a rule that prohibits a taxpayer from switching from the standard uplift method to the estimate method after the payment of the second instalment of provisional tax. This restriction is designed to ensure that taxpayers who had paid the first two instalments and realised they were overpaid could not then switch to the estimation method and receive credit UOMI from the first instalment date. 29 The intention of the proposed changes is to permit taxpayers to pay whatever they want for the final instalment of provisional tax as this is when UOMI will apply to them. Officials thought this was clear in the wording of the calculation of UOMI and a practical way of dealing with this but submissions have suggested otherwise. Submissions have also suggested that policing action may be undertaken on the standard uplift amount on the final instalment when the taxpayer makes a payment that is less than the standard uplift amount required. Officials recommend altering the wording in the legislation to make it clear that taxpayers who use the standard uplift method can either base their final instalment of provisional tax on the standard uplift amount or their estimate of their residual income tax for the year less payments made to date. Officials are currently considering the optimal way to reflect the policy intent in the legis lat ion. This will apply to all standard uplift provisional taxpayers with the exception of those who wish to use the safe harbour from UOMI when their residual income tax is less than $60,000 who must pay all three instalments using the standard uplift amounts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Inconsistency between sections RC 5 and RC 7 Submission (Deloitte, EY) The proposed changes to section RC 5, which limit a taxpayer’s ability to use the estimation method after paying the first two instalments using the standard uplift method are inconsistent with section RC 7, which outlines the estimation method. Comment We consider that the issue outlined will be covered by the wording change proposed to enable taxpayers to use an estimate on their last instalment date (see “Issue: Estimating at the third instalment date”). As a result, we do not consider the proposed amendment is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 Issue: The overriding anti-avoidance section is unnecessary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Two submitters raised concerns around the lack of detail about when the proposed definition of “provisional tax interest avoidance arrangement” would apply and therefore believed it should be removed. Submitters stated that if this submission was not accepted, more detailed explanation should be provided about when and how the rule would apply. Comment The removal of UOMI from some taxpayers creates opportunities to avoid UOMI and the payment of provisional tax in entirety by related parties switching income between them. As a result, a specific provision has been included in the legislation to deal with the most obvious gaming opportunity. However, officials consider it is prudent to retain a more general anti- avoidance mechanism to void transactions that have the primary motive of defeating the intent of the provisional tax rules that have not been contemplated by that more specific rule. Th is particularly applies to the under $60,000 residual income tax safe harbour. Officials do, however, agree that further guidance on the application of this provision should be supplied to taxpayers in a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. It is intended that this provision is only applied when significant manipulation of income between related persons or entities has occurred to defeat the intention of the provisional tax rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Two instalment and transitional year taxpayers Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The current legislation does not deal with taxpayers who pay provisional tax in two instalments or those who are in a transitional year and may have more than three provisional tax instalments. Comment There are two situations where taxpayers do not have the usual three provisional tax instalments. In principle, there should be no reason to exclude these taxpayers from the safe harbour from UOMI. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 31 Issue: An alternative anti-manipulation rule should be considered rather than the general anti-avoidance rule Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Rather than the proposed anti-switching rule an alternative rule could be introduced that does not pay credit interest until the final instalment for those who start in the standard uplift and switch to the estimation regime. Alternatively, consideration could be given to providing UOMI relief to taxpayers who pay provisional tax using the estimation method. Comment As part of the review of the mechanism to allow taxpayers to use an estimated payment for their final instalment, officials will be considering if this is better achieved through the UOMI rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Pooling and standard uplift safe harbour Submission ( PwC) The bill does not comment on the use of tax pooling for those taxpayers using the standard uplift safe harbour although the issues paper issued by Inland Revenue clearly states that tax pooling will be able to be used. Clarificat ion is also required in relation to whether tax financed or purchased by a taxpayer when the amount equals or exceeds the standard uplift amount qualify for the proposal in relation to UOMI. Comment The tax pooling rules will apply to standard uplift taxpayers as they always have. Officials do not consider that any specific legislation is required to confirm that the current tax pooling rules continue to apply under these proposals. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 32 Issue: Reassessments – determination of method Submission ( PwC) A practical issue arises in relation to reassessments when attempting to determine the method elected by the taxpayer for the income year in question. Individuals involved in making the election may no longer work for the organisation or they may no longer recall which method they have elected. Comment The way UOMI applies to taxpayers who receive a reassessment will depend on which provisional tax method they have used for a particular tax year. For example, someone who used the standard uplift method and met all the conditions for UOMI to apply will have UOMI applied from the final provisional tax instalment date. Officials believe which provisional tax method taxpayers used in particular income years will be clearly indicated in the START system and the calculation of UOMI will be automatic on this basis. In addition, the record retention requirements placed on a taxpayer should ensure these records are available for reference. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Standard method associate rule Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC, New Zealand Law Society) Five submitters believed that the proposed standard method associate rule is too widely targeted and should not be enacted. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, KPMG, PwC, New Zealand Law Society) One submitter was supportive of the standard method associate rule as it is restricted to wholly owned companies. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitters who were not supportive of the rule considered that: • it would be difficult for Inland Revenue and taxpayers to monitor their compliance with the rule; • many associated entities are run as separate business units with provisional tax decisions made independently, and the provision will impinge on that; and • the constraint may be too far-reaching even for companies in the same wholly owned group and may result in a wholly owned group paying too much provisional tax. 33 The rule should be restricted to companies and shareholders with at least 50 percent direct voting interests or market value interests or to close companies with shareholder employees who do not have PAYE deducted. (EY) Concessionary UOMI treatment should apply where a standard method associate uses the estimation method and any concerns regarding the switching of income is more than adequately addressed by the anti-avoidance provision in the rules. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The standard method associate rule is designed to deal with the situation when related taxpayers use differing provisional tax methods to circumvent the new UOMI rules by reducing exposure to UOMI and potentially also provisional tax. It complements the specific anti-avoidance provision that has also been introduced in these rules. Officials have considered the submissions made in relation to the standard method associate rule. Officials believe that there is a requirement for such a provision to stop taxpayers from gaming the differences between the standard uplift and estimation regimes to reduce exposure to UOMI and provisional tax, and believe using a provision such as this is preferable to relying on a more general anti-avoidance provision. However, officials consider that the scope of the definition may be too wide and may capture relationships which have a minimal ability to abuse the rules. Officials believe that the wholly owned group provision is correctly targeted but that the two provisions relating to individuals would benefit from being modified. In particular officials recommend that proposed subsections 120KBB(4)(b)(ii) and (iii) relating to standard method associates be modified to include persons who are associated under section YB 3, treating section YB 3 as requiring 50 percent voting interests and market value interests rather than 25 percent and ignoring subsection YB 3(3). This will restrict the application of the provision significantly to capture only direct and indirect shareholders. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, in part. Issue: The formula for the calculation of failed instalments will mean a taxpayer could pay more UOMI on an instalment they have met than on a failed instalment Submission (EY) The formula for determining the amount of residual income tax in proposed subsection 120KBB(3) will result in the payment of more UOMI than for a failed instalment because of the definition of “residual income tax”. To ensure that no UOMI is charged on instalments that are not failed instalments when a taxpayer does have another failed instalment during the year, the formula should be amended to reference section RC 10 in addition to section RC 9. 34 Comment We agree that subsection 120KBB(3) should be altered to include section RC 10. This will mean when a taxpayer has, during an income year, instalments they pay on time and a failed instalment, the result will be that no UOMI will apply to the non-failed instalments but will apply to the failed instalments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Correction to section 139C(1D) Submission (EY) Clause 116(2) inserts new section 139C(1D). The word “the” is missing from the provision as follows “...for the tax year is the amount of unpaid tax given by section 120KBB(3)(b) for the date”. Comment We agree that the subsection should be altered to include the word “the” as outlined in the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting issues Submission (Matter raised by officials) A number of small drafting points have been identified in relation to the wording in the legislation that should be remedied. Comment We recommend that the following minor drafting matters be remedied: • the definition of “initial provisional taxpayer” in the Income Tax Act should reflect the change in the safe harbour threshold from $50,000 to $60,000; • clause 110 should include a reference to section RC3(3) in the proposed amendment to section 120KE(1)(a) to ensure that those who are put into provisional tax for the current year can continue to use the safe harbour provisions; 35 • clause 110 should include the words “on or before” to ensure those taxpayers who pay their provisional tax instalments early can still use the safe harbour; • clause 110 should also repeal section 120KE(1)(e) to align the treatment of taxpayers who have certificates of exemption from resident withholding tax; and • clause 109 should amend proposed section 120KBB(3) to ensure that taxpayers will not be paid credit UOMI on failed instalments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 36 PROVISIONAL TAX ATTRIBUTION Clauses 72, 73, 77, 78, 79, 82, 92(8)-(10), 96, 102 and 111 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC, AIM software providers) Submitters expressed support for the proposals. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The proposal is overly complex and mechanical in nature Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC) All of the submitters stated that the proposal is overly complicated and complex and could be simplified. The drafting results in unnecessary complexity. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The UOMI calculations are extremely complicated and consideration should be given to simplifying these so they are easy to understand and apply. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The mechanism used to transfer the tax credit to the shareholder-employee is complex and can be simplified. The submitter suggested that the existing trust-beneficiary mechanism be used. ( PwC) Consideration should be given to introducing two separate provisional tax attribution calculations, one for the shareholder-employee and one for the company. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Although the concept of provisional tax attribution is simple the mechanism to implement a robust solution is, by nature, complex. Complexity arises in a number of areas including the attribution of provisional tax, the transfer of that tax and the overlay of use-of-money interest where shortfalls occur. 37 While acknowledging that the current mechanism does achieve the aims of the proposal officials have reviewed this in light of the submissions raised and agree some simplification can be made to make the proposal less complex for taxpayers. Officials will continue to work with drafters and submitters to simplify the mechanism in the proposal with a view to providing a more simplified approach to the attribution in the reported back version of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to official’s comments. Issue: Dividend and fringe benefit tax implications Submission (EY) Explicit provisions should be included to address the dividend or FBT implications, if any, and the timing thereof, for transfers of provisional tax from the company to the shareholder- employee. Comment To the extent that any amount transferred to the shareholder-employee is not charged to a shareholder current account or otherwise reimbursed by the shareholder, it should be a dividend or a fringe benefit. In these circumstances it is more naturally a dividend so we agree that there should be no FBT. The timing of any dividend should be on the last day of the company’s income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of elections Submission (EY) Clarification is required as to whether the provisional tax attribution agreements are intended to be made each year or whether they should continue from year to year unless cancelled. Comment It is intended that taxpayers should not have to make an annual election to use provisional tax attribution, however, once elected this will continue until the taxpayers cancel that election. Officials w ill review the draft legis lat ion with a view to clarify ing this issue. 38 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The provisional tax amount attributed to the company Submission (EY) Proposed section RC 10(7) does not achieve the outcome asserted in the Commentary. Proposed section RC 10(7) should treat shareholder salary as the first part of their income. Comment As part of the simplification of the proposals, officials will review the drafting of this provision to ensure it meet the policy intent expressed in the Commentary to the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Consequences of an insolvent liquidation Submission (KPMG ) It is not clear how the proposed rule would work in an insolvent liquidation of the company. The amounts paid would be treated as income tax of the company rather than an amount held in trust for another person. A shareholder employee may as a result find themselves with an end- of-year liability. Comment Officials note that in practice it would be unusual for a company in an insolvent liquidation to pay a shareholder-employee salary in the year of the liquidation, which is where the issue would arise. It is more likely that an amount has been advanced by the company to the shareholder employee during the year. This would seem to have commercial consequences but little tax implications. We do not consider the provisional tax attribution rules to be overly affected by this situation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 39 Issue: Tax pooling Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) As an alternative to the proposed rules, companies and shareholder employees should be able to pool their provisional tax obligations and allocate at year end. This would simplify the process and achieve the desired objectives. This can be achieved through the transfer rules in subpart 10B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, however this approach should be formalised and sanctioned in the legislation. Comment As noted above, officials believe that some simplification of the proposals should be investigated with submitters and drafters and this potential alternative will be considered as part of that work. Recommendation That this submission be noted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Consideration of consequences of the shareholder-employee ceasing to receive a salary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Consideration should be given to whether the proposed rules address the situation of a shareholder-employee ceasing to receive a non-PAYE deducted salary. Comment Officials believe this issue can arise under current law and there are existing options to address this which can continue to be used under the provisional tax attribution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Date of election Submission ( PwC) The requirement to elect to use provisional tax attribution before the company’s due date for the first instalment of provisional tax should be further considered. 40 Comment The election to use provisional tax attribution prior to the first instalment is necessary to ensure that the obligations are correctly set and accounted for by taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Officials believe that an election is required prior to the first instalment of provisional tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Company becoming a provisional taxpayer Submission (EY) The current drafting refers to a company that is a provisional taxpayer. Where a company is currently not a provisional taxpayer but expects to be one for the tax year it should be able to use the proposed method. Comment In principle officials see no reason why a company who expects to pay provisional tax for the year could not use this mechanism and this issue will be reviewed as part of the simplification of the method. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Minor drafting issues Submission (EY) A number of specific drafting points (cross-references and similar) should be reviewed. Comment As part of the simplification of the mechanism officials will review the drafting points raised by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 ALLOWING CONTRACTORS TO ELECT THEIR OWN WITHHOLDING RATE Clauses 87, 88, 92(2)-(6), 93(1)-(18), 98, 99 and 114 Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) Five submitters supported the proposed amendment to allow contractors subject to the schedular payment rules to elect their own withholding rate. Some concerns about the technical detail of the proposal were raised, which are addressed below. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Non-declaration rate for schedular payments Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, PwC) The bill proposes to standardise the non-declaration rate for schedular payments to 45%. One submitter supported the simplified approach to the non-declaration rate. (PwC) Three submitters did not support the change to the non-declaration rate. They saw no strong justification for a non-declaration rate of 45% and believed that the non-declaration rate should attempt to match a contractor’s final income tax liability. The increase in non-declaration rate is contrary to the reduced non-declaration rate made for non-resident companies in 2004. (EY) The current non-declaration rate should be retained and the non-declaration rate for employees should be decreased to 33%. (EY) Comment Non-declaration rates provide an important incentive for taxpayers to provide their IRD number. This information is important to ensure that the income information recorded in the employer monthly schedule can be matched against a taxpayer and therefore ensure the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax and that their social policy obligations are correctly calculated. 42 We consider that a 45% rate is a simple rule that provides this incentive. The rate needs to be greater than 33% to ensure taxpayers on the top marginal tax rate who also have social policy entitlements or obligations have an incentive to provide their IRD number. It also aligns the rate with that for employees. However, we agree that a 45% rate would be too high for non-resident companies. This is because these companies are likely to have deductions and no flow-on social policy obligations. Obtaining an IRD number for these companies may also be more difficult than for persons present in New Zealand. As a result, we recommend retaining the current 20% non-declaration rate for non-resident companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Minimum rate Submission (KPMG, PwC) One submitter supported the proposed minimum withholding rate (PwC) and one did not. (KPMG ) The rate is too high and assumes a margin of approximately 30% on a contract payment. Most contractors will try to accurately pick a rate. (K PMG) Comment A minimum rate is necessary to reduce the risk that contractors may pick artificially low withholding rates to defer or avoid their tax obligations. Contractors that have genuine reasons for wanting a withholding rate below 10% will still be able to apply for a special tax rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repeatedly switching withholding rates Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC) Three submitters raised concern about the compliance costs for payers of contractors as a result of the proposed amendments. In particular, submitters commented on the proposed rule that contractors who have elected a withholding rate twice in the year must obtain the payer’s consent to any further changes. 43 The number of changes allowed before consent should be decreased to one. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The contractor should require their consent for all changes to their withholding rate. (PwC) The rule should be reviewed after two years to gauge the impact on compliance costs for payers of schedular payments. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The proposed rule regarding repeatedly changing rates is intended to balance the competing objectives of reducing compliance costs for contractors and enabling them to get their withholding rate right, against the objectives of reducing the compliance cost for withholders having to repeatedly change withholding rates. Th is trade-off is finely balanced. We consider that enabling a contractor to elect a rate twice within a year appropriately meets this balance. Enabling two elections without consent gives contractors an opportunity to correct genuine mistakes or adjust the rate if their circumstances change. However, we agree with submitters that this should be reviewed after implementation, and believe it should be considered as part a wider review of schedular payments (see “Issue: Wider review of schedular payment rules”). Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Safeguards for prescribed rate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Taxpayers should be allowed a right of appeal or the Commissioner should be required to consult with the taxpayer regarding the prescribed rate before it is applied. It would be equitable to include these features. Comment The process for prescribed rates is intended to mirror the current process for deduction notices under section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under section 157 the taxpayer can apply to have the deduction notice removed when they have paid all outstanding debt. We consider that this process is appropriate for prescribed rates issued under section 24LC(2) (which relates to rates for outstanding debt). When a taxpayer has met all their obligations and the Commissioner considers it likely they will meet their future obligations we consider it appropriate that they also be able to apply to have any rate prescribed under section 24LC(1) changed. 44 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Maximum prescribed rate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The maximum prescribed rate threshold of 60% appears too high and could put affected contractors into a difficult position. A rate of 50% would seem fairer. Comment We agree with the submitter that 60% appears to be too high. Reducing the rate to 50% would be more consistent with the maximum rate under deduction notices for salary and wages. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Published guidance on prescribed rate Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commissioner should publish detailed guidance on the circumstances in which she would be likely to exercise her discretion to make a prescribed rate. Comment Under the proposed amendment, the Commissioner will only be able to use a prescribed rate when a contractor has not complied with their obligations under the Revenue Acts. This would generally be when the taxpayer has an overdue tax debt, but it could also include non-filing or evasion in some circumstances. The Commissioner will prescribe a tax rate under section 24LC(2) (which relates to additional amounts to withhold to meet debts and other liabilities) when the taxpayer has an overdue debt. This rate will be used to repay the overdue debt and provides a more efficient means of collecting the amount outstanding compared with using a deduction notice. The Commissioner will prescribe a rate under section 24LC(1) (which relates to adjusting the ordinary schedular withholding rate) to ensure the taxpayer’s on-going compliance with their obligations. The Commissioner will use this when the taxpayer is non-compliant with their obligations and considers the taxpayer is at risk of future non-compliance with their obligations. 45 Inland Revenue will publish further guidance closer to the time of implementing this change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Schedular notification Submission (EY, New Zealand Law Society) Section 24L(2) should be reworded so it clearly applies only if a taxpayer has elected a withholding tax rate or if the Commissioner has prescribed a withholding tax rate. Comment A contractor can only notify their payer of their elected withholding rate if they have in fact made such an election. Officials agree that th is should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Services performed before 1 April 2017 Submission (EY) It should be clarified whether the changes will apply to all schedular payments made on or after 1 April 2017, regardless of whether they relate to services performed before or after that date. Comment The PAYE rules apply on a payments basis. The amendments are therefore intended to apply to payments beginning 1 April 2017, regardless of when the services relating to the payment were performed. Officials w ill make this clear in the Tax Information Bulletin following the bill’s enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 46 Issue: Recognition of incorrect rates Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The legislation should recognise the possibility of tax being withheld at the incorrect rate due to administrative/coding errors. It would be difficult to verify errors of this nature and appropriate for the rules to recognise this. Comment If there is tax withheld at the wrong rate due to administrative or coding errors, Inland Revenue intends to focus more on education and future compliance with the rules. This is similar to how Inland Revenue addresses errors that occur for the PAYE rules generally. We consider that this flexible administrative approach works adequately for PAYE and is the better means of addressing any errors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Minor drafting issues Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have identified a small number of minor drafting issues in relation to: • whether there is a limit on how precise a contractor’s withholding rate can be; and • clarifying that as part of their notification requirements, a schedular payment contractor must provide their name and IRD number to their payer. Comment We recommend these issues be addressed by: • providing that contractor’s elected rate must be rounded to the nearest decimal place; and • requiring schedular payment contractors to provide their name and IRD number to their payer as part of their notification requirements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 47 EXTENDING WITHHOLDING TO LABOUR-HIRE FIRM CONTRACTORS Clauses 93(19) and 100(2) Issue: Support for proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC) Three submitters supported the proposed amendment and rationale for the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Wider review needed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PwC) A wider review of the schedular payment rules should be undertaken. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Consideration should be given to extending the schedular payment rules to all labour-only contracts. (PwC) Comment A review of the schedular payment rules is being considered as part of the Business transformation programme. This review will consider whether the schedular payment rules should be extended to all labour-only contracts. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Need for greater clarity Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The definition of “labour-hire” is very brief and does not provide enough certainty for taxpayers. In particular, what is a “main activity” and when work is performed “directly for a client” is 48 unclear. There needs to be detailed commentary which explains how this rule is intended to apply. Comment The labour-hire firm provisions apply to a payment by an entity if “1 of the entity’s main activities is the business of arranging for a person or persons to perform work or services directly for clients of the entity”. This definition is based on rules that already exist in Australia. “Arranging for a person to perform work or services directly for clients” means that there is an agreement to provide a worker to the client, who will then provide their services at the general direction of the client. This does not include a contract in which the parties agree to deliver a given result or outcome. For example, if a contract provided for Firm A to make available some painters to a building company to work for them for a period of time, and the painters work at the general instruction of the building company, then Firm A would be arranging for a person to perform work or services. In contrast, if a contract providing for a painting company to paint houses for a building company, and the painting company contracted some labourers to work for it in completing the service, the contract between the painting company and building company would be a contract for a service to produce a given result (the painted houses) rather than a contract arranging for a person to “perform work or services directly for clients”. For something to be one of the main activities of the business requires the activity to be more than incidental to other activities of the firm. For example, a wedding planner may arrange for persons to perform makeup, or other services directly for clients, but because this is incidental to the main activity of the planner it will not make the wedding planner a labour-hire firm. A business can have more than one main activity. For example, a labour-hire firm may have main activities of providing workers directly, as well as providing direct contracting work. The key question to ask is whether arranging to provide workers directly is being done in a business of its own right, or whether it is merely a requirement or incidental activity of another activity of the business. We will provide further guidance on this in the Tax Information Bulletin follow ing the bill’s enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Alignment with attribution rule for personal services income Submission ( PwC) There is a risk that the current proposal could be too wide and may infringe on the application of the existing attribution rules for personal services income that already applies in cases when the contractor is associated with the labour-hire firm. 49 Therefore, the proposal to extend withholding tax to labour-hire firms should be limited to where the contractor and labour-hire firm are not associated. Comment The purpose behind the extension of the withholding rules to labour-hire firm contractors is to help contractors manage their tax payments throughout the year, and to address tax evasion concerns with some contractors in the industry. In contrast, the personal services income attribution rules are intended to prevent higher income earners from diverting personal services income to associated entities to avoid the highest personal tax rates. It does this through attributing the income from the associated entity to the individual. The application of this rule does not affect the PAYE rules or remove provisional tax obligations, and relies on the taxpayer correctly self-assessing their income. As a result, we do not believe that the application of the personal services income attribution rule would address the compliance cost and evasion concerns that the proposed labour-hire firm amendment addresses. In addition, when a labour-hire firm is associated with the contractor due to a shareholding relationship, the payment will usually be a shareholder-salary, which can be treated as exempt from the PAYE rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption certificates Submission (KPMG ) Clarification is needed as to whether non-resident contractors will still be able to apply for certificates of exemption. The submitter strongly recommends that certificates of exemption be retained. Comment Certificates of exemption allow a contractor to be exempted from the schedular payment rules based on previous good behaviour. A contractor may wish to obtain a certificate of exemption when they would prefer paying provisional tax rather than paying their tax through withholding. For New Zealand-resident contractors working for labour-hire firms, we consider that special tax rates of 0% provide a better mechanism for enabling this. This method still allows contractors to pay their income tax through the provisional tax system, but has the advantage over certificates of exemption in that it ensures that the contractor’s income information is still provided to Inland Revenue and so minimises the risk of non-compliance. However, for non-resident contractors we accept that there may still be a place for exemption certificates. This is because many non-resident contractors will be exempt from New Zealand tax and to obtain a special tax rate requires the contractor to obtain an IRD number. For non- 50 resident contractors, this may impose a compliance cost which exceeds the evasion risk. As a result, we recommend that non-resident contractors working for labour-hire firms be able to obtain certificates of exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying special tax rates of 0% Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The Commentary to the bill states that contractors will be able to get special tax rates of 0%. However, this is not apparent in section 24N or 24F and it does not seem possible for a contractor to request this. This should be clarified and the IR 23BS form should be modified as necessary. (Deloitte) The legislation should confirm that complying taxpayers who wish to remain in provisional tax should be able to obtain a special tax code certificate. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The legislation enables the Commissioner to provide special tax rates without any constraints on what rate she is able to provide. Inland Revenue intends to update the relevant forms to enable contractors to specifically apply for special tax rates of 0%. We consider that there should be a transitional provision for special tax rates so that contractors who have a certificate of exemption can, for the 2017–18 income year, have the certificate of exemption treated as a special tax rate of 0% if the certificate of exemption is not valid due to these amendments. This will help to ensure a smoother transition. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Company exemption for labour-hire firm contractors Submission ( PwC) The Commentary to the bill makes it clear that the general exemption from the schedular payment rules for companies will be overridden for labour-hire firm contractors. However, it is unclear in the draft legislation how the company exclusion is being overridden. 51 Comment Clause 86(2) of the bill proposes to remove the company exemption for payments that are covered by the labour-hire firm withholding rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exemption for certain professional services firms Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Payments made by a professional services person to its wholly owned professional services company should be excluded from the proposed rules. Extending the rules to these firms increases compliance costs for no benefit. Comment We agree that applying the withholding rules to payments between wholly owned companies would increase compliance costs for little benefit. These situations are also similar to payments of shareholder-salaries which are exempt from the PAYE rules. We recommend that payments to wholly owned companies be excluded from the labour-hire firm rule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Minor drafting issues Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed amendments currently refer to an “entity” when, for clarity, it should refer to a “person” instead. The proposed amendment is intended to apply when a labour-hire firm arranges for a worker to perform services to a sub-client of a client of the labour-hire firm. However, the current drafting imposes an additional condition that the client of the labour-hire firm also be a labour-hire firm. Th is additional criterion is problematic, as it results in inconsistent treatment for contractors of labour-hire firms. It is also a criterion that is not present in the Australian legislation. Comment We recommend remedying this by replacing the word “entity” with “person”. 52 We recommend that for the situation where there a chain of clients for a labour-hire firm, that the legislation not require the intermediary client be a labour-hire firm. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 53 VOLUNTARY WITHHOLDING AGREEMENTS Clause 93(19) Issue: Support for the proposed amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PwC) Four submitters supported the proposed amendment to provide the option to enter into a voluntary withholding agreement. For one submitter this support was contingent on the requirement of mutual consent remaining. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Company exemption for voluntary withholding agreements Submission ( PwC) It is unclear whether the company exception is overridden for voluntary withholding agreements. Comment Companies should be able to enter into voluntary withholding agreements if they have the consent of the payer. This is an oversight that should be fixed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 Issue: Requirement for valid agreement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The legislation should be redrafted to clarify what is required for a valid voluntary withholding agreement. The bill requires that the parties have “recorded their agreement in a document”. This is unclear and more guidance is needed. Comment For the voluntary withholding provision to apply there must be an agreement between the payer and contractor, and this agreement must be recorded in a document. Determining whether there is a valid agreement is based on standard contract law principles and requires there to be offer and acceptance, objective evidence of agreement, and intention to create legal relations. For this agreement to be recorded in a document, it can be through a memorandum, email, letter or formal contract between the parties so long as there is sufficient written evidence that there has been a required agreement between the parties (which can be either electronic or in hardcopy). We will provide further guidance on this in the Tax Information Bulletin, as well as Inland Revenue’s employers’ guide. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Other payments Submission ( PwC) It is unclear whether the voluntary withholding will apply to items which have previously not attracted withholding tax such as expense reimbursement. Clarification is needed in respect of these items. Comment Voluntary withholding applies when no other withholding provision applies and the parties agree to enter into a voluntary withholding agreement. If the parties wish to enter into a voluntary withholding agreement for expense reimbursement, they may choose to do so. 1 1 With the exception of amounts to which the Commissioner has made a determination under section RD 8(3). 55 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Placement of voluntary withholding provision Submission (Deloitte) The voluntary withholding provision should be in Part K of schedule 4 rather than Part W. Comment Given the voluntary withholding provision is unique compared with the remaining schedular payment provisions, and only applies if the other schedular payment provisions do not apply, it is preferable to leave it in Part W. This would allow greater flexibility to add more parts to schedule 4 in the future. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES Clause 114 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PwC, R Saunders) Submitters support the proposal to no longer impose the 1% incremental late payment penalty on certain tax types, with some submitters acknowledging that more work could be done in this area in the future. The current penalty regime is excessive, particularly when combined with UOMI. (K PMG) We would like to see further flexibility in the penalty rules, such as removing late payment penalties from provisional tax payments. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Instalment arrangements credited against core tax Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Instalment payments should be credited against core tax first, then late payment penalties and UOMI. Inland Revenue should concentrate on collecting core tax outstanding rather than collecting incremental penalties, many of which will have to be written off in the future. Comment The treatment and priority of payments made to Inland Revenue, and the calculation of UOMI on unpaid tax is outside the scope of the current bill. Officials may look at this issue in the future, depending on tax policy work programme priorities. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 57 Issue: Commissioner discretion to impose penalties and UOMI Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) A further discretion in the debt collection area should be given to the Commissioner so she can set different rates of late payment penalty and/or UOMI depending on the compliance history and circumstances of the taxpayer. UOMI rates for instalment arrangements could vary, so that one-off late payers are not penalised in the same way as serial defaulters. Comment Currently, when the taxpayer has a good compliance record for the preceding two years, the Tax Administration Act requires the Commissioner to grant a taxpayer additional time to pay before imposing late payment penalties. If the payment is not made by a certain date, the late payment penalty is imposed. In giving the Commissioner discretion to impose late payment penalties and UOMI, the Commissioner would be required to design business rules to administer her discretion. These rules would require careful consideration and consultation and be robust enough to be fairly applied to all taxpayers. Consideration would also need to be given to how these rules would be implemented, either by computer or by manual (human) processing. Given the time-sensitive nature of these decisions, the Commissioner would need to devote significant resources to ensure the efficient delivery of the discretionary rules. There may be opportunity in the future for officials to further explore this issue as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme, by using the new IT capability (START) to administer and deliver greater discretion to some administrative financial penalties and UOMI rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Imposition of late payment penalties on other civil penalties Submission (Matter raised by officials) The current drafting of the proposed section requires the Commissioner to impose incremental late payment penalties on other unpaid civil penalties that have been imposed in the same tax period. The outcome for the taxpayer is that while incremental late payment penalties will not be imposed on the unpaid tax in one of the prescribed periods, if a civil penalty such as a late filing penalty is imposed and remains unpaid, the Commissioner will be required to impose incremental late payment penalties on the unpaid late filing penalty amount. 58 Comment The proposed section relies on the existing definition of “unpaid tax” in section 139B(6)(c) of the Tax Administration Act, which incorporates the definition of “tax” as defined in section (3)(1). This definition includes civil penalties in the definition of “tax”. A potential interpretation of the current drafting is that the Commissioner is required to impose incremental late payment penalties on the unpaid civil penalty, but not the unpaid tax underlying the unpaid civil penalty. This interpretation is against the policy intent, which is to no longer impose the incremental late payment penalty on the prescribed tax periods, regardless of whether a civil penalty is subsequently imposed on that particular tax period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting issue Submission (EY) GST return periods The proposed new subsection is drafted as: (a) GST return period ending within 7 days of 31 March 2017 and (b) GST for a GST return period ending after 31 March 2017. As the proposed new para (b) refers to GST returns for GST return periods ending after 31 March 2017, we assume para (a) is intended to cover return periods ending within the 7 days ending on 31 March 2017. As phrases such as “within x days of” are often used for periods following the given date, we suggest it may be clearer for the proposed subsection to refer to a period ending within 7 days before or on 31 March 2017. Comment Officials acknowledge the minor drafting point raised by the submitter and have referred these points to the bill drafters for their consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 59 GST returns: clarification of “within” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amending the number of days a GST return can be filed within 31 March 2017, to allow the provision to include all applicable taxpayers that may file their GST return early under section 15E(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Comment Proposed section 139B(2B)(a) prescribes that taxpayers that file GST returns that end within 7 days of 31 March 2017 will not be liable to pay an incremental late payment penalty. Officials are concerned that taxpayers may read the definition of “within” to include the day of 31 March 2017, in effect only providing 6 days before the 31 March 2017 (25 March 2017). Due to section 15E of the Goods and Services Tax Act being worded as “not more than 7 days before or after the last day of the month”, officials recommend amendment to the provision, to include the 7 th day before 31 March 2017 (24 March 2017). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 60 DISCLOSING REPORTABLE UNPAID TAX TO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES Clauses 95, 103 and 104 Issue: Support for the amendment Submissions (Deloitte, Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Dun and Bradstreet, KPMG, PwC, R Saunders) Almost all submitters supported the rationale of the proposal, but had concerns about the impact on the taxpayer in the event of misreporting or misidentification. Submitters supported the safeguards around the requirements the Commissioner had to meet in order to disclose the taxpayer’s information. One submitter was concerned about the commercial ramifications of misreporting and the lack of guidance on redress in such situations. (KPMG) One submitter agreed that sharing information about outstanding tax debt with credit reporting agencies will provide some additional protection for the business community. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) One submitter disagreed with the proposed amendment, believing that it was unnecessary as the submitter expected the indebted taxpayer’s tax agent to be proactive in resolving the tax debt. (R Saunders) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: May limit commercial lending by banks Submission (R Saunders) The proposal would inform retail banks that a taxpayer owes a significant amount of reportable unpaid tax debt, and consequently provide a bank with a reason to decline a taxpayer’s request to any further lending. In order to convince banks to lend to an indebted taxpayer, the taxpayer would occasionally have to set up certain business structures and other lending justifications that were otherwise not required, in order to facilitate the lending. This is not in the best interests of New Zealand. Comment 61 This proposal will support businesses that unknowingly extend lending or trade credit to significantly indebted taxpayers. By disclosing tax information about significantly indebted taxpayers, the proposal provides other businesses with a more comprehensive view of the taxpayer’s financial position at the time they are making important commercial decisions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Formal notification Submission (Deloitte) The legislation does not specify how taxpayers will be notified. The Commentary indicates that if the taxpayer is a company, a notice will be sent to all registered directors. It is recommended that the notice should also be provided to the company itself at its registered address. Comment Proposed section 85N(2)(b) requires that the taxpayer will be formally notified prior to any disclosure. The definition of “formally notified” in section 14D of the Tax Administration Act must be in writing, delivered personally or by registered post, with communication not including communication by email, the internet or other electronic means. The Commentary furthers explains this notice will be served personally on the taxpayer. A notice can also be easily be posted to the company’s registered address. This address is accessible to the Commissioner from the Companies Office Register. This additional notification will be incorporated into operational guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Safeguards for disclosing taxpayer information Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Commentary provides that this proposal will be phased in and the Commissioner will only credit report approximately 500 taxpayers per year, until robust processes can be established. In the submitter’s view, no taxpayers should be reported on until such policies are established. Reporting on taxpayers when there are no robust policies in place increases the risk of errors and, the absence of reportable unpaid tax for an entity could give false impression that there is no outstanding tax debt when this may not be the case. 62 Comment The Commentary outlines that the proposal would be implemented in a phased approach, and so the Commissioner would only disclose approximately 500 taxpayers a year. This would allow Inland Revenue to have firm ly established robust processes and mechanisms in place while working with modest volumes. The implementation of this proposal requires Inland Revenue to develop its own IT processes as well as interact with external third parties’ IT databases. Officials agree that it is vital that those processes and polices are fit for purpose, before this proposal is launched. In the short-to medium-term, Inland Revenue will disclose modest volumes to ensure those processes and polices are capable of handling larger vo lumes, if required. This proposal will not “go live” until Inland Revenue has established processes and internal policies have been established. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Remedies for error Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The legislation should outline how the risk of errors will be mitigated (and corrected), and make provision for remedies when the taxpayer has suffered damage to their reputation or business as a result of this erroneous disclosure. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There needs to be clear guidance on how these situations will be managed, including sanctions for the offender and redress for those affected. (KPMG) Comment The proposal contains a number of safeguards designed to minimise misreporting or misidentification. This includes the 30-day notice being served on the taxpayer (or director) outlining the taxpayer’s debt data. This allows the taxpayer to review this data and advise Inland Revenue of any errors, before the taxpayer’s data is disclosed. The Commissioner will disclose the taxpayer’s identification information in order to match the taxpayer with the approved credit reporting agency’s credit records. This will likely use a number of reliable identification sources, including the Company Office and New Zealand Business Number information. Only when there is a strong degree of confidence that an identification match has been successful, will the Commissioner subsequently disclose the taxpayer’s debt information for the purposes of the data being included on the taxpayer’s credit report. 63 In addition, the proposal intends to work with the approved credit reporting agency’s processes and safeguards, to allow the approved credit reporting agency to perform a “common sense check”. If an error is identified, Inland Revenue will report that error to the approved credit reporting agency as soon as practicable, to allow the approved credit reporting agency to efficiently correct and update their records. This will include correcting any information that has been previously distributed to third parties. The Commissioner will provide each taxpayer with information on how they can report any data errors as well as the complaints process. Where an erroneous disclosure has occurred, the taxpayer can follow existing administrative law and ask the courts to judicially review the Commissioner’s actions and decisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Threshold for initial disclosure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Dun and Bradstreet, PwC) The $150,000 threshold of reportable unpaid tax contained in proposed section 85N(2)(d) may not achieve the policy intent of the changes. The submitter supports the provision that allows the Governor-General to change by Order in Council, however it is uncertain whether the threshold proposed will be sufficient to protect the business community and help them to mitigate business risk. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The use of a variable percentage of gross income to determine whether the tax debt is to be disclosed is inappropriate as it may expose businesses with materially small amounts of debt. (PwC) The power to adjust the thresholds is important. The reduction of these thresholds in the future will provide a truer picture of a party’s real liability position. (Dun and Bradstreet) Comment Officials acknowledge that the debt thresholds may not capture all sign ificant ly indebted businesses at the most appropriate time to disclose. These thresholds represent a balance between complexity and coverage across all s ign ificant ly indebted taxpayers. For the $150,000 threshold, the ability to amend by Order in Council is important and provides the ability to amend the threshold when there is a sudden change in circumstances that may require Inland Revenue to take action. The other threshold where the debt is more than a year old and is 30 percent or more of a taxpayer’s gross income can be considered for indebted taxpayers that may owe less than the 64 $150,000 threshold, but the tax debt is older, and significant compared with the turnover of the business. Officials will monitor the effectiveness of the proposal’s debt thresholds and consult with submitters if any further amendments are required. As part of that oversight, officials will monitor the implementation of the new rules and report to the Minister of Revenue if concerns with the effectiveness of the rules are identified. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Disclose where there is repeated non-compliance Submission (Dun and Bradstreet) Where the taxpayer has shown repeated non-payment behaviour, the Commissioner should be able to disclose the taxpayer’s information, despite the amounts outstanding being below the proposed debt thresholds. Comment The debt thresholds are designed for taxpayers that are significantly indebted. If the taxpayer is consistently and repeatedly filing tax returns without payment, the total debt amount will increase over time, until the amounts outstanding meet the prescribed debt thresholds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amending the threshold amount using an Order in Council Submission (Regulations Review Committee) Proposed section 85N(2)(d)(i) prescribes the threshold amount the taxpayer must owe in reportable unpaid tax, before the Commissioner can consider disclosing the taxpayer’s information, with an accompanying empowering provision that would allow this amount to be amended by an Order in Council. This provision is a technical “Henry VIII” power, as it authorises the statutory amount to be amended by Order in Council. There may be alternative ways of drafting this that would not create a technical Henry VIII provision. For example, the provision could state that the amount would be set by an Order in Council. 65 Comment Officials agree with the submitter’s suggested drafting of amending the empowering provision so the provision prescribes that the initial amount will be set by way of an Order in Council. This will resolve the submitter’s concerns, while maintaining the flexibility to amend the amount in the future. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Commissioner’s judgement Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) How is it proposed that the Commissioner determines a taxpayer’s income if the taxpayer is not up to date with their return filing. Comment The Commentary notes that the Commissioner will use previously filed tax returns and other financial information to reasonably determine the taxpayer’s gross income for the year. If the tax returns are unavailable, the Commissioner would require a level of other suitable financial information to reasonably determine the taxpayer’s income. It is difficult for the legislation to effectively prescribe what can be a taxpayer-specific situat ion. The better option is to leave this to the judgement of the Commissioner to determine whether the requirement has been met. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Require the Commissioner to disclose Submission (Deloitte, KPMG) Once the Commissioner has notified the credit reporting agencies of a tax debt, the Commissioner must ensure the accuracy of the tax debt record from that point, especially when the taxpayer has cleared the tax debt. (Deloitte) We note there may be a delay between the tax debt in Inland Revenue’s system, the reporting of that debt to the credit reporting agencies, and the use of the information by lenders. There needs to be a process to ensure that any shared information is updated in a timely basis. Th is includes 66 a requirement for the credit reporting agencies to update their records and information communicated to any third parties. (KPMG ) Comment The proposal relies on the Commissioner regularly disclosing data to external third parties (approved credit reporting agencies), with these agencies including the data in their databases, for the purposes of making that information available to selected third parties upon request. However, officials recognise that when taxpayers have paid their reportable unpaid tax debt in full, they would then want this information updated on their credit report as soon as practicable, so their credit records show they no longer owe any reportable unpaid tax debt to Inland Revenue. As part of the proposal’s implementation, Inland Revenue will design a separate method for communicating with the approved credit reporting agencies when applicable taxpayers have paid their debt in full. Due to the tax debt balances changing daily, and because databases are being administered by the approved credit reporting agencies, the Commissioner would be providing regular, scheduled information updates to the approved credit reporting agencies. Between these updates the data held by the approved credit reporting agency may become inaccurate, until the next data exchange has occurred and applied. The timing of these exchanges is yet to be determined, however they are likely to be on a fortnightly or monthly basis. Officials will provide further guidance on how data exchanges will work in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in principle, subject to practical limitations. Issue: Disclosure of key elements of reportable unpaid tax Submission (Deloitte) The Commentary indicates the Commissioner may disclose key elements about the taxpayer’s reportable unpaid tax, including the amount of outstanding tax for each tax type expressed within a narrow band, and the age of each tax type. It is not clear where or how this is expressed in the legislation, however we expect this is intended to be in subsection 85N(4). Comment The drafting of proposed section 85N(4) provides the legislative discretion to the Commissioner to communicate any information relating to the taxpayer and any amount of reportable unpaid tax. This includes the elements outlined in the Commentary. The legislation does not need to prescribe the elements, because as the legislation is currently drafted, that level of prescription is not required. 67 Officials will provide further information about the information that is disclosed under this provision in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Disclosure of default assessments Submission (R Saunders) Inaccurate information may be disclosed to an approved credit reporting agency, in particular, when the taxpayer has incurred the tax debt by way of a Commissioner-issued default assessment. In some circumstances, these returns are inaccurate compared with the tax return later filed by the taxpayer and so had this data been released, it would have been wrong. Comment The proposed amendment has been developed with several safeguards in mind, in order to minimize any possible inaccuracies. This includes having the debt data being served on the taxpayer (or director) and allowing time for the taxpayer to raise any inaccuracies with the tax debt information contained in the formal notice. The Commissioner would commonly raise a default assessment when a taxpayer had failed to file a required tax return. The default assessment is based on the best information available to the Commissioner at the time the default assessment was raised. A default assessment is usually rai sed when the tax return has been outstanding for some time (at least several months) and when the taxpayer had previously been informed that a default assessment may be raised if the return remains outstanding. While the default assessment would be manually issued by an Inland Revenue officer or automatically issued by Inland Revenue’s IT system, the default assessment fundamentally continues to represent a tax debt owed to the Commissioner. The Commissioner can take action (including legal proceedings) to recover the default assessment amount in the same way as any other tax debt. This would occur where the taxpayer has been issued with the default assessment and it remains unpaid. The quickest way for the taxpayer to resolve a default assessment is to file the outstanding return. However, officials do note the submitter’s concerns that some taxpayers may have outstanding returns or default assessments at the time they formally receive the notice. When an amount contained in a previously issued default assessment meets the definition of “reportable unpaid tax”, these amounts will be identified in the formal notice. The formal notice will also advise the taxpayer that if they wish for these amounts to best reflect their tax position at the time, they need to file their outstanding tax return as soon as possible. Th is notificat ion will be incorporated into operational guidelines. 68 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Publication of credit reporting agency that has had approval revoked Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commissioner should publish the number of credit reporting agencies that have had their approval revoked in the previous year. This would provide a check and balance on the proposal. Comment The Commentary states that any approval or revocation would be publicly notified. This is to ensure the general public is aware of who is authorised to receive the taxpayer’s information. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disclosing an individual’s information Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Dun and Bradstreet, PwC) Submitters are keen for officials to take a considered approach when contemplating extending the proposal to individuals. Inland Revenue will need to do further work to determine the consistency of the proposal with the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004, which regulates credit reporting agencies use of individual information. The submitter’s staff will work with Inland Revenue to help identify the best way to implement the policy for individuals in business, without unduly affecting their privacy. (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) At a minimum, we submit that credit reporting of an individual’s tax debt information should be the subject of further consultation. (PwC) Comment Officials acknowledge that further work is required when considering how best to extend the proposal to individuals. In due course, officials will welcome discussions with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and other submitters. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 69 Issue: Need for clarity Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The legislation should be updated and Inland Revenue should ensure there is clear guidance on the intended application of the rules (Deloitte). The legislation relating to the proposals is unclear, and does not necessarily align with the description included in the Commentary. It does not appear to explicitly require the Commissioner to disclose the amount of debt owing, despite the Commentary to the bill suggesting this will occur. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials acknowledge the balance between legislative flexibility and specificity can be better achieved and have referred some items to the drafters for consideration. Officials will issue guidance on the interaction and effect of this clause, including providing practical examples in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin. The Commissioner will also prepare guidance on the practical use of the proposed section, so taxpayers and tax practitioners are made more aware of the provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Guidance on what constitutes “reasonable efforts” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commissioner should publish detailed guidance on what she considers to be “reasonable efforts to recover reportable unpaid tax”. It will be critical to ensure trust and confidence in the system. It will therefore be fundamental for all parties involved, including the Commissioner, the taxpayer and the credit reporting agency, to understand the criteria that must be satisfied. Comment The Commentary notes that “reasonable efforts” includes when the Commissioner has engaged in recent, meaningful and sustained communication with the taxpayer. This includes when the Commissioner and the taxpayer have explored various options to resolve the reportable unpaid tax, without success, or when the taxpayer is in the process of securing finance or conducting an ordinary windup of their business, and the Commissioner is confident of its success. 70 Officials will provide further guidance on this in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, with the Commissioner also issuing guidance, so taxpayers and tax practitioners are made aware of what constitutes “reasonable efforts”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “income” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) Proposed section 85N(2)(d)(ii) is unclear about what is the “taxpayer’s income”. Is it gross income, net income, taxable income, taxable and exempt income? Comment The term “income” is defined under section BD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, officials acknowledge that this definition of income is very broad, and may be broader than is required for this provision. Officials recommend the proposed section be amended so the term “income” is replaced with assessable income. This defin ition is defined under the Income Tax Act 2007 and will include most of the usual forms of income received by New Zealand businesses. This figure can be determined from the tax returns and other financial information that taxpayers file with Inland Revenue. Th is definition will also provide clarity to taxpayers and tax practitioners about what income is included for the purposes of determining if the taxpayer has met this portion of the debt threshold. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Inconsistency between the Commentary and the bill Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) There is an inconsistency between the officials’ Commentary on the bill and the bill itself, in relation to the reportable unpaid tax debt thresholds prescribed in section 85N(2)(d). This subsection prescribes the amount of reportable unpaid tax that must be owed before the Commissioner can disclose the taxpayer’s information. The drafting does not reflect the policy intent as described in the Commentary on the bill. 71 The threshold is an amount that is greater than $150,000 or an amount that has been unpaid for a year and the amount is 30 percent or more of the taxpayer’s income for the past year. The drafting is expressed as a “:” meaning and/or, whereas the Commentary states that the threshold is part of a “greater than” test. Comment Officials confirm that the threshold contained in the bill is correct. The criteria in the Commentary is an error and officials propose to provide clarification in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, which details the tax changes to the public once the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting issues Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte) The submitters raise a number of drafting issues: i. Proposed section 85N(2)(d)(ii) is unclear as to what is “the year”, with the Commentary indicating this is the “previous” year. ii. Proposed section 85N(2)(7)(c) should be redrafted to improve clarity so that the number of taxpayers that have ceased having reportable unpaid tax in the previous year “having been previously” notified under this section. Comment Officials acknowledge the minor drafting points raised by the submitters. In submission i), the term “year” is defined under Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 as a 12-month period. The drafters have considered the submitter’s issue and consider that amending the term to “previous year” would lead to ambiguity and confusion, as the term “previous year” is commonly used in a tax year context and it is not being used in that context in the proposed section. In submission ii), the drafters have considered the submitters proposed drafting, and consider the difference in drafting to amount to different drafting style. As such, the drafters do not believe there is any added value in amending the current drafting. Officials w ill consider whether the drafting could be improved in other areas of the proposed section. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 72 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials would like to raise a number of drafting issues: • Proposed section 85N(8) and (9) could be redrafted to provide clarity on the interaction of (8) and (9). • Proposed section 85N(11)(a)(i) that results from liability for or refunds of income tax. Officials believe that this drafting could be clarified as excess refunds. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 73 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO SOME OFFENCES TO THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES Clause 104 Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The thresholds for sharing information in clause 104 are consistent with the exceptions provided for under principle 11(e) of the Privacy Act (which provides for disclosure where it is considered necessary to avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law). The provision is appropriately defined and will not unduly impact the privacy of affected individuals. (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Proactive sharing with the Companies Office Submission (Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand) Detailed guidance should be issued to the public on which provisions under the Companies Act 1993 would trigger action by the Commissioner, and in particular, how Inland Revenue would be interpreting these provisions. Comment If enacted, the process for sharing information with the Companies Office will be outlined in a Tax Information Bulletin and it will detail which provisions under the Companies Act will trigger action. Inland Revenue may proactively share information in certain limited circumstances where no interpretation of the Companies Act is required – if Inland Revenue discovers any persons still acting as director or promoter of a company when they are the subject of a prohibition order and/or if they are directing or acting in promotion of a phoenix company. The list of prohibited persons is a matter of public record. Inland Revenue may also proactively share information when it discovers a person making false statements about tax matters, as this may also mean false statements have been made under the Companies Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 74 Issue: Framework for information sharing with other agencies Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter voices a general concern that information sharing between agencies is being developed on an ad hoc basis without a framework which balances the need for information sharing with the rights of individuals to have control over information or keep information private. The lack of framework against which to test each information sharing decision means the rights of individuals will be gradually eroded. Through information sharing arrangements, agencies will be able to access data which it is not clear Parliament meant them to access. If Parliament did not give an agency the same powers to gather information as Inland Revenue, that agency was not meant to have that information, and should not access it through a sharing arrangement. Comment The Government is developing a framework for tax administration which includes the sharing of information gathered by Inland Revenue. In November 2015 the Government sought feedback from the public on a framework for tax administration through the release of the Making Tax Si mpler – Towards a New Tax Administration Act discussion document. This document suggested changes to the tax secrecy provisions to allow information to be shared among government agencies, in order to provide better public services, and to be shared with foreign jurisdictions, to assist in taxpayer compliance. The Government is considering the feedback it received from the public on the proposals and this will inform its work on any changes to the Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 75 MOTOR VEHICLE EXPENDITURE OF CLOSE COMPANIES Clauses 56, 58, 59, 60, 61 and 63 Issue: Scope of proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC) Three submitters supported the proposal to allow close companies the option of apportioning business and private use of motor vehicles instead of having to pay FBT on private use. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC) One submitter also acknowledged that while the proposal is a sensible and pragmatic simplification measure, it does contravene the concept of a company being a separate legal entity. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that the proposal does ignore the close company’s separate legal entity because the close company is operating like a sole trader and therefore is being treated the same as a sole trader for the purposes of this proposal only. This means that the company structure is set aside in order to use the motor vehicle expenditure rules if the close company elects to use this option. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Interest allocation rule for motor vehicle expenditure for close companies Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The interest allocation rule adds unnecessary complexity to a proposal that is meant to be a simplification measure. It is accepted that not allocating interest costs to the apportionment of vehicle expenses is impure. However, simplification is a compromise between compliance costs and accuracy. “Close enough” should be accepted as good enough in these circumstances. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The rationale for this rule is understood to be to prevent a close company obtaining a full interest deduction for a motor vehicle which is used 100% privately by the shareholder- employee. Addressing this concern is not straightforward given the fungibility of money. (KPMG ) 76 Comment This proposal provides an alternative to FBT on motor vehicles for close companies by providing methods to apportion the motor vehicle expenditure that includes interest. Motor vehicle expenditure includes interest that relates to the direct or indirect funding cost of motor vehicle expenditure – for example, interest on borrowings to purchase a motor vehicle. An interest allocation rule is required in order to limit the interest claimed on a motor vehicle used both privately and for business to ensure close companies using this option are treated the same way as sole traders. Without a specific interest allocation rule, close companies using this option would be able to claim all the interest on their motor vehicle funding costs under the automatic interest deduction rule for companies. For these reasons we recommend retaining the interest allocation rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternatives to interest allocation rule Submission (KPMG ) The submitter provided alternatives to the interest allocation rule, as follows: • Disallowing the taxpayer’s election into the subpart DE regime where there is an “interest all ocation avoidance arrangement”. An “interest allocation avoidance arrangement” could be defined as an “arrangement that involves the manipulation of the private/business use ratio with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the motor vehicle expenditure rules in subpart DE”. • A two-tiered objective test described as a prescribed private/business ratio that is complemented by a “brightline” threshold between when the motor vehicle is acquired by the close company and when the motor vehicle reaches the prescribed ratio of private/business use above. For example, if a motor vehicle is used for more than 50 percent private use during any income year within five years of acquisition by the close company, this could be deemed to be an interest allocation avoidance arrangement. • A prescribed 50% deduction of interest regardless of the private/business use ratio. This represents a compromise between accuracy and simplicity, being the main objective of the proposals. The submitter acknowledged that all of these require some element of tracing and are not therefore ideal and suggested further consideration is required. Comment As the submitter acknowledges, all of the above options involve a degree of tracing to establish the amount of interest attributable to amounts used to fund motor vehicle expenditure. The proposal also requires a degree of tracing of the interest amount but it is considered that this is appropriate given that this proposal allows a close company to be treated like a self-employed taxpayer and self-employed taxpayers would also be required to trace their relevant interest amount if they were using the motor vehicle expenditure rules. The advantage of the proposal 77 compared with a specific anti-avoidance rule is that it creates more upfront certainty for taxpayers as to what interest expenditure needs to be included. A 50% prescribed deduction of interest rule is also not appropriate when there is minimal business use of a motor vehicle. Using actual expenditure as a basis for calculating the business expenditure is a much more appropriate basis that can take into account all levels of business/private use. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 78 INCREASED THRESHOLD FOR TAXPAYER SELF-CORRECTIONS OF MINOR ERRORS Clause 105 Issue: Scope of proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PwC) Three submitters supported the proposal and all submitters recommended that the threshold be increased further. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Changes to the threshold Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PwC, EY) All submitters recommended changes to the proposal including: • increasing the statutory threshold; • setting the threshold as a percentage of tax due; and • having a threshold that applies to taxpayers with a residual income tax over a certain level. The threshold should be raised to either $2,000 or $5,000, or $10,000 for taxpayers with a residual income tax over a certain level. Increasing the threshold will decrease compliance costs. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) Alternatively the threshold should be a percentage of the total tax due or a mix of percentage and a threshold value depending on the type of taxpayer. ( Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) Further self-corrected errors should be disclosed in the taxpayer’s tax return. (KPMG) Comment Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act was introduced in 2009 as part of a wider package of measures to help reduce compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The section was aimed at providing a greater level of comfort to taxpayers by having a provision that allowed minor errors that had been identified to be rectified by including them in current 79 returns. It was also considered that it would reduce the number of interactions taxpayers had with Inland Revenue. The proposal increases the total discrepancy in an assessment threshold from $500 to $1,000. This increase in the threshold enables taxpayers to include more minor errors in their returns, which reduces compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Given that this provision was aimed at assisting SMEs, it is not recommended at this stage to increase the threshold beyond the proposed level because this is considered to be an appropriate threshold for non-disclosure of minor errors for SME taxpayers. Also further work on changing the scope of section 113A is being considered as part of the broader review of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Review of self-correction rules Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) A fundamental re-think of the rules applying to self-correction should be undertaken with a view to further reducing restrictions on self-correction. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There should be a broader review of the process for correction of errors. (K PMG) Comment Further work on reviewing the process for correction of errors should be considered as part of the broader review of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Widening the scope of section 113A Submission (EY) The proposed increase in the threshold is too restrictive and the scope of section 113A should be widened to include PAYE and other withholding tax errors. 80 Comment Further work on extending the scope of section 113A to other tax types should be considered as part of the broader review of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 81 SIMPLIFIED CALCULATION OF DEDUCTIONS FOR DUAL USE VEHICLES AND PREMISES Clauses 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 71 Issue: Scope of proposal – vehicles Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC) The simplified method for calculating deductions for vehicles used for both business and personal purposes is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scope of proposal – dual use premises Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposal for expenditure on dual use premises is not supported because there is no real simplification as a result of having to do two calculations: one calculation for utilities using the Inland Revenue published rate and another calculation for rent, rates and mortgage interest. The second calculation is the calculation done now by taxpayers. Comment The proposal does provide simplification for taxpayers with dual use premises because it results in fewer calculation for taxpayers as they are able to use the Inland Revenue published rate for utilities per square metre. The second calculation that is related to actual costs is necessary because mortgage interest, rates and rent are fixed costs related to the dual use of the premises. These costs vary depending on a taxpayer’s circumstances. It is therefore more appropriate to calculate the deduction for these costs based on a portion of the actual costs related to the area of the premises used primarily for business purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 Issue: Standard deduction amount for dual use expenditure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposal should be replaced with one that allows the deduction of a standard amount for dual use expenditure with that amount being set by Inland Revenue; initially at say $2,000. Taxpayers should be able to elect to use the standard amount or undertake their own calculation. A standard sum would be a true simplification measure as it would remove the need for the calculation and gathering of information about a diverse range of costs. According to the Regulatory Impact Statement, Officials consider that a flat rate would be too inaccurate, as it would not be proportionate to the size of the premises used for business purposes. The submitter’s suggestion is a simplificat ion measure and simplificat ion is a compromise between accuracy and cost. In its present form the proposal is not a simplification measure. Comment A set deduction amount bears no relationship to actual expenditure incurred by taxpayers that relates to the dual use of the premises and would be viewed as a subsidy for taxpayers with home offices. The method proposed offers simplification and a reduction in compliance for taxpayers who use the method, while still maintaining the general principles of deductibility. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “total premise costs” Submission (EY) The proposed section DB 18AA(3)(a) definition of “total premise costs” should also include insurance or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should clarify that insurance costs will be included in determining the “square metre rate”. Comment The suggestion to include insurance costs as part of the square metre rate has been forwarded to the Inland Revenue operational area that will be responsible for setting the rate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 83 REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT TO RENEW RWT EXEMPTION CERTIFICATES ANNUALLY Clause 101 Issue: Scope of proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Three submitters supported the proposal with one submitter saying this was because the proposal will reduce compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Section 32I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Deloitte) RWT exemption certificates for taxpayers with tax losses and RWT refunds are actually issued under section 32I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and therefore the bill should also be modifying section 32I. Comment Officials agree that section 32I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to confirm that a RWT exemption certificate issued in accordance with to section 32I can also be issued for an unlimited period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Expanding the scope of the proposal to other types of exemption certificates Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Inland Revenue should consider expanding this proposal to other types of exemption certificates (for example, non-resident contractors’ tax). 84 Comment Extending the proposal to other types of exemption certificates goes beyond the scope of this proposal, and further investigation would be required to understand how and when this could be progressed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Listing holders of exemption certificates on website Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) If a certificate is open-ended, it is important that a passive income payer is able to rely on this unless notified by the payee or Inland Revenue. This could be achieved by Inland Revenue maintaining a website page listing taxpayers with valid exemption certificates. Comment Inland Revenue currently maintains a list on its website of IRD numbers for reissued and cancelled RWT exemption certificates. The Government discussion document Making Tax Si mpler – investment income information , released in July 2016, included a proposal for Inland Revenue to maintain such a database for payers to access. The basis of this submission is therefore already being considered as part of that workstream. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 INCREASING THRESHOLD FOR ANNUAL FBT RETURNS FROM $500,000 TO $1 MILLION OF PAYE/ESCT Clauses 90 and 91 Issue: Scope of proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The proposal is supported as it will reduce compliance costs for some taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inconsistency between wording in sections RD 60 and 61 Submission (Deloitte) There is inconsistency in wording between sections RD 60 and RD 61, which are being modified by clauses 90 and 91. We submit that the other wording in these section should be tidied up to ensure they are clear in their application. In particular, section RD 60 refers to FBT returns being made on an income year basis (not on a 1 April – 31 March standard year if the employer has a non-standard balance date). Section RD 61 makes reference to both tax years (1 April – 31 March) and FBT being calculated on an “annual basis” (presumably based on a tax year). It is unclear why close companies who provide a fringe benefit to a shareholder-employee are able to pay FBT on an income year basis but a small business (which might also be a close company) who provides fringe benefits to an employee who is not a shareholder-employee is not. It is not clear from the legislation which of these sections takes precedence. Comment Officials note the issues raised by the submitter and recommend that that these be considered in the next available tax bill dealing with fringe benefit remedials. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 86 Issue: The use of the section RD 29 formulae for calculating motor vehicle benefits Submission (EY) The proposed increases to the thresholds are welcomed but it is submitted that the section RD 29 formulae for calculating motor vehicle benefits on an income year and annual return basis be amended so that they are identical and consistent with the Commissioner’s apparent practice and advice to taxpayers. Inland Revenue guidance suggests that the same formula is used for both annual and income year FBT returns. This guidance is inconsistent with the legislation and should be revised. Comment The points raised in the submission have been forwarded to the area in Inland Revenue responsible for the guidance on FBT to review Inland Revenue’s guidance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 87 MODIFYING THE 63-DAY RULE ON EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION Clause 70 Issue: Scope of proposals Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC, K PMG) Three submitters supported the proposal including one submitter who supported the change in the interim. One submitter did not support the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Not a simplification measure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed modification of the 63-day rule for employee remuneration is not a true simplification measure. Employers who elect not to calculate the 63-day adjustment will save time but incur a tax cost. Comment The proposal is a simplification measure because employers who chose not to apply the existing 63-day adjustment rule will avoid having to track payments of employment remuneration paid within the 63-day period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Allowing deductions for accrued employee expenditure Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The 63-day rule should be modified to allow the deduction of holiday pay incurred at balance date but still to be paid. This would match expenditure to the appropriate year by bringing to account a liability that an employer must meet. The 63-day rule could continue to apply to other remuneration provisions. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 88 The correct solution is to allow employers to take a deduction for accrued employee expenditure on the basis that such expenditure is incurred. (Deloitte) If financial statements are audited, then accruals booked for items such as employment remuneration should be accepted as expenditure incurred for tax without any review of possible under- or over-accruals. A more targeted policy response which addresses the concerns regarding deferred bonuses could be: • for statutory obligations such as holiday pay, a deduction should be able to be taken for expenditure incurred; and • for contractual obligations such as payment of a bonus, a deduction should only be able to be taken for expenditure incurred if there is a legal obligation to pay within a certain timeframe (for instance, within a three to six month timeframe). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Given the 63-day adjustment is a temporary tax difference only (that is, a matter of timing as the deduction will ultimately be allowed), the better option is simply to allow the deduction. This would not apply to accrued shareholder-employee income, which is not recognised as taxable income in the same income year. This carve-out is necessary to ensure that deferral advantages are not sought due to a difference between deduction and income for related entities. (K PMG) Comment Submitters are suggesting a change to allow a deduction for accrued employee expenditure. Some submitters have suggested this modification be limited to holiday pay accruals while others have suggested it should apply to all accruals of employee expenditure apart from shareholder-employee accruals. One submitter has suggested an additional requirement for contractual obligations other than statutory obligations. The basis for these suggested changes is that these accrued amounts meet the general incurred test for deductibility because the employer has a legal obligation to pay the various amounts. However as these payments are accrued and not yet paid, these amounts need to be added back in the income year they are accrued. The proposal does not change this treatment. The current 63-day rule was adopted because if the employer were able to claim all expenditure in relation to accrued employee expenditure there would be a mismatch between the year the employer recognises the expense and the year the employee recognises the income. This princip le still applies and for this reason we do not support making any further changes in this area. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of the proposal Submission (EY) It should be clarified and expressly provided that the amended section EA 4(1) applies for the 2017–18 and subsequent income years. Taxpayers preparing and filing their 2016–17 returns 89 after 1 April 2017 would seem entitled to apply the amended provision for those returns on the basis the amendment was then in force. It is suggested that the application of the amendment should be clarified by specific provision in the legislation, preferably for returns for the 2016–17 and later income years, otherwise for the 2017–18 and later income years. Comment The proposed amendment comes into force on 1 April 2017. However, to ensure consistency about when the new rule applies for all taxpayers, it is recommended to clarify that the proposed amendment applies for the 2017–18 and subsequent income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 90 OTHER SUGGESTED CHANGES TO BUSINESS TAXATION No clause Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, PwC) Several submitters suggested additional items that could be considered to reduce compliance costs for businesses. They included: • reviewing the timing of deductions for ACC levies, audit and accounting fees (PwC) • reviewing the rules around entertainment, GST and the entertainment limitation rules ( PwC) • extending the $10,000 threshold for legal fees to entertainment expenditure (PwC) • increasing the residual income tax threshold for provisional tax liability to $10,000 (EY) • reducing the current standard uplift rates (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) • excluding one-off fluctuations from uplift calculations (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • removing the requirement to renew exemption certificates annually for other types of exemption certificates (Corporate Taxpayers Group) • extending the early payment discount rules to all taxpayers regardless of business structure (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). Comment We consider that the items would need further investigation before being progressed. Officials will consider these suggestions in the context of the tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 91 Automatic exchange of information 92 93 GENERAL ISSUES Clauses 3 to 26 Issue: General support and acknowledgement Submissions (BNZ, Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Kensington Swan, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Office of the Privacy Commissioner, PwC, TGT Legal) The submitters provided general expressions of support (albeit in many cases subject to concerns in relation to specific issues). (BNZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Kensington Swan, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Office of the Privacy Commissioner, PwC, TGT Legal) The submitters acknowledge Inland Revenue’s engagement with financial institutions and their advisors. (Chapman Tripp, PwC) Comment Officials welcome the general expression of support from these submitters. Additional support for particular aspects of the bill is identified throughout this report. Submitters concerns over specific issues are also identified in this report. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Establishing general tax-based “know your client” rules Submission (KPMG ) The proposals establish “know your client” rules for non-residents only. Consideration should be given to implementing general tax-based “know your client” rules, which apply to residents and non-residents. Th is is an opportunity to establish tax-based “know your client” rules, which establish a person’s status and on which investors and New Zealand financial institutions can rely, for multiple tax purposes (that is, withholding and exchange of information). Comment The submitter has raised an issue that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. 94 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Efficacy of the Common Reporting Standard Submission (KPMG ) Inland Revenue appears to have concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) regime. In a draft internal memo provided to the Government Inquiry on Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules, Inland Revenue appears to advise the I nquiry that the CRS is easy to avoid (as well as not always applying). We consider it important that, as a matter of public record, officials’ concerns should be expressly addressed by the Select Committee. Comment The design of the CRS reflects OECD recognition that a comprehensive reporting regime that would apply to every investor in every circumstance would impose unreasonable compliance costs on jurisdictions. The CRS therefore adopts a pragmatic and risk-based approach that targets structures and jurisdictions where offshore tax evasion is most likely to occur. 2 Under this approach, the CRS therefore does not have a one-size-fits-all approach to trusts. A trust may be a financial institution or a non-financial entity, depending on its circumstances. This can affect whether information about the trust and persons connected with the trust are reported for CRS purposes. Trusts that are financial inst itutions will generally have CRS reporting obligations in respect of their non-resident settlors, trustees and beneficiaries. However, trusts that are non-financial ent it ies will generally only be subject to CRS reporting to the extent that they satisfy “passive non-financial entity” criteria, hold accounts with financial institutions and have controlling persons that are non-resident. A pragmatic approach is also adopted in respect of the due diligence procedures that apply to accounts. Stringent rules apply to new accounts. These generally require customers to provide self-certifications as to their residence status. However, for pre-existing accounts, the CRS often allows financial institutions to rely on information they already have on hand, and to identify relevant non-residents for reporting solely on the basis of “indicia of non-residence” that are evident from the information held. These matters all contribute to whether an account holder (or controlling person of an account) is reported for CRS purposes. Inland Revenue’s comments to the Inquiry reflect the reality of these points. 2 The CRS als o requires imp le me nt in g ju r is d ic tio ns to es tab lis h effec t ive a nt i-avoidance ru les . C o ns is tent w ith th is req u ire me nt, proposed section 185R in clause 24 of the bill contains a proposal fo r a broad anti-avo idance rule. 95 Recommendation That the submission be noted. 96 INCORPORATING THE CRS INTO NEW ZEALAND LAW Issue: Incorporation by reference Submissions (KPMG, Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Westpac) On balance, making the CRS part of New Zealand law is the best answer. (K PMG) The proposal raises significant sovereignty issues which should be carefully considered. (Chapman Tripp) We do not support the implementation of AEOI by incorporating the CRS into New Zealand law by direct reference to the CRS and OECD Commentary. Our preference is for the text to be redrafted using current legislative drafting practice and to be restated in the Tax Administration Act 1994. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Westpac) Comment Officials consider that making the CRS part of New Zealand law is appropriate. It is also broadly consistent with the approach adopted by Australia. 3 The CRS is an international standard that New Zealand has committed to fully implement. Translating the rules, as set out in the CRS and as clarified and elaborated upon by the related OECD Commentary, into legislation would be feasible. Indeed, some countries have opted for that approach. However, translating the rules is unnecessary and, given the complexity inherent in the rules, would risk creating inaccuracies and ambiguities in the legislation. New Zealand will be subject to comprehensive international peer review to ensure that the rules as set out in the CRS and OECD Commentary have been enacted correctly. Incorporating the CRS by reference removes any risk of inadvertent inaccuracies that would result in confusion or a failed peer review. It may be noteworthy that only two submitters have indicated that they do not support this approach. Their specific arguments are addressed below as separate issues. Only one submitter has expressly indicated support for the proposed approach. However, silence on the part of other submissions on this matter appears to indicate tacit support. Indeed, some submissions have made explicit suggestions to assist in making the approach more workable – for example, by publishing a New Zealand version of the CRS. These suggestions are dealt with below as separate issues. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, and that the submissions recommending against incorporate by reference be declined. 3 However, New Zealand’s approach differs from Australia’s in respect of the ambulatory approach, discussed in this report. 97 Issue: Lack of an express power to incorporate by reference Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Tax Administration Act 1994 does not expressly include a power to incorporate material by reference, which would be best practice. Comment The submitter’s point is noted, but an Act cannot empower itself. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Lack of plain language Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Westpac) The drafting in the CRS and OECD Commentary is not expressed in terms that impose clear obligations. In addition, the CRS and OECD Commentary do not use plain language drafting that will be easily understood by taxpayers. For example, the CRS is amended by Schedule 2 of the bill. This, in turn, substitutes certain sections of an annex to the CRS for sections of the CRS itself. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The CRS and OECD Commentary is not expressed in terms that impose clear obligations. Many commentators have noted that the language used in the CRS does not meet with the plain language drafting used in New Zealand tax legislation. Reliance is placed on guidance contained in the OECD Commentary which is not written using the New Zealand id iom. (Westpac) Comment The rules as set out in the CRS and OECD Commentary are inherently complex. Rather than improving clarity, translating the rules into legislation actually raises the risk of creating inconsistencies and ambiguities. However, the concerns that have been raised are acknowledged. To address these concerns, officials note that Inland Revenue intends publishing a New Zealand version of the CRS that will include all New Zealand-specific modifications and dates. Approval is currently being sought from the OECD for this approach, given that the CRS and OECD Commentary are subject to copyright. Inland Revenue will also publish guidance on the CRS due diligence and reporting requirements, which will provide further clarity about obligations. 98 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Lack of accessibility Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Westpac) It is a fundamental principle that the law should be accessible to all. There should be one place to go to locate the regulatory framework and AEOI laws applicable to New Zealand individuals and entities. However the CRS and OECD Commentary are subject to copyright and it may not be possible for them to be made available on the New Zealand legis lat ion website. Comment As noted, officials intend publishing a New Zealand version of the CRS that will include all New Zealand-specific modifications and dates. Approval is currently being sought from the OECD for this approach, given that the CRS and OECD Commentary are subject to copyright. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ambulatory approach Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Westpac, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The CRS and OECD Commentary are to be incorporated into New Zealand law as amended from time to time. This is referred to as an “ambulatory approach”. It means that any subsequent changes that may be made by the OECD to the CRS or OECD Commentary will automatically become New Zealand law. Such changes will therefore not be subject to consultation and the Parliamentary process. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Westpac) Changes should not be automatic, but should be incorporated into New Zealand law by Order in Council. Changes without any approval of the Executive seem constitutionally inappropriate. An Order in Council mechanism would be consistent with FATCA, where changes to the IGA must be made by Order in Council. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Changes that automatically apply may result in inconsistencies with or be contrary to New Zealand law (for example, the Privacy Act 1993). (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Westpac) 99 Comment Officials’ reasons for proposing the ambulatory approach are as follows. The CRS and OECD Commentary will be refined by the OECD over time to close loopholes and address deficiencies. New Zealand will have an opportunity to influence any future changes as decisions are being made and approved at the OECD. New Zealand officials participate in those decision-making sessions and have veto rights. Once changes are approved by the OECD they become part of the international standard, which New Zealand has committed to implement. Failure by New Zealand to respond to the changes, particularly if it has failed to veto the changes at the OECD, would have international ramificat ions. However, officials acknowledge the concern of stakeholders that decisions could be made that will have unreasonable or unintended implications for New Zealand financial institutions and other taxpayers. Financial institutions and taxpayers would have the right to challenge particular changes through judicial review if applicable. It also remains open to Parliament to act to prevent any future changes through explicit legislation, if it considers such an action necessary. This would need to be made in the full awareness and acceptance of the potential international ramifications. However, the time it would take to enact explicit legislation to block changes would be problematic if a rapid response was required. To address that concern, Officials recommend insert ing a regu lat ion-making power into the bill by which the Government could, if it desired, act quickly to defer commencement of any particular change. That is, changes to the CRS would apply automatically unless the Government intervenes with an Order in Council setting terms around the application of the change, such as an effective start date. With regard to the specific point raised by a submitter about consistency with FATCA, officials note that the FATCA rules are implemented by means of a different mechanism. The FATCA rules are enshrined in a bilateral treaty with the United States. Changes to the rules will therefore require an amendment to the treaty, which must then be given effect by Order in Council. A different mechanism applies for AEOI. In response to the specific point raised by two submitters that changes could be contrary to New Zealand law, and in particular the Privacy Act, officials note that this is unlikely. Information obtained and provided by a financial institution in accordance with a legislative requirement (including a requirement arising from such a change) would take precedence over that Act, as would the exchange of such information by Inland Revenue to meet a treaty obligation. Comments further below, under “Privacy”, that confirm that human rights and other legal safeguards will continue to apply, are also relevant to this issue. However, as a matter of course Inland Revenue will monitor changes, with a view to notifying financial institutions and other taxpayers of any such changes. If inconsistencies or other issues are identified, the Order in Council mechanism recommended above could be used to defer implementation until the issues are addressed. It will also be open to financial institutions and taxpayers to challenge any changes, for example by seeking judicial review, if they consider their legal rights are infringed. 100 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, and that a regulat ion-making power be introduced to enable the Government, if it considers it necessary or otherwise appropriate, to act to require certain changes to commence from a particular date, or not to apply at all. Issue: Ambulatory approach – timing concerns Submissions (Chapman Tripp, KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Changes to the CRS should not apply retrospectively. (Chapman Tripp, KPMG) Inland Revenue should provide taxpayers with a sufficient transitional period to understand and make the systems/process changes that may be necessary as a result of any change to the CRS. Particular issues arise because New Zealand’s reporting period is different from the 31 December reporting year adopted by most other countries. There is no evidence that the OECD would promote reasonable timelines. (Chapman Tripp, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Comment Changes to the CRS and OECD Commentary will normally be announced by the OECD at its annual Ministerial Council Meeting, which is typically held in June. In the normal course of events, any changes would be expected to apply from the beginning of the next reporting period (in the case of New Zealand, 1 April). That means New Zealand financial institutions can expect to have around nine months’ lead time for changes. However, it is difficult to envisage all circumstances that could arise, and it is not inconceivable that particular implementation timeframes could be mandated by the OECD in respect of some changes, for valid reasons. New Zealand officials would attempt to influence such decisions as they are developed and approved at the OECD to prevent unreasonable timeframes from occurring. But, again, it is not inconceivable that such decisions could be approved. If that were the case, and if it were to give rise to difficulties for financial institutions, these matters would be relevant to considerations of whether penalties should be imposed in the circumstances. If the Government considered it to be necessary, the Order in Council mechanism recommended above could be also be used to block or change implementation dates. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 101 Issue: Ambulatory approach – advance notice Submission (KPMG ) New Zealand is involved in OECD working parties, and therefore should be in a position to publish proposals for change as they are proposed by the OECD. Comment The OECD itself generally submits proposals of this nature for public consideration, and calls for submissions. Otherwise, OECD confidentiality rules would normally apply, meaning that officials would be constrained from providing advance notice of specific proposals under consideration by the OECD. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ambulatory approach – notification by Inland Revenue Submission (Chapman Tripp) Inland Revenue should notify taxpayers of any changes to the CRS (for example, in a Tax Information Bulletin or on the Inland Revenue website). Comment Officials agree and note that Inland Revenue would do this as a matter of course. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Ambulatory approach – accessibility Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, Westpac) Inland Revenue should provide taxpayers with ready access to current and all historic versions of the CRS, OECD Commentary, and other relevant instruments, so that they can easily ascertain the version that applied at any particular time. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, Westpac) 102 The bill should be amended to require Inland Revenue to do this. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Inland Revenue should maintain and publish an up-to-date New Zealand version of the CRS and OECD Commentary. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) Comment This is similar to the issue raised above in relation to “Lack of accessibility”. As noted in relation to that submission, Officials intend publishing a New Zealand version of the CRS that will include all New Zealand-specific modifications and dates. Approval is currently being sought from the OECD for this approach, given that the CRS and OECD Commentary are subject to copyright. Under this approach, updated and historic versions would all be publicly available. It would be unusual to include this in the bill as a requirement. In any case, formal OECD approval has not yet been obtained for this approach. (No difficulties are anticipated, as there is a degree of implied consent for implementing jurisdictions to replicate the CRS, but the legal niceties must be observed.) Recommendation That the submissions to publish current and historic New Zealand versions be accepted (subject to the receipt of OECD approval). That the submission to require this in the bill be declined. 103 PRIVACY Issue: Privacy impact assessment Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Inland Revenue has kept my office updated regularly as this initiative has progressed. Implementation of the CRS as provided for in the bill does not seem unduly privacy-invasive. I understand that Inland Revenue is currently assessing the potential privacy impacts of adopting the wider approach and my staff will continue to work with them as they finalise this. Comment The reference to assessing the potential privacy impacts alludes to a draft Privacy Impact Assessment that Inland Revenue has prepared, in consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Finalising that Assessment report was deferred pending the Select Committee consideration of the bill, to ensure that any privacy concerns identified during consideration could be addressed in the report. In finalising the document, officials will continue to liaise w ith the Privacy Commissioner’s office. For clarification in relation to this submission and other submissions below, the reference in the submission to the “wider approach” refers to the compliance cost reduction options offered in the CRS that implementing jurisdictions can adopt, to: • allow their financial institutions to identify account holders or (where relevant) controlling persons that are non-resident, as opposed to resident in particular (“reportable”) jurisdictions; and • allow their financial institutions the option of reporting all of the identified non-resident account holders and controlling persons, as opposed to only reporting on those that are only resident in reportable jurisdictions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Privacy Commissioner’s endorsement required Submissions (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Chapman Tripp) Some industry participants have concerns that the wider approach has not been endorsed by the Privacy Commissioner. Inland Revenue should confirm with the Privacy Commissioner that financial institutions will not be in breach of the Privacy Act 1993 if they elect to adopt the 104 wider approach. Th is is urgent, as financial institut ions need certainty before they build systems. (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The outcome of Inland Revenue’s discussions with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner should be clearly communicated to all affected parties. (Chapman Tripp) Comment This issue is addressed in the Privacy Commissioner’s submission on the bill. That submission is a public document. The Privacy Commissioner does not view the proposals in the bill as unduly privacy invasive. However, the Privacy Commissioner has requested that Inland Revenue be transparent on the purposes for which it will use information, conduct a public education campaign, and have robust procedures in place. As noted above, Inland Revenue will engage with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner as it finalises the Privacy Impact Assessment. Inland Revenue will disseminate information arising from that engagement in its proposed public education campaign, and on its website. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Legal safeguards Submission (Cone Marshall Ltd) It is important that there is assurance that the data protection rules which are built into the Privacy Act 1993, the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 will extend to all data gathered under the CRS rules. Comment Inland Revenue will only exchange information required to be exchanged, and will do so in accordance with its legal obligations. The Tax Administration Act rules will extend to data gathered under the CRS rules as a matter of course. There are inherent conflicts between any cross-border information exchange involving tax- related personal information, and the Privacy Act. However, such conflicts are recognised and resolved in the various legislative and treaty mechanisms. In this regard, the submission referred to above from the Privacy Commissioner that the proposals in the bill do not seem unduly privacy-invas ive, is relevant. 105 With regard to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act (and other applicable legal safeguards), it is important to note that all of New Zealand’s tax treaties under which information exchanges can be made expressly require such legal safeguards to continue to apply. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Public education campaign Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) The Government should launch a public education/communication campaign to enhance awareness of AEOI. The campaign should clearly explain the roles and responsibilities of taxpayers and financial institutions under the CRS requirements. The bill proposes a new section 185P(4) wh ich will place the onus on account holders to inform their financial institut ions in a timely manner about any material changes of circumstance that will affect the information previously provided to the financial institution. The Government should put in place a public education programme to inform the public of their CRS obligations. The campaign should also clearly explain the concept of “tax residence”. Comment Officials agree. In addition to Inland Revenue’s planned on-going engagement with financial institutions and stakeholders (which will include the provision of guidance material), a w ider public education campaign will be undertaken. The campaign will address the specific points raised by the Privacy Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Potential use of data for purposes other than that for which it has been collected Submission (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Inland Revenue will need to develop robust procedures for managing any “residual information” it collects under the AEOI framework. 106 Both Inland Revenue and financial institutions will need to clearly communicate their chosen implementation processes to their customers to ensure they are fully informed of the impacts of the changes. For consistency with New Zealand’s privacy laws, it is proposed that the potential use of residual information by Inland Revenue be subject to full transparency. Comment The reference to “residual information” in the submission relates to information that might be reported under the wider approach to reporting but which does not need to be exchanged with other countries for AEOI purposes. Officials agree that Inland Revenue must have robust procedures for managing residual information. Officials also agree that transparency is important in this regard. Officials intend ensuring transparency in different ways, including in its public information campaign and other messaging about how reported information can be used. As noted above, officials will continue to engage with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, in particular with regard to finalising the Privacy Impact Assessment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 24(1) Issue: “Permitted choice rule” Submission (Chapman Tripp, KPMG) Financial inst itutions that choose to adopt the wider approach to reporting are likely to come under significant pressure and potential challenge from customers. A “permitted choice” rule similar to that applying for FATCA would protect financial institutions against such challenges. Comment In broad terms, the Privacy Act 1993 has a rule that provides that it will be overridden by express legislation. Accordingly, a financial institution providing information to Inland Revenue under an express legal requirement in tax legislation will not violate the Privacy Act. However, the situation is not as clear if a financial institution provides information on the basis of having elected to do so under an option allowed in the tax legislation, rather than being required to do so. Financial institut ions are concerned that they could be vulnerable to challenge that the Privacy Act is not overridden because there was no compulsion to make the election. 107 This issue was addressed in the FA TCA legislat ion by means of a “permitted choice” rule 4 that essentially provides that, if a financial institution makes an allowable election, it must then report to Inland Revenue on that basis. This creates the necessary legislative override. The bill includes a similar rule in section 185N(8). However, the submission highlights the concern that this may not be sufficiently clear. Officials recommend that the rule be clarified, and relocated to follow the general provision on options in section 185O(5), to address the submitter’s concern. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Sections 185N(7) and 185O(5) – conflicting drafting Submission (KPMG ) Section 185N(7) allows a financial institution a choice to apply the wider reporting approach or not. Section 185O(5) suggests that this choice is subject to Privacy Act compliance. We understand that it is intended that the choice is freely available. That intention should be clearly expressed. Comment Officials agree that the current wording could lead to a lack of clarity, and that the drafting should be amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 4 Section 185F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 108 SUBORDINATE LEGISLATION Clauses 12 and 25 Issue: Determinations Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, David McLay) The submitter supports the Commissioner having power to issue such determinations. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Under proposed section 226D, the Governor General, in Council, can promulgate any territory outside New Zealand to be a reportable jurisdiction. Under proposed section 91AAU, the Commissioner can determine any jurisdiction to be a “participating jurisdiction”. It seems that the latter is the more important decision, as it applies for the purposes of Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (information sharing agreements). No grounds for inclusion are specified, and there are no procedural steps. As at 26 July 2016, there were 101 jurisdictions that had committed to the OECD’s Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). As New Zealand has a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) with 40 jurisdictions and Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEA) with another 11 jurisdictions (and another 9 jurisdictions), it is clear that there are many potential recipients of information under the AEOI where there are no bilateral treaty obligations. (These numbers are based on the Inland Revenue Policy website – the reference to “90 jurisdictions” at page 8 of the Explanatory Note to the Bill is difficult to understand.) It is submitted that each of proposed section 226D and proposed section 91AAU should be amended to permit jurisdictions with DTAs or TIEAs with New Zealand to be included as reportable jurisdictions or participating jurisdictions (respectively) by way of Order in Council, and that other jurisdictions can be added after the Commissioner is satisfied that there are appropriate protections for the secrecy of the tax information to be disclosed under the AEOI. It is respectfully submitted that anything less than this would be treating private tax information as being “owned” by Government rather than held by Government as a custodian. This provision ought not to be enacted in its current form as it will be a serious erosion in the principle of taxpayer secrecy. (David McLay) Comment Officials acknowledge the submission that supports the proposal. Officials note that the submitter raising privacy concerns may not have correctly understood the difference between the concepts of “reportable jurisdiction” and “participating jurisdiction”. New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions are those that it will provide information to. New Zealand’s participating jurisdictions are those that will provide information to New Zealand. In the context of concerns over countries maintaining confidentiality in respect of information provided by New Zealand, the only relevant list is therefore the reportable jurisdiction list. This is why only that list is subject to the Order in Council mechanism, to ensure Government oversight. The mechanism proposed in the bill is therefore consistent with the submitter’s expressed aim. 109 The submission also signals potential confusion as to the exchange mechanism. The submitter appears to be concerned that exchanges might be made on the basis of the list of reportable jurisdictions rather than under tax treaties. Officials can confirm that all AEOI exchanges will be made under an authorising tax treaty. Officials also confirm that the existence of appropriate protections for the secrecy of exchanged information will be a key consideration in the selection of countries for addition to the list of reportable jurisdictions. Such considerations will be informed by the outcomes of comprehensive reviews currently being undertaken internationally by the OECD’s monitoring agency (the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes). Submissions will also be called for domestically, to provide stakeholders with an opportunity to provide input into those considerations. The tax treaty that will apply for all (or almost all) exchanges is the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which New Zealand signed in 2012. D TAs and TIEAs will only be relevant for AEOI exchanges if, for any reason, an exchange partner needs or has a strong preference to make the exchanges under a DTA or TIEA rather than the Multilateral Convention. No jurisdiction has yet announced that intention, but it cannot be ruled out as a possibility. The reference to “90 jurisdictions” refers to the current number of parties to the Multilateral Convention that have also committed to implement AEOI. The remaining number of committed jurisdictions have either signed the Multilateral Convention and are awaiting entry into force, or are expected to do so shortly. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Clauses 12 and 25 Issue: Lack of objectives and criteria Submission (KPMG) The proposals do not clearly state the objective of determination and regulation powers so it is difficult to test their validity. Explicit criteria should be provided. For example, the legislation should specify how the Commissioner should determine whether a country is a reportable jurisdict ion. Comment The CRS requires implementing jurisdictions to publish lists of excluded entities and accounts, participating jurisdictions and reportable jurisdictions. The bill proposes that the first three categories of list be made by “determination” by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The provisions in question authorise the Commissioner to “determine” which entities, accounts or jurisdictions are to appear on the lists. The criteria which the Commissioner must apply are set out in the CRS and do not need to be included in the legis lat ion. 110 The reportable jurisdictions list is also required by the CRS, but the bill proposes an Order in Council process to ensure Government oversight, given that privacy and other important issues will need to be taken into account (as discussed earlier in this report). Inland Revenue intends providing guidance in respect of the lists. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 12 Issue: “Determination” as a defined term Submissions (New Zealand Law Society) The word “determination” is used in sections 91AAU, 91AAV and 91AAW as if it were a defined term. The bill Commentary also capitalises the word, suggesting it is a defined term. This may cause confusion. Section 91AAU(3) also appears to read as a continuation to subsection (1) where the phrase “the determination” first appears. However subsections (1) and (3) refer to two different forms of determination. Comment The term “determination” is used in many places in the Inland Revenue Acts, and is not defined. Officials do not consider there to be any unique consideration applicable to AEOI that would require the term to be defined in this case. However, officials concur there is merit in improving the drafting to improve clarity. In particular, in the issue with section 91AAU(3) the reference to “The determination” should be resolved. Recommendation That the submission be in accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments that the term “determination” should not be defined, but changes made to the drafting to improve clarity should be made. 111 Clauses 12 and 25 Issue: Timing Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, KPMG, AMP, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Sections 91AAU, 91AAV, 91AAW and 226D are inconsistent. Sections 91AAU(2), 91AAW(2) and 226D(2) provide that a determination or regulation made under those provisions may set out the period for which it is to apply. However, section 91AAV(2) provides that the Commissioner must set out the period. (New Zealand Law Society) Transitional rules which govern their effective date and period should also be included in the legis lat ion. This should refer to a reporting period, and the legislation should provide that changes must not occur part-way through a reporting period. (K PMG) Financial institutions require significant lead time for changes to the list of participat ing jurisdictions. Ideally any change to the list would take effect in the following reporting period in respect of obligations on financial institut ions. An exception to this could apply when general practice is at odds with tax administration and back-dating would merely align the two. Inland Revenue should engage with the banking industry on transition periods when making changes. (AMP, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment The different approach highlighted in clauses 12 and 25 was intentional. The determination and regulation-making powers proposed in those clauses relate to the CRS requirement for an implementing jurisdiction to publish lists of its non-reporting financial institutions, excluded accounts, participating jurisdictions and reportable jurisdictions. Additions to these lists will generally be favourable for financial institutions and officials expect that financial institutions may not want to be precluded from such changes applying mid- reporting period. For example, a financial institution that is added to the list of non-reporting financial institutions would have a strong preference for that change to have immediate effect, to remove any obligation to report in relation to the current reporting period. However, officials’ acknowledge that concerns may arise in the reverse situation, when an entity, account or jurisdiction is removed from a list. Any removal would result in CRS obligations being “switched on”. Officials agree in principle that such changes generally should not apply mid-reporting period. However, there would be a risk in preventing the immediate application of changes. New Zealand needs the ability to swift ly respond to directives from the OECD/Global Forum directives. If, for example, a Global Forum peer review were to crit icise New Zealand’s list of participating jurisdictions, and require removal of a country from that list with immediate effect, a legislative prohibition against making an immediate change would be problematic. 112 Accordingly, the drafting proposed in the bill permits, but does not require, Inland Revenue to specify a reporting period. Inland Revenue intends to clarify the processes around additions to, and removals from, lists in guidance material. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Clause 12 Issue: Three-month limitation in section 91AAV Submission (KPMG) It is not clear why determinations that suspend reportable jurisdictions should be limited to three months. Either remove the three-month limitat ion or clarify in the legislation what the objective of the determination is (which would include an explanation of why a three-month period is imposed). Comment A treaty obligation to exchange information with a country by a particular deadline may need to be suspended as a matter of urgency, for example, in the case of a serious breach of privacy by that country. Normally, such a suspension would be made by the Order in Council mechanism proposed in section 226D. 5 However, if the exchange deadline is imminent, there may be insufficient time to promulgate an Order in Council. Section 91AAV is therefore a safety mechanism that authorises the Commissioner to suspend the exchange in these circumstances, pending confirmation by Order in Council. The three-month limitation reflects the fact that the Commissioner’s action must be confirmed by the Government (by Order in Council). Officials do not consider that this needs to be explained in the legislation. Inland Revenue intends clarifying the matter in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 T o c lar ify, th e int erac t io n o f New Z ea land ’ s lis t o f rep o rtab le jur is d ic t io ns w ith the treaty obligations effectively mean that removing a country from a list effectively “switches off” the applicable treaty obligation. 113 Clauses 12 and 25 Issue: Location of published lists Submission (AM P) The bill provides that the lists of participating jurisdictions, non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts will be published “in a publication chosen by the Commissioner”. Access to these lists impacts a financial institut ion’s ability to comply with its CRS obligations. The legislation or regulations should specify where, or how, a financial institution will be able to easily ascertain where the lists have been published. Ideally, this would be the Inland Revenue website. Comment Officials agree that it is important for the lists to be published in a way that is widely available and accessible. Inland Revenue will ensure that this is the case. At a m inimum, Officials would expect the lists to be available on Inland Revenue’s website. However, the drafting proposed in the bill will ensure Inland Revenue has the flexibility to supplement this by other means. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 12 and 25 Issue: Urgency Submission (AMP, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) The lists of non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts should be published as soon as possible. Inland Revenue’s intended date of early-to-mid 2017 may be too late and lead to unnecessary compliance costs, and adversely impact customer service. Preferably, the lists should be published at least six months before 1 July 2017. Inland Revenue should issue a draft determination or other guidance describing the categories of entities and accounts that may be excluded as soon as possible. If it is not possible to issue a draft determination, officials should provide an indication as to the accounts that will be excluded. There is a risk that financial institutions could also unnecessarily report excluded customers. 114 Comment Officials agree it is important to disseminate this information as soon as possible. Given that determinations will only be authorised when the bill has been enacted, if possible, Inland Revenue will issue indicative lists as soon as decisions have been made. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 115 NEW ZEALAND TIMELINES Clause 24(1) Issue: Deadlines for reviewing and reporting pre-existing accounts Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) From FATCA experience, involving smaller numbers and less complexity, CRS due diligence and reporting compliance will be extremely challenging. Compliance costs and efforts will be significantly higher in the first reporting period under CRS. This should be taken into consideration when setting the first reporting period. In light of these challenges, there are workability issues with the three-month grace period set out in the bill for carrying out due diligence and “immediate” reporting (as opposed to reporting in the period following on from when an account is identified as reportable as per general FATCA and CRS obligations) on pre-existing accounts. There is a risk that if the proposals remain unchanged, customer experience will suffer due to the pressure to complete due diligence. More customers will likely be reported simply because financial institutions will be unable to completely assess customers within the required period. Comment Officials acknowledge these difficu lt ies. The bill proposes a three-month grace period for pre- existing account due diligence and a transitional approach to penalties to try to minimise compliance costs. Inland Revenue will also be producing guidance on CRS due diligence and reporting obligations with a view to clarifying these obligations and minimising compliance costs. The grace period attempts to allow extra time for carrying out due diligence, while still ensuring that New Zealand complies with its AEOI exchange obligations. The grace period is broadly in line with that adopted by Australia. It is also important to note that financial institutions that consider that utilising the grace period will be operationally difficult are not required to do so. They merely have the option to do so. That is, a financial institution could decide to take nine months to review and, if reportable, report pre-existing high value individual accounts and 21 months for other pre-existing accounts, as opposed to utilising the grace period and taking 12 months and 24 months respectively to review and, if reportable, report these accounts. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 116 Clause 25 and schedule 2 Issue: References to facilitate a non-calendar year reporting period Submissions (Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Law Society) We support the adoption of a reporting period that aligns with the tax year. Proposed schedule 2, item 1, is intended to achieve that. However, there are many references to “31 December” throughout the CRS (for example, in sections V.D.2, VIIIA.6(b), VIII.C.15, VIII.C.17) and “calendar year” (for example, in sections III.C.6, I.C, V.B) that should also be changed so all date references are aligned to the concept of the period ended 31 March. (Chapman Tripp) For item 10 of new schedule 2, the reference to “31 December” on line 4 of section V, subparagraph D(2) should be replaced with “31 March”. This is consistent with the approach taken in relation to the review of pre-existing entity accounts under FATCA (as stated at paragraph 94 of Inland Revenue’s FATCA due diligence guidance notes). (New Zealand Law Soci et y) For item 20 of new schedule 2 the second reference to “31 December” on line 3 of section VIII, subparagraph C(15) should be replaced with “31 March”. This is consistent with the approach taken in relation to the review of high-value accounts under FATCA (as stated at paragraph 67 of Inland Revenue’s FATCA due diligence guidance notes). Comment The bill intends to provide that references in the CRS are read as aligning with the tax year. However, the submitters have correctly identified some additional modifications that need to be made to facilitate this. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 117 COMPLIANCE COSTS Clause 24(1) Issue: Deadlines Submission (TGT Legal, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Reporting deadlines should be reasonable having regard to the purpose for which the data is collected. They should be consistent with those applicable to, for example, the filing of returns by the trustees of other trusts. (TGT Legal) From FATCA experience, which involved smaller numbers and less complexity, CRS due diligence and reporting compliance will be extremely challenging. Compliance costs and efforts will be s ign ificant ly higher in the first reporting period under CRS. This should be taken into consideration when setting the first reporting period. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) In light of these challenges, there are workability issues with the three-month grace period set out in the bill for carrying out due diligence and “immediate” reporting (as opposed to reporting in the period following on from when an account is identified as reportable as per general FATCA and CRS obligations) on pre-existing accounts. (TGT Legal) There is a risk that if the provisions remain unchanged customer experience will suffer due to the pressure to complete due diligence. More customers will likely be reported simply because financial institutions will be unable to completely assess customers within the required period. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment The bill proposes that the annual CRS reporting period will be for the period ending 31 March and that reporting will be by 30 June. The 31 March period approach was endorsed by a number of submitters in the initial round of consultation and is in line with New Zealand’s tax year and reporting date for FATCA. Submitters consider that this alignment should assist in minimising compliance costs for financial institutions. The 30 June deadline for reporting is also in line with FATCA timeframes, and was broadly supported by submissions in initial consultation. This date will also provide Inland Revenue with sufficient time to process the information reported and exchange it with the relevant jurisdictions, in accordance with its international commitments. Officials acknowledge that financial institutions will face difficult timelines. The bill proposes a three-month grace period for pre-existing account due diligence and a transitional approach to penalties to minimise compliance costs in this regard. The grace period is broadly in line with that adopted by Australia. The grace period attempts to allow extra time for carrying out due diligence while still ensuring that New Zea land complies with its international commitments to complete first exchanges by 30 September 2018. However, financial institutions that consider that utilising the grace period will be operationally difficult are not required to utilise this period; they merely have the option to do so. 118 Officials also note that New Zealand is allowing a longer period of time for the completion of reviews of pre-existing entity accounts (effectively 24 months) than Australia (effectively 13 months). Officials also note that Inland Revenue intends producing guidance on CRS due diligence and reporting obligations with a view to clarifying such obligations and further minimising compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Confirming reasonableness of self-certifications Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, BNZ) A financial institution must confirm the reasonableness of a self-certification based on the information they have obtained. It is not clear what this requires. For example, an account holder is required to specify their tax residence. However, determining tax residence is not always straightforward and can be difficult for an individual let alone a financial institution. Expecting a financial institution to confirm the reasonableness of a self-certification places an undue burden on them. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Financial institutions should be able to rely on the self-certification provided by customers and additionally rely on the obligation placed on customers to provide information about a material change in circumstances relat ing to a self-certification. (BNZ) Comment Self-certifications (and checking the reasonableness of such certifications) are a critical element in the CRS, and New Zealand does not have the ability to unilaterally relax the requirements. The CRS and OECD Commentary set out the circumstances in which a financial institution can reasonably rely on a self-cert ificat ion. Generally, self-certifications can be relied upon unless a financial institution knows, or has reason to know, that the certification may not be correct. This means that, for example, a financial institution should cross-check the certification against any other information they have, for anything that might put them on notice that there is an inconsistency. Given that self-certifications will generally be obtained on account opening, this will typically mean cross-checking the self-certification against information received from the customer at the same time as the self-cert ification. Inland Revenue intends to provide additional guidance on the circumstances when a financial institution can rely on self-certifications that they have received when classifying a customer for CRS purposes, and how the rules regarding changes in circumstances apply in this context. 119 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Reliance on anti-money laundering (AML) processes Submissions (AM P, K PMG) For CRS purposes, a financial institution should be able to use the information it collects under AML about controlling persons, particularly until the next raft of AML legislative changes are implemented and CRS and AML are fully aligned. (AM P) The ability of financial institutions to rely on their AML processes for CRS purposes, to the extent they support CRS compliance, should be explicitly provided. (KPMG ) Comment The CRS and OECD Commentary stipulate the specific circumstances in which a financial institution is able to rely on AML procedures to help carry out CRS obligations. There is no scope in the CRS for relying on AML procedures beyond those specified circumstances. To the extent there is any non-alignment between AML and CRS, the CRS procedures must drive the CRS obligations. This is consistent with the fact that CRS is a global initiative and will need to be implemented consistently world-wide. The OECD and Global Forum will rigorously monitor New Zealand’s compliance with the CRS obligations. The circumstances in which a financial institution is able to rely on AML procedures to help it carry out CRS obligations are incorporated in the bill, through the importing of the CRS and the Commentary. Further explicit clarificat ion is not required in the legis lat ion. However, officials note this is a matter that Inland Revenue intends to provide guidance on. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 120 Clause 24(1) Issue: Reliance on information provided by other means Submission (KPMG ) Efficient implementation of the CRS will require the use of existing information and processes. As drafted, it is not clear that information, directly or indirectly, already available to a financial institution can be used to satisfy CRS requirements. Comment The CRS sets out several instances when a financial institution can rely on information it already has (including information that may be held by, for example, an agent working on their behalf) in carrying out due diligence. There is also some scope for institutions within a group to rely on such information. However, these instances are prescribed by the CRS itself. F inancial institutions will (especially for new accounts) often need to obtain a self-certification with respect to the account. These points are addressed in the CRS, which is already incorporated by reference in the bill. Inland Revenue will also provide guidance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 12 Issue: Non-reporting financial institutions and excluded accounts Submissions (AMP, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) The list of CRS exempt entities and accounts should include those entities and accounts that are exempted for FATCA purposes. (AMP, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Any inconsistency between obligations imposed under FATCA and obligations imposed under the CRS applied standard should (to the greatest extent possible) be avoided. (Russell McVeagh) Comment For FATCA, it was agreed with the United States that certain types of entities and accounts would be exempt from FATCA obligations, on the basis that they were considered to pose a low risk of tax evasion. The submissions propose that these same exemptions should also apply for CRS. 121 The CRS also provides for exemptions for entities (non-reporting financial institutions) and accounts (excluded accounts). The CRS and OECD Commentary set out specific criteria that must be satisfied before these exemptions can apply. Importantly, these criteria do not focus solely on whether entities or accounts pose a low risk of tax evasion. Although a number of the FATCA exemptions are likely to also apply for CRS purposes, any FATCA exemption will need to be tested against the CRS criteria before confirming that they will also apply for CRS purposes. The OECD has been clear that an exemption for FATCA will not automatically apply for CRS purposes. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. That is, that they are accepted to the extent that the entities and accounts that are exempt for FATCA purposes also comply with the defined criteria that must be satisfied before an exemption can apply for CRS purposes. Clause 24(1) Issue: Undocumented account reporting Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association, BNZ) The definition of undocumented accounts in the bill should be extended to include new as well as pre-existing accounts. Comment The OECD has a base expectation that self-certifications will always be obtained for new accounts. As a general rule, an account should not be opened unless and until the requisite self- certification is obtained. Consistent with this, the CRS and OECD Commentary only contemplate the reporting of undocumented accounts in relation to certain types of pre-existing account. That is, the OECD seems to have taken the position that extending undocumented account reporting to new accounts is not applicable because either the requisite self-certifications will be obtained or the account will not be opened. The framework that New Zealand has in requiring that financial institutions obtain self- certifications will be a key area of Global Forum peer review, particularly in the context of new accounts. There is a risk that if New Zealand has an explicit provision that allows the reporting of undocumented accounts for new accounts, New Zealand will be criticised as not having a sufficiently robust legislative framework to ensure that self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts. This is because undocumented new accounts will only arise if self- certifications have not been obtained in the first place. 122 One submission notes that the Cayman Islands and the United Kingdom both allow undocumented account reporting for new accounts. However, other countries have not adopted this approach. In particular, Australia’s CRS legislation does not explicitly provide for undocumented account reporting for new accounts. Officials consider that any decision to extend the key building blocks of CRS (of which this is one) should be done on a multilateral basis, rather than adopting a unilateral domestic amendment that could result in a failed peer review. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 24(1) Issue: Timing for obtaining self-certifications Submissions (KPMG, TGT Legal, AM P) Clear rules on when self-certification is required should be legislated. To be consistent with the CRS associated guidance, this should be within 90 days. (K PMG) We understand from Inland Revenue that, if a financial institution is unable to obtain a self- certification at the time of opening a new financial account (under proposed section 142H(3)), a further period of 90 days would be given to the institution to obtain such certification. The provision of this grace period for self-certification reflects the approach expressly supported by the OECD, and is endorsed by Inland Revenue. However, there is no mention of a grace period in the bill. The bill should be amended to include specific reference to the “90-day grace period” being available to financial institutions in relation to obtaining self-certification when opening new financial accounts. (TGT Legal) AMP supports the stated Inland Revenue approach of permitting a financial institution up to 90 days to obtain a self-certification when it is not possible to obtain it on day one. (AMP) Comment The CRS generally provides that a self-certification is to be obtained “upon account opening”. OECD “Questions and Answers” on its website clarify how this “upon account opening” requirement should apply in practice. The general rule as set out in that clarification is that this should occur as part of a “day one” process. However, the clarification provides that there is scope for a 90-day period to be used, as an exception to this general rule, in certain circumstances. These circumstances are highly nuanced, and do not amount to a blanket 90-day period always applying. The reference in the CRS to “upon account opening” should be read in accordance with this background context. 123 The bill provides, in this regard, that a financial institution is able to choose to avail itself of options consistent with the CRS. This would include the ability to apply the 90-day approach in the circumstances set out in the OECD clarification. Inland Revenue also intends to provide guidance on how this 90-day approach would apply in practice, given that the application of such a 90-day period will be highly fact-specific. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Clause 24(1) Issue: Filing nil returns Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Financial institutions should not have to file nil returns as this adds to compliance costs. Instead, we recommend that financial institutions must evidence “nil returns” if required by Inland Revenue. Comment The CRS provides that jurisdictions may allow financial institutions to file nil reports. This ability is incorporated through the general option provision in proposed section 185O(5). There will be no compulsion for financial institutions to file nil reports. This is merely an option that is available to a financial institution if it has a preference to file nil returns. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 124 OPTIONALITY Clause 24(1) and schedule 2 Issue: Adoption of “optionality” Submiss ion (BNZ) We support the inclusion of “optionality” in the bill. Where there is optionality, requirements and definitions should be made clear to ensure consistency across financial institutions. Comment The bill sets out a general rule that financial institutions are able to take advantage of optionality consistent with the CRS. This is subject to some limited exclusions set out in proposed section 185N(11) and the exclusions set out in schedule 2, items 1 and 4. Inland Revenue intends to provide guidance on the circumstances when optionality is permitted and what the requirements are in this regard. This should help to ensure consistency across financial institutions. Elsewhere in this report, where potential areas of ambigu ity are h igh lighted, recommendations for removing the ambiguity or otherwise clarifying the legislation are proposed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 24(1) and schedule 2 Issue: The wider approach to due diligence Submissions (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Chapman Tripp) The submitters broadly support the inclusion of the wider approach to due diligence in the bill. (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The OECD’s suggested CRS replacement sections for facilitating the wider approach should be further modified to clarify that financial institutions are required to undertake due diligence to identify account holders (and controlling persons) that are resident in any foreign jurisdiction and to collect the requisite information that relates to them and to those foreign jurisdictions. (Chapman Tripp) 125 Comment This issue is already addressed in proposed section 185N(3)(c) and the importing of the wider approach to due diligence under proposed schedule 2, item 2 (as modified by items 3 to 12). However, officials consider it may be useful to seek additional clarity by including an express override of the CRS in relation to section 185N(3)(c). This matter could be referred to the drafter for consideration. Recommendation That the submissions supporting the wider approach to due diligence be noted. That the submission recommending modifications be declined, but that the matter of including an express override of the CRS in relation to section 185N(3)(c) to be referred to the drafter for consideration. Clause 24(1) and schedule 2 Issue: Wider approach to reporting Submission (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The submitters broadly support the inclusion of the wider approach to reporting in the bill. (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The wider approach to reporting should be mandatory rather than optional. This is the approach taken in most other countries to reduce compliance costs and inconsistencies. The optional approach will be confusing to customers if some financial institut ions elect to report all of their CRS information to Inland Revenue and other institutions elect to report only on residents of reportable jurisdictions. This will add an unnecessary level of complexity for customers with foreign tax residencies. Financial institutions that opt for the wider approach are likely to receive customer complaints if a customer is reported to Inland Revenue by one financial institution but not by another. Dealing with such complaints, notwithstanding the absence of any grounds for such a complaint, would unnecessarily and significantly increase compliance costs for institutions that are fully complying. Account holders may also choose to move their accounts to institutions that only report accounts on the reportable jurisdiction list, creating an unfair competitive advantage for some financial institutions. Allowing financial institutions the choice to limit reporting will not reduce compliance costs as intended, but will simply spread them over a much longer period. The reportable jurisdiction lists will change over time and financial institutions will need to constantly update processes and reporting requirements to meet those changes. (AMP, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Some industry participants have concerns that the wider approach has not been endorsed by the Privacy Commissioner. Inland Revenue should confirm with the Privacy Commissioner that 126 financial institutions will not be in breach of the Privacy Act 1993 if they elect to adopt the wider approach. (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment The approach proposed in the bill is to allow financial institutions the option to decide whether to adopt the wider approach to reporting. Officials consider that the “optional” nature of the wider approach to reporting is important for the following reasons: • An overarching objective has been to have an implementing framework for CRS that aims to minimise compliance costs where possible and to allow financial institutions to make choices, where permissible, to allow them to achieve that end. This will generally involve the institution undertaking a cost/benefit analysis of the merits of adopting a particular option. • It will allow a financial institution to choose to report all information about all non- residents that they have identified (choose to adopt the wider approach to reporting) if they consider that such an approach would be preferable from a business/compliance cost perspective. This is conceptually similar to the general “optionality” permitted in the bill (set out in proposed section 185O(5)), which has been broadly endorsed by the industry. All of these options have the ability to impact on what information will be reported to Inland Revenue. • It will allow a financial institution to choose only to report information about non- residents from reportable jurisdictions (that is, choose not to adopt the wider approach to reporting) if it considers that such an approach would be preferable from a business/compliance cost perspective. • The “optional” nature of the wider approach to reporting is particularly important for smaller financial institutions that may not otherwise be required to report to Inland Revenue for CRS purposes. A mandatory wider approach to reporting would require these institutions to file a CRS report to Inland Revenue on an annual basis (and potentially be subject to penalties for failing to do so) if they have any non-resident accounts, even if all of the information was information that Inland Revenue would not be exchanging for AEOI purposes (that is, even if the only non-resident accounts were not held or controlled by residents from reportable jurisdictions). This would add compliance costs for these institutions for those periods where they would be required to report. A number of submissions were made in the earlier consultation with industry on the compliance cost concerns associated with requiring such institutions to report under the wider approach in these circumstances. Officials also note that there is not a consistent approach world-wide with regards to the wider approach to reporting. Some jurisdictions have not permitted it, whereas others have. Ultimately, a decision whether to adopt the wider approach to reporting and, if so, whether that approach should be optional or mandatory is a matter for implementing jurisdictions to consider. This is why the OECD has allowed each implementing jurisdiction the choice of what approach to adopt, after weighing up the relevant considerations. On balance, officials consider that the optional wider approach to reporting is preferable as it allows institutions to make a choice (as per other options available to them) that they consider will best suit them from a compliance cost perspective. 127 Submissions on endorsement by the Privacy Commissioner have been addressed above as a separate issue. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, but that the submissions for the wider approach to reporting to be mandatory be declined. 128 DEFINITIONS Clause 8(2) Issue: “CRS standard” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As currently drafted, the definition of “CRS standard” refers to “financial accounts as defined”. It is assumed that the phrase “as defined” is included as a reference back to the relevant definition of “financial accounts” in the CRS standard. However, this reference may be confusing to a reader as it suggests there is a definition of “financial accounts” in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is exacerbated by the absence of a similar reference back in relation to other terms used in the Act that are defined in the CRS applied standard. The words “as defined” should therefore be removed. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 8(3) Issue: “FATCA agreement” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of “FATCA agreement” correctly refers to the full title of the agreement. However, it is more commonly known as the “intergovernmental agreement”, and the link to it on Inland Revenue’s website also uses that title. It would assist a reader’s understanding if the definition were to include the words “commonly known as the intergovernmental agreement with the United States in relation to FATCA”. Comment Officials agree. 129 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 8 Issue: “Financial institution” Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) A definition of “financial institution” which applies for the CRS and FATCA rules should be included in the legis lat ion. A standalone New Zealand definition of “financial inst itution” is not strict ly required. However, including a definition that references the CRS and FATCA definitions would assist a reader’s understanding of the legislation. Defining “financial institution” would mean that the term could then be used in the legislation in preference to “person” (FATCA) or “entity other than a person” (CRS). The definition would need to be ring-fenced to the CRS and FATCA rules. (KPMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Due to differences in the definition of “financial institution” under the FATCA and CRS regimes, we recommend alignment of the FATCA financial institution definition to that contained in the CRS. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment Officials consider that any advantages of defining “financial institution” in the legislation would be outweighed by the disadvantages. Inserting a definition into the legislation would then require that term to be maintained to ensure that it remained consistent with the CRS. To avoid this, the legislation is been drafted in a way that facilitates changes by the OECD automatically applying. The submitters acknowledge that including a definition is not strictly needed, but generally argue for its inclusion on the basis that it would make the legislation more readable. The same argument would apply for any other term defined in the CRS. Officials do not consider there is an advantage in referring to “financial institution” rather than “person” or that “entity other than a person” would materially change the position. Under FATCA, the term “financial institution” is defined in the treaty (“the FATCA intergovernmental agreement”) that New Zealand has entered into with the United States, and cannot be unilaterally amended in New Zealand legislation. That said, the FATCA intergovernmental agreement allows entities to substitute the definition of “financial institution” in the United States’ Treasury Regulations, which is very similar to the CRS definition. Therefore, an entity that wants broadly the same definition of financial institution applying for CRS and FATCA purposes can simply choose to use the United States’ Treasury Regulations definition of “financial institution” for FATCA purposes. This would result in broadly the same test applying for both CRS and FATCA purposes. 130 This is a matter that Inland Revenue intends to address in guidance following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Clause 6 Issue: “Foreign account information sharing agreement” Submission (EY) The bill proposes amending the definition of “foreign account information-sharing agreement” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to extend its application beyond FATCA and facilitate its application to AEOI. The proposed new definition refers to agreements that facilitate “the automatic exchange by the parties of information relating to financial accounts”. The present definition, which is limited to New Zealand’s FATCA agreement with the United States, does not include the word “automatic”. While the exchange of information between New Zealand and other jurisdictions is likely to become much more extensive and frequent, it will still be occurring under and in terms of New Zealand’s tax treaties. On that basis we suggest the word “automatic” may be misleading and could, preferably, be excluded from the statutory definition. Comment Officials do not agree. “Automatic” exchange has specific meaning under tax treaties. It refers to a programme of automatic exchanges of specific categories of information agreed between treaty partners. AEOI and FATCA are both programmes of automatic exchanges of financial account information. The reference to “automatic” in the definition is therefore appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 8(4) Issue: “Maintain” Submission (AM P) Is sub-paragraph (a) intended to make a broker a financial institution? 131 Subparagraph (c) should be made subject to the CRS, particularly the exclusions from “financial account” as there is a risk that this subparagraph could inadvertently negate the CRS exclusions. Comment In relation to sub-paragraph (a), the provision sets out the circumstances in which a financial institution, as defined, would be considered to maintain a custodial account. It does not determine the circumstances when an entity will be a financial institution. In relation to sub-paragraph (c), officials consider that the submitted amendment is not needed as there is no conflict under the scheme of the CRS. By definition, a financial account can never include an excluded account. Recommendation That the submission on sub-paragraph (a) be noted, and the submission on sub-paragraph (c) be declined. Clause 8(7) Issue: “Passive income” Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Westpac) The submitter welcomes the inclusion of a definition of “passive income” in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will facilitate consistent interpretation and application of the CRS applied standard in New Zealand. However the definition has been drawn from the OECD Commentary and reworded, rather than replicating the Commentary. Replicating the Commentary would remove any risk of inadvertent gaps and ensure that any subsequent guidance issued by the OECD (in relation to “passive income”) will apply in New Zealand. (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed definition of “passive income” should not apply for FATCA purposes. Most financial institutions that have implemented FATCA were not planning on revisiting decisions on their FATCA systems and processes unless changes had been initiated by the United States. There is no specific definition of “passive income” for FATCA purposes. The definition that has been applied is “income from financial assets”. Importantly, this means that income from real property is excluded. A new and different definition would require reconsideration of the characterisation of entities for FATCA purposes. There does not appear to be any requirement from the United States that a definition be introduced for FATCA to align with CRS. No such change should be made without the United States’ confirmation of the need for change and then only with a suitable lead time. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Westpac) 132 Comment With respect to restating the definition, officials disagree. Whereas other aspects of the CRS and OECD Commentary are incorporated into New Zealand law by reference, the OECD’s Commentary on the meaning of “passive income” is worded in such a way that it cannot be directly imported. It therefore needs to be defined in the legislation. That definition has been drafted using the applicable New Zealand legislative draft ing style. Officials cannot detect any difference in meaning. The proposal that the definition of “passive income” would apply for FATCA as well as for CRS purposes was made with the intention of minimising compliance costs for financial institutions. However, a number of submitters have noted that such a change could actually increase compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission on restating the definition of “passive income” be declined. That the submission on limiting the application of the definition to the CRS be accepted. Clause 8 Issue: “Tax return” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of “tax return” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to omit a return required under the CRS applied standard, in the same way that FATCA returns are carved out. This will ensure that late filing penalties do not apply (it is not necessary to impose late filing penalties, given that a general sanction applies). Comment Officials agree that the same approach should apply for both FATCA and CRS. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 133 Clause 8(9) Issue: “Taxpayer identification number (TIN)” Submission (AM P) Why is any application of a double tax treaty disregarded? Comment The submitter’s reference to a double tax treaty refers to the fact that such treaties usually include “tie-breaker” rules to resolve dual-residence issues. The definition in question does not refer to such tie-breaker rules, because the reference is not needed. For example, it is clear from the OECD Commentary that a customer that is dual-res ident in New Zealand and Australia would apply the tax treaty tie-breaker rules, and self-certify on the basis of the outcome. This does not need to be built into the definition. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 8 Issue: “Undocumented account” Submissions (AMP, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The bill’s Summary of Proposed Amendments (Commentary) refers to “undocumented account”. Under the CRS, an undocumented account arises in extremely restricted circumstances, namely where an account has a hold mail instruction or in care of address, and no other address, and the financial institution has taken prescribed steps to try to document the account but has been unable to do so. The comparable FATCA term is “recalcitrant account”, but the reporting requirements for recalcitrant accounts and undocumented accounts are very different. The above factors may give rise to confusion. The legislation should therefore be amended to clarify the limited circumstances in which “undocumented account” reporting can arise. (AMP) If a financial institution is unable to determine the status of a pre-existing account it generally must report it as an “undocumented account”. However, the CRS provides that “undocumented account” only relates to particular situations and there is a conflict between the CRS and the OECD Commentary. Accordingly this requires clarification. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) 134 Comment Officials agree that, to avoid confusion, the limited circumstances in which “undocumented account” reporting can arise should be clarified in the legislation. Inland Revenue also intends to provide guidance in respect of undocumented account reporting. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 135 ENFORCEMENT Clause 9(3) Issue: Record-keeping requirements – self-certifications (1) Submissions (AMP, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The bill takes a more comprehensive enforcement approach to record-keeping than the international AEOI obligations require, specifically around the requirement in proposed section 22(2)(1d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to keep records about any failure to collect a self- certification. Th is requirement should be removed as existing section 22(2)(lc) imposes a general obligation on financial institutions to maintain records, and this is adequate to ensure compliance and accountability. Section 22(2)(1d) is superfluous given the obligation that already exists under section 22(2)(1c). This legislative detail will add onerous and costly obligations, may result in unintended consequences, and is not necessary. For example, it would be costly, onerous, and unnecessary for a financial institution to extract into a dedicated database the failures of customers to respond to self-certification requests. The appropriate mechanism in respect of failures to obtain self-certifications is through reporting of undocumented accounts, both new and pre-existing. CRS record-keeping requirements should align with those currently imposed under FATCA. (BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment The CRS contains a number of due diligence procedures that require financial institutions to obtain self-certifications. The OECD Commentary highlights that obtaining the requisite self-certifications (particularly for new accounts) is a critical aspect of ensuring that the CRS is effective. The OECD’s expectation is that implementing jurisdictions will have robust procedures in place to ensure that self-certifications are obtained for new accounts. 6 There is also a broader expectation that implementing jurisdictions will have robust procedures in place to ensure that they are able to monitor and verify compliance with the CRS. Being able to monitor and verify when the requisite self-certifications have not been obtained will be a key element of this. This will, in turn, be a key part of the OECD’s review of New Zealand’s compliance with the CRS. Proposed section 142H(3) imposes a penalty for a failure to obtain a self-certification for a new account. There is also a penalty in proposed section 142I(2)(f) and (h) that can apply to an account holder or other person that does not provide a required self-certification. A key aspect of monitoring and verifying compliance with these obligations will be being able to determine whether such self-certifications have been obtained or provided. 6 Paragraph 18, page 211 of the OECD Commentary. 136 For this reason, it is important that an obligation for a financial institution to keep a record of any failure to obtain a self-certification for a new account is imposed, so that compliance can be effect ively verified in the context of review or audit activity. It is arguable that the requirement to keep records of failures to obtain self-certifications is subsumed within section 22(2)(lc). However, officials consider that expressly stating the obligation in section 22(2)(ld) is an important clarification in light of the conflicting submission about whether such a requirement adds to or is subsumed by the general keeping obligation. Officials disagree with the comment that compliance with section 22(2)(ld) would require a dedicated database of failures of customers to respond to self-certification requests. Workflow- type records and business processes should satisfy the proposed requirement. The reference to an undocumented account reporting mechanism, for both new and pre-existing accounts was addressed above as a separate issue in the section on compliance costs. With respect to the comment that CRS record-keeping requirements should align with those currently imposed under FATCA, officials note that this is effectively the same issue as that just addressed. The CRS record-keeping requirements are broadly in line with the FATCA requirements. The key difference is that for the CRS, the bill proposes an express record- keeping obligation for failures to obtain self-certifications. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Clause 9(3) Issue: Record-keeping requirements – self-certifications (2) Submission (AM P) The references in proposed section 22(2)(ld) to “failure by the person to obtain a self- certification” should refer to “the customer’s failure to provide information”. Comment The submitter suggests changing the emphasis from failure of a person to “obtain” a self- certification to failure of a customer to “provide” it. However, failure to obtain a self- certification could potentially arise in other circumstances. For example, the failure might arise from a failure of a controlling person to provide a self-cert ificat ion. The submitter also seems to be suggesting broadening the provision to refer to “information” rather than “self-certifications”. The objective of the provision is to buttress the rules around obtaining self-cert ificat ions. Officials therefore do not support the suggested changes. 137 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 9(3) Issue: Record-keeping requirements – additional requirements Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Matter raised by officials) The requirement, under proposed section 22(2)(1d), for a person to keep records of any failure to obtain a self-certification should be amended to read “a failure by a person to obtain information, or a self-certification as required by the CRS applied standard”. (New Zealand Law Soci et y) The CRS record-keeping obligations ought to cover all documents that are material to a financial institution’s CRS compliance. This may include documents other than self- certifications (for example, documentary evidence establishing an account holder’s tax residence). An additional record-keeping requirement for financial institutions should be inserted into clause 9 of the bill, requiring financial institutions to keep records of the steps undertaken and any evidence relied upon for the performance of their CRS obligations. (Matter raised by offi ci als) Comment The AEOI standard explicitly requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules in place that require financial institutions to keep records of (i) the steps undertaken and (ii) any evidence relied upon for the performance of their CRS obligations. Officials had taken the view that these specific obligations would be subsumed within the general record-keeping obligation at section 22(2)(lc) into the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, given the comments received in submissions (and cited above in respect of the previous issue) on proposed section 22(2)(ld), officials are concerned that some financial institutions might not interpret section 22(2)(lc) on this matter in the same way as officials. To ensure that New Zealand does not fail peer review on this point, officials consider that the specific OECD requirements for financial institutions to keep records of (i) the steps undertaken and (ii) any evidence relied upon for the performance of their CRS obligations should also be inserted into the bill as express obligations. This proposal will also address the issue raised by the New Zealand Law Society. 138 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, and addressed by means of inserting into the bill an express record-keeping obligation in respect of (i) the steps undertaken and (ii) any evidence relied upon for the performance of CRS obligations. Clause 13 Issue: Penalties Submission (AM P) The submitter agrees that penalties should be civil rather than criminal. Given that a financial institution is dependent on account holders providing information (particu larly pre-existing customers), the submitter supports the extension of penalties beyond financial institutions. Comment Officials welcome the submission that supports the approach proposed in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 13 Issue: Interaction of penalties Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) It is unclear how the penalties interact. Several penalties can be applied for the same offence. Clarification is required that a financial institution will not be subject to penalties under proposed new section 142H(1) or (3) as well as a penalty under proposed new section 142H(5). Comment Officials agree that the provisions should be amended to clarify that these penalties do not overlap. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 Clause 13 Issue: Maximum limit on penalties Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) There is no cap or limitation on the penalties that can be applied. There should be a cap on the strict liability penalties (that is, the “absolute liability” penalty provisions at sections 142H(1) and (3)) that can be imposed in a given reporting period. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh) The potential liability should not exceed the potential liability under the penalty for lack of reasonable care (that is, the penalty provision at section 142H(5)). (Russell McVeagh) The penalties imposed under section 142H(1) or (3) should be capped at $10,000 per reporting period (half the amount applicable for a first offence under the penalty for lack of reasonable care (that is, the penalty provision at section 142H(5)). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) In the case of a systemic failure, Inland Revenue should consider if the financial institut ion failed to take reasonable care. Comment Officials agree that the penalties that could be imposed under the absolute liability penalties (sections 142(H)(1) and (3)) should be capped in the manner proposed by submitters. Although the submitters disagree on the actual amount of the cap, Officials consider that it should be set at $10,000 per reporting period. That amount represents half the amount applicable for a first offence under the penalty for lack of reasonable care (section 142H(5)). Officials also consider that there should also be a cap for the penalties that could be imposed under the penalty for lack of reasonable care (section 142H(5)). In that case the limit should be set at $100,000 per reporting period. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, and the penalty provisions amended as set out above. Clause 13 Issue: Section 142H penalty defences – “reasonable efforts” Submissions (AM P, BNZ, K PMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, TGT Legal, Westpac) The 1 April 2019 limitation for the “reasonable efforts” defence for financial institutions should be removed, or extended. 140 With the volumes of data each year, the process will not be error free. Penalties also need to reflect the reality that customers will provide incorrect data or fail to provide data notwithstanding their awareness of the legal requirements. (AMP, BNZ, KPMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, TGT Legal, Westpac) The “reasonable efforts” defence is only available until 31 March 2019. It therefore does not apply to pre-existing entity accounts and lower value pre-existing individual accounts (for which the reporting deadline is 30 June 2019). (AMP) There should be a single transitional period applying until 31 March 2020. Failing that, the transitional period for pre-existing entity accounts and lower value pre-existing individual accounts should be extended to 31 March 2020. There is a no fault defence for a customer. A financial institution should also have a defence to the penalties in proposed section 142H if their inability to comply with an obligation is outside their control. (AMP, TGT Legal) The “reasonable efforts” transitional relief should be provided for the penalty for lack of reasonable care in proposed section 142H(5). (BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment The CRS and OECD Commentary are clear that implementing jurisdictions must have effective penalties for deterring non-compliance and errors. The bill proposes a suite of measures for ensuring compliance, including strong sanctions. However, the drafting of the bill reflects acknowledgment by officials that there are strong arguments for relaxing those sanctions for a transitional “introductory” period. The CRS is a complex regime and financial institutions face short implementation timelines. In addition, financial institutions face a challenging requirement to complete due diligence reviews of their pre-existing accounts within the first two-year period. Despite best efforts, there are likely to be errors over this period. Officials also note that during the initial period Inland Revenue will endeavour to ensure that financial institutions receive adequate guidance to help them to comply with their CRS obligations. In acknowledging these challenges, the bill proposes (in section 142H(1) and (3)), that financial institutions will be permitted to mount a “reasonable efforts” defence against the imposition of penalties. The ability to mount this defence will only apply until 31 March 2019. This appears to go further than other countries. For example, Australia’s CRS legislation does not explicitly contemplate such a defence. Officials consider that removing the 31 March 2019 limitation would pose a risk that the OECD, on reviewing New Zealand’s legislative framework, may consider that New Zealand does not have an adequate penalties regime to address non-compliance. Similarly, officials do not support the proposed extension of the expiry date to 31 March 2020. However officials agree that the transitional period could be extended by three months to 30 June 2019. Such an extension would then continue to apply during the three-month grace period 141 from 1 April 2019 until 30 June 2019, during which some financial institutions may wish to continue their due diligence of pre-existing entity accounts and lower value pre-existing individual accounts. Officials also broadly agree that a financial institution should not be penalised under section 142H(1) for matters that are outside its control. An additional provision should therefore be included in the bill, to apply on a permanent basis, permitting a financial institution to mount such a defence to the application of that provision in such circumstances. This defence would not apply to section 142H(3). This is because New Zealand’s framework for ensuring that the requisite self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts will be a key area that the OECD will review. Such a defence could be criticised by the OECD as unduly weakening the requirement to always obtain self-certifications for new accounts. A financial institution will also always have at least a degree of control when opening an account (that is, they could have systems in place such that the account will not be opened until after the requisite self-certifications have been obtained). Therefore, having a defence applying to the failure to obtain a self-certification for circumstances outside their control would not be appropriate. Regarding the proposal to extend the reasonable efforts defence to the penalty for lack of reasonable care, Officials note that a financial institution that has failed to take reasonable care to meet their CRS obligations would, by definition, not be able to avail themselves of a “reasonable efforts” defence. Therefore, a “reasonable efforts” defence to this penalty would be redundant. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, and that the bill be amended to extend the transitional period from 31 March 2019 to 30 June 2019, and to provide financial institutions with the permanent ability to mount a defence to the imposition of a penalty under section 142H(1) that failure to comply with a CRS obligation was due to circumstances outside their control. Clause 13 Issue: Section 142H penalty defences – “reasonable time” Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The provisions in section 142H(2) and (4) that permit a financial institution to mount a “reasonable efforts” defence against the imposition of absolute liability penalties only apply if the financial institution rectifies the error within a reasonable time of it being detected. The use of the words “reasonable time” is unclear and does not provide institutions and account holders with certainty. The phrase “reasonable time” should be replaced with a specific time period, for example “x days” to provide greater certainty. Comment 142 A set time-period would not be appropriate because the issue of what constitutes a “reasonable time” w ill be h igh ly fact-specific. Some failures may require more time than others to rectify, depending on the facts. Inland Revenue intends to provide guidance about how this requirement is to apply in practice, which will help provide greater certainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 13 Issue: Section 142H penalty defences – AML processes Submission (KPMG ) A financial institut ion that follows its tested anti-money laundering (AML) processes should be able to claim a “reasonable efforts” defence set out in proposed section 142H. For any financial institution that is not subject to AML, implementing AML-aligned processes should be an acceptable defence. Comment The CRS and OECD Commentary set out a number of circumstances when financial institutions will be able to rely on AML processes and information to help carry out CRS due diligence. However, it is clear under the standard that in other instances, further due diligence work will be required. Therefore, carrying out AML processes will not necessarily be sufficient. Instead, it will sometimes be necessary for a financial institution to carry out further due diligence for CRS purposes. Therefore, it is not appropriate to have a provision that would in effect create a CRS safe-harbour for a financial institution that simply follows AML processes (or procedures in line with AML processes). There is a material risk that such a provision would be criticised by the OECD on review. Officials note that the circumstances when a financial institution will be able to rely on AML processes for CRS purposes will be addressed by Inland Revenue in future guidance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 143 Clause 13 Issue: Section 142I penalty defences – “no fault” Submission (KPMG ) If a failure to provide information is within the control of the person, the person needs to show that the failure is not due to their fault. It is difficult to see in what circumstances this could apply. Comment A person may fail to provide information for a number of reasons. For example, a person could simply be away on holiday when a financial institution requests the information and not be contactable. In these circumstances, any failure to provide information may potentially be subject to the no-fault defence even though the information is within the control of the person. This will be a question of fact. Officials consider that the application of the penalties provisions (and the relevant defences) can be best clarified by Inland Revenue in guidance. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 13 Issue: Section 143A(1(a) and 143A(2) – information Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed revision to section 143A(2) and new section 143A(1)(ac) applies only in respect of a failure to provide a self-certification. Elsewhere in the bill, a person’s obligations are in respect of “information or a self-cert ificat ion”. It is not clear whether this narrower liability in respect of knowledge offences is intended. Comment The narrower liability was not intended. The provision should be amended to refer to “information” and to a “self-certification”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and sections 143A(2) and 143A(1)(ac) be amended to refer to “information” as well as to a “self-certification”. 144 Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185P – persons other than financial institutions Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, AMP) Proposed section 185P imposes obligations on the account holder and other information providers to provide information. Achieving clear obligations and clear consequences is better achieved by separating account holders from others. This would require redrafting section 185P. (K PMG ) Proposed section 185P applies to : • persons or entities that are requested by a financial institution to provide information (“institution contacts”); and • persons or entities that are requested by an institution contact or other person or entity to provide information (“secondary contacts”). The reference to “or other person or entity” unnecessarily widens a secondary contact’s obligation to provide information. It introduces the possibility of a person being compelled to provide information other than at the request of an institution contact or at the request of a financial institution. (New Zealand Law Society) Under proposed section 185P(4), potentially if person A who is associated with an entity account holder is provided with information from person B, who is also associated with the same entity, person A appears to have an on-going obligation under this provision to be advised by person B of any of B’s change in circumstances, even when A is no longer associated with the entity account holder. (AM P) Comment Officials consider that the current draft wording correctly reflects and addresses the complexity involved in the different ways that an information provider may be contacted, and the different capacities in which they may be required to obtain and provide information. An account holder will generally be the institution contact and will provide information about themselves. However, the account holder will also, in certain circumstances, be required to obtain information from a person that is a secondary contact (such as a controlling person). Secondary contacts will, in turn, then have their own obligations to obtain and provide information. With reference to the “or other person or contact” issue, officials consider that the reference is needed because there may be chains of persons or entities in an account holding structure. For example, a secondary contact may itself be a controlling person that is an entity. In these circumstances, CRS requires that the secondary contact is “looked through”. 7 Natural persons at the end of the chain (that are also secondary contacts) may receive a request from a secondary 7 For examp le, refer to the comments at page 199 of the OECD Commentary. 145 contact, rather than from an institution contact. The reference to “or other person or entity” is therefore important. Officials disagree with the submission on section 185P(4). Proposed section 185P is clear that the provision only applies to a person or entity associated with an account (as stipulated in section 185P(1)). Therefore, any obligations under the section would cease to apply when the person or entity no longer had that association. Officials note that Inland Revenue intends to elaborate on this point in guidance. However, the submission does highlight a potential problem in that it would not then be clear under the legislation who a person (person B, in the case of the submitter’s example cited above) should then advise changes to. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but that it be clarified who a person should advise changes to. Clause 13 Issue: Monitoring compliance Submission (PwC) The CRS requires implementing jurisdictions to have rules and procedures in place to ensure compliance and to address non-compliance. While the bill proposes a comprehensive suite of enforcement rules and penalties, it does not address how New Zealand intends to implement its programmes for reviewing a financial institution’s CRS compliance. We recommend that New Zealand’s AEOI/CRS compliance review framework reflects a risk- based approach that is proportionate to the size and complexity of the financial institution concerned and focuses primarily on the financial institution’s processes and controls. Under this approach, the expectation is that only a representative sample of the financial institution’s customer and transaction records would require testing – this should cut down on the length of the review and any disruption to the financial institution’s business. We consider that an appropriately qualified independent firm is best placed to review an institution’s CRS processes and controls. The findings from the firm’s independent review would then be provided to Inland Revenue who could make an assessment about whether any further investigations are required. This should result in significant costs savings for the Government/Inland Revenue given that part of AEOI compliance review is effectively outsourced to the private sector at no cost. This could also achieve efficiencies in leveraging off other review procedures such as those that apply for AML procedures. Comment Officials agree that the CRS requires that New Zealand has procedures in place to monitor compliance and to address non-compliance. This will be considered as part of the implementation of CRS. 146 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Anti-avoidance rule Submission (BNZ) The submitter agrees that anti-avoidance rules should be in place and agrees that the anti- avoidance rules should be consistent across the CRS and FATCA. Comment No additional comment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 147 TRUSTS Clause 24(1) Issue: Difficulties in applying CRS to trusts Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Determining the controlling persons of a trust will place an unreasonable compliance burden on financial institutions, given that annually a financial institution will have to obtain from every trust information on discretionary beneficiaries who received distributions during that year. A discretionary beneficiary who moves overseas (temporarily or permanently) and becomes a tax resident of another jurisdiction could result in a change of status for the foreign trust under AEOI. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The CRS due diligence work effort for trusts is significant. One member bank has indicated that it has over 84,000 account holders with the word “trust” in their t it le. Th is w ill pose issues in terms of workability of the due diligence and reporting process and timelines. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment Officials acknowledge that the CRS due diligence procedures are complex, particularly in so far as they apply to trusts. This includes procedures dealing with changes in circumstances. Those complexities are inherent in the CRS itself. The bill contains a number of proposals (ability to use options, transitional period for enforcement, and the ability to adopt the wider approach), which are intended to address some of these challenges. In addition, the bill proposes (in section 185P(4)) imposing an obligation on account holders and other persons to notify their financial institution of a material change of circumstance that will affect their status for CRS purposes. Beyond that, however, there is no further scope for New Zealand to reduce the complexity without risking failure in peer review. Issues with the CRS must be addressed globally, and global solutions adopted. In this regard, officials note that the OECD has recently released a number of “Questions and Answers” on its website, which provide some useful guidance on how trust due diligence can be carried out more efficiently. Officials also note that Inland Revenue intends to provide detailed guidance on the application of CRS to trusts. Raising awareness of the importance of complying with the obligation on persons or entities under section 185P will be addressed as part of Inland Revenue’s planned public education campaign. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 148 Clause 24(1) Issue: Treating all trusts as financial institutions Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, K PMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The Government could consider finding an alternative solution for obtaining AEOI information from trusts. For example, Inland Revenue could explore the option of building on the information it already receives and collecting any additional information required as part of the trust’s annual tax return. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Trusts should be treated as financial institutions and the information required by CRS reported with the trust’s income tax return. This is because the persons with the knowledge about the trusts are the trustees. Practically, financial institutions that maintain trust accounts will have difficulties with complying with their obligations to conduct due diligence on such accounts. Therefore, the CRS reporting obligations should sit with the trustees. (KPMG) The Government (and indeed on a global basis, all CRS participating governments) must consider finding an alternative solution for obtaining AEOI information from trusts. Inland Revenue must explore the option of building on the information it receives and collecting any additional information required as part of the trust’s annual tax return process. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Comment The obligations to be imposed on trusts are an inherent part of the CRS. New Zealand has also already signed legal instruments that set out specific obligations to collect and exchange information as per the CRS. Officials consider that it is therefore not appropriate for New Zealand to unilaterally transfer to trusts any CRS due diligence and reporting requirements that are not subject to CRS obligations under the standard. As noted above, any solution to the issue of trusts needs to be made on a multilateral basis. The OECD has also started to release “Questions and Answers” on its website on how trust due diligence can be carried out more efficiently. Also as noted above, the bill addresses some of the concerns through the use of options, a transitional period for enforcement, wider approach and imposing an obligation on account holders and other persons to notify their financial institution of a material change of circumstance that will affect their residence status. Inland Revenue guidance and raising awareness through a public education campaign w ill also help. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 149 Clause 24(1) Issue: Discretionary beneficiaries Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, AMP) Proposed section 185N(10) should be amended to provide that a discretionary beneficiary of a trust is not treated as a controlling person. It would be unfair to require reporting financial institutions to have reasonable safeguards and procedures for identifying when a distribution is made to a beneficiary. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Distributions are often only determined after the end of a reporting period. This makes the application of a test based on when distributions are made problematic. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) An additional provision should be inserted that explicitly states that where a financial institution has reasonable safeguards and procedures in place in compliance with section 185N(10), the institution has no liability in relation to any failure of the institution to identify when a beneficiary has received a distribution. (AM P) Comment It is neither appropriate nor permissible under the CRS to provide that a discretionary beneficiary is not a controlling person. The need for a financial institution to identify distributions to discretionary beneficiaries of certain passive entity account holders will only arise if the institution elects to take advantage of the option offered in the CRS to treat only discretionary beneficiaries as controlling persons of such an account when a distribution has been made. Otherwise, discretionary beneficiaries are prima facie required to be treated as controlling persons. 8 The CRS offers this option on the basis that it may help to reduce compliance costs for some financial institutions. Financial institutions are not compelled to take the option. Moreover, a decision to take advantage of the option should only be made if the financial institution is confident it has sufficient safeguards and procedures to identify when a distribution has been made (as stipulated in proposed section 185N(10). Officials do not think it would be appropriate to include a provision clarifying that a financial institution that has reasonable safeguards and procedures in place for identifying distributions can never be subject to penalty for failing to identify a distribution. Whether a financial institution will be subject to a penalty for failing to comply with CRS due diligence will be h igh ly fact-specific. For example, a financial institution may have procedures in place to try to identify whether and when a distribution is made to a discretionary beneficiary. However, the institution may become aware that the account holder is not complying with these procedures and may choose to proceed without addressing the issue. This could lead to the potential application of penalties even though safeguards and procedures are in place. 8 Page 199 of the OECD Commentary. 150 Inland Revenue intends to provide guidance on what would constitute reasonable safeguards and procedures. With regard to the point that distributions may be determined after the end of a reporting period, officials note that for CRS purposes these distributions would not be relevant to that reporting period. The relevant distributions for a reporting period are those that are actually received (paid or payable) in that period, not in subsequent periods. This is set out in the CRS and OECD Commentary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 151 GUIDANCE ON CRS REQUIREMENTS Clauses 3 to 26 Submissions (AMP, BNZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Chapman Tripp, Cone Marshall, Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY, KPMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh, Westpac,) In addition to a public messaging campaign, Inland Revenue should (with urgency) provide CRS guidance in respect of matters such as: • the roles and responsibilities of taxpayers and financial institutions under CRS • the concept of “tax residence” • record-keeping obligations • non-reporting financial entities and excluded accounts • the application of the penalties provisions and defences • undocumented account reporting • reasonable safeguards and procedures for identifying when a distribution is made to “the beneficiary” of a trust • the intended meaning of “distribution” in the AEOI context • published lists, and determinations/regulations • the ability to exercise choices. Comment Officials note that, in addition to a public messaging campaign to promote awareness of obligations, Inland Revenue intends to prepare detailed CRS guidance notes to help with compliance. This will include the matters identified by submitters, other points noted by officials in this report, and any other relevant matter that is subsequently identified. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 152 MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS Clause 24(1) Issue: Section ordering Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The ordering of sections in the bill sets out the requirements for financial inst itutions (in proposed section 185N) before provisions relating to the application of the CRS (proposed section 185O). The order of these sections should be reversed, for a more logical order. Comment The ordering in the bill was intentional, and follows New Zealand’s current legislative drafting style. That style involves first setting out the obligations (in this case, section 185N) and then following with provisions dealing with interpretation (in this case, section 185O). Officials do not consider that reversing the order would be advantageous, and would conflict with New Zealand’s legislative drafting style. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 8(2) and 24(1) Issue: References to legal instruments Submission (Matter raised by officials) The references to “MCMAA convention” and “MCA agreement” in clause 8(2) and to “Multilateral convention” in clause 24(1) (in the heading “Multilateral convention and CRS standard” that appears immediately before section 185) could be misleading and give rise to confusion. Comment The references to “Multilateral Convention”, “MCMAA convention” and “MCA agreement” refer to the principal legal instruments under which it is intended that exchanges of information for AEOI purposes will be made. However, the AEOI standard does not prevent jurisdictions agreeing to make AEOI exchanges under other forms of legal instrument. 153 Although New Zealand has not entered into any such agreement, officials cannot rule out the possibility that this will never be agreed to. Accordingly, the references to the above specific legal instruments could be misleading and create confusion. As a minor drafting matter, officials therefore submit that the potentially misleading references be redrafted in more general terms. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185N – wider than intended Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, AMP) The current drafting of section 185N goes further than is strictly necessary to incorporate the CRS standard into domestic law by reference (as was the policy intent). This creates an opportunity for inadvertent gaps and interpretative errors. It is recommended that section 185N be pared back and refer more heavily to the CRS applied standard (similar to the approach taken to FATCA). Alternatively, a number of specific drafting suggestions are made. (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 185N(3)(c) is arguably a broader obligation that the corresponding obligation in the CRS. (AM P) Comment Section 185N is intended to incorporate the CRS requirements for financial institutions. The submitters’ primary concern is that section 185N(3)(c) could be read as requiring financial institutions to carry out due diligence and collect information in respect of all account holders and controlling persons, and not solely to non-resident account holders and relevant controlling persons (as required under the CRS wider approach to due diligence). However, the reference in section 185N(3)(c) to “perform the due diligence procedures required by the CRS applied standard” limits the application of the provision. Therefore, in context, section 185N(3)(c) is not broader than the CRS. The focus in section 185N(3)(c) on collecting information on account openings from all foreign tax residents that have been identified in accordance with the due diligence procedures is also based on an approach that the OECD has suggested 9 in order to ensure that the wider approach to due diligence is implemented efficiently by financial institutions. Section 185(N)(3)(c) allows financial institutions to carry out the wider approach to due diligence in an efficient way, 9 Refer to paragraph 4, on page 285, of Annex 5 of the CRS publication. 154 as suggested by the OECD, by collecting information about relevant non-residents “up front” when an account is opened. This will help to minimise compliance costs. However, in reviewing the drafting of section 185N(3)(c), officials consider that the following changes should be referred to the drafter for consideration: • In section 185(3)(c), changing the reference to “due diligence procedures for each new financial account” to “due diligence procedures applicable to new financial accounts”. • In section 185N(3)(b), adding the words “self-certification”, in the place suggested by the submitter. • In section 185N(8), adding the words “to the Commissioner”, “financial institution’s” and “application of the” in the places suggested by the submitter. • In section 185N(11), adding the words “under subsection (3)(d)” and replacing the words “with a” with “at” in the place suggested by the submitter. • In section 185N(12), adding the words “by a financial institution under subsection (3)(d)” and “provided to the Commissioner”, in the places suggested by the submitter. However, officials do not consider that the other specific drafting amendments suggested in the submission are necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined in part, and that the matters noted above be referred to the drafter for consideration. Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185N(3)(c)(ii) – “reportable period” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference in proposed new section185N(3)(c)(ii) to “has domestic law requiring that the TIN be collected” is intended to reflect the exception at CRS Section I.D for a country that does not require the collection of TINs. (Currently, the OECD has only identified Australia as having this rule.) As drafted, the legislation is ambiguous. That is, it could be argued that a TIN should only be collected if the country of residence has an express legislative requirement for the collection of TINs. Comment Officials consider that section185N(3)(c)(ii) should be redrafted to remove the ambiguity and better reflect the intention of CRS Section I.D. 155 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185N(5) – “reportable period” Submission (AM P) The reference in proposed new section185N(5) to “reportable period” should read “reporting period”. Comment Officials agree that section185N(5) should refer to “reporting period”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185N(5) – ambiguity regarding reporting dates Submission (AM P) The bill’s Summary of Proposed Amendments Commentary has the following ambiguous statement: “Importantly, any high value accounts identified as reportable during the grace period must be reported with respect to the reporting period of 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018.” Should this read: “Importantly, any high value accounts identified during the grace period as reportable for the first reporting period must be reported with respect to the reporting period of 1 July 2017 to 31 March 2018.” If not, it suggests that an account that becomes reportable on 31 May 2018 and is identified as reportable on 31 May 2018 must be reported for the reporting period ending on 31 March 2018. Clarification is needed. There is another corresponding paragraph for other accounts that requires sim ilar clarificat ion. 156 Comment Officials agree that the wording in the bill’s Summary of Proposed Amendments Commentary may be ambiguous. The wording of section 185N(5) in the bill appears to reflect similar ambiguity. Officials will explore alternative legislative wording to resolve the ambiguity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185N(7) – ambiguity Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “Reportable Person” at CRS Section VIII.D(2), excludes certain entities (such as a corporation, the stock of wh ich is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets). Officials note that, as drafted, the option provided to financial institutions at proposed new section 185N(7) to adopt the wider approach to reporting, could be read as overriding the definition. That is, the legislation is ambiguous as to whether a financial institution that elects to adopt the wider approach can still take advantage of the above exclusions. Comment Officials consider that section185N(7) should be redrafted to remove the ambiguity and clarify that the exclusions continue to apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185N(12) – reporting template Submission (Chapman Tripp) Proposed new section 185N(12) requires financial institutions to provide their annual report to Inland Revenue in the prescribed electronic format. It would be helpful if Inland Revenue could provide a template for financial institutions to complete, which can be easily converted to the prescribed electronic format. 157 This is a particular issue for smaller financial institutions that do not have the resources or systems in place to generate electronic files in the prescribed format. Comment To meet the requirements of the broad range of financial institutions, Inland Revenue’s project team is exploring a number of reporting format; including an online form, a template and an XML file. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185O(4) – reference to “used in the Inland Revenue Acts” Submission (KPMG ) Under proposed section 185O(4), a term defined in the CRS or relevant tax treaty, and used in the Inland Revenue Acts, has the meaning under the CRS and Multilateral Convention. This broad importation of CRS and treaty definitions has the potential to override existing rules and tax concepts in unintended and unexpected ways, and should be restricted to provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts which apply the CRS. For example, the Income Tax Act 2007 already has a definition of “financial institution” which applies for specific purposes. The drafting in section 185O(4) would appear to override that definit ion. Comment Officials do not agree with the analysis. The application of section 185O(4) is limited by its opening words “In the application of the CRS standard ...”. That means that it cannot override any provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts that do not relate to the CRS. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 158 Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185O(5) Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) The requirement in proposed new section 185O(5) that the election is not contrary to the Tax Administration Act 1994 is unnecessary and complicating. Section 185O itself imports the election into the Tax Administration Act. By definition, the election should therefore not be contrary to the Tax Administration Act. (K PMG) A minor amendment to section 185O(5) is recommended, to insert the words “under the CRS applied standard”, as follows: “A person or entity may make an election that is expressed as being available to a person or entity under the CRS applied standard, if the election is not contrary to this Act and not otherwise contrary to the law of New Zealand.” (New Zealand Law Society) Comment In relation to the first point, the reference to “not contrary to this Act” is necessary because there are certain options contemplated in the CRS that are explicitly excluded in the Tax Administration Act 1994. For example, this includes the exclusions set out in proposed section 185N(11) and the exclusions set out in schedule 2, items 1 and 4. On the second point, officials agree that greater clarity should be provided with respect to the reference to an election that is “expressed”. The additional words suggested by the submitter (“under the CRS applied standard”) are potentially limiting. For example, they could prevent financial institutions from taking advantage of guidance or clarifications that become availab le on the OECD website. Alternative wording such as “consistent with the CRS applied standard” would be more appropriate. Recommendation That the submission to delete the reference to “not contrary to the Act” be declined. That the submission to provide clarity in respect of the reference to “expressed” be accepted, with officials to explore appropriate wording. 159 Clause 24(1) Issue: Section 185P(1) – reference to “associated with” Submission (KPMG ) Proposed section 185P(1) requires a person associated with a financial account to provide information when requested by a financial institution. However, “associated with” is a broad term, and in the income tax and GST contexts it has a defined meaning (through the “associated person” definition). This could result in a lack of clarity in the proposed legislation. Comment Officials agree that the current wording could lead to a lack of clarity, and that the drafting should be amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 24(1) Iss ue: Section 185Q Submission (KPMG ) Proposed section 185Q is a rule for those entities that are not “persons”. However, the rule may not be required or, if required, may not be effective. The CRS includes as “entities” partnerships and trusts which are not legally persons. Generally these are not taxpayers (it is the partners or trustees and beneficiaries who pay the tax). However, “person” is defined by the Acts Interpretation Act 1999 as including an unincorporated body of persons. This would normally include partnerships and trustees of trusts. For example, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 does not separately define a partnership as a person. It is assumed that the partnership is a person because it is an unincorporated body of persons. This may mean that section 185Q would not apply as the entities would appear to be persons. 160 Comment The proposed section 185Q contains express references to trusts, partnerships, joint ventures and legal arrangements. Therefore, it is clear on the face of the provision that these arrangements would come within the ambit of the section. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 24(1) and schedule 2 Issue: Schedule 2 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The submitter broadly supports the inclusion of a new schedule 2 to modify the CRS standard for New Zealand. However, the following minor improvements are suggested. • With respect to item 10 of the schedule, the reference to “31 December” on line 4 of Section V, subparagraph D(2) should be replaced with “31 March”, to align with the intended policy. • With respect to items 13 and 22 of the schedule, a cross-reference to the relevant sections that provide for the Commissioner’s power to make the determinations referred to should be included. • With respect to item 20 of the schedule, the second reference to “31 December” on line 3 of Section VIII, subparagraph C(15), should be replaced with “31 March”, to align with the intended policy. Comment Officials agree. The submission correctly identifies deficiencies between the proposals in the bill and the intended policy. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 Clause 24(1) and Schedule 2 Issue: Contradictory exclusions Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Section I paragraphs C, D and E of the CRS should be modified. All three paragraphs include exclusions that are contradictory. Section 1 paragraph A imposes an obligation on a financial institution to collect certain information. The exclusions in paragraphs C, D and E apply only where the information is not required to be collected under domestic law. The CRS is incorporated into domestic law. Th is seems to imply the exclusions in paragraphs C, D and E can never apply. This needs to be clarified. Comment Officials disagree with the analysis. The wording in paragraphs C, D, and E ensures that the exclusions will continue to apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 24(1) Issue: Default TINs Submission (AM P) A default tax identification number (TIN) should be made available for financial institutions to use when they need to file a report and have been unable to obtain the account holder’s TIN, particularly pre-existing account holders. Financial institutions need to be able to successfully report accounts where they have been unable to obtain a TIN for the account holders. Financial institutions do not want reports to fail because not all files contain a TIN and we understand that some institutions have experienced this problem during FATCA reporting. Comment The CRS does not require a TIN to be reported in all circumstances. For example, it is not required when a TIN is not issued by the jurisdiction in which a reportable person is resident, or if the domestic law of that jurisdiction does not require the collection of the TIN. Therefore, as the reporting of a TIN element is not mandatory, Inland Revenue will ensure that system validations do not reject a report for failure to include a TIN. 162 A default TIN is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 163 Foreign trusts 164 165 SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED RULES Clause 10 Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, PwC, Russell McVeagh, Office of the Privacy Commissioner) The proposed changes, which strengthen the disclosure rules, should discourage offshore parties from using New Zealand foreign trusts for inappropriate purposes. We are pleased that the Government is not generally changing the underlying trust rules, which are principled. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) We fully support the amendments to section 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 related to foreign trust registration and disclosure as outlined in clause 10 of the bill, and as recommended by the recent Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules. The proposed changes promote increased transparency, which will discourage the use of New Zealand trusts for illicit purposes by offshore parties. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) We support enhancements to the disclosure rules for foreign trusts with a New Zealand-resident trustee. The proposals should, alongside other initiatives (such as FATCA, AEOI and other measures to increase transparency in the tax context as well as anti-money laundering regulations more generally) further prevent the foreign trusts regime from being used for illegitimate purposes. (Russell McVeagh) We support the proposed introduction of additional disclosure requirements for foreign trusts. We strongly support the policy rationale behind these changes and commend the Government on taking steps to address the public concern about the New Zealand foreign trust regime. (PwC) I was consulted during the I nquiry and I am comfortable that these proposals are appropriately designed to meet the policy objectives while not unduly impacting on the privacy of the individuals concerned. The personal information implicated by the amendments is relatively restricted and non-intrusive, but is sufficient to enable regulators to make further enquiries if required. The changes proposed are also equitable in that they more closely align the rules for foreign trusts with the existing rules for domestic trusts. (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 166 RULES ARE UNNECESSARY Submission (Kensington Swan) Section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows for the Commissioner to request information. This allows the Commissioner access to a broader range of information relating to foreign trusts than will be disclosed under the proposed amendments. Therefore, rather than requiring information to be provided as part of increased disclosure, the Commissioner may just utilise section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. (Oral submission) Comment This submission is suggesting there should be no change to the existing law. Officials disagree with this submission. The I nquiry concluded that changes that require the New Zealand trustees to provide information to Inland Revenue upon the establishment of the trust and also to provide annual returns (which Inland Revenue can pass on to the relevant authorities, including overseas authorities, the Police, and the Department of Internal Affairs), are necessary. Officials agree w ith the I nquiry’s conclusion that requiring foreign trusts to disclose more information upon registration will ensure that Inland Revenue can proactively share information and therefore that the relevant tax authorities in other jurisdictions are aware of the existence of the trust. Th is is difficult to ach ieve, and administrat ively costly, under the existing legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The “qualifying resident foreign trustee ” concept should be retained Submission (David McLay) The “qualifying resident foreign trustee” approach provided greater tax integrity in many respects than the current proposals. In the context of international trusts, it is not uncommon for the trust to “move jurisdiction” by the appointment of a new trustee in another jurisdiction. The essence of the qualifying resident trustee rule is that a New Zealand-resident individual has a personal responsibility to retain trust records within New Zealand. Under the Tax Administration Act 1994 that obligation exists for seven years. Retention of information within New Zealand will necessarily be limited to the prescribed information, but overseas jurisdictions may expect New Zealand to have an ability to obtain other information. It is highly probable that New Zealand authorities will not be able to obtain information requested by overseas tax authorities. 167 The proposed repeal of this concept (and associated rules) would detract rather than enhance New Zealand’s reputation as a leading tax jurisdiction. Comment The submission appears to have conflated the definitions of “resident foreign trustees” and “qualifying resident foreign trustees” in the Tax Administration Act. There is no existing “requirement” to have a qualifying resident foreign trustee. A foreign trust must have a resident foreign trustee. The existing disclosure and record-keeping requirement are imposed on the resident foreign trustee who may or may not also meet the definition of a “qualifying resident foreign trustee”. A “resident foreign trustee” is defined as the New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust. All resident foreign trustees are required to meet disclosure and record-keeping requirements. The bill retains this concept. A “qualifying resident foreign trustee” is defined as a resident foreign trustee who is the member of a professional body. The sole effect under tax legislation for a foreign trust with a qualifying resident foreign trustee is that the foreign trust is subject to lesser sanctions in the case of non- compliance with the disclosure rules (the “safe harbour”). The I nquiry recommended that this safe harbour be reviewed. After considering advice from officials, the Government decided to repeal this exemption (and as a result, the concept of a qualifying resident foreign trustee), and this is reflected in the bill. Officials understand that in 2006 it was considered that this safe harbour would encourage foreign trusts to use a professional New Zealand accountant or lawyer as a trustee, and that having a trustee who is a professional New Zealand accountant or lawyer would be an appropriate check to prevent non-compliance. This bill proposes removing the safe harbour (and therefore the associated concept of a qualifying resident foreign trustee) because the Government considers it does not provide a clear and appropriate signal about the importance of complying with the disclosure rules. In addition, concerns about the consequences on retaining trust records in New Zealand (and in relation to the point about trusts relocating) are mitigated by the proposed wider init ial and regular disclosures that are required to be made to Inland Revenue. For example, requiring the trust deed would automatically mean that Inland Revenue will have this information on file in case the overseas jurisdiction requests it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 168 INTERACTION WITH AEOI AND AML PROPOSALS Issue: Foreign trusts will generally be subject to AEOI Submission (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) The conclusion reached by the Government Inquiry that New Zealand needed specific trust disclosure seems to have been on the basis that a significant number of foreign trusts might fall outside AEOI/CRS disclosure requirements. This seems at best an exaggeration. Comment This issue relates to conclusions of the I nquiry about whether AEOI is likely to alleviate disclosure concerns in respect of New Zealand foreign trusts. The conclusions and recommendations of the Inquiry have informed the foreign trust disclosure proposals in this bill. The Inquiry considered whether AEOI is likely to alleviate any disclosure concerns in respect of New Zealand foreign trusts. The Inquiry concluded that for a significant number of foreign trusts the proposed AEOI rules will not result in any material increase in the amount of information required to be disclosed to Inland Revenue. AEOI is designed to counter tax evasion through requiring – • financial institutions, in participating jurisdictions, to carry out due diligence on their account holders and (in certain circumstances) “controlling persons” 10 to identify any non- residents; • financial institutions to report information on financial activity, such as gross amounts paid or credited and account balances (including distributions to beneficiaries in the case of trusts) as well as identification information about each reportable person, annually, to the local tax authority (for New Zealand, Inland Revenue); • the local tax authority to provide that information automatically to offshore tax authorities in participating countries throughout the world. The information will be provided to the countries in which persons identified by the “reporting financial institution” are tax resident. There are two main ways in which AEOI may apply to a foreign trust – • through the foreign trust itself constituting a “reporting financial institution” for AEOI purposes; and • through the foreign trust holding an account with a New Zealand bank or other “financial institution”. The I nquiry concluded that the activities of foreign trusts in New Zealand and the way they are operated means that in a significant number of cases they are unlikely to constitute financial institutions under the guidance set out in the CRS and therefore that they will not be reporting financial institutions. 10 For trusts this will generally inc lude settlors, trustees, beneficiaries and other controlling persons. 169 Foreign trusts that maintain accounts with a bank or other financial institution in New Zealand are likely to be classified under the CRS as “passive non-financial entit ies” for AEOI purposes. Where this is the case, the financial institution (for example, the bank) will be required to carry out due diligence and to report to Inland Revenue information on the trust, and on its controlling persons. Importantly, however, financial information such as income and account balances will be limited to the account held with the financial institution. 11 It will not extend to the foreign trust’s overall financial position or to distributions to beneficiaries. In summary, based on the information presently available, the Inquiry concluded that for a significant number of foreign trusts, AEOI will not result in any material increase in the amount of information required to be disclosed to Inland Revenue, and the Inquiry therefore did not regard AEOI as a solution to the tax disclosure issues identified with foreign trusts. Officials agree w ith the Inquiry’s assessment of the applicability of AEOI to foreign trusts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Trusts should be subject to the AEOI rules rather than a separate regime Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) A separate regime is not required for foreign trusts. Trusts will be reportable investors, under CRS, if the trust is controlled by a non-resident. A controlling person includes a beneficiary. For discretionary beneficiaries, they become controlling persons at the choice of the New Zealand financial institution when a distribution is received. Trusts should be treated as financial institutions and the information required by CRS should be reported with the trust’s income tax return. This means the CRS reporting obligations should sit with the trustees. The information can be reported as part of the tax return process. This solution could equally apply to trustees of New Zealand foreign trusts. (K PMG) Trusts that are subject to AEOI/CRS under this bill should be considered to meet foreign trust information disclosure requirements unless additional information is justified, in which case that information should be specifically required as an addition to AEOI/CRS rules. When a trust is not subject to AEOI/CRS rules, disclosure requirements should be as consistent as possible with AEOI/CRS rules. This principle is not, it seems, reflected in the bill. (New Zealand Trust ee Companies Association Limited) If a different standard for trusts was adopted than for AEOI, this could cause unnecessary administrative and compliance costs and risks confusing overseas agencies by providing them with information in an unfamiliar form. There even seems to be a risk that by not adopting the internationally agreed standard of key information New Zealand might create international suspicion that we are deliberately not following international best practice, undermining our international reputation. 11 Due diligence will not be required on accounts already in existence at 30 June 2017 if they are below, and at all times remain below, a thresho ld of US$250,000. 170 Comment Officials disagree that the AEOI rules should be extended to apply to foreign trusts. There are several reasons why a disclosure regime specific to foreign trusts is more appropriate than extending the AEOI rules to foreign trusts. Officials note that the Inquiry explicitly considered and rejected extending the AEOI rules to foreign trusts. This was on the basis that it would be inconsistent with the underlying design of the AEOI regime (which is that this is a global set of rules that should follow the common standard prescribed under the CRS). AEOI is an automated programme reflecting a prescribed standard AEOI refers to an exchange of information on an automated basis agreed upon in advance by the participating countries. AEOI will apply to information that is collected under the OECD’s global AEOI/CRS rules. Under the AEOI programme, information will be collected by reporting financial entities, reported to the tax authority, and exchanged by automated means with other countries. The rules on which entities must report, and what information must be reported and exchanged, follow an internationally agreed-upon set of rules. If New Zealand were to try to provide information regarding foreign trusts that are not subject to AEOI (and therefore modify the information it exchanges under the AEOI programme), this could cause confusion, given the highly prescribed and automated nature of the AEOI programme. A separate set of disclosure rules for foreign trusts will maintain New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information Information held by Inland Revenue that is not collected under the OECD’s AEOI/CRS rules (such as the proposed foreign trust disclosure rules) is generally exchanged either upon request by a treaty partner or under the spontaneous exchange of information mechanism. Most of New Zealand’s treaties allow for spontaneous exchange. For information collected in relation to foreign trusts, officials anticipate that Inland Revenue will provide certain information about the trust under the spontaneous exchange mechanism to the settlor’s country of residence as a matter of course. The information that will be provided to the overseas tax authority as a matter of course will be information about any settlor resident in that jurisdiction (name, taxpayer identification number, contact details) and the New Zealand trustee’s contact details. This will alert the overseas tax authority to the fact that their resident has a New Zealand trust, and give them the opportunity to seek further information about the trust from Inland Revenue (which, under the proposed changes in the bill, would generally hold). It should be noted that more disclosure would be required under the proposed foreign trust disclosure rules than under the AEOI/CRS rules. For example, the foreign trust disclosure rules as introduced would require the New Zealand-resident trustee to provide the trust deed. This was a deliberate policy decision. Officials consider that requiring more disclosure than under the AEOI/CRS rules will help to ensure that New Zealand’s reputation as a leader in best practice of international exchange of information is maintained. Accordingly, officials disagree that having a separate regime for foreign trusts that requires additional reporting would create international suspicion that New Zealand is deliberately not following international best practice. 171 It should be noted that New Zealand is already proactive in spontaneously exchanging information to other tax authorities. Accordingly, we see no risk of confusion for overseas tax authorities by separately collecting information that will be spontaneously exchanged. Timing of introduction of AEOI and foreign trust rules differ Apart from deliberate policy decisions to require certain additional information officials generally agree with the idea that the foreign trust disclosure rules should align with the AEOI where possible. However, there is a timing difference between the implementation of AEOI and the new foreign trust disclosure rules. It is important that the new foreign trust disclosure change comes in as soon as possible in order to maintain New Zealand's reputation. The I nquiry recommended that the changes be implemented to require all existing trusts to register (and accordingly provide the initial registration disclosure) by 30 June 2017. In contrast, AEOI has a later timeline, with 30 June 2018 being the first reporting deadline. Accordingly, full alignment will not be possible at this point in time. Officials have d iscussed this with the New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited, but did not agree on this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Duplication of information with Anti-Money Laundering and AEOI Submission (Kensington Swan, Cone Marshall, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) The foreign trust disclosure requirements effectively create a situation where trustees of foreign trusts are required to make disclosure of similar or overlapping data under three separate reporting regimes, namely, FATCA, CRS and the proposed enhanced foreign trust disclosure. (Cone Marshall, Kensington Swan) Some of this information will be also be provided under the AML rules. Hence, it is submitted that much of the information requested under the foreign trust disclosure rules would be identical to that collected under the existing AML legislation, FATCA and CRS, and would not necessarily enhance New Zealand’s fight against tax evasion. It is therefore submitted that instead of using section 10 of the bill for such purposes, the Anti-money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Act could be amended to ensure that all trustees of foreign trusts are “reporting entities” and be required to conduct customer due diligence. (Cone Marshall) We are concerned that the speed with which the reforms are being implemented risks creating duplicate information reporting requirements and processes that will impose high compliance costs. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 172 Comment There is potential for some duplication under the requirements of the AEOI rules, the AML rules and the foreign trust disclosure rules. However, where an entity is subject to more than one regime, officials expect that in the vast majority of cases, entities would be able to use the same information collected for foreign trusts. Accordingly, while duplication in those cases might potentially increase compliance costs, those compliance costs seem likely to be relat ively min imal. If there are significant compliance issues arising from the differences between AEOI and the foreign trust rules, officials recommend that these issues be considered after the AEOI rules have bedded in. The Government noted the I nquiry’s recommendation that – while the registration process should be the responsibility of Inland Revenue initially – there should be a review of the government agency responsible for administering the foreign trust regime in the future. The Inquiry also noted that there is potential for duplication, and that consideration might be given to having a single government agency assigned an overall coordination role to ensure these initiatives, and the resulting disclosure requirements, are implemented as efficiently as possible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: A central portal should be established to collect the information Submission (Kensington Swan, Cone Marshall, TGT Legal) Inland Revenue should provide a single portal for trustees to provide information for all relevant reporting regimes (FATCA, AEOI/CRS and foreign trust disclosure rules). (Kensington Swan, Cone Marshall, TGT Legal) The Commissioner of Inland Revenue could then develop a second web form on the same platform for the purposes of the annual filing that is required under the relevant reporting regimes. Alternatively, we suggest that a central regulatory agency could be established to receive and process CRS, AML, foreign trust and other regulatory data. (Cone Marshall) Comment In order to implement the new foreign trust rules in an expedient manner, and in light of Inland Revenue’s significant Business transformation programme that is currently underway, a separate reporting process for foreign trusts is being developed. However, the provision of a single portal or joined-up reporting mechanism could be considered in the future. 173 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 174 RULES SHOULD BE LIMITED TO CERTAIN TRUSTS Issue: The proposal should be limited to trusts established or administered in New Zealand Submission (KPMG ) All foreign trusts with New Zealand trustees will be subject to the rules. A failure to comply will mean that world-wide income is taxable in New Zealand. The proposal should be limited to trusts established or administered in New Zealand. Comment Officials disagree that any foreign trusts should be exempt from these disclosure rules. In order to increase transparency of the use of foreign trusts, all New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts should be required to disclose the prescribed information under these proposed rules. If the rules were limited to those trusts that are administered within New Zealand, this would add enable the disclosure rules to be circumvented and undermine the purpose of the reform. It would also add complexity to the rules. The extension of the grace period and reduced requirements on non-professional trustees (as discussed below in “Issue: Disclosure regarding settlements should exclude historical settlements” and “Issue: No tax exemption if trustee is non-compliant”) would reduce the compliance costs faced by trustees who are not professionals, in addition to giving them a longer period to comply with the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exception for a pre-existing trust which subsequently has a New Zealand- resident trustee Submission (KPMG, Russell McVeagh) If Inland Revenue can be satisfied that despite one or more trustees being tax-resident in New Zealand, the trust remains subject to tax in the other relevant jurisdiction, the full disclosure rules are unnecessary and should not apply. One mechanism for achieving this outcome could be to provide an alternative form of disclosure in such cases. We expect there will be trusts settled by non-residents which have New Zealand-resident trustees (family or friends of the settlor). We consider these are not trusts which are of concern. If a comprehensive regime is required, such trusts could be excluded on filing of a copy of a tax return for the settlor or other trustee’s tax jurisdiction. (K PMG) 175 Comment The suggestion that Inland Revenue should assess whether the trust is subject to tax in another jurisdiction is not appropriate. Such a rule would be difficult to implement and administer. Among other things, Inland Revenue would not be able to determine whether the trust has complied with its tax obligations in the other jurisdiction. This is why it is proposed that information about the settlor would be disclosed to the other tax authority, as that other tax authority would be in a better position to assess whether they have any concerns about the trust’s compliance with its tax obligations. In addition, we agree with the I nquiry’s conclusion that it is important to obtain information on foreign trusts for the purpose of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism. The collection of information for these purposes is also an important feature of the rules. Officials note that (as discussed below in “Issue: Disclosure regarding settlements should exclude historical settlements” and “Issue: No tax exemption if trustee is non-compliant”), concessions are recommended for non-professional trustees to reduce compliance costs and increase the length of time they have to comply with the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 176 GENERIC TAX POLICY PROCESS Submission (David McLay, New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) We note that whereas AEOI/CRS has been subject to consultation between officials and the private sector, by its nature the proposed foreign trust disclosure rules have been subject to a different process that has in effect meant no consultation on the technical aspects of the proposals. In other words, there has been no Generic Tax Policy Process on the foreign trust disclosure rules. There has been no opportunity in this process for detailed technical consultation so that workable law results. Officials should be directed to consult with those with a detailed technical knowledge of how foreign trusts work to amend the bill to make it more workable in practice while meeting the stated objective of ensuring that our foreign trust disclosure rules meet the highest international standards for transparency. (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) The generic tax policy process has not been followed in the development of these requirements, and there has been excessive rhetoric in the public media so that a full examination of tax issues and principles has not been possible. The use of the Commission of Inquiry process, and its haste, has impeded the more usual (and correct) manner in which new tax requirements are developed. (David McLay) Comment While the proposed foreign trust amendments have not been through the normal Generic Tax Policy Process, the Government considered the recommendations that arose from the Inquiry along with official’s advice on these recommendations. The proposed amendments in this bill follow the Government’s decisions based on the Inquiry’s recommendations. The Inquiry undertook an extensive independent review of the policy and operation of the foreign trust rules. As part of its review, the Inquiry invited submissions from the public. It received and considered 23 submissions. Officials note that this officials’ report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends several changes to make it easier to comply and clarify technical issues in response to submissions received as part of the select committee process. Officials will monitor the implementation of the proposals and report to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue if concerns with the effectiveness of the rules are identified. In addition to the usual monitoring, the Inquiry recommended that the registration process should be the responsibility of Inland Revenue initially, but that this should be reviewed in the future. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 177 INFORMATION SHARING AND DATA PROTECTION Issue: Data protection Submissions (David McLay, Cone Marshall, Kensington Swan, TGT Legal) Given the extent and type of information that needs to be reported under the foreign trust disclosure rules, it is important there is assurance that the data protection rules which are built into the Privacy Act 1993, the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, will extend to all data gathered under the disclosure rules, which are similar in scope to that required of New Zealand domestic trusts, and under the CRS rules. (Cone Marshall) We also consider it important that there is assurance that the data protection rules which are currently provided for in the Privacy Act 1993, the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 will extend to the data gathered under the new foreign trust disclosure regime. (Kensington Swan) It is critical that any data collection system established by Inland Revenue (whether for CRS, the new disclosure rules or FATCA) is secure and has mechanisms that ensure that the integrity and accuracy of the data is maintained. (TGT Legal) There has been no analysis of how taxpayer information that is secret under New Zealand law is to be provided to overseas jurisdictions. The focus of the rhetoric has been on allegedly bad behaviours by settlors of trusts, and there has been none on the possibility of corrupt behaviours of government officials in overseas jurisdictions, where tax information may be misused. (Davi d McLay) Comment Officials note that the register of foreign trusts will not be accessible by the public. Th is is in line with the Inquiry’s recommendation that the register be shared with the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police, but should not be available publicly. The information will be held by Inland Revenue, the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police. Inland Revenue and the Police are able to share certain information with other parties (including other governments) in accordance with New Zealand law. Strict secrecy provisions apply to information held by Inland Revenue, which prevents Inland Revenue from sharing information unless it is for tax administration purposes or purposes specified in the Tax Administration Act. A well-established principle, however, is that Inland Revenue is able to share information with other tax authorities under an international treaty, in accordance with that treaty. This information is only to be used by the tax authority for ensuring compliance with tax obligations. The New Zealand Police would use and disclose information obtained from the foreign trust register to fulfil any of its functions and the information would have the same statutory protections as with any other information held by the New Zealand Police. 178 The New Zealand Police can share information domestically and internationally in accordance with New Zealand law (for example, the Privacy Act 1993, Policing Act 2008, Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009, and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992). Information can be shared through: • international treaties and arrangements (such as memoranda of understanding); • participation in multi-agency groups (for example, the Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand); • through the Police Liaison Officer Network; and • through international bodies established to enhance international cooperation in crime prevention and law enforcement such as INTERPOL, the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units and, once operational, the International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre. The types of information shared must be relevant to the purpose for which the information is being used. The New Zealand Police can share information for purposes including crime prevention and law enforcement. The sharing of information is subject to the requirements of New Zealand laws and the conditions specified under each mechanism. Sharing with international counterparts would occur where this was warranted either for the New Zealand Police’s own law enforcement purposes or those of another police jurisdiction. Provisions in the Policing Act 2008 enable the New Zealand Police to share personal information held by the New Zealand Police with a corresponding overseas agency where disclosure is reasonably necessary to enable the corresponding overseas agency to perform a function in its jurisdiction that the New Zealand Police perform in New Zealand. Under the Policing Act provisions, the New Zealand Police is required to consult with the Privacy Commissioner before any agency-to-agency agreement is entered into or varied. Police is also required to report annually to the Privacy Commissioner on the operation of Police audit and assurance processes to show that the New Zealand Police is meeting our international sharing limits or obligations with regard to personal information. In addition to the sharing of information described above, information held by the Police can be disclosed under the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008 provisions for disclosure of information in criminal proceedings. The Official Information Act 1982 also applies. The Department of Internal Affairs will use the foreign trust disclosure register for the purposes of AML/CFT supervision to aid in the identification of risk within the sector it regulates. In particular, the information will be used to ensure that trust and company service providers are complying with the rules they operate under. The Department of Internal Affairs is experienced in handling information of a sensitive nature and has appropriate protocols in place. Currently, the Department of Internal Affairs is not permitted to share any information relating to specific trust and company service providers (although it is possible that in future changes to domestic legis lat ion or international treaties could allow for information sharing between certain overseas counterparts of the Department of Internal Affairs, or other domestic agencies). Interdepartmental memoranda of understanding between Inland Revenue, the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police on the handling of the information will be agreed. 179 It should be noted that there are existing data protection mechanisms contained in all New Zealand’s tax treaties. Information exchanged under New Zealand’s tax treaties will not be provided to another jurisdiction if it is contrary to public policy. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: There should be a prohibition on automatic exchange of information for information disclosed under proposed rules Submission (TGT Legal) Due to the sensitivity of the additional data collected under the new disclosure rules that is not available under CRS or FATCA, we are of the view that additional safeguards should be put in place to ensure that data provided under the new disclosure rules is not provided automatically to a foreign jurisdiction. We believe this is of such significance that the prohibition against such (automatic) disclosure should be enshrined in the legislation and underpinned by appropriate sanctions for breaches that occur. This would not, however, prevent exchanges to occur in the normal course under double tax agreements and other information exchange agreements. We submit that the bill should be amended to prohibit the automatic exchange of information provided under the new disclosure rules together with appropriate sanctions for breaches of the prohibition. Comment Officials do not agree that there needs to be a legislative prohibition on the automatic exchange of information. Officials note, however, that there will not be “automatic exchange of information” of foreign trust information under New Zealand’s tax treaties. Most of our international tax treaties provide for information exchanges under the following exchanges: • exchange of information at the request of the other jurisdiction; • spontaneously by New Zealand to the other jurisdiction; and • automatically between the two jurisdictions. Information exchange in relation to foreign trusts will occur under the spontaneous or “on request” exchange of information mechanisms and not the automatic exchange of information mechanism (which relates to an automated bilateral programme set up by both countries). As noted above in “Issue: Trusts should be subject to the AEOI rules rather than a separate regime”, it is expected that, where a settlor is a resident in a jurisdiction which has an exchange of information agreement providing for spontaneous exchange, Inland Revenue will provide certain information to the tax authority of that jurisdiction as a matter of course. The 180 information that will be provided to the overseas tax authority as a matter of course will be information about the settlor (name, taxpayer identification number, contact details) and the trustee’s contact details. Officials consider that it is necessary to provide this information to overseas jurisdictions as a matter of course in order for the receiving jurisdiction to establish whether or not they need further information about the trust from Inland Revenue (which the jurisdiction can then request further information under the exchange of information on request mechanism). This approach follows the approach taken under the current rules in relation to Australian settlors. As noted above in the response to “Issue: Data protection”, there are existing data protection mechanisms contained in all New Zealand’s tax treaties. Information will not be provided to another jurisdiction if it is contrary to public policy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Purposes of collection is unclear Submission (Cone Marshall) It is presently unclear about the purposes for which the Commissioner will be collecting information under the foreign trust disclosure rules. Comment As noted above, Inland Revenue will be collecting information to be held in a register that will be searchable by Inland Revenue, the Department of Internal Affairs, and the New Zealand Police. The information will be used for the purposes of preventing tax evasion and avoidance (both New Zealand and overseas tax), crime prevention and law enforcement, and regulation of trust and company service providers. Inland Revenue will also share information with overseas treaty partners so they can ensure compliance with tax obligations. All informat ion will be collected and used in accordance with the laws applying to the relevant agencies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 181 Issue: Information sharing with other agencies should be limited to law enforcement purposes Submission (Russell McVeagh) Disclosure of information to members, officers, employees or agents of other government agencies under proposed section 81(4)(y) should be limited to disclosure for law enforcement purposes. Proposed section 81(4)(y) should be amended such that it only applies to communications to a person for the purposes of criminal law enforcement and enforcement of the Anti-money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Act. Comment The information is to be used by all three agencies in accordance with the laws under which they operate. The information will be used by the New Zealand Police for crime prevention and law enforcement, and by the Department of Internal Affairs for the regulation of trust and company service providers. Under the submitter’s proposal, before providing information to the New Zealand Police and the Department of Internal Affairs, Inland Revenue would be required to assess the intended use of the data by the New Zealand Police and the Department of Internal Affairs on a case-by-case basis. This is contrary to the policy intent of the bill as the New Zealand Police and the Department of Internal Affairs would be unable to search the database. The policy intention is that the information is proposed to be contained on a shared register, which will be searchable by the Department of Internal Affairs and the New Zealand Police as well as Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Administrative process in cases where a person believed information has been used or disclosed outside of the scope or objective it was collected for Submission (Cone Marshall) We submit that the Commissioner provides an administrative process for an aggrieved party to present their case to an impartial body if the person reasonably believes the information provided under the FTD/CRS rules has been used or disclosed outside of the scope or objective it was collected for, or where such information has already been reported by a Reporting Financial Institution or another body (in New Zealand or overseas), or where the information reported by different reporting entities are inconsistent /contradictory even though they relate to the same account. Comment Officials disagree with the submission that there should be a new administrative process for an aggrieved party to present their case to an impartial body. There are existing administrative 182 remedies available if persons are concerned about the Commissioner's use of powers. For example, they are able to seek a judicial review. These remedies are available to New Zealand- resident trustees of foreign trusts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Mechanism to ensure internal consistency of data held Submission (TGT Legal) There should be mechanisms to ensure that the data held is accurate, and that there is internal consistency in terms of the data held by Inland Revenue about a trust. The absence of a mechanism to correct errors may create issues in a settlor or beneficiary’s home country, particularly if, for example, the settlor or beneficiary makes a tax disclosure to their home tax authority that does not match with data exchanged under CRS or FATCA. Comment Officials consider there are general points that are relevant to this submission. • If Inland Revenue holds incorrect data because trustees have provided incorrect data, then this is an issue for the trustee to correct. Trustees are required to provide accurate data. The consequences of providing inaccurate information are losing eligibility for the tax exemption on foreign-sourced income in addition to potential penalties in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for providing incorrect information. If trustees discover they have provided incorrect information, they must correct it. • If there is internal inconsistency between two sets of information held by Inland Revenue because of, for example, transposition errors, trustees are able to simply request that inconsistencies are corrected. There is no need for a special “mechanism” to correct errors. • If there is a mismatch between data held by Inland Revenue and that held by another jurisdiction, this can be resolved through consultation between competent authorities as provided for in New Zealand’s international treaties. In all three scenarios above, accuracy of data is not an issue specific to this reform, and there are existing ways incorrect data can be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 183 REGISTRATION AND FILING FEE Clause 10 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposal to introduce a registration fee of $270 and an annual filing fee of $50 should not proceed. This proposal fails to recognise Inland Revenue’s obligation to administer New Zealand’s tax laws fairly and impart ially. Although the annual fee is not directly linked to the filing of the annual income tax return, the perception may be that the fee is payable to file a tax return. Other taxpayers do not pay fees to Inland Revenue when they file a tax return. Comment It is important to note that foreign trusts do not pay tax in New Zealand, so the fee is not a charge for paying tax. Charging fees recognises that foreign trusts benefit from New Zealand’s regulatory environment and that there are costs involved to the Crown, both in processing registrations and returns, exchanging information with other jurisdictions and also in enforcing the rules relating to foreign trusts. Charging fees would recompense the Crown for those costs. The registration and annual filing fees are in line with those charged by the Companies Office for the registration of entities. Further, the register of foreign trusts could, in future, be administered and maintained by a different government agency, where it may be more common to charge fees for registration services. Accordingly, officials disagree with the submission that fees should not be charged. However, as recommended by the Specialist Tax Adviser to the Committee, officials agree that it is appropriate for non-professional trustees to apply to the Commissioner for an exemption from the registration and filing fees. This should help to address situations where resident trustees have become trustees of a foreign trustee due to changes in circumstances (such as a trustee migrating to New Zealand or acting as an executor of a trust), rather than choosing to establish a foreign trust, and then having to register in order to fulfil their tax obligations. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 184 IMPACTS ON NON-PROFESSIONAL TRUSTEES – GRACE PERIODS FOR NEW MIGRANTS Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) The proposed grace period of two years should be extended to mirror the four-year transitional resident exemption. The grace period should begin on the first day of residence in New Zealand and end on the earlier of: • the day before the person ceases to be a New Zealand resident; or • the last day of the 48 th month after the month in which the person satisfies the requirements of the permanent place of abode and the 183-day personal presence tests in section YD 1(2) – (4). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Clarificat ion is required on when individuals’ New Zealand residence will be treated as commencing for section 59C purposes and the general back-dating of residence under section YD 1(4) should be excluded for these purposes. That rule is excluded from applying, however, when determining the application of the transitional resident rules under section HR 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and we suggest it would also be appropriate to exclude it in this context. (EY) Comment Officials note that the current disclosure rules provide a two-year grace period for natural persons who migrate to New Zealand and are not in the business of providing trustee services. The bill as introduced retains this grace period, with minor amendments. Officials agree with the submission that the grace period in the foreign trust disclosure rules should be extended to four years to align with the principle of the four-year exemption in the transitional residence rules. This would simplify requirements for trustees migrating to New Zealand who are not in the business of providing trustee services, allowing them four years to understand and meet these obligations. This also recognises that migrants may not have knowingly opted into being a New Zealand- resident trustee of a foreign trust when they became a trustee, and therefore are less likely to be using foreign trusts for illicit purposes. The Specialist Tax Adviser to the Finance and Expenditure Committee further recommends in her report that eligibility for the grace period be extended to resident trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services more generally, regardless of whether or not they are new migrants to New Zealand. This is discussed in further detail in “Issue: No tax exemption if trustee is non-compliant”, which relates to the impact of the foreign trust rules on so-called “accidental trustees”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 185 INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED UPON REGISTRATION Clause 10 Issue: Trust deeds should not be required upon registration Submission (Kensington Swan, New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) Provid ing the trust deed and financial statements for a foreign trust places in a public register fundamentally private information. It is also common for trust deeds to be amended and functionaries under trusts to be changed from time to time by supplemental deeds. The terms of a trust deed filed may not actually reflect the terms of the trust at the time the register is searched and so may be of limited utility. Furthermore, it is common for companies to be interposed between trusts and the assets held and so in these cases the financial statements of the trusts concerned may not provide any meaningful information. (Kensington Swan) The same requirement that applies to domestic trusts should apply as it seems the Inquiry intended. That is, on registration, the trustee should provide excerpts from the trust documentation to identify the trust. (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) The trust deed should be available for IRD inspection should that be required. In that case section 22 (7)(d)(i) of the Tax Administration Act – which requires trustees to retain documents that evidence the creation and constitution of trusts should not be repealed as proposed by clause 9(4) of the bill. (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) Comment Under current law, the trust deed of a foreign trust must be available and provided to Inland Revenue if requested. The bill proposes that the trust deed should be provided to Inland Revenue at the time the trust is registered in New Zealand. A key conclusion of the Inquiry was that the trust deed should be provided to Inland Revenue at the time the foreign trust is registered. The trust deed documents the creation and terms of the trust and is essentially the foundation document. Having the trust deed for a foreign trust provides Inland Revenue with the ability to verify the information provided by the trust. It is possible that a foreign trust in New Zealand could wind up in order to avoid its trust deed being provided to an overseas tax authority. If Inland Revenue holds the trust deed, it can still be provided if requested by an overseas tax authority. Moreover, requiring the trust deed upon registration sends an important signal and should provide a deterrent to foreign trusts being used for illicit purposes. Officials note that, in the absence of a specific legislative requirement to disclose the trust deed, the Commissioner could use her powers under section 17 to request the deed. Having a legislative requirement to provide the trust deed upon registration avoids the administrative costs of Inland Revenue having to issue requests under section 17. 186 It should also be noted that Inland Revenue’s forms currently require trust deeds to be provided for any trust applying for an IRD number (not just excerpts of the trust deed). Accordingly, requiring trust deeds for foreign trusts wishing to register in New Zealand is consistent with requirements for New Zealand trusts that are required to apply for IRD numbers. Officials understand that submitters have expressed two concerns with providing the trust deed. The first concern is that trust deeds contain sensitive information that mean trust deeds should only be available to Inland Revenue on request. It should be emphasised that the information disclosed to Inland Revenue would not be made public. It is anticipated that the trust deed would be provided to overseas authorities only when it is requested. In addition, the trust deed would not be automatically provided to Department of Internal Affairs and the Police as part of the register. The trust deed would be provided only when requested by Department of Internal Affairs or the Police. More information on data protection in each agency is provided as part of the response to “Issue: Data protection”. The second concern relates to compliance costs. Officials do not consider that the costs of complying with this requirement would be significant. As previously noted, the trust deed is required to be kept and if requested, sent to Inland Revenue. Accordingly, the costs for providing the trust deed to Inland Revenue on registration are likely to be relatively minimal, and as noted above, are consistent with the current requirements for other trusts that apply for IRD numbers. Officials have discussed the requirement to provide trust deeds with New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Lim ited, but did not reach agreement on this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to trust deed in registration requirement Submission (EY) It appears not every foreign trust with a resident trustee would be required to register under the proposed section 59B and 59C requirements, as those requirements include having a trust deed. No specific definition of “trust deed” is already included in the Tax Administration Act 1994 or Income Tax Act 2007 or proposed to be included for these purposes. Comment Under the proposals, all foreign trusts with a New Zealand-resident trustee would be required to register under the proposed amended rules in order to be eligible for the tax exemption. If a foreign trust does not have a trust deed (that is, if the foreign trust is based on an oral agreement), they will be unable to register and fulfil the associated disclosure requirements. Accordingly they will not be eligible for the exemption. 187 Officials note that Inland Revenue currently requires trusts to provide a trust deed in order for domestic trusts to get an IRD number. Officials note that if there is an exception to the proposed rule that in order to get an exemption the foreign trust must effectively have a trust deed, this exception could be open to abuse. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Any documents amending or to be read together with the trust deed should also be provided Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 59B(3)(e) requires that the trust deed be provided. This section should expressly provide that both a copy of the trust deed and any document that amends or that must be read together with the trust deed (such as, for instance, any document by which a person is appointed as protector), must be provided. Comment Officials agree and recommend that the bill should be amended to ensure that any documents that either amend or are to be read together with the trust deed should also be provided. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Agreement to provide information should be limited to information relevant to the trust Submission (Russell McVeagh) The agreement of settlors, trustees and other persons who control a trust to provide information for compliance with the Tax Administration Act 1994, Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act and regulations under the latter Act should be limited to information necessary for the relevant trust’s compliance with those laws. We assume that this is the intention but the requirement as drafted could on the face of it extend to information that has nothing to do with the trust. Proposed section 59B(4) should be amended to require that each relevant person agree “to provide to the applicant trustee information necessary for the applicant trustee’s compliance with the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing 188 of Terrorism Act 2009 and the regulations made under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 as those laws apply to the relevant trust”. Comment The requirement is that a trustee must provide a signed declaration that the trustees, settlors and persons able to control the trust (if any) have been informed of, and have agreed to provide the information necessary to comply with the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 and the regulations made under the later Act. Officials consider that the trustee’s obligations in relation to informing the settlors, trustees, and other persons able to control the trust could be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and referred to drafters. Issue: Signed declaration is ineffective and should be deleted Submission (David McLay) There is a proposed section 59B(4)) for a signed declaration by settlors and trustees and others having powers to control the trust. The declaration may be helpful, but it appears to be only required at the time of initial registrat ion. Proposed section 59C does not require any new declaration upon changes affecting the trust. The declaration is a “makeweight” that is unlikely to enhance the proposals. It is otiose and should be deleted. Comment The submitter notes that the signed declaration is only required to be made at the time the trust is first registered w ith Inland Revenue. This means that if there are any subsequent changes to trustees or additional settlors or other relevant persons subsequent to the registration of the trust, the resident trustee is not required to obtain their signature. The requirement to provide a signed declaration as part of the registration process was recommended by the Inquiry. Officials disagree that it is ineffective as it requires all persons to have turned their minds to the relevant laws and regulations that they will need to comply with. In light of the submission, officials consider that it would be appropriate to require the resident trustee of a foreign trust to obtain a signature from any person who becomes one of the following subsequent to the registration of the trust: • settlor; • person with a power under the trust deed to control the dismissal or appointment of a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary; • person with a power under the trust deed to control a trustee in the administration of the trust; and • trustee. 189 This will ensure the declaration is obtained regardless of the time that the person becomes involved with the trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Signed declaration – relevant persons may be deceased Submission (Cone Marshall, New Zealand Trustees Companies Association Limited) Proposed section 59B (4) would require a trustee to provide on registration a signed declaration that the settlors, controllers and trustees have been informed of and agree to provide information necessary to comply with foreign trust disclosure and anti-money laundering rules. This raises some very practical problems when the settlor, for example, has died, is mentally incapacitated or cannot be traced. (New Zealand Trustees Companies Association Limited) It is unclear what options are available to the resident trustee if any of the persons described above cannot be contacted because they are deceased, cannot be located or are incapacitated. To address such scenarios, we submit that the declaration from the resident trustee include words to the effect “to the best of my knowledge and belief” so as not to unreasonably prevent the registration of a foreign trust. The resident trustee should be provided with the option, within the declaration, to advise the Commissioner that one or more of the above mentioned persons is deceased, cannot be located or is incapacitated so as to enable the resident trustee to comply with the remaining requirements of the trustee's declaration. (Cone Marshall) Comment Officials acknowledge that when a person is incapacitated, their legal guardian, personal representative, or power of attorney should sign on their behalf. If the person cannot be located, the trustee should complete a statutory declaration outlining their attempts to find the person. Officials considered requiring a copy of the death certificate when a settlor may be deceased, but this is likely to be impractical, particularly if the settlor is not recently deceased. It would be sufficient for the resident trustee to declare that a signature cannot be obtained as the settlor is deceased. If incorrect information is provided, knowledge offence penalties under the Tax Administrat ion Act 1994 could apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 190 Issue: Email address Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The requirement to provide the email addresses of specified persons under proposed sections 59C and 59D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should not proceed. The requirement for the resident trustee to provide an email address for specified persons fails to recognise that not everyone has an email address. Comment Officials agree that the resident trustee should only be required to provide an email address when an email address is known by the resident trustee. This recognises that not all individuals have an email address. When the email address is not known by the resident trustee, officials consider that the other address details required should provide sufficient information. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Applicable definition of “settlor” Submission (Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) Given the broad definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the obligation to disclose information in respect of settlors may apply more broadly than intended. The definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007 includes a person who transfers value to the trust, for the benefit of the trust or on terms of the trust. Consequently, a person may be a settlor of a trust when they have provided services to the trust for less than market value (for example, family members or friends who are lawyers or accountants providing services to a trust for less than market value). (Russell McVeagh) Under the Income Tax Act 2007 the term “settlor” is specifically defined (sections HC 27(2) and HC 27(4)). Th is is a very w ide definition (for example, it includes the provision of subsidised services) because it is designed to bring into the New Zealand tax base any trust that could be used to avoid New Zealand tax. It would seem inappropriate for these purposes. This defin it ion applies only for the purposes of the “trust rules” that is defined by section YA 1 as including sections 59 and 93D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 but not proposed sections 59B or 59D. It is unclear what is intended by the term “settlor” in these sections. (New Zealand Trust ee Companies Association Limited) Comment The definition of “settlor” in the Income Tax Act 2007 is not restricted to the trust rules. It is a general definition which also applies in the Tax Administration Act 1994 as provided for by 191 section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The definition of “settlor” is used extensively in the Income Tax Act and its wide meaning is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. After discussing this issue with the Specialist Tax Adviser to the Committee, officials consider that there should be some restriction to the definition of settlor for the purpose of the foreign trust disclosure rules. This would allow an exception to making a person a settlor solely because they provide services at below market value, but only in restricted cases. Officials consider that it is important that there are appropriate restrictions on a narrower definition for the purpose of the disclosure rules in order to mitigate any potential abuse of the rules. Officials consider that it is appropriate to exclude a person who would be settlor only because they provide services to the trust below market value and the services provided to the trust below market value are minor, and incidental to the activities of the trust. The requirement for the services to be incidental to the activities of the trust would be relative to the trust in question. It would ensure that certain types of services are excluded depending on the activities of the trust. For example, a service that would be both minor and incidental to the activities to the trust could include, for example, a friend carrying out an inspection of a rental property held in the trust for free. However, the service would not be considered incidental if a person provides services similar to those provided by the trust. For example, where a friend carries out an inspection of a rental property, this would not be incidental if the trust were in the business of property management. The requirement for the services to be minor introduces a standard that applies equally to all trusts. This will ensure that the incidental services would only be carved out where the value of the services is low. Officials considered stipulating an explicit threshold for what constitutes a “minor” service. However, this would introduce additional complexities and compliance costs. Officials also considered using a test relevant to the trust, for example, allowing an exclusion for below market services where the asset base of the trust was less than NZ$1 million. O fficials considered that it would be possible to circumvent such a test by setting up multiple trusts to split the assets, and that there was a possibility for a large number of business activities to be run with a low asset base. In other cases, this could impose compliance costs on those well below the asset threshold as they would be required to obtain valuations to provide that they are in fact below the threshold. In addition, given that the number is a nominal value, it is also likely the threshold would need to be updated to take account of changes in asset prices to ensure that the threshold is appropriately targeted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 192 Issue: Provision of TIN and contact details of guardian when a beneficiary is a minor Submission (New Zealand Law Society) In some cases there are very likely to be beneficiaries (such as, children) that do not have email addresses and/or tax numbers. A provision should be included allowing the contact details of a guardian or parent to be provided when the beneficiary is a minor. Comment Officials agree that it would be appropriate for the TIN and contact details of a guardian or parent be provided if the minor beneficiary does not have a contact number or TIN. However, the resident trustees should note on the registration form when a beneficiary is a minor, and update the details when the minor is no longer a minor (reaches age 16, consistent with the trust tax rules). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Estates of deceased individuals Submission (EY) Although personal representatives of a deceased person are included in the Income Tax Act 2007 definition of “trustee”, we assume a will or other testamentary instrument would not be regarded as a “trust deed” for these purposes. On that basis, New Zealand residents who are or become trustees of a foreign trust by virtue of being or becoming personal representatives of a deceased person's estate would not be required to register, pay fees and report all required details to the CIR. The proposed section 59C(3) grace period for registration would not necessarily be appropriate or adequate for estate situations as a New Zealand-resident personal representative may never have been non-resident or may not fall within the specific residence/non-residence criteria proposed. Deceased individuals’ estates should be excluded from being required to register, pay fees and meet the detailed information requirements and to limit application of the new rules to inter vivos trusts. 12 12 A trust created by a declaration of trust which commences at that time while the settlor is still living. 193 Comment Officials agree that a will is not a trust deed in itself for the purposes of the foreign trust disclosure rules. However, a trust established under a will (a testamentary trust) will be a trust for these purposes. As noted above, non-professional trustees will have a longer period to comply with the rules under the extended grace period. These trustees will also be eligible to apply for an exemption from the registration and annual filing fees and provide more limited disclosure on historical settlements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Disclosure regarding settlements should exclude historical settlements Submission (Russell McVeagh) The requirement to disclose details regarding settlements and settlors should be adapted so that it is workab le for pre-existing trusts, in respect of which settlements may have been made years in the past, and the settlors may be deceased. In the case of trusts established before becoming subject to the disclosure rules, proposed section 59B should require disclosure of settlements and settlors only for a certain period of time prior to applying to become registered. This period of time would need to be sufficient to ensure that the disclosure requirements could not be circumvented, but not so lengthy as to be impossible to comply with in practice. A period of three to four years would seem appropriate. Comment After discussion with the Specialist Tax Adviser to the Committee, officials agree that there should be a limit to the historical settlements for non-professional resident trustees. However, it is expected that professional trustees provide the details of all historical settlements for the trust. To address compliance costs for non-professional trustees, officials consider that they should only be required to provide details of historical settlements for the previous four years. The beginning of this four-year period should be from the earlier of: • the point that the trustee first becomes liable to register the foreign trust; and • the application date of the legislation (30 June 2017). Note that the four-year time limit for providing historical settlements can be different from the way the four-year grace period for registration is calculated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 194 Issue: Meaning of “each person with a power under the trust deed to control the dismissal or appointment of a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 59B(3)(c)(ii) requires disclosure of “each person with a power under the trust deed to control the dismissal or appointment of a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary”. This drafting does not appear to encompass a person with a power to control the amendment of the trust deed or control the appointment or removal of a beneficiary, nor is it clear that a person with the power to control the dismissal or appointment of a trustee encompasses a person with the power to appoint and remove a trustee. The drafting is also problematic as it requires the requisite power to stem from the trust deed. This should be redrafted as: each person with a power (whether under the trust deed or otherwise) to dismiss or appoint a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary and each person with a power (whether under the trust deed or otherwise) to consent, veto or otherwise control the exercise of a power to dismiss or appoint a trustee, to amend the trust deed, or to add or remove a beneficiary. Comment Officials agree that the details should be provided under proposed section 59B(3)(c) for any person who has a power to dismiss and/or appoint a trustee or appoint and/or remove a beneficiary, whether or not this power stems from the trust deed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and referred to drafters for their consideration. Issue: Bare trustee Submission (Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) Section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to clarify that it also applies for the purposes of the foreign trust disclosure rules. This would also clarify that the rules do not apply to trustees when the trustee is merely a bare trustee and that details of beneficiaries whose rights are held via a nominee must also be disclosed under proposed section 59B(3)(c)(v). (Russell McVeagh) It seems to be the policy objective that bare trusts (outside those covered by AEOI/CRS) should still be subject to disclosure. This needs to be provided for. (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) 195 Comment Officials have discussed this with submitters. We note that section YB 21 provides that a trustee is a nominee only if a trustee is a bare trustee (that is, a trust that has no discretion to administer the trust’s assets). When a trustee is considered to be a nominee, they are effectively ignored and the tax rules “look through” to the person they are acting for. We agree that it should be clarified that section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act should apply to the requirements, so that when a trustee is considered to be a nominee, they would not be subject to the foreign trust disclosure rules. At this time, officials consider that this is the appropriate policy outcome, but officials note that this raises a concern in relation to potential abuse of the disclosure rules. Officials will monitor this issue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Clarification of “date and detail of each settlement” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 59B(3)(b) requires the “date and detail of each settlement” to be disclosed. It is not clear what details are required, for example, the value of the settlement, the nature of the property settled, the location (if any) of the property settled, and/or the identity of the settlor of each settlement. Comment Disclosure on the detail of each settlement made on the trust should include the date of settlement, the name of the settlor and the nature (such as, land or shares) and value of the settlement. Specific details about the settlor are also required as part of the disclosure under proposed section 59B(3)(c)(i); name, email address (if known), residential address, country of tax residence, and taxpayer identification number. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 196 Issue: Disclosure in relation to residence Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 59B(3)(c) requires the “residential address” of each person listed in (c) to be disclosed. Since, for instance, a trustee or settlor may not be an individual, clarification is needed as to what address, if any, is required for non-individuals, (such as, a registered office). Comment Officials w ill clarify in further guidance that for an individual, resident trustees will have to provide their physical or residential address. For non-individuals the registered office or servicing address should be provided. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Other identifying particulars Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The words “other identifying particulars” in proposed section 59B(3)(a) are vague and, given the liability for inadequate disclosure, unhelpful. Proposed section 59B(3) requires the name of the trust and a copy of the trust deed to be provided, so it is not clear what other particulars are required to identify the trust. If it is desirable for the date of establishment of the trust to be expressly disclosed, for example, that should be specified. Comment Th is wording reflects the ex isting d isclosure requirement in section 59B. Under the existing rules, it was intended that other identifying particulars (for example, the date of initial settlement on the trust) are only to be provided when the foreign trust does not have a name. Officials agree that this information is no longer necessary as a result of the other information that is proposed to be required upon disclosure. Officials therefore recommend that the reference to “other identifying particulars” should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 197 INFORMATION REQUIRED IN ANNUAL RETURNS Clause 10 Issue: Requirement to provide any changes to details provided at registration within 30 days of alteration Submission (KPMG, TGT Legal, Russell McVeagh, Cone Marshall, Chapman Tripp, New Zealand Trust ee Companies Association Limited, New Zealand Law Society) A trustee is required to notify changes and also provide an annual return which contains the same information. The duplication of notification should be eliminated. (K PMG) Given the additional work this would require throughout the year, it is appropriate that any changes made to the settlement dates or details only be disclosed to the Commissioner in the annual return. (Chapman Tripp) Requiring changes about the trust to be reported under two separate provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 is unnecessary and simply imposes additional compliance costs, which we believe far exceed any benefits of doing so. We submit that changes to trust data should only be reported either once in each year in the annual return or once within a reasonable timeframe after the change. Assuming the latter option is preferred, a reasonable timeframe for reporting changes is three months, which is consistent with the timeframe within which changes are required to be reported under the Charities Act. (TGT Legal) The requirement to provide updates in 30 days seems to impose compliance costs for no obvious benefit. (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) The requirement to file an annual return under proposed section 59D is sufficient to adequately inform the Commissioner of changes to the particulars of a foreign trust and that ad hoc disclosure during the year is not necessary. (Russell McVeagh) The resident trustee advises of any changes to the registered information when the annual return of a foreign trust is filed, as is the case with New Zealand companies (that is, information is updated when the annual return is filed). (Cone Marshall) Comment In order to have current information on a foreign trust it is necessary that the details provided as part of a foreign trust’s initial disclosure on registration are kept up to date. For example, holding up-to-date details of any settlors and their current tax residence impacts on information- sharing with relevant overseas jurisdictions. Accordingly, officials do not believe that the 30- day requirement is excessive. The current disclosure rules for foreign trusts require updates to any information provided as part of the initial disclosure to be updated within 30 days. Officials consider that this requirement should be kept for the purposes of the enhanced disclosure rules. 198 However, officials agree that requiring any changes to the registration document to be reported both within 30 days of alteration and as part of the annual return results is an unnecessary duplication. Officials recommend that the annual return requirement be amended to remove the requirement to provide any changes to the information provided at registration. The requirement to provide any updates within 30 days of alteration would be sufficient. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Issue: Financial statements Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The term “financial statements” in proposed section 59D should be defined to mean the minimum requirements as prescribed in clause 8 and the Schedule of the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014. “Company” should be read as “trust”. Comment As noted by the submitter, the Tax Administration Act 1994 includes a provision for minimum standards for financial statements to be set by Order in Council. Officials consider that rather than referring to the Order in Council setting out the requirements for companies, an Order in Council should be made under this provision to specify the minimum standards for financial statements for foreign trusts. This should provide certainty to resident trustees as to what is required as a financial statement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Clarification regarding financial statement requirements Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 59D(1)(b)(ii) acknowledges the possibility of a foreign trust not preparing financial statements. If a foreign trust has not done so, it is not clear whether it is intended under proposed section 59D(2)(b) that financial statements are to be provided only if they are prepared, or whether the intention is for every registered foreign trust to prepare financial statements, even if they would not otherwise be prepared. 199 Comment If a trust does not prepare financial statements for other purposes, they would have to prepare financial statements in order to meet their requirements under the enhanced disclosure rules. As noted above, officials consider that an Order in Council should be made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify the minimum standards for financial statements for a foreign trust. This will make it clear for foreign trusts, including those who do not ordinarily prepare financial statements, what information must be provided. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Annual return deadlines Submission (TGT Legal, New Zealand Law Society) We believe that the three-month reporting deadline is too short, and is arbitrary. By their nature, foreign trusts will invariably have all or substantially all of their assets, outside of New Zealand. Responsibility for administration, including the preparation of financial statements, is usually undertaken by administrators, accountants and advisers outside of New Zealand. In some cases timeframes are driven by foreign jurisdictional requirements. Because of this, we believe there w ill be logist ical d ifficu lt ies in filing financial statements of a foreign trust within the proposed three-month period. In addition, we do not believe it is either appropriate or reasonable to impose a timeframe for the reporting of financial statements (and annual returns) by foreign trusts that are substantively shorter than those applicable to New Zealand-based trusts and entities. To address these concerns, we submit that the timeframe within which: • foreign trust annual returns (other than financial statements of the trust) are required to be filed should be extended to at least six months from the end of the trust’s balance date; and • foreign trust financial statements that are required to be reported be extended to the same time period that applies when the taxpayer is on the agency list of a registered tax agent (generally 12 months from balance date). Three months is a very short timeframe. By contrast, the annual return for a charitable trust must be filed within six months of balance date. Moreover, if the majority of income is derived in other jurisdictions which have different balance dates, there may not be complete information available within three months of the end of the New Zealand tax year. Six months after balance date or six months after the end of the tax year (as applicable) would be a more reasonable timeframe. (New Zealand Law Society) 200 Comment Given that any updates to the information provided as part of initial disclosure will be updated throughout the year, officials agree that six months following a trust’s balance date is a more appropriate timeframe for the annual return. This would give resident foreign trustees more time to gather any required documentation and meet their obligations. Officials acknowledge that this is likely to be particularly important given that much of the documentation may be held overseas. For foreign trusts that do not have a balance date, officials agree that they should be required to file six months after the end of the tax year (31 March). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifications required in relation to distributions Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section 59D(2)(e) requires the date and amount of each distribution to be provided in the annual return. It is not clear whether the required amount is the total of distributions made on a particular date or the amount of a distribution on a particular date to a particular beneficiary. If the latter is intended, that should be clarified. If so, it is also unclear whether the identity of the particular beneficiary is also required to be provided under (e), which would seem useful, in which case the requirements in proposed (f) could be transferred to (e) instead. In addition, it should be noted that distributions can include items that are otherwise of money or assets (for example, the use of a property by a beneficiary for no consideration). It is not clear whether it is intended that these types of distributions be identified and valued. Comment Information on the amount of distributions required in the annual return of a foreign trust should specify the amount of a distribution made on a particular date to a particular beneficiary. The identity and contact information for each beneficiary should also be provided in accordance with section 59D(2)(f). When a distribution takes the form of an item which is not money or an asset, the market value for the distribution should be provided. The form will prescribe what information is required. Recommendation That the submission be noted and referred to the drafter. 201 TAX EXEMPTION FOR FOREIGN TRUSTS Clause 5 Issue: No tax exemption if trustee is non-compliant Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG,) Proposed section HC 26 (1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007, that treats foreign-sourced income as exempt income only if the resident trustee has complied with the registration disclosure requirements and fulfilled their annual filing obligation, should not be enacted. Imposing New Zealand tax on the worldwide income of a foreign trust is inconsistent with the scheme and purpose of New Zealand's tax legislation. Non-compliance with the new requirements should be dealt with by the application of penalties to the New Zealand-resident trustee, as provided for by the Tax Administration Act 1994 currently. We are particularly concerned in this context about “accidental” foreign trusts. If proposed section HC 26(1)(c) is not removed, the “foreign trust” definition should be limited to trusts established under New Zealand law. Comment Officials consider that removing the exemption for foreign-sourced income is an appropriate sanction for lack of compliance with the new requirements, and therefore disagree with the submission. However officials acknowledge submitters’ concerns about the impact of the proposed new disclosure rules on so-called “accidental trustees” and the significance of the sanction for resident trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services. To address these concerns, officials agree with the recommendations of the Specialist Tax Adviser to the Committee that there should be additional concessions to ensure that the rules are easier to comply with for non-professional trustees. First, the Specialist Tax Adviser recommends in her report that eligibility for the grace period should also be extended more widely to natural persons who are not in the business of providing trustee services, regardless of whether they are migrants or existing New Zealand residents. Officials agree with the recommendation. Officials also note that in “Issue: Grace period for new migrants – consistency with transitional residence rules”, it is also recommended that the grace period be extended from two years to four years to give these resident trustees more time to comply with the increased obligations. For migrants, the grace period is calculated from the day they first become New Zealand- resident. For non-migrants, the start of the four-year grace period should be when the person first becomes a resident trustee of a foreign trust. This extended grace period for non-migrants should be available regardless of whether the start date is before or after the enactment of the proposed legislation. 202 This would mean that for natural person resident trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services and who would become liable to register their foreign trust upon enactment of the legislation, these trustees may have up to an additional four years to register. This means that natural persons, who are not in the business of providing trustee services and who have only become resident trustees of foreign trusts in the past few years, would have some additional time beyond 30 June 2017 to meet the proposed new disclosure requirements. It was not considered appropriate to extend the grace period to existing resident trustees of foreign trusts more generally beyond 30 June 2017, as they already have an obligation to disclose information under the existing foreign trust disclosure rules. For example, if someone has been a resident trustee of a foreign trust for eight years, it would not be appropriate to give them beyond 30 June 2017 to register. For resident trustees who would become liable to register a trust after enactment of the legislation, they will have four years from the date that they would have otherwise become liable to register that trust if they were in the business of providing trustee services. In addition to the grace period, officials agree with the Specialist Tax Adviser’s recommendation that there should be some additional concessions for natural person resident trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services. In particular, to ensure that existing trusts are able to transition into the rules without significant compliance costs, the requirement to provide historical settlements for the trust on initial disclosure should be limited to the earlier of four years prior to either: • the trustee’s obligation to register commencing; or • the application date of the legislation (30 June 2017). As noted in “Issue: Registration and annual filing fee”, officials agree with the Specialist Tax Adviser’s recommendation that resident trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services should be eligible to apply to the Commissioner for an exemption from registration and filing fees in relation to that trust. Example 1: Four-year grace period Ellie, a New Zealand-resident, was appointed a trustee of a foreign trust on 1 July 2013. She is not in the business of providing trustee servi ces and is eligible for the four-year grace period. She will be required to appl y for the registration of the foreign trust by 31 July 2017. 203 Example 2: Timeline of grace period Recommendation That the submission be declined but that officials’ recommendations be accepted. Issue: Trust must be registered before income derived to qualify for tax exemption Submission (Chapman Tripp, EY, New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) There is no policy justification to remove the current section HC 26 exemption from income tax for foreign-sourced income of foreign trusts with resident trustees who may not be required to register with the Commissioner under the registration provisions. The new provisions are currently proposed to apply from enactment. This might happen at any point during a tax year or a trust 's income year (if the trust does not have a 31 March balance date). Trustees will not have been able to register before enactment. I t seems contrary to New Zealand's underlying policy of not taxing foreign -sourced income derived through foreign trusts to remove that exemption, effectively with retrospective impact, for the whole of an income year in which they may have already derived such income. The proposed amendment to section HC 26 should be revised to ensure it applies only to subsequent income and to ensure trustees have a reasonable period to seek registration and provide all information required before the exemption ceases to apply. (EY) Proposed section HC 26(1)(b) requires a trust to be registered before it derives any income. This seems excessive and unnecessary. A trust cannot register until it receives a settlement. From the point it receives a settlement it is likely to derive income making it necessary, it seems, to settle and register simultaneously. That is not likely to be practical. The requirement for 30 June 2013 1 January 2018 1 January 2022 Details of settlements provided on registration under section 59B(3)(b) to this date Grace period commences Must have applied for the registration of foreign trust (grace period ends) Appointed as trustee of a foreign trust 2 December 2017 204 registration should be within a reasonable time. The current requirement under IR607 is 30 days. (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) The current drafting does not achieve the policy objective of allowing an appropriate transitional period for existing foreign trusts to register. Accordingly, new section HC 26(1)(c) should be amended to avoid the loss of the foreign source tax exemption. (Chapman Tripp) Comment Officials agree that foreign trusts who meet the registration requirement before 30 June 2017 should be entitled to the tax exemption for income earned prior to their registrat ion. Officials will revisit the drafting of this section to ensure the transitional outcome is achieved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Strict liability for failure to comply Submission (New Zealand Trustee Companies Association Limited) The main sanction for failure to comply with disclosure requirements seems to be loss of the tax exemption on offshore income (sections HC 26 and CW 54). That could be a very significant penalty. There is no provision for trustees that do not meet even the most immaterial details of the information requirements set out in the proposed sections 59B and 59D. It is submitted that exemptions along the lines of those in proposed section 142I (with respect to AEOI/CRS) should be included. Comment Officials agree that the exemption should still be available if a trustee makes a mistake in relation to registration or disclosure that is unintentional and remedied immediately. There should be a legislative provision that gives the Commissioner discretion to reinstate the exemption if she considers the mistake was unintentional and was remedied immediately. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 205 Issue: Clarification on whether tax exemption criteria to be applied on a year-by- year basis Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Presumably the intention to treat foreign-sourced income as being liable to tax in New Zealand for failure to register relates only to income derived for that income year and not, if a trust is belatedly registered, for every year thereafter. In other words, the intention is that the criteria under section HC 26 are to be applied on a year by year basis, so that for: • a new trust that fails to register within 30 days, or • an existing trust that fails to register before 30 June 2017 foreign-sourced income could still be eligible for a tax exemption under section HC 26. Presumably a failure to register within the required timeframe does not mean that the failure cannot be rectified for a later period, to bring the trust within the rules, however this ought to be made clear. Comment The eligibility for an exemption on foreign-sourced income of the trust will be assessed on a year by year basis. Accordingly, a foreign trust that fails to register on time will lose its exemption for that year. However, if it later registers and fulfils its annual reporting obligations it will be able to get to the exemption for those relevant years. Officials will consider whether the drafting could be made clearer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 206 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Definition of a “foreign trust” Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Trustees Companies Association Limited, EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The term “foreign trust” is not defined for Tax Administration Act 1994 purposes. A definition of “foreign trust” for the proposed disclosure requirements is required. Currently on establishment and until a distribution is made, a trust will not be a foreign trust. The proposed sections would not appear to apply in the interim. (K PMG) For New Zealand income tax purposes, a foreign trust is defined merely for the purposes of determining the New Zealand tax status of distributions. The issues are complex but in short it would seem unlikely that any of the foreign trusts referred to in the media over the past few months would be “foreign trusts” with the result that none of the information disclosure rules in the bill would apply to them. This is obviously not intended. It is not obvious how the rules can be redrafted in a more satisfactory way. For example, information disclosure rules could apply to any trust the foreign income of which is tax exempt under sections HC 26 and CW 54, but that would apply on a year basis and it would only be apparent if a trust fell within the ambit of the rules at the end of the income year. (New Zealand Trustees Companies Association Limited) The Income Tax Act 2007 definition of “foreign trust” may need amending to ensure the effectiveness of the bill's proposals, by replacing the words “in relation to a distribution” with wording along the lines “at any particular time” or “at any relevant time”. (EY) Comment The definition of a “foreign trust” is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 for the existing disclosure requirements. While the existing drafting does not appear to have caused significant uncertainty in practice, officials agree it would be useful to clarify in legislation that the definition of a “foreign trust” for the purposes of the disclosure rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to all trusts with a foreign settlor and a New Zealand-resident trustee, regardless of whether a distribution has been made. Because this is a clarification of the existing law, officials recommend that this apply from the date of enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 207 Issue: No resident trustee remaining in New Zealand Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The amendments should clarify what, if any, obligations the trustees have in respect of a foreign trust registered under section 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 when the New Zealand- resident trustee leaves New Zealand and no New Zealand-resident trustees remain. Proposed section 59D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (annual return for foreign trust) and proposed section HC 25(1)(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (exemption for foreign-sourced amounts) only apply to resident trustees of a foreign trust. In other words, if a foreign trust has no New Zealand-resident trustees, it appears the trustees have no New Zealand tax obligations. In our view, the new rules should set out the consequences of a foreign trust ceasing to have a New Zealand-resident trustee. Inclusion of specific rules will create certainty for the trustees of a foreign trust. Comment Officials note that if a trust with a foreign settlor has no New Zealand-resident trustees and no New Zealand income, there are no New Zealand tax obligations. Accordingly, the trust will have no reporting obligation in New Zealand. However, officials agree an amendment should be made to ensure the New Zealand-resident trustee is required to notify Inland Revenue if they cease to be New Zealand-resident. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 208 MINOR DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Drafting issues raised by submitters Clause 10 Submissions (EY, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Law Soci et y) The submitters raise a number of drafting issues: • The reference to current section 59B(3) in section 22(7)(d) will be incorrect, the bill should amend section 22(7)(d) to impose the record-keeping obligation “other than during a grace period referred to in section 59C(3)”. • Proposed section 59D(3)(b) should be clarified so that it is clear that it applies when section 59D(1)(b)(ii) applies. That is, a resident trustee must provide a return for the foreign trust by 30 June following 31 March if the foreign trust does not prepare financial statements. • The official Commentary on the bill indicates that “year” in proposed section 59D(3) is to be construed as “tax year”, but this is not made clear in the bill. Proposed section 59D(2) should be amended to clarify that “year” means “tax year”. • The words “all that is relevant to the trust of” in the opening line of proposed section 59B(3) are redundant, given the detailed list of items that must be disclosed which follow those words. • It is not clear what is added by the words “when a distribution is made under the trust or when rights apparently vested under the trust are exercised” in proposed section 59B(3)(d). The Law Society recognises that such phrasing was suggested in the Government Inquiry report but the provision would appear to be effective if it simply read: “for a discretionary trust, details of each class of beneficiary sufficient for the Commissioner to determine whether a person is a member of the class”. • This provision also refers to the “country of tax residence”. This would be better expressed as “country, territory or jurisdiction of tax residence”. • The reference in section 59C(3) to section 59C(2) appears redundant. The reference should be to section 59C(1) only. • Proposed section 59C(2) includes the words “except if subsection (3) applies”. “If a change to particulars provided on registration must be supplied within 30 days of the trustee becoming aware of the change, it is not clear why that 30-day requirement does not apply to an individual trustee who meets the requirements of subsection (3).” • On applying to register, the date and detail of each settlement of the trust must be provided. Read literally, no trust will be able to comply as settlements can and do occur over t ime. A trustee will not have any details of future settlements. • The reference in proposed section 59C(3)(b) to the trustee becoming New Zealand resident “on or after 1 October 2006” appears redundant, given that the grace period runs 209 from the time that residence is acquired and ends two years and 30 days after that date if the grace period ends after the date otherwise provided for in subsection (1) or (2). Comment Officials acknowledge these minor drafting points raised by submitters. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Clarifications regarding beneficiaries Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The following clarifications are required regarding beneficiaries: • Proposed section 59B(3)(d) requires, for a discretionary trust, “details of each class of beneficiary”. It is common for a discretionary trust to name specific individuals as beneficiaries. Proposed section 59B(3)(d) should be amended to refer to “each class of beneficiary (including a class consisting of one person)...” • Proposed section 59B(3)(c)(v) requires details for “each beneficiary and nominee for an underlying beneficiary” to be provided to the Commissioner. The term “underlying beneficiary” is not defined and is not a concept recognised under the general law of trusts. Proposed section 59B(3)(c)(v) should be amended to require a trustee to provide details of each beneficiary and any nominee for a beneficiary. • Proposed section 59B(3)(d) requires that a trustee of a discretionary trust provide sufficient information in respect of a class of beneficiaries “for the Commissioner to determine, when a distribution is made under the trust or when rights apparently vested under the trust are exercised, whether a person is a member of the class”. The reference to “rights apparently vested” is unnecessary. The term “distribution” is defined in section HC 14(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 such that a trustee makes a distribution “when the trustee transfers value to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust”. The reference to “a distribution” in proposed section 59B(3)(d) is therefore sufficient to encompass all circumstances when a beneficiary benefits from a trust. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 210 Issue: Use of term “resident trustee” Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The bill uses the term “resident trustees” of a foreign trust. The Tax Administration Act 1994 and current section 59B uses the term “resident foreign trustee” which is defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For clarity and to ensure that there is no difference in the application of the recordkeeping obligations under section 22 and the obligation to register and disclose information under proposed sections 59B to 59D, clause 10 should be amended to use the existing defined term “resident foreign trustee”. (Russell McVeagh) Clause 10 contains a number of references to “resident trustee” (as does the heading to clause 5). Th is term is not defined. However, the term “resident foreign trustee” is already defined by section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This defined term should replace references in clause 10 to “resident trustee”, and the reference to “trustee” in proposed section 59B(3). (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials consider that this should be referred to drafters for consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 211 MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Registration and filing fees inclusive of GST Submission Currently the legislation is silent on whether the registration and annual filing fees are inclusive or exclusive of GST. Officials consider that the proposed registration fee of $270 and the annual filing fee of $50 will be inclusive of GST and that this should be made explicit in legis lat ion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Information sharing with the Overseas Investment Office Submission It is possible that for some trusts that meet the foreign trust definition (that is, they have a New Zealand trustee and a foreign settlor) may intend to invest in New Zealand assets. Officials consider that Inland Revenue should be able to disclose information about a foreign trust where requested by the Overseas Investment Office (OIO), for the purposes of approving investment in sensitive New Zealand assets by overseas investors. This will allow the OIO to utilise relevant information when considering applications from overseas people who intend to invest in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 212 213 Business transformation-related matters 214 215 ADMINISTRATION OF LATE PAYMENT PENALTY RULES – SUPPORT FOR THE AMENDMENT Clauses 112 and 113 Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The submitters support the amendment, and consider it to be a reasonable and pragmatic approach to take while Inland Revenue is operating tax types out of two software platforms. Comment Officials note the submitters’ support for the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 216 AMENDING THE RULES FOR NEW AND INCREASED ASSESSMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONER Clauses 113(1) and (5), 115, 117 and 118 Submissions (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) The proposal should not proceed: • There is concern that it removes the long established grace period for taxpayers to pay tax which allows time for taxpayers to organise payment once the amount of tax was assessed. (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) • The amendments are unlikely to achieve the objectives of reducing taxpayers’ interactions with the tax system and their risk of exposure to penalties and UOMI. (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, KPMG) • The only reason for the proposal seems to be cost savings for Inland Revenue. (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) Comment The changes are designed to preserve the general principle to allow taxpayers time to organise payment in case of a new or increased assessment by the Commissioner. Taxpayers will have at least 30 days from date of the notice to organise payment without incurring late payment penalties or being subject to any collection actions. The proposed amendments will allow the earlier application of any credits or refunds that arise in the timeframe between notice of assessment and the date by which payment of the resulting tax is required. At present a taxpayer has to request any credit or refund to be applied to the tax due. Use-of-money interest on the new or increased assessment applies from the original due date for payment of the tax. A w ider review of the application of penalties including late payment penalties and interest in the future START system is currently being undertaken. This review will cover the setting of a new due date when a new or an increased assessment is issued. Officials see the proposed changes as an interim measure until we have reported to the Government on the outcome of this review. In addition officials believe, contrary to the submitters’ views, that taxpayers affected by the change will benefit from the proposal. This is because taxpayers affected by the relevant provisions are incurring UOMI from the date after the original due date and an early resolution or reduction of the assessed tax will reduce the exposure to UOMI. Officials therefore consider the proposal should proceed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 217 USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST AND TRANSFERS OF TAX Clauses 106, 119 and 120 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (KPMG, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitters support the proposal to limit transfers of tax to earlier periods for transfers within a taxpayer’s accounts or to another taxpayer to the amount in debt and/or in dispute in that period. Submitters are also supportive of the proposal to clarify when a transfer takes effect for GST refunds and GST overpayments. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Limiting other transfers Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to section 173S of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that transfers to earlier periods are limited to the amount in debt and/or in dispute in the requested transfer period for transfers of interest on overpaid tax. Comment The amendments to the transfer rules in the bill did not go far enough as they did not limit transfers of interest on overpaid tax to the amount in debt and/or dispute in the requested transfer period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 218 Issue: Definition of “deferrable tax” Submission (EY) Clauses 119 and 120 of the bill propose amending sections 173L and 173M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to limit the amount that can be transferred to an earlier period to the total of any debt and the taxpayer’s deferrable tax (tax in dispute) in that period at the requested date of the transfer. The definition of “deferrable tax” should be amended to cover tax in dispute more comprehensively, by including tax subject to the Part 4A disputes process and tax for which a potential liability has been identified during an audit or investigation, even though no agreement or assessment has yet arisen and the formal Part 4A disputes process may not yet have started. The definition is currently limited to amounts in relation to which the person makes a competent objection under Part 8 or that the person challenges under Part 8A. The definition of “deferrable tax” in section 138I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should also be reviewed to accommodate potential liabilities identified in IRD audits or investigations and disputes under the Part 4A process. Comment The intention behind allowing a taxpayer to transfer an amount into an earlier period that has tax in dispute is to enable the taxpayer to reduce their liability to penalties and use-of-money interest should the dispute not be resolved in the taxpayer’s favour. O fficials agree that using “deferrable tax” to refer to tax in dispute is too narrow. However, officials consider that the definition proposed by the submitter is too broad as it would allow the taxpayer to transfer tax to a prior period that was under audit or investigation, before the amount of the additional tax payable had been identified. As the additional tax payable would not have been identified, there would be no limit on the amount the taxpayer could transfer. This could give rise to taxpayers receiving more UOMI than otherwise entitled – the issue that this amendment was intended to prevent. In order to ensure the original intention is upheld, officials propose that the taxpayer’s tax in dispute for the purposes of the transfer rules should be lim ited to: • the taxpayer’s deferrable tax for the period; • an amount referenced in a notice of proposed adjustment issued by the taxpayer or the Commissioner for the period; • an amount otherwise agreed with the Commissioner. In relation to amending the definition of “deferrable tax” in section 138I, officials note that the submission would require further analysis and therefore officials will consider the issue’s priority for inclusion on a future tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. 219 MATTERS RAISED BY OFFICIALS Multiple statements and co-existence within START Submission There are current rules within the Tax Administration Act around the issue of statements of account and the cancellation of UOMI when a taxpayer pays the entire amount of tax, penalties and UOMI within 30 days of the issue of the statement. The current configuration of Inland Revenue’s FIRST system has an extremely complex process for tracking the issue of statements and the calculation of UOMI to be cancelled. The current rules often result in a taxpayer paying more interest than is eventually charged to the taxpayer, leaving them with a small over-payment, which must be transferred or refunded. This is due to the statements indicating the UOMI charge to the date of the statement rather than the ultimate charge to the taxpayer. Once all the main tax types are migrated to the new START environment the long-term solution is to move to a monthly billing cycle where UOMI will only be charged to an account at the same date every month. This will eliminate the need for the current 30-day rule. To replicate the process for tracking statements to determine how much UOMI should be cancelled within START would be complex and involve considerable resources for what would be a lim ited 18-month life cycle until all taxes are migrated to the START environment, and the monthly billing cycle is introduced, which removes this issue. A transitional solution is proposed to deal with the issue of multiple statements. This proposal will only affect goods and services tax within the START environment. The solution involves an amendment to section 183C of the Tax Administration Act, which practically, will mean no change for most taxpayers. This amendment will state that when a taxpayer receives a statement, no UOMI will be charged between the date of the statement and the date of payment of all the tax, penalties and UOMI charged on that statement if that date is within 30 days of the issue of the statement. The only time this rule will not apply is when the liability to tax (being underlying tax only excluding penalties) is increased – in which case the 30-day period will reset. Comment We recommend that a clause be inserted in the bill to modify the current rule in section 183C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This rule would provide that when a taxpayer receives a statement, no UOMI will be charged between the date of the statement and the date of payment of the total of that statement, as long as the period between the issue of the statement and payment is 30 days or less or the core tax liability excluding penalties is increased in which case the 30-day period will reset. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 220 Prescribed forms No clause Submission Currently the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can prescribe forms under section 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. There is, however, some concern that this section could be interpreted as requiring that information required under a prescribed form may have to be provided electronically or in writing. This would mean that declarations made under an Inland Revenue Act in a form prescribed by the Commissioner could not be made verbally (either by telephone or in person). With some prescribed forms it is easier for taxpayers and more efficient for Inland Revenue if the information in the form and the declaration made in completing the form is ab le to be provided or made verbally. There are also situations when Inland Revenue may wish to undertake an outbound calling programme to encourage taxpayers to register for different products or services. Again it would be more efficient if the registration could be completed based on the information provided verbally and would make outbound calling operations a more effective means of helping people to get their tax obligations right from the start. Not all information will be permitted to be provided verbally. The proposed amendments will allow the Commissioner to dictate which “forms” can be provided verbally or in writing. A similar issue arises with “approved forms” in the Child Support Act 1991. Officials recommend this also be amended in the same manner. Comment We recommend that a clause be inserted into the bill to modify section 35 of the Tax Administration Action 1994 to clarify that information prescribed in a form can be provided to the Commissioner, in a manner permitted by the Commissioner. We also recommend that a modification be made to the Child Support Act 1991 as this Act uses the term “approved form”. It is also proposed that this Act would be amended to clarify that information required in an “approved form” is allowed to be provided to the Commissioner in a manner permitted by the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 221 Transitional regulations 222 223 Clause 120B OVERVIEW As part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation, changes to legislation and administrative processes will be required in a range of areas, including supporting the upgrade to new technology. Some of these issues will require a prompt regulatory response to avoid the potential for delays to the transformation process. The proposed amendment would enact a regulat ion-making power to resolve any such transitional issues arising during the period of co- existence of two Inland Revenue Department software platforms. Eight submissions were made on the proposed amendment. The submitters were divided over the need for the empowering provision. However, all the submitters raised concerns about the breadth of the scope of the proposed empowering provision. There were six main areas of concern raised by submitters. These were: • whether the proposed regulation-making empowering provision is objectionable under rule of law grounds; • whether the regulation-making power is justified in the circumstances; • whether the general scope of the power is too broad; • whether the empowering provision should be prevented from diminishing a taxpayer’s rights; • whether the empowering provision should be prevented from increasing a liability; and • whether certain parts of the Act should be excluded from the power. All of the submissions are explained in more detail in the report. Issue: Whether the proposed regulation-making empowering provision is objectionable under rule of law grounds Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The transitional override power is a “Henry VIII” clause and is objectionable on rule of law grounds. As a fundamental point, laws including tax laws should not be able to be changed by regulation, even if temporarily. The rule of law is a fundamental plank of New Zealand’s constitutional system, the suggestion in the Regulatory Impact Statement that it is of equal importance to cost efficiencies is of serious concern. This adds to the concern that Inland Revenue has failed to properly weigh the consequences of the transitional override powers. (New Zealand Law Society). Many commentators in New Zealand and in other countries have, over the years, criticised the use of such provisions. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 224 Comment Officials note that rule of law issues can be anticipated to arise if an urgent issue comes up during the transformation process. The question is whether transitional regulations are suitable for addressing the issue or not. Professor John Burrows (QC) described transitional regulation-making powers as a “necessary evil in this modern complex legislative world”, in testimony to the Committee 13 as part of its review of transitional regulation-making powers in November 2012. Professor Burrows also noted that: It is not within the realms of human capability to foresee and provide for every eventuality in advance. There has to be a device for resolving this problem. An amending Act is not usually the answer because it is too slow and cumbersome, and would in any event weigh Parliament down with technical detail – if indeed it ever reached the top of the order paper. So the device most commonly used is to provide in the Act for the making of regulations to solve transitional problems which are not covered by the express transitional provisions in the Act itself. There has to be a device to ensure that unforeseen happenings do not unduly impede an orderly transition from the old to the new. As already stated, regulation empowering provisions are often the most sensible solution. Principle at time has to give way to pragmatism, provided that it is properly controlled pragmatism. Bill Moore (at the time, the Acting Chief Parliamentary Counsel, Parliamentary Counsel Office) in testimony to the Regulations Review Committee noted: I think there has been an increase in the use of powers, ...— I really attribute this to three things. A lot of projects are dependent on successful implementation of new computer projects, and they almost never go to plan. You actually have an enormous rule of law dilemma here, because you can say, well, if something emerges late in the day, sorry the law says this, the computer system says that. And we can’t change the computer system, because it’s easier to change the law than the computer system. So the dilemma is, and this is really from a rule of law perspective: do you say let us use these transitional regulation-making powers, arguably in a questionable way to at least say this is authorised by law until struck down or disallowed, or do you say we do nothing, in reality, and you can say well the rule of law means that we shall follow the law, but because the law is really in practice dictated by the computer it actually means that you’re acting in breach of the law. So there’s an interesting dilemma there about whether in fact, if you don’t deal with these things that arise, whether that is in fact showing less respect for the principle of rule of law, because officials—or whoever Min ister—say: “Well, we can’t do anything about this. It’s sort of administrative. We’ll fix it up with some amendment having retrospective effect later.” These observations, therefore, suggest that a rule of law dilemma arises if an urgent issue comes up during the transformation process whether transitional regulations are used to deal with the issue or not. For example, if retrospective legislation is used it will mean taxpayers have to apply the current law and run the risk the approach will be retrospectively undermined, or they have to ignore the current law and hope that the amendment is enacted as proposed. 13 Regulation-making powers that authorise transitional regulations to override primary legislation (Report of the Regulations Review Committee, I.16J, July 2014). 225 Officials have concluded, taking submissions into account that, appropriately drafted, a regulat ion-making power for the business transformation period can ensure that rule of law concerns are limited. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Whether the regulation-making power is justified in the circumstances Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, KPMG, Russell McVeagh, PwC) Submitters had varying views on whether the regulation-making power is justified in the circumstances. It is questionable whether the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional to justify the use of transitional override provisions in the present case. The use of such clauses is constitutionally unobjectionable when used to deal with unforeseen contingencies arising from the introduction of new legislation, although this is intended more for situations where there was an amalgamation of a large number of statutes rather than rewrites of an existing Act. The use of such clauses cannot be an acceptable substitute for a thorough and proper consideration of potential consequences from an IT upgrade and the use of tailored and appropriate regulations to address those particular potential consequences. The analysis does not appear sufficiently complete or convincing. The power should be removed from the bill, on the basis that the purported rationale for its inclusion did not meet the threshold requirements for creating such powers. Proposing such a provision without providing sufficient justificat ion reflects a lack of appreciation of the seriousness and import of using transitional override powers. (New Zealand Law Society) Although the proposal was well intentioned, it remained to be convinced that the case for its introduction is compelling. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The motives behind the proposal are sound and that, on some occasions, it will be desirable to amend legislation without the need for the normal legislative process. However, there are insufficient taxpayer protections. (Deloitte) It is accepted that in a project the size and scale of Inland Revenue’s business transformation it is difficult to “know what you don’t know”. Although there is significant policy (and private sector) resource devoted to the project, perfect foresight is difficult to achieve. A regulation- making power to allow time for appropriate legislative amendments is necessary. (KPMG ) New Zealanders should be able to expect that Inland Revenue’s new business systems would have been extensively tested prior to implementation (and appropriate contingencies built into the system to allow for any necessary changes after implementation). That said, the transition from the existing system may give rise to issues that require rapid technical amendments to the law. (Russell McVeagh) 226 Permitting primary legislation to be amended by way of regulation risks undermining the rule of law. It would also deviate from the Generic Tax Policy Process. Nevertheless, there is support in princip le for conferring these regulation making-powers for the limited purpose of facilitating the business transformation process, where these powers are subject to sufficient safeguards. (PwC) Comment A general principle is that the use of transitional regulations is justified if there are exceptional circumstances and the regulations are demonstrably essential. 14 Officials consider there is adequate justification for the proposed power while appreciating the seriousness and import of using transitional override powers. Specifically, officials consider the current circumstances satisfy the requirement to be exceptional and are demonstrably essential given the nature and scope of Inland Revenue’s transformation process. Officials note that Inland Revenue’s business transformation process is the largest public sector transformation process ever undertaken and is exceptionally complex. As noted above, Professor Burrows and Bill Moore both noted that transitional regulations are useful in situations involving computer systems changes, given the difficulties with changing computer systems. Given the size of the transformation process it needs to be undertaken in four stages. During each of these stages the rules and processes of a different part of the tax system will be transferred from the old system to the new system. This means that during the entire period of the transformation, there will be different parts of the tax system in different systems. This will significantly increase the likelihood of transitory issues arising (similar to the grace periods issue that is being remedied in the current bill). Coupled with this is the detailed nature of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which increases the likelihood of legislative issues arising. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Whether the nature of the transition supports the introduction of the power Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Professor Burrows’ comments (suggesting that transitional regulations were often used during information system transformations) related to an existing system that needs to be upgraded to meet the requirements of the new law. The present case is somewhat different. Inland Revenue put forward two situations where the transitional override powers may need to be used: • The first situation – providing a bridge between the current process in the old computer system and the correct process in the new computer system – seems to fit within the scope of Professor Burrows’ comments. • The second situation – “when the new computer system offers a more efficient or different process to that currently legislated” – does not. This seems to be a situation where 14 Report of the Committee on Ministers’ Powers 1932, Cmnd 4060 (The Donoughmore Report). 227 potential technological advantage is driving legislative change through delegated legis lat ion. While that may be administratively convenient, it is not an exceptional circumstance nor demonstrably essential. Comment Officials understand the submitter’s concern about technological advantages driving legislative change. Whether this gives rise to an exceptional circumstance will depend on the issue but officials consider the power should only be used in exceptional cases of this nature. Officials also note that Professor Burrows specifically referred to the child support and student loan transformation projects as examples of situations when the computer system affected the need for transitional regulations. Officials consider that the same two situations (noted by Professor Burrows) arose during the implementation of those reforms, and will also arise during the current Inland Revenue transformation. Officials note it will not be appropriate to use transitional regulations to remedy an on-going issue with the new information system, given the regulations temporary nature. Instead, any on- going issues with the new system will need to be remedied by legislative amendment. However, there may be situations when it is appropriate to provide a temporary transitional provision to bridge to the new provision. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Consideration of the specifics of the transition Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Insufficient thought has been given to the specifics of the transition and the types of transitional override powers that are likely to be needed. Stating that it is impossible to anticipate where issues may arise in a transition is not an acceptable substitute for a thorough consideration of what may occur. Comment Inland Revenue is thoroughly considering whether the legislation fully supports the transition and as a result has already identified legislative issues that need to be addressed. These have been identified early enough to be remedied through the normal legislative process. Officials note that three such issues are being remedied in the current bill. We are concerned, however, that despite our best efforts not all issues will be identified sufficiently early. In those limited number of circumstances, an urgent remedy will be needed to provide certainty for taxpayers and to prevent delays to the transformation process (and increased costs). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 228 Issue: Whether the general scope of the power is too broad Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants New Zealand and Australia, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh, KPMG) Regulations to override primary legislation should be drafted in the most specific and limited terms possible. The proposed provision does not meet that principle. The expressed reasons for the provision are in relation to resolving issues between two software platforms. However, the provision does not make any reference to resolving such issues, or even to the software platforms. If the provision is needed, it should be expressly limited to resolving issues arising from the transition between software platforms. (New Zealand Law Society) As currently drafted the empowering provision effectively provides the Minister of Revenue (on the advice of officials) with an almost unfettered regulation-making power to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 where he considers it “necessary or desirable” to do so “for the orderly implementation of the business transformation process”. Overriding the normal legislat ive process in relation to an Act with such broad application and extensive powers raises serious questions of principle. Should a transitional empowering provision be enacted, its scope needs to be much narrower than currently drafted. The scope should be limited to regulations that are necessary (or critical) to enable compliance with, or the administration of, the substantive legislation that Inland Revenue administers (the Inland Revenue Acts). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposal is too broad, allowing substantive changes to be made to the law without the checks and balances of the standard legislative process. (Chapman Tripp) New Zealanders should be able to expect that the relevant systems deployed in the course of Inland Revenue’s business transformation will have been thoroughly tested prior to implementation (and appropriate contingencies built into the system to allow for any necessary changes after implementation). The proposal should be more targeted, and should contain safeguards to protect against taxpayers’ substantive rights under the Tax Administration Act 1994 being adversely affected by regulation. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) A clearer articulation of the rationale for the regulation-making is required. The touchstone should be that the power may be exercised only where, as a result of business transformation, it is necessary to amend the Tax Administration Act to administer one or more of the Inland Revenue Acts and where the amendment is not inconsistent with the purposes of the primary legis lat ion. (Russell McVeagh) The regulation-making power is unfettered, and so taxpayers’ rights might be abrogated. This is compounded by the fact that the object is indirectly described, as there is no definition of “business transformation process”. The submitter accepted that the power was not intended to affect substantive rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, but the border between administrative and core provisions is not clear. Focusing on what the regulations are intended to cover and on what the business transformation process is should assist in a better description of the key issue. (K PMG) 229 Comment Officials agree that the regulation-making power was intended to be lim ited to resolving issues arising from the transition between FIRST and START. Officials agree that the purpose could be clarified in the provision to better describe this transitional process and thus to lim it its scope. Officials note that submitters also raised some specific proposals to limit the scope of the empowering provision. The specific proposals are discussed in the issues below. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and recommend that the provision be specifically limited to resolving issues arising from the transition between FIRST and START. Issue: Whether the empowering provision should be prevented from diminishing taxpayers’ rights Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Deloitte, Chapman Tripp) The empowering provision should not allow a regulation that alters a right of a taxpayer to dispute or to challenge a tax liability or decision of the Commissioner, or the application of the statutory time bar. (New Zealand Law Society) The empowering provision should not be able to remove or diminish the rights of any taxpayer under Part 4A (Disputes Procedures), Part 5 (Determinations), Part 5A (Binding Rulings), Part 8 (Objections), Part 8A (Challenges), Part 11 (Remission, Relief and Refunds). (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Regulations made under the regulation-making power should only be made if the effect is taxpayer favourable. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Parts 4A, 8 and 8A provide taxpayers with rights of challenge to the Commissioner’s decision. It imposes time obligations on taxpayers and the Commissioner. It would be inappropriate for the regulations to waive requirements on the Commissioner to do certain things within a certain time to the detriment of taxpayers. This limitation is not obvious on the face of the proposed section. This may be achieved by a wide limitation which prevents a regulation from increasing taxpayer liabilities or abrogating taxpayer rights. (K PMG) There should be a safeguard in the rules preventing the Governor-General from making regulations that detrimentally affect taxpayers. This safeguard would reflect Parliament’s intention to make the business transformation programme work, without penalising taxpayers. (Chapman Tripp) Comment Officials agree that the proposed regulation-making power should not be able to remove or diminish the rights of any taxpayer under Part 4A (Disputes Procedures), Part 5 (Determinations), Part 5A (Binding Rulings), Part 8 (Objections), Part 8A (Challenges), or Part 230 11 (Remission, Relief and Refunds). The requirement that any proposed regulations would have to be consistent with the current policy was intended to prevent any amendments that would diminish taxpayers’ rights. However, given the apparent lack of clarity as to whether this was achieved, officials recommend that the drafting be amended to expressly provide this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and recommend that the empowering provision should specifically provide that it is not able to remove or diminish the rights of any taxpayer under the relevant parts. Issue: Whether the empowering provision should be prevented from increasing a liability Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The empowering provision should not allow a regulation that has the effect of imposing or increasing a liability for tax, use-of-money interest or penalties not already imposed under the primary legis lat ion. (New Zealand Law Society) There should be a safeguard in the rules preventing the Governor-General from making regulations that detrimentally affect taxpayers. This safeguard would reflect Parliament’s intention to make the business transformation programme work, without penalising taxpayers. (Chapman Tripp) No transitional regulations should result in a taxpayer being subject to any liability exceeding the taxpayer's liability under this Act if no regulation were made under the proposed provision. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Regulations made under the regulation-making power should only be made if the effect is taxpayer favourable. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that that the empowering provision should not result in a taxpayer being subject to any liability exceeding the taxpayer’s liability under this Act if no regulation had been made under the proposed provision. Officials recommend amendments to ensure this is the case. Officials note this would significantly reduce the ability of the power to remedy transitional issues and would increase the likelihood that urgent taxpayer-unfriendly issues would need to be remedied by legislation passed under urgency or with retrospective effect. Using retrospective amendments to remedy such issues may arguably be less consistent with the rule of law, as noted by Bill Moore (at the time, the Acting Chief Parliamentary Counsel, Parliamentary Counsel Office) in testimony to the Regulations Review Committee. Officials note, however, that ensuring that the regulations could not increase a taxpayer’s liability will balance taxpayers’ concerns with the need to deal with any urgent issues that may arise. 231 Recommendation That the submission be accepted and recommend the empowering provision be amended so that it cannot result in a taxpayer being subject to any liability exceeding the taxpayer’s liability under this Act if no regulation had been made under the proposed provision. Issue: Whether certain parts of the Act should be excluded from the power Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Russell McVeagh) If the regulation-making power is to be enacted its application should be limited to certain Parts of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A number of Parts / Subparts of the Act should be excluded from the scope of the regulation-making power either because they provide critical protections for taxpayers and / or should not create the IT system transitional issues that the regulat ion-making power is intended to address. The regulations made under the power should only affect the provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that relate to the reporting, payment and collection of tax. By way of example, Part 3 of the Act includes sections which prescribe and restrict the Commissioner’s rights to access premises, remove and copy documents and require the provision of information from a taxpayer. These rules are long- established and fundamental to the integrity of the tax administration system. Amending them in any way by a regulation would compromise the integrity of New Zealand’s tax system. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Various provisions of the Act should be protected from amendment by regulation. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The provision should exclude from its scope various provisions of the Act, being provisions that set out the fundamental rights of a taxpayer and obligations of the Commissioner. Given the significance of these provisions, any amendment should be a matter for Parliament, and not for the Executive by Order in Council. Further, it is difficu lt to imagine issues aris ing from the business transformation process ever requiring rapid amendment provisions. (Russell McVeagh) The power should not allow a regulation that alters Part 2 of the Act (which contains the care and management provisions in sections 6 and 6A), or any of the provisions relating to the Commissioner’s information gathering rights, privilege and non-disclosure in sections 16 – 21 (inclusive), or Parts 4 (Secrecy), 5 (Determinations) and 5A (Binding Rulings). (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that certain parts of the Act will not be affected by the IT system changes. Additionally, given that the relevant administrative rules and processes are not dependent on automation it is very unlikely that there will be an urgent need to fix any issues in respect of the provisions. As a result, officials agree that the following provisions can be excluded from the scope of the provision: 232 • the care and management provisions in sections 6 and 6A; • the information provisions in sections 16 to 21; • the secrecy provisions in Part 4; • a shortfall penalty under sections 141 to 141K; • a criminal penalty under sections 143 to 148. Officials think that it would be appropriate to include within the scope of the empowering some provisions within Part 9. The relevant provisions relate to the penalties that are imposed automatically, and exclude those relating to shortfall penalties and criminal penalties. The use of the regulation-making power for penalties that are imposed automatically would, however, only be appropriate in conjunction with the recommended requirement that there can be no increased liability for taxpayers under the empowering provision. In other words, the empowering provision should only be able to amend the application of the relevant penalties when it would maintain or decrease the amount of the penalty. Officials consider it might be appropriate to have the ability to deal with any issues that may arise with the transition of the penalties that are automatically imposed (that do not result in an increase in liability for a taxpayer). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Whether the “necessary or desirable” standard is appropriate Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The empowering provision should require any regulations to be “necessary” for the implementation of business transformation, rather than “necessary or desirable”. (New Zealand Law Society) The phrase “or desirable” should be removed. The phrase “or desirable” suggests changes that are not necessary but might be “nice to have”. The sole determining factor for application of the regulat ion-making power should be what is necessary for the orderly implementation of the business transformation process. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment The use of the phrase “necessary or desirable” is consistent with numerous previous transitional regulat ion-making provisions. Examples of when the phrase has been used in previous transitional provisions include the Child Support Amendment Act 2013, Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, Local Government (Auckland Transitional Provisions) Act 2010, Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, and the Financial Advisers Act 2008. There are advantages in having a consistent form of words, as differences in words can lead to arguments that the words have differences in substance. However, officials also accept that the use of boilerplate provisions is not always appropriate. 233 Officials note that submitters have concerns with the use of the phrase in the current context. Officials accept that the phrase could be misinterpreted, so agree that it is more appropriate to require any regulations to be “necessary” for the business transformation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and recommend removing the reference to “desirable”. Issue: Consultation for empowering provision Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Russell McVeagh, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The consultation relating to the introduction of the regulat ion-making power has been inadequate. A transitional override power is a matter of great concern, and should be given full consideration, including proper public consultation. It should not be introduced through supplementary order paper. (New Zealand Law Society) The regulation-making power should have been subject to the normal public consultation process under the first stage of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) w ith a proposal based on the outcome of that consultation then included in the bill. Including a proposal of such importance in a Supplementary Order Paper is inappropriate. The submitters believe that the lack of consultation on the proposal and the inclusion of it in the bill by Supplementary Order Paper mean that there has been limited opportunity for it to be properly thought through and that it is being implemented in haste. The opportunity should have been taken to consult on the issue and the options to address it prior to the bill’s introduction. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Any amendments to the Supplementary Order Paper should be further publicly consulted. Consultation was undertaken within government but no public or private consultation was undertaken. Any amendments to the Supplementary Order Paper would normally only be apparent when the bill is reported back by the Select Committee. Given the potentially wide application of this provision, the Select Committee should invite further submissions on any proposed amendments to the Supplementary Order Paper. (K PMG) A more meaningful opportunity should have been allowed for consultation on this proposal. It was submitted that officials should consult further with interested parties on the drafting. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials accept that the usual Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) was not followed in developing this policy. Consultation was undertaken with the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC), Crown Law, the Ministry of Justice and the Treasury. This consultation resulted in the clarification in the scope of the empowering provision. No wider consultation was undertaken on the proposal because of time constraints. The time constraints resulted from the need to have the proposal enacted as soon as possible given the benefits of the transitional regulation-making 234 provision and the timing of the transformation process. Officials acknowledge that the lack of wider consultation raised the risk that potential problems with the proposals had not been fully identified. Officials agree that the proposal could benefit from further consultation with interested parties on the drafting. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and recommend that submitters be consulted on the drafting of the proposed empowering provision. Issue: Consultation on the regulations Submission (New Zealand Law Society, PwC, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The consultative process for making the regulations should be a meaningful one, as it is a procedural check to ensure that the power is used appropriately. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The level of consultation for any exemptions or regulations made under the provision should be more clearly defined and meaningful, given the potential impact of exemptions and regulations. (New Zealand Law Society) The bill should prescribe the following minimum standards for the consultative process in relation to a proposed regulation, before a Minister may recommend that regulation to the Governor General: • consultation with the New Zealand Law Society and Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (or successor bodies); • a minimum four-week period of public consultation; and • a report from officials as to the outcome of consultations including: - a summary of submissions received; - indications as to the extent to which submissions are adopted; and - reasons for declining submissions not adopted. (PwC) The consultation process for the introduction of regulations should state with whom the Minister is required to consult before making a regulation, as is required under section 21C(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Specifically, it was submitted that the Minister of Revenue should have to consult with professional accounting and legal bodies that the Minister decides it is reasonable to consult with. This amendment to the section will make the decision-making process more robust and alleviate some of the perceived risks associated with legislative change by regulation. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) 235 Comment Officials agree that the consultation process for the regulations will be important because it is a procedural check to ensure that the power is used appropriately. Officials also agree that the consultation process should be defined in the provision to give affected parties reassurance that their interests will be properly considered. Officials consider given the remedial nature of the proposed power, and the fact that it is recommended to amend the power so it could not increase a liability or diminish taxpayer rights, there should not be a minimum period of consultation. Instead, officials recommend the period of consultation should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Whether regulations should be subject to Parliamentary confirmation Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The empowering provision has a sunset clause with a life of more than three years. The Regulations Review Committee has expressed a number of principles that ought to be followed concerning time limits on transitional override provisions including that regu lat ions made pursuant to such a provision should be subject to parliamentary confirmation. Comment Officials note that no previous transitional regulation-making provisions have been subject to parliamentary confirmation despite having sunset periods longer than three years or no expiry dates. We note that Professor Burrows in testimony to the Regulations Review Committee described the confirmation process as cumbersome and as probably going beyond what is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether the time limit on the empowering provision is appropriate Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The empowering provision expires on 31 December 2021, which is over the three-year lifespan suggested under the Regulations Review Committee guidelines. The presumed reason is that this is when the entire transition process should be completed. However, it is not clear why it is 236 expected that there would still be issues between the two pieces of software (FIRST and STAR T) right up until the last day of the proposed transition. Comment Officials consider there may be transitional issues until the last processes and rules are transferred over to the new system. There may be administrative processes that need to be carried on in both IT systems until then. As a result, officials consider that 31 December 2021 is the most appropriate sunset date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether the time limit for the transitional regulations is appropriate Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) While regulations made under the provision would have a sunset period of three years, the princip le is that the three-year timeframe is an upper limit, not an aim. It is not clear that consideration has been given to whether the three-year period is necessary or appropriate in this case. (New Zealand Law Society) The timeframe for repealing regulations made under the empowering provision should be reduced from three years to two years. A two-year deadline for repealing any regulations should give sufficient time for any underlying substantive IT system transitional issues to “self-resolve” or be addressed through the normal legislative process, should that be required. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Officials agree that the three-year period should be the maximum recommended timeframe for transitional regulations, rather than the default period. Officials consider this is consistent with the current drafting of the provision which allows regulations to have a sunset period of up to three years. Consideration was given to whether a shorter sunset period would be workable. However, the three-year period was considered appropriate given the complex nature of the transformation and the fact that the different parts of the tax functions will be in different systems for some time. This supports having a three-year sunset period for transitional regulations. Officials will need to consider the appropriate sunset period for any specific regulations keeping in mind that the three-year period is the maximum and not the default period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 237 Issue: Whether substantive issues should be dealt with by legislative amendment Submission (Chapman Tripp) If there are substantive issues arising from the business transformation programme, these should be dealt with under the standard legislative process. Comment Officials note that the empowering provision is limited to amendments that are consistent with the existing policy and contains other limitations both currently in the bill and from the recommendations in this report. This means substantive issues, that involve a change in policy, would have to be dealt with under the standard legislative process. As a result, officials consider no amendments to the empowering provision are needed in respect of the submission. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Whether the empowering provision suggests that the IT system will dictate policy changes Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) The regulation-making power should not be used as a means of avoiding costs that would otherwise need to be incurred to customise Inland Revenue’s new software. The regu lat ion- making power should not be used as a cost-saving measure to avoid customising of the START system. If the current law is not able to be translated into the new system without customisation the full Parliamentary process should be followed. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) A major aspect of the problem definition underlying the proposal is a concern that the complexities associated with the business transformation process may give rise to situations in which the relevant IT system has not resulted, or will not result in, the tax system being administered according to law. Th is in itself is cause for concern, as it suggests that regulations may be used to validate a systems-driven outcome that is otherwise inconsistent with the legislation as set down by Parliament. That is, the IT system would dictate what the law should be, not the other way around. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposal may promote a “systems-driven” approach to the administration of the tax system. That is, if regulations can be used to validate a “systems-driven” outcome that is otherwise inconsistent with the legislation as set down by Parliament, the regulation-making power could be used to amend the law to validate what the systems says. The system should reflect what the law says. (Russell McVeagh) 238 Comment Determining what the best policy approach is to any issue includes determining the administrative costs for Inland Revenue as well as the range of other standard policy considerations. As a result, officials consider that one of the factors that will continue to be relevant in determining the best approach to a tax issue will be the IT costs of setting up the solution, and the on-going IT administrative costs. If the issue is merely transitory then the temporary IT costs may be a significant element in determining the best approach to take to the issue. For on-going issues in the new system, the initial IT costs will be less significant in relative terms. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Whether the changes to the care and management provision should be given priority Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Inland Revenue’s review of the care and management provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the role of subordinate legislation in the tax system should be given priority. The Commissioner’s care and management provisions are being reviewed as part of a broader project on the Tax Administration Act 1994. That review is likely to consider the merits of increased use of administrative solutions to resolve smaller and narrower tax administration issues. The review should address the balance required between the need for pragmatic and quick solutions on the one hand and the need for ministerial and parliamentary oversight of any substantive changes on the other. A wider conversation about the role of subordinate legislation in a tax context needs to be part of this workstream. The bill already includes a number of regulation and determination powers (in Part 1). It also proposes changes which could be usefully used as test cases for determining the boundary between legislation and subordinate legislation. Comment Inland Revenue has published an interpretation statement concerning the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities taking into account the New Zealand legislative provisions and the approach of the New Zealand courts. 15 The statement views the “care and management” responsibility as two interrelated responsibilities. First, the Commissioner is charged with the “care of the taxes”. Secondly, the Commissioner is charged with the “management of the taxes”. This means that she is responsible for making managerial decisions in the interests of bringing about the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. This involves the 15 Interpretation statement “Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010). 239 Commissioner exercising judgement in how she carries out her duties and the relative resource she allocates to Inland Revenue’s functions. Importantly, the Commissioner’s view is that she can manage and allocate resources but cannot deliberately act contrary to her view of the correct interpretation of the law. Some important implications of this are that the Commissioner cannot: • disregard the requirements for the lawful exercise of powers and discretions conferred by other provisions; • alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements; • issue extra-statutory concessions; • administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies; • interpret provisions other than in accordance with statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions; or • act inconsistently with the obligation to use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue is currently reviewing the care and management provision as part of the policy stream of work related to its business transformation process. The review is considering whether to provide the Commissioner with a power to remedy minor or transitory legislative anomalies in limited situations. The proposed extension would not be limited to tax administration issues and is not limited to transitory issues during the business transformation process but would apply generally on an on-going basis. Given the broader nature of the proposed extension to the care and management provision, it is considered appropriate to consult widely on that proposal. This issue is expected to be included in a discussion document on the Tax Administration Act which will be released in the near future. The role of subordinate legislation in the tax administration system is also being reviewed in the same discussion document. As a result, officials consider neither option is an appropriate substitute for the transitional regulations in the current proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether there should be a searchable database of any transitional regulations Submission (Deloitte) It is inevitable that some provisions will be suspended or amended under the proposed power. This is likely to result in increased compliance costs faced by taxpayers and their advisors because they may be unable to look up the Act to determine the current law. To minimise these 240 compliance costs, there will need to be a searchable database of regulations created by Inland Revenue under this proposed power. Comment Officials consider if the proposed empowering provision is enacted it is likely to be used sparingly. From 2001–2014, only 14 regulations were made under six of 25 Acts containing transitional provisions. This suggests that the powers are not used very often. Officials consider it is likely that the current power (if enacted) would similarly be used sparingly (especially if the recommended changes in this report are adopted). Any regulations made under the power will be Orders in Council and so will be published on the New Zealand Legislation website. They would also be published on Inland Revenue’s policy website. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether any regulations made should be referred to the Regulations Review Committee Submission (KPMG ) The regulations are subject to Parliamentary scrutiny and revocation if found to be invalid. This is important protection for taxpayers. However, the regulations made are likely to be time crit ical. They will likely apply within a short time of being issued as well as lasting only for a short time. Judicial review and other protections for taxpayers are unlikely to be of practical use to aggrieved taxpayers. The section should therefore require immediate reference to the Regulations Review Committee for early review. Comment Follow ing d iscussions with staff from the Regulat ions Review Committee, officials th ink it would be contrary to commonly established practice to legislate for a Parliamentary process, such as legislating that all regulations would need to be referred to the Regulations Review Committee for early review. Officials note that the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines do not suggest such an approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 241 Issue: Whether a case study should be published to illustrate the intended effect Submission (KPMG ) The Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) and other documents proceed on the basis that the potential regulations are unknown. However, in the “grace period” rules, the bill already contains an example of a business transformation issue against which the regulation-making power can be tested. If the regulat ion-making power was already in place, potentially, this issue could have been dealt with by regulation. A published case study on this (whether a regulation would have been made, why or why not, its detail) would provide comfort on the intended effect and application of the power. Comment Officials agree that under the proposal the grace periods issue could have been dealt with by a transitional regulation if there had not been sufficient time to remedy it by legislative amendment. The details of the issue are set out in the Commentary to this bill. In short, the current tax rules impose a late payment penalty if a taxpayer does not pay on time. If, however, the taxpayer has punctually paid all relevant taxes due in the two years before the default in question, the Commissioner must first issue a notice to the taxpayer specifying a further date for payment of the unpaid tax, before a late payment penalty can be imposed. This gives the taxpayer a grace period in which to pay the amount owing before late payment penalties are imposed. Application of the late payment penalty grace period is determined on the basis of the taxpayer’s previous compliance in terms of the payment of tax across all relevant tax types (such as GST, income tax and PAYE deductions). The transition from Inland Revenue’s FIRST to START system will be done on a tax-type basis, in four stages, with GST being transferred in early 2017 and income tax, FBT and PAYE scheduled to be transferred in 2018. This raises an issue in relation to the late payment penalty grace period, as the current legislative framework for the application of the penalty requires the Commissioner to consider the taxpayer’s compliance history across all applicable tax types. As information relating to the taxpayer’s tax compliance history and payment activity will reside in two software systems, it will be difficult for the Commissioner to look across all applicable tax types to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to a grace period without significant manual intervention. A proposed amendment in the current bill will enable the Commissioner to look only at tax information about a taxpayer’s compliance history held in the system from which the tax type in payment default is being administered. Inland Revenue identified the issue in time to remedy it by legislative amendment, so there was no need to remedy it by regulation. If hypothetically there had been insufficient time to remedy the issue by legislative amendment then there could have been a regulation to provide a similar remedy (but one that would be limited to up to three years). The details of the regulation are likely to have been similar to the proposed amendment in the current bill. Under the recommended proposal, before any regulation could be made to remedy the hypothetical issue, consultation would need to have been undertaken with appropriate accounting and legal bodies 242 including providing a copy of the proposed regulations. Any regulations made under the proposal would be subject to disallowance. Officials will consider a suitable example to include in the Tax Information Bulletin on the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 243 RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF EMPOWERING PROVISION Clause 120B Submission (Matter raised by officials) Following their formal submission to the Committee, the New Zealand Law Society raised concerns with officials about whether the empowering provision should be prevented from having retrospective application. The Society noted that if the power could not increase a liability under the Act or remove or diminish a right under the relevant parts, then any issues that had a retrospective aspect to them could be remedied by the Commissioner’s care and management powers. Specifically, the Society believed that the Commissioner could acknowledge that the system had operated in a more favourable way but, in order to maintain the integrity of the tax system, and taxpayers' perceptions of that integrity, in circumstances where (but for the transition) she was satisfied with the operation of the system, she would not collect the additional amounts, and would move to introduce correcting legislation at the earliest opportunity. The Society’s concerns were that allowing the power to apply retrospectively would undermine the rule of law. Comment Officials agree that the empowering provision should be prevented from having retrospective application. However, officials accept that a possible implication of preventing the empowering provision from applying retrospectively, would be that it would not provide certainty to taxpayers in some situations. Officials agree that in a situation when the system had operated in a more favourable way than legis lated for, the Commissioner could decide not to allocate resources to determining which specific taxpayers had benefited from the favourable treatment in past periods. Officials consider deciding not to allocate resources would be within the scope of the care and management power. 16 However, Inland Revenue’s view is that the care and management power does not allow the Commissioner to administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies, or issue extra statutory concessions. This means the Commissioner would have to apply the law correctly going forward. This would mean that either resources would have to be committed to altering FIRST or the law would have to be changed to deal with the transitional issue (that is, until the concessional treatment could be remedied under START). If the transitional regulation could not apply retrospectively, there would be situations when it would not provide certainty for taxpayers. In other words, without a regulation, taxpayers would not be sure the favourable treatment would not be reversed. For example, as the Commissioner cannot administratively remedy legislative errors, if a taxpayer was under audit and its assessment was subsequently amended, the Commissioner would have to apply the law correctly (which would result in the favourable treatment being reversed). 16 Interpretation Statement IS 10/07: Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 244 Taxpayers could see this as unfair as they would be disadvantaged compared with other taxpayers with similar discrepancies that were discovered earlier (that is, before the favourable treatment was discovered). However, officials agree that on balance the risk to the rule of law outweighs the possible disadvantages to taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the empowering provision be prevented from applying retrospectively. 245 Student loan interest exemption 246 247 SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER NO. 229 TO EXTEND THE STUDENT LOAN INTEREST EXEMPTION FOR STUDY OVERSEAS TO RECIPIENTS OF NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT-FUNDED SCHOLARSHIPS Clauses 121AA and 122 Submission (Matter raised by officials) As part of the International Connections for New Zealanders Budget 2016 package, Government proposed a number of policy changes which, together, would encourage more New Zealand citizens and New Zealand permanent residents to study outside New Zealand as part of their New Zealand qualification. The package included increased funding for the Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia and the establishment of the Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Latin America. However, it is inconsistent for the Government to provide funding for overseas study while requiring the recipients of that funding to pay interest on their student loans and make repayments based on their loan balance rather than their ability to pay. Comment Student loans are interest-free for New Zealand-based borrowers. In addition, student loans remain interest-free for borrowers who go overseas for 183 consecutive days or less and who have lived in New Zealand for at least 183 days before leaving. Further, the exemption from interest is extended to borrowers who go overseas principally to study full-time for longer than six months provided they meet specific criteria. However, those criteria limit the interest exemptions to full-time study at Level 7 or above on the New Zealand Qualifications Framework, whereas the purpose of the Prime Minister’s Scholarships and other government- funded scholarships is broader than academic scholarship (e.g. they aim to identify the scholar’s potential to build connections that can be later used in the person’s career, not just academic scholarship). Furthermore, Government scholarships may be targeted to students studying or undertaking internships at lower levels of study. Excluding the scholarship recipients from the interest exemption is inconsistent with the policy objectives of providing consistency and clarity across funding policy settings and developing new international connections and capabilities for New Zealanders. The proposed amendments to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (the Act) in the Supplementary Order Paper would extend interest-free student loans to recipients of New Zealand Government-funded scholarships, including the Prime Minister’s Scholarships to Asia and Latin America. The scholarship recipients may be studying full-time or undertaking an internship that is full-time or part-t ime w ith study. The proposed amendment to section 25 of the Act adds two new situations in which the Commissioner may treat borrowers as being physically in New Zealand (and eligible for interest-free student loans). The proposed amendments to Schedule 1 of the Act set out the conditions that must be satisfied by borrowers who apply under the new provisions in section 25: • The conditions for overseas study are that the borrower must receive a qualifying government-funded scholarship for the study and undertake the study overseas on a full- time basis. 248 • The conditions for overseas internships are that the borrower must receive a qualifying government-funded scholarship for the internship and undertake the internship overseas on a full-time basis, or a part-t ime basis if combined with study. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 249 Miscellaneous matters 250 251 TIMEFRAME FOR SUBMISSIONS No clause Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) It would be preferable if more time was provided for submitters to consider the amendments to this bill, particularly given the bill has fundamental changes to the way taxes are paid that impact many taxpayers. A shorter consultation runs the risk that issues with this legislation may not be picked up or not be given sufficient attention given the limitations on submitters’ resources to achieve this within the imposed timeframe. Comment The bill contains amendments to business tax that apply from 1 April 2017 as well as amendments to implement the G20/OECD standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters that applies from 1 July 2017. It is important that the bill is enacted in time for taxpayers to implement these changes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 252 LAND REMEDIALS – RLWT AND BRIGHT-LINE Clause 92 Issue: Amending the definition of “offshore RLWT person” for limited partnerships and look-through companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) The recently introduced residential land withholding tax regime is intended to apply to certain disposals of residential land when the land is disposed of by an “offshore RLWT person”. The definition of “offshore RLWT person” is critical to the operation of the regime. The definition refers to limited partnerships and look-through companies. For limited partnerships, the RLWT rules are intended to apply at the partnership level for limited partnerships given their separate legal status, despite their look-through status for tax purposes. This separate legal status results in the residential land being registered in the name of the limited partnership. Consequently it is the limited partnership that disposes of the residential land which means the limited partnership will be liable for any RLWT. The same issue arises for look-through companies; the RLWT rules are intended to apply at the company level given a look-through company’s separate legal status, despite their look-through status for tax purposes. The current definition of “offshore RLWT person” requires clarification to ensure that the definition applies at the limited partnership level (rather than the partner level which is the case for ordinary partnerships) and at the company level for look-through companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 102B Issue: Certificate of exemption requirements Submission (Matter raised by officials) RLWT does not apply when the vendor who is disposing of the residential land holds a certificate of exemption for RLWT that relates to the land that is being disposed. A certificate of exemption may be issued to a vendor who is in the business of developing land, dividing land into lots or erecting buildings, if the vendor meets certain criteria. One of these requirements is that the vendor needs to have complied with their tax obligations in the two years before they apply for the certificate of exemption. Meeting this requirement is difficult for entities that have been specifically set up for a particular development. These special purpose entities are often 253 limited partnerships or companies and are often associated with other taxpayers who would be able to meet this requirement. To help newly formed entities meet this requirement, it is recommended that the certificate of exemption requirement in section 54E(3) be amended to allow another taxpayer closely associated with the newly formed entity to meet the two-year good compliance history requirement on behalf of the newly formed entity. This amendment would only apply to partners in a limited partnership and members of a wholly owned group of companies because of their close connection with the newly formed entity. This matter was also raised by submitters during submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Comment The certificate of exemption for RLWT rules is an important part of the RLWT regime for property developers, sub-dividers of land and builders who would otherwise be liable for RLWT on residential land disposals. The recommended remedial will assist with the issuing of these certificates to newly formed entities. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 91B Issue: Relationship property – RLWT Submission (Matter raised by officials) Relationship property may be transferred from one partner in a relationship to another following the breakdown of a relationship. Relationship property will often include residential property. It was not intended that these residential property transfers would be subject to any RLWT liability because the transfer results from a relationship property agreement rather than a disposal of residential property to another party. An amendment is required to ensure that these types of transfers are not caught under the RLWT rules. It is noted though that any subsequent disposal of the relationship property may be subject to RLWT under the ordinary rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 254 Clause 91D Issue: RLWT calculation – GST Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section RL 4 sets out how to calculate RLWT but does not state whether or not RLWT calculations are done net of GST. The policy intent is that RLWT is calculated net of GST on the basis that income and deductions are net of GST for income tax purposes. Therefore it is recommended that this point be clarified in section RL 4. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 91C Issue: Technical amendment to RLWT rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section RL 2 sets out when vendors must pay RLWT and how that payment is made. The section includes references to the defined term “residential land purchase amount” which is the amount that triggers a RLWT liability. A remedial amendment is required to fix a drafting oversight in section RL 2(6) and (8) where the word “amount” was omitted from the term “residential land purchase amount”. Further, the heading to section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires a remedial amendment to ensure the section heading accurately describes the purpose of the section. It is recommended that the title of the section is changed to “Information in relation to RLWT” to reflect that the section sets out the information requirements for determining whether RLWT applies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 255 Issue: Change of trustees – bright-line test Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bright-line test in section CB 6A is intended to apply to disposals of residential land where the land was owned for less than two years. The bright-line test was intended to supplement the existing land rules by targeting short-term speculation in the residential housing market. The bright-line test applied to disposals of interests in land when the interest was acquired on or after 1 October 2015. For the purposes of the bright-line test, section CB 6A(1) sets out what date the two-year bright- line period begins from. Generally this period will start from when the instrument to transfer the residential land is registered. When a trust owns land and there is a change to the trustees, a new instrument is registered to reflect the change of trustee event. This change of trustee affects the timing of the bright-line period because it is linked to the date of transfer and the registration of the new instrument reflecting the change of trustees. It was not intended that these types of transfers would trigger the application of the bright-line test because the trust property has not been disposed of to another party. An amendment is proposed to ensure that a change of trustee does not trigger the application of the bright-line test in section CB 6A. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 55B and 55C Issue: Technical amendment – application for date for section CB 15B(3) Submission (Matter raised by officials) A remedial amendment is required to fix a drafting oversight in relation to the application date of the recently enacted amendments to section CB 15B(3). The amendment relates to determining the date land is acquired when it is acquired through the exercise of an option. It is intended that the amendment apply from the date of enactment of the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Act 2016. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 256 AGENCY PROVISIONS – UNINTENDED LEGISLATIVE CHANGE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section HD 3 contains an unintended legislative change arising from the rewrite of Income Tax legislation. This should be corrected. Comment The agency rules in subpart HD apply to a person declared to be an agent for income tax purposes on behalf of a principal who is not present in, or who is a non-resident of, New Zealand. Some of the agency rules relate solely to business activity and some relate to non- business activity, such as income earned from passive investment by absentee non-resident insurers. The rewrite of the agency rules into the Income Tax Act 2007 inadvertently restricted all of the agency rules to business situations. This has resulted in an inability to collect income tax from agents when a business activity does not exist. Some taxpayers have relied on the existing law in taking tax positions prior to this proposed amendment. Therefore, officials recommend the unintended legislative change be corrected on a prospective basis, from date of enactment of the bill. This would protect tax positions already taken. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 257
