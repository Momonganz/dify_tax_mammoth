Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 and Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015
==========================================================================

2015 legislation containing changes to the tax rules around property including new information requirements in the property investment sector.

The Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill introduced on 22 June 2015 contained changes to help Inland Revenue enforce the tax rules around property. The changes are part of a package of measures announced by the Government in Budget 2015, to strengthen the rules around the taxation of property.

The bill received its first reading on 25 June and its second reading on 8 September. On 9 September, at the committee of the whole House stage, the bill was divided into two bills, the Tax Administration Amendment Bill and the Land Transfer Amendment Bill. Both bills received their third reading on 10 September.

The resulting Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 received Royal assent on 22 September 2015.

The new Acts amend the Land Transfer Act 1952, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Land Transfer (Computer Registers and Electronic Lodgement) Amendment Act 2002.

### New information requirements to improve tax compliance in the property investment sector

_Sections 2AA, 156A, 156B, 156C, 156D, 156E, 156F, 156FA, 156G, 156H, 156I, 164B, 236, and schedule 1AA of the Land Transfer Act 1952; section 23 of the Land Transfer (Computer Registers and Electronic Lodgement) Amendment Act 2002; sections 3, 24BA, and 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

New measures in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 require transferors and transferees of land to provide certain tax information, including a New Zealand IRD number, when land is transferred unless an exemption applies to them.

The changes also require "offshore persons", as defined, to provide a New Zealand bank account number when they apply for an IRD number.

The changes came into force on 1 October 2015.

#### Background

The Income Tax Act 2007 contains provisions that impose income tax on certain property transactions, and also on rental or other income earned from property.

These rules include provisions that tax gains from property bought with the intention of disposal, and others that tax land acquired for the purposes of dealing in land. Enforcing the tax rules on non-residents can be difficult, especially those with only limited engagement with New Zealand.

In order to investigate compliance with the income tax legislation relating to property transactions, Inland Revenue has the ability to access records of land transfers in New Zealand. To date, this process has been historic, rather than in real-time. Information received may also not have given a complete picture of the activities or identity of a particular taxpayer.

To deal with these concerns, the Government announced a package of measures as part of Budget 2015 aimed at providing clearer rules for property investors, more useful information to Inland Revenue to help enforce the rules, and increased funding to investigate property compliance.

Accordingly, the following two measures came into force on 1 October 2015:

*   Information will be required to be supplied to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) upon transfer of property as part of the usual land transfer process. In particular, persons transferring any property (other than New Zealand individuals transferring their main home) must provide:
    *   their New Zealand IRD number; and
    *   their tax identification number from their home country if they are currently tax-resident overseas.
*   To ensure that New Zealand's full anti-money laundering rules apply to non-residents before they buy a property, offshore persons must have a New Zealand bank account before they can get a New Zealand IRD number.

#### Key features

Transferors (such as people who are selling their property) and transferees (such as people buying a property) of property must provide the following information:

*   whether the land has a home on it;
*   whether the person or a member of their immediate family is a New Zealand citizen or visa-holder;
*   if the person is a transferee and they or their immediate family has a work or student visa, whether they intend living on the land.

The following tax information must also be provided unless an exemption (such as the main home exemption) applies:

*   the person's IRD number;
*   if the person is a tax resident in another jurisdiction at the time of transfer, the name of that jurisdiction and the equivalent of an IRD number (the "tax identification number", or TIN) from that foreign jurisdiction.

A person who is not an "offshore person" as defined, and who is purchasing a property with the intention of that property becoming their main home, or selling a property that was their main home, will not have to supply the tax information. The main home information exemption is not available when the person is an "offshore person", when the property is to be or was owned by a trust, or if the person is selling their main home for the third time in a two-year period.

This information will be provided to LINZ as part of the transfer documentation and then passed on to Inland Revenue to help compliance with New Zealand's tax legislation. It could also be provided to overseas tax authorities by Inland Revenue in accordance with existing information-sharing legislation.

Aggregate data that does not identify any person may also be used for the purposes of housing policy.

An "offshore person" (as defined) will also be required to provide evidence of a fully functional New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. This is to ensure that an offshore person seeking to obtain an IRD number has first complied with New Zealand's anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules.

An individual is not an "offshore person" if:

*   they are a New Zealand citizen **and** have been in New Zealand within the past three years; or
*   they hold a New Zealand residency class visa **and** have been in New Zealand within the past 12 months.

All other individuals will be "offshore persons".

A non-individual (such as a partnership, trust or company), in general is an offshore person if it is an entity or arrangement which is:

*   incorporated outside New Zealand; or
*   25 percent or more owned (legal or beneficial) or controlled by an offshore person.

#### Application date

The new rules came into force on 1 October 2015.

However, the new information requirements for transfers of land do not apply for transfers when both the following two conditions are met:

*   the contract for the transfer is entered into before 1 October 2015; and
*   the transfer is registered on or before 1 April 2016.

#### Detailed analysis

All references in this article are to the Land Transfer Act 1952 unless stated otherwise.

#### _Supplying information when transferring land_

##### _Requirement to provide a tax statement_

Section 156B provides that all transferors and transferees of real property who are transferring a "specified estate in land" must provide a "tax statement" before the transfer can be registered. The tax statement must be provided to LINZ, or to a certifier who will provide it to LINZ, in accordance with existing conveyancing processes as specified in section 156B(2) and (3).

The definition of a "specified estate in land" is contained in section 156A, and includes freehold estates, leasehold estates, and certain unit titles and licences to occupy, as well as any other estate in land that is declared to be a specified estate in regulations.

Section 156C states that a tax statement must contain the following:

*   full name, date and signature of the transferor or transferee;
*   whether the land has a home on it;
*   whether the person or a member of their immediate family is a New Zealand citizen or visa-holder;
*   if the person is a transferee and they or their immediate family has a work or student visa, whether they intend living on the land; and
*   either:
    *   the category of exemption that applies (if the transfer is a "non-notifiable transfer" for the person as defined in section 156A(2) and therefore exempt from the requirement to provide tax information);  
        
    *   **or**
    *   the tax information set out in section 156C(2) if the person's transfer is not exempt from the requirement to provide tax information.

##### _Information required for persons for whom transfer is non-notifiable_

Transferees and transferors must provide the information contained in section 156C(2) unless the transaction is a "non-notifiable transfer" as defined in section 156A(2) (and therefore exempt for the purposes of section 156(2)).

The exemptions would only apply to the party identified and not to the transfer as a whole. That means that the tax information will still be required by the other party to the transfer unless the transaction is a non-notifiable transfer for that person also.

In all cases, the non-exempt person must supply their IRD number. This applies regardless of whether they are tax-resident in New Zealand or not. If the person does not currently have an IRD number, they must obtain one from Inland Revenue before they can complete the transfer.

If they are currently a tax resident of another jurisdiction, the person must state the name and country code of that jurisdiction. The list of country codes is available on Inland Revenue's website.

The person must also provide the equivalent of their IRD number in that jurisdiction – that is, the unique identifier that they use in their dealings with the tax authority in that jurisdiction.

In some cases, when a person is a tax resident of more than one jurisdiction, under the law of those jurisdictions (dual resident), a double tax agreement treaty may provide that a person is a tax resident of only one jurisdiction for the purposes of the double tax agreement treaty. In these cases, the person would have to provide their tax identification numbers for both jurisdictions.

##### _Persons acting in different capacities_

When a non-exempt person must supply information about their IRD numbers (and when applicable, their foreign equivalent of an IRD number and relevant country code), section 156C(3) provides that a person who is acting in a different capacity must provide the information as it relates to the capacity in which they are acting.

For example, when trustees of a trust are buying or selling trust property, they must provide the trust's IRD number, not their own personal IRD numbers. Similarly, partners in a partnership who are buying or selling partnership property should provide the partnership's IRD number, not their own IRD numbers. Nominees must provide the IRD number of the person for whom they are acting as nominee.

##### _Exemptions from requirement to provide information_

There are certain exemptions from the requirement to provide information. As noted above, these are "non-notifiable transfers" as defined in section 156A(2).

The first is for individuals who are not "offshore persons" who are transferring their main home.

The second is for particular transfers or parties to transfers that have been specified in regulations to the Act.

Having to supply an IRD number does not necessarily mean that tax must be paid on the sale of property. Conversely, while a person who does not have to provide their information will generally not have to pay New Zealand tax on their gain, in some circumstances they might not.

##### _Main home information exemption_

This exemption is intended for New Zealand individuals who are transferring their main home. This is provided for by section 156A(2)(a)(i) and (ii).

The definition of "main home" contained in the Land Transfer Act 1952 is very similar to the definition of "main home" contained in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill, introduced on 24 August 2015. The policy intent was for the definitions to be broadly consistent with each other.

For the main home exemption to apply for a transferee, the land must be intended to be used predominantly for a dwelling that will be the transferee's main home.

For the main home exemption to apply for a transferor, the land must have been used predominantly, for most of the time the transferor owned the land, as a dwelling that was the transferor's main home.

The owner must intend to reside (or have resided) in the property as their main home. Accordingly, the exemption will not apply when only a family member will use or has used the property as their main home (and not the owner themselves).

Section 156A(2)(b) provides that the information exemption is not available when any one of the following applies:

*   the person is an "offshore person";
*   the property is to be owned via a trust (in the case of a transferee);
*   the property was owned via a trust (in the case of a transferor); or
*   for the sale of a property, when the main home exemption has been used twice or more in the past two years immediately preceding the date of transfer.

_Transferor must have used the land for "most of the time" as their main home_

In the case of a transferor, the land must have been used for most of the time that the person owns the land as their main home. This requires the property to have been used more than 50 percent of the time as their main home for the period the person owns the land.

The land does not need to have been used without interruption as their main home. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while the owner is on vacation or prior to settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the time is less than the private residential use.

_Mixed-use properties_

When a property is used as both a main home and for other commercial, investment or farming purposes, the main home information exemption will be available if most of the land is used for the home. When less than 50 percent of the property is used for the main home of the person, the main home exception will not apply.

For example, when the person's home is on a farm that is being run for profit, it is unlikely that the main home information exemption will apply because most of the land is used for commercial farming. However, if the home is on a small lifestyle block, it is likely that the main home information exemption will apply as the land is mostly used for the person's home.

When a property is used for commercial premises (for example, a shop below a house), the main home information exemption will apply if most of the premises are being used for the person's home. If most of the property is being used for the shop, the main home information exemption will not apply.

In some circumstances this may require an estimation to determine the area of land used for their private residential purposes and the area of land used for other purposes. For example, when a single property has been used by the owner partly as a residential home and partly as a rental property, the relative areas will need to be determined. For transferors, a taxpayer will have determined the relative areas in working out the tax deductions (insurance and rates, for example) that can be claimed. The determination of the areas includes any land used for the relevant purposes (for example, a backyard for the home).

Another mixed-use situation can arise when a property is being used partly as a home for the transferor or transferee, and partly as rental accommodation for other people. For example, a person owning a two-bedroom house who has one flatmate could potentially use the main home exemption, as they are likely to be using the majority of the house as their main home. However, a person who owns and lives in a boarding house with eight rooms cannot claim the main home exemption because the property is not used predominantly as their main home.

_Multiple homes_

If a person resides in multiple homes, only one of those properties can be their main home.

When a person has more than one place of residence, their "main home" would be determined according to which property the person has the greatest connection with. The factors that determine these connections would include:

*   the time the person occupies the dwelling;
*   where their immediate family (if any) live;
*   where their social ties are strongest;
*   the person's use of the dwelling;
*   the person's employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and
*   whether the person's personal property is in the dwelling.

The greatest connection factors are similar to those used to determine if a person has a permanent place of abode under current case law. Therefore, existing guidance on the "permanent place of abode" test should assist in determining which property the person has the greatest connection with.

_Time at which test is applied_

The time that the test should be applied is at the date of transfer. Occasionally this will mean that a person can use the main home information exemption for two properties sold at the same time.

An example is when a person purchases a house intending to live in it and then moves into a new home while trying to sell the original home.

The ownership overlap of the properties will not mean the original home fails to satisfy the requirements to be a main home for the previous period. If the two properties were sold at the same time, the owner will be able to use the main home exception for the purchase and sale of the original house, and also for the purchase and sale of the second property (if each transaction satisfied the requirements to be a main home at the date of transfer).

#### Example: Main home exception for multiple properties

![Main home exemption for multiple properties](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/c/fcdbd134-d121-41c0-b07b-e13464da904e/multiple-property-home-exemption-diagram.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203146&hash=52B31868A6E63B54F5E6B8B62145BD4E "Main home exemption for multiple properties")

The main home exception is available for both properties. Property 1 was the main home for the majority of the time that person owned Property 1. Property 2 was the main home for the entire time it was owned (October to December 2016).

_Different co-owners can have different main homes_

The test applies for each transferor or transferee. This means that different co-owners can have different main homes. For example, a person living in one city could potentially have a different main home from their spouse living in another city.

_Offshore persons_

Section 156A(2)(b)(iv) will provide that the main home exemption is not available to "offshore persons" (defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

This means that the main home exemption will be available to a person only if one of the following applies:

*   they are a New Zealand citizen or permanent visa holder who is currently present in New Zealand; or
*   they are a New Zealand citizen who is not currently present in New Zealand but they have been away from New Zealand for less than three years; or
*   they are a permanent resident visa holder who is not currently present in New Zealand but they have been away from New Zealand for less than one year.

All other persons who are transferring a property must supply their IRD number, and if they are a current tax resident of another country, their equivalent of an IRD number and the country code of the other country.

_Trusts_

If the property being transferred was or will be trust property, section 156A(2)(b)(i) and (ii) provides that the main home information exception cannot be used. This means that the trustees of a trust will need to provide the trust's IRD number (and foreign equivalent of an IRD number and country code, if applicable) when transferring trust property.

_Persons selling their main home a third time within two years_

Section 156A(2)(b)(iii) provides that a person who has transferred their main home at least twice in the past two years must provide their IRD number (and foreign equivalent of an IRD number and country code, if applicable) if they transfer their main home a third time within that two-year period. This is to address the situation where a person has a regular pattern of buying and selling a property in which they live, for profit. The person may be taxable under existing law on gains from the sale of these properties. Collecting information in relation to those who have sold their home for the third time within two years is intended to help Inland Revenue identify those situations.

#### Examples of main home information exemption

##### Example 1: Main home

George buys his first home in Seymour Street in 2016. However, his neighbours complain about the noise when he plays his drum kit, so he decides to sell it and buy a new home with better soundproofing. When he puts his Seymour Street house on the market he is pleasantly surprised to discover that his house has risen in value. He has an offer accepted on a new house in Taradale Street. George does not need to provide his IRD number for the sale of the Seymour Street property, which he lived in as his main home, or the purchase of the Taradale Street property, which is to be his main home.

##### Example 2: Holiday home

Lisa rents an apartment in Wellington, where she lives with her son. The apartment is close to her office from which she runs her consulting business fulltime. She is a member of a local tramping club and is on the Board of Trustees of her son's school in central Wellington.

She owns a house on Lake Taupo with views over the lake. She does not let the Lake Taupo property out when she is not using it. She spends four weeks with her son in this property here over Christmas and New Year, and also uses the property for about five weekends during the ski season.

When Lisa sells the Lake Taupo property, she cannot use the main home exemption because it is not the property with which she has the greatest connection, taking into account the factors listed above under the section "Multiple homes".

##### Example 3: Two properties

Mr and Mrs Brown and their children live in a house on a small lifestyle block in Oamaru. Mrs Brown works in Christchurch for three days a week, and works from the Oamaru house two days a week while her husband looks after the children fulltime. Mrs Brown plans to buy an apartment in Christchurch city. She will live in that apartment while she works in Christchurch.

Taking into account the fact that the majority of Mrs Brown's time is spent at the Oamaru house, and her family is located at the Oamaru house, the main home information exemption will not apply in relation to Mrs Brown's Christchurch apartment as it is not the home with which she has the greatest connection, and she will have to supply her IRD number in relation to the purchase of that property.

However, if Mr and Mrs Brown were to sell their Oamaru property, they would not need to provide their IRD numbers in relation to that sale because that property was their main home.

##### Example 4: Offshore person

Sarah is a New Zealand citizen who has been living in the United Kingdom (UK) for the past 10 years. Before returning to New Zealand, she decides to buy a house in Te Awamutu to live in. As she is an "offshore person" at the time she purchases the house, she cannot use the main home information exemption for this property and she will need to supply her IRD number in relation to the purchase of that property. Because she is a tax resident of the UK at the time that she purchases the property, she will also need to supply her UK National Insurance number (which is the equivalent to a New Zealand IRD number), and the UK country code.

##### Example 5: Investment property

Tom and Barbara are selling their property, which they used as their main home, to Jerry and Margo, who are buying it to use as an investment property.

The transfer is a non-notifiable transfer for Tom and Barbara. They are both New Zealand citizens and have been present in New Zealand within the last three years, and are selling their main home.

However, the transfer is not a non-notifiable transfer for Jerry and Margo. Jerry and Margo live in the UK but are New Zealand citizens, and have visited New Zealand within the last three years. However, they are not buying their main home. They must therefore supply the tax information required under section 156C(2).

Jerry and Margo must supply their New Zealand IRD numbers. Because they are both tax residents of the UK, they must also supply their UK National Insurance numbers.

Jerry is also a tax resident of France under France's domestic tax laws because he owns a holiday home there. He therefore also needs to provide his French tax identification number. (Although there is a double tax treaty between France and the UK, and that double tax treaty provides that Jerry is a resident of the UK only, he still needs to provide both his French tax identification number and his UK National Insurance number.)

##### Example 6: Multiple dwellings

Tom buys an apartment block on a single title. He lives in one of the apartments as his main home and rents out the remaining six apartments. Tom sells the apartment block to a third party. Tom will have to provide his IRD number on the sale of the apartment block because the land (contained on the single title) was not used predominantly as his main home. The majority of the land was used as rental property.

##### Example 7: Lifestyle block

Paul purchases a two hectare block of former farmland and builds a house on it. Paul lives in the house as his main home with his family. The remaining land is used by the family to keep some family horses to ride and to run a handful of sheep to keep the grass down. The main home exception will apply and Paul will not need to supply his IRD number when he purchases or sells the land.

##### Example 8: Mixed use - apartment attached to factory

Melissa intends to purchase a large factory with a small apartment attached. Melissa intends to live in the apartment as her main home. Melissa must supply her IRD number at the time she acquires the property because she does not intend to use the land predominately as her main home.

##### Example 9: Mixed use - country store and house

Judy owns a country store that has living quarters attached. She lives in the living quarters and runs a retail business from the front half of the property. She estimates that the retail business uses 45 percent of the property and claims expenses (for example, insurance and rates) on that basis against the retail income. Judy sells the property. She does not need to provide her IRD number because she has used the property predominantly (55 percent) as her main home during the time she has owned the property.

##### Example 10: Mixed use - purchase of fish and chip shop

Brandon intends to buy a fish and chip shop with an attached dwelling. Brandon will need to determine the total area of the different parts of the property to determine whether he intends to use the property predominantly for his main home, and so whether he needs to supply his IRD number as part of the purchase. (Brandon will need to make an estimation of the total area in the future in any event to determine the deductions that can be claimed against his retail income.) Brandon estimates that he will use the property (building and surrounding land) 60 percent for the fish and chip shop. He will, therefore, need to provide his IRD number on purchase of the property.

##### Example 11: Purchase of lifestyle block (change in use)

Amy and Chris decide to move from the city to the country. They buy a 15 acre (six hectare) block. They intend to purchase some livestock to keep the grass down and the freezer full.

At the time of acquisition, they would not need to supply their IRD number as the main home exemption would apply.

After three years, the couple decide to supplement their income by leasing out all but one of the paddocks for horse grazing. As a result, the area that they use for their own purposes does not exceed the area of the leased paddocks. They continue to lease out most of the paddocks for horse grazing for the next five years, at which point they decide to sell the property.

When they sell the property, the main home exemption will not apply to them because the majority of the land was not used for their main home for the majority of the time that they owned it.

##### _Information exemptions (non-notifiable transfers) under regulations_

Sections 156A(2)(iii) and 236(l)(ha)(ii) provide that particular types of transfers or parties to transfers can be "non-notifiable" transfers under regulations to the Act. In these cases the IRD number, and where applicable, a tax identification number and country code are not required.

In order for a type of transfer, or party to a transfer, to be specified in regulations, section 236(4) provides that the Minister for Land Information must be satisfied that the type of transfer or party to a transfer meets the following criteria:

*   collecting this information would be impractical or involve high compliance costs; or
*   the transfer would represent a low tax avoidance risk.

The exemptions would only apply to the party identified and not to the transfer as a whole. That means that the tax information will still be required by the other party in the transfer unless the transaction is a non-notifiable transaction for them too.

Cabinet has approved regulations that will exempt transfers in the following situations.

_Mortgagee sales_

Where a transfer is the result of a mortgagee sale, a rating sale under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002, a court-ordered or statute-ordered sale, the transferor does not need to provide an IRD number. This is because the transferor in this circumstance is the mortgagee or creditor and there is a low risk of tax avoidance in this context.

_Transfers from executors_

In the case of death, the executors of the person's estate are exempted from the requirement to provide an IRD number. The rationale for this exemption is that estate sales will not be taxed under the proposed bright-line test, and requiring all executors to get an IRD number would also add compliance costs in a situation when there is no choice about the vehicle used for transferring property.

_Public and local authorities_

Tax-exempt public authorities and tax-exempt local authorities, as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, would not need to provide an IRD number when transferring land. This definition includes departments and departmental agencies and local authorities but not wider Crown Entities or Council Controlled Organisations. It will include any land held by the Crown. As they are tax-exempt there is no need for tax information.

##### _Offence to supply misleading or false tax information_

Section 156E provides that a person who knowingly, or with intent to deceive, gives false or misleading tax information, commits an offence. A person who commits such an offence is liable to a fine of up to $25,000 if the conviction is a first-time offence, and a fine of up to $50,000 for every subsequent offence.

A person who provides information that they genuinely believe to be true but which is not in fact correct will not be committing an offence.

##### _Correction of errors or omissions_

Section 156D provides a procedure for an omission or error that was contained in a tax statement provided to LINZ to be corrected. Such omissions or errors do not affect the validity of any registration of transfer instrument.

##### _Information disclosure and retention_

Section 156H provides that tax information must not be disclosed unless authorised or required by law.

Section 156F requires LINZ to supply Inland Revenue with the tax information and the details of the related property transaction that it collects. Section 156I of the Land Transfer Act and section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permit tax information to be disclosed between authorised persons in specified circumstances, which is intended to allow for information matching between Inland Revenue and LINZ in relation to the information collected by LINZ.

Section 156F also permits the chief executive of LINZ to release or to give tax information to any person who requests it, provided that the information is given in aggregate form only and in a manner that prevents any person, estate in land, or transaction from being identified.

Under section 156G, certifiers and LINZ must hold tax statements for 10 years. A copy of a statement must be provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue if requested in writing.

##### _Regulations providing for exemption from requirement to provide tax statement_

As noted above, section 156B provides that all transferors and transferees of real property must provide a tax statement before the transfer can be registered.

Section 236(1)(ha)(i) provides for regulations to be made to exempt certain types of transactions from the requirement to complete a tax statement if it would be impractical or involve high compliance costs, or when there is a low risk of tax avoidance.

Cabinet has approved regulations to exempt transfers of Māori Land as defined by Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (Māori customary land and Māori freehold land) for practicality reasons. There are often many owners and contacting them all is difficult, if not impossible. Cabinet has approved regulations to exempt transferees from the requirement to complete a tax statement where the transfer is a part of the Treaty settlement process. Again, in many cases it would be impractical to collect information from owners.

Except in the case of Māori land, the exemptions would only apply to the party identified and not to the transfer as a whole. That means that a tax statement will still be required by the other party in the transfer unless they too are exempted by regulation.

##### _Regulations providing for other estates in land to be covered by the tax information requirement_

Regulations will be able to be made to include transfers of other estates in land to be covered by the tax information requirement, where these are economically equivalent (see section 236(l)(hb)). No such regulations are currently under consideration.

#### _New Zealand bank account requirement_

Section 24BA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner must not allocate a tax file number (commonly known as an IRD number) to an offshore person unless she first receives a bank account number for that person.

The main features of the rule are:

*   the definition of "offshore person"; and
*   the definition of "bank account number".

##### _Offshore person_

The definition of "offshore person" applies both to individuals and non-individuals (for example, trusts and companies).

For individuals, a New Zealand citizen or person that holds a residence-class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009 will generally not be classed as an offshore person unless:

*   in the case of citizens, they have not been in New Zealand within the last three years; and
*   in the case of residents, they have not been in New Zealand within the past 12 months.

A non-individual will be an "offshore person" if they would be an overseas person under section 7(2)(b) to (e) of the Overseas Investment Act 2005 (modified to include the test for individuals described above). This test looks through structures that are New Zealand tax-resident and looks at their underlying ownership or control. The test is necessary to prevent offshore individuals avoiding the rule by interposing a New Zealand-resident structure.

Generally speaking this means a non-individual will be treated as being "offshore" if:

*   It is a body corporate (such as a company) and:
    *   it is incorporated outside New Zealand; or
    *   25 percent or more of its shares are owned by a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand; or
    *   an offshore person has (or offshore persons have):
        *   25 percent or more of any class of securities;
        *   the power to control the composition of 25 percent or more of its governing body; or
        *   the right to exercise or control 25 percent or more of the voting power.
*   It is a partnership or other unincorporated body of persons (other than a trust) and:
    *   25 percent or more of its partners or members are offshore persons; or
    *   an offshore person has (or offshore persons have) a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the profits or assets (including on winding up); or
    *   an offshore person has (or offshore persons have) the right to exercise or control the exercise of 25 percent or more of the voting power at a meeting.
*   It is a trust and an offshore person (or offshore persons):
    *   constitute 25 percent or more of its governing body; or
    *   has or have a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the trust property; or
    *   are 25 percent or more of those that have the right to amend or control the amendment of the trust deed; or
    *   are 25 percent or more of those having the right to control the composition of the trust's governing body.
*   It is a unit trust and an offshore person (or offshore persons) and:
    *   is or are the manager or trustee, or both; or
    *   has or have a beneficial interest in, or entitlement to, 25 percent or more of the trust property.

#### _Bank account number_

A "bank account number" is an identifying number of an account at either a "registered bank", as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989,[1](#1)
 or a "licensed non-bank deposit taker", as defined in the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013. The Reserve Bank publishes lists of both types of entity on its website.

The bank account must be one for which customer due diligence (under the anti-money laundering rules) has been completed. This is to ensure that the relevant identity checks have actually been performed on the person applying for the IRD number. The account must be a current account (a person cannot use the details of a closed account).

The account number submitted to the Commissioner must be an account held by the IRD number applicant.

The bank account requirement applies only in instances when a person has applied for an IRD number. This is so that the current practice of the Commissioner allocating IRD numbers as an administrative matter in some cases will continue.

#### _Becoming an offshore person_

Section 24BA(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is intended to prevent the bank account requirement being circumvented by, for example, a New Zealand company being established, obtaining an IRD number and then being sold to an offshore person. The proposed section requires a person to give their bank account number to the Commissioner immediately upon becoming an "offshore person". However, this requirement to provide a bank account number at this later time applies only to non-individuals. This means that, for example, a New Zealand citizen who emigrates will not be obliged to provide a bank account number after being away for three years.

A person who has already provided a current bank account number to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue does not need to do so again if they become an "offshore person".

#### _Penalties for non-compliance_

No new penalties are included as part of these amendments. If an offshore person does not provide a bank account number they will not be issued an IRD number. Existing penalties may apply in certain instances, such as for the requirement to provide a bank account number upon becoming an offshore person. In such cases, failing to provide information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when required to do so by a tax law is an offence under sections 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

1 This definition is already contained in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and so is incorporated in the Tax Administration Act through the operation of section 3(2) of that Act.

Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014
====================================================

2014 Order in Council covering standards of financial reporting for companies, including 'look-through companies'.

From 1 April 2014, companies including "look-through companies" that do not prepare financial reports to a higher authoritative accounting standard will be required under section 21B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to prepare financial reports to a minimum standard as set out in the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 unless otherwise exempted from doing so.

#### Application date

The new regulation applies for income years commencing 1 April 2014 and later, with a deferral for the disclosures connected with associated persons' transactions to the 2015 tax year.

#### Background

The start of the Financial Reporting Act 2013 on 1 April 2014 removed for a large number of companies the obligation to prepare general purpose financial reports.

When decisions were made by the Government to reform the financial reporting regulatory framework for companies, it was also decided that these companies should continue to prepare financial reports for tax purposes, but to a lesser and minimum special-purpose level (special-purpose financial reports). For medium-sized companies that previously complied with the general-purpose financial reporting requirements, significant compliance cost savings are anticipated.

The Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 and sets a framework so that by way of Orders in Council, the minimum financial requirements can be specified for companies and other taxpayers (when specified). A fuller description about the legislative changes made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 can be found in the commentary on the new legislation in this _Tax Information Bulletin_.

#### Overview of the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014

**_Application of the minimum requirements to companies and look-through companies_**

All companies including look-through companies, except those expressly exempted, will be required to prepare special-purpose financial reports to a level specified by the regulation. The circumstances when companies are not required to prepare financial reports are discussed below.

"Company" is defined as having the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which includes bodies corporate and other entities that have a legal existence separate from that of their members. This includes subsidiaries of companies that prepare general-purpose consolidated financial reports.

The regulation also provides that the minimum requirements also apply to "look-through companies" as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, unless they are otherwise exempt because the look-through company is inactive or its activities are small-scale. Look-through companies that prepare financial reports using a higher authoritative accounting standard are also exempted from preparing special-purpose reports.

**_Companies exempted from preparing financial reports_**

Section 21B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 removes the obligation to prepare special purpose reports if the company prepares financial statements to a higher authoritative accounting standard or is required to prepare according to a standard specified by another enactment, for example - companies that are subject to the Companies Act 1993 or Charities Act 2005.

In addition, recognising the costs connected with preparing financial reports, the regulation also exempts:

*   companies, that are not part of a group of companies, whose activities are small-scale (both income and expenditure do not exceed $30,000 during an income year); and
*   companies that are non-active companies.

The term "non-active companies" is defined by reference to section 43A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. An election under section 43A removes the obligation to file a return of income for certain companies when, for example, the company has derived no income or deemed income and has no deductions. An explanation of the non-active company rules can be found in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995), page 28.

_Definitions_

For the most part, the definitions used in the regulation are defined in the context of the Inland Revenue Acts. An exception applies to terms used to describe accounting principles - clause 4(2) refers - and includes:

*   accrual accounting
*   assets
*   double-entry
*   expenditure
*   historical cost
*   income
*   intangible property
*   liabilities
*   net assets.

The terms above are to be defined according to their accounting context.

**_Minimum requirements_**

Clause 8 and the Schedule to the regulation prescribe the minimum requirements for preparing financial statements. The minimum requirements are directed at the preparation of special-purpose financial statements. The requirements are, for the most part, principles based, although some disclosures and valuation methods are specified. The new regulation sets out the following minimum requirements for preparing financial reports under the headings:

*   _Form of the financial reports_ - Companies are required to prepare a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement.
*   _Principles with which statements must comply_ - Financial reports must be prepared using double-entry accrual accounting concepts.
*   _Valuation_ - Disclosed values should generally be based on tax values (values that comply with the Inland Revenue Acts). In most instances this will correspond with historical cost, but not always. Historical cost or market values can be used if this is more appropriate. For example, entertainment expenses should be recorded using historical cost, with the add-back detailed in the book-to-tax reconciliation. The valuation method used should be included in the accounting policies disclosure.
*   _Statement of accounting policies_ - A description of the policies used by the company in preparing the financial reports must be included.
*   _Matters the statements must show_ - Comparatives are required, but in years that special-purpose financial reports are first adopted they need not be restated, so long as resulting movements in shareholders' funds are disclosed.
*   _How matters must be shown_ - Amounts showing interest and dividends received must be grossed up for RWT and dividends should be grossed up for imputation credits, to the extent the dividend is taxable and the imputation credits can be used. However, the imputation credit gross-up can be disclosed in the book-to-tax reconciliation if the preparer of the financial reports prefers.
*   _Schedule_ - The schedule to the regulation sets out the matters that must be disclosed. Clause 1 prescribes matters that must be shown for income years starting from 1 April 2014. Clause 2 prescribes additional information for certain transactions with certain associated persons and applies to tax years starting from 1 April 2015. These clauses are discussed in more detail below.

**_The schedule_**

Clause 1 specifies, under three headings, a number of disclosures:

*   The first heading deals with reconciliations and fixed or depreciable assets - where a difference arises between a company's accounting profit and taxable income for an income year, a reconciliation of the two figures is required. Companies are also required to prepare a detailed tax schedule of fixed assets and depreciable property.
*   The second heading deals with disclosures specific to certain taxpayers. The regulation specifies particular disclosures for companies involved in forestry (the tax-carrying cost of timber) or that deal with livestock (class by class details of sales, purchases and on-hand).
*   The third heading requires the financial reports to show items on forms prescribed under section 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is a reference in the IR 10 prescribed form. However, any reconciliation from the IR 10 back to the financial reports will be undertaken by Inland Revenue in the first instance. This is because it is accepted that good detailed financial reporting may be prepared on a divisional basis and this practice may mean that the financial report does not directly reconcile with the disclosures in the IR 10. A good example of this is a dairy farm's financial reports which are likely to have a milk account, cattle account and sundry income, all of which will have components of "gross income".

Clause 2 applies to tax years from 1 April 2015 and deals with matters connected with certain associated persons' transactions, within the meaning of the term "associated person" in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Clause 2(3)(a) requires matters connected with transactions with non-companies (for example, individuals and trusts) and non-resident companies to be disclosed if the transaction relates to:

*   interest expense incurred in respect of any loan;
*   amounts paid in the nature of outbound loans or other advances;
*   expenses incurred for services, including wages and salaries, management fees and other payment for services;
*   expenses incurred in respect of rentals or leases of land and other assets;
*   expenses incurred to acquire or use intangible property including royalty payments.

Clause 2(3)(b) also requires a reconciliation of any movements in shareholders' equity and loans or other advances to (and from) the company's shareholders or other owners and persons associated with the company.

#### Relationship with authoritative financial reporting standards and other frameworks

The Income Tax Act 2007 makes reference in a number of places to financial reporting standards (New Zealand International Accounting Standards) when determining values for income, expenditure or loss. Examples of this include research and development expenditure and the financial arrangement rules. Preparers of financial reports may choose to use higher quality reporting standards for segments of their financial reports when appropriate so long as Inland Revenue's minimum requirements are disclosed. Also, preparers are free to use frameworks that have more detailed disclosures, such as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants' (NZICA) special-purpose framework, which is in the process of being finalised. It is anticipated that compliance with NZICA's special-purpose framework will also mean compliance with minimum requirements set out in the regulation.

Tax advisor's statutory non-disclosure right narrower than legal professional privilege
=======================================================================================

2008 case note – Protection afforded by s 20 B of the Tax Administration Act is narrower than legal professional privilege, list of clients' names is not protected.

Case

Iain Wilson Blakeley v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Sections 17, 17A and 20B - G of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The protection afforded by section 20 B is much more confined than legal professional privilege. A list of clients' names is not protected thereby.

### Facts

In the course of an investigation a taxpayer gave the Commissioner four tax opinions prepared by the plaintiff, a chartered accountant. The Commissioner considered that the "lease prepayment arrangements"and "lease assignment arrangements"referred to in the opinions were tax avoidance arrangements.

In an attempt to identify other taxpayers that had entered into similar arrangements the Commissioner issued a section 17 notice to the plaintiff requiring him to provide the names and IRD numbers of persons that he had provided advice to for similar arrangements.

The plaintiff declined to comply with the notice arguing that, as the Commissioner already had the content of the advice, the plaintiff would unavoidably be providing the content of the advice to his clients in breach of their non-disclosure right contained in section 20B of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) if he provided the information sought. He asserted further that it was in any event impossible to provide the information sought.

The Commissioner successfully applied to the District Court for an order that the information sought was not a classified document for the purposes of section 20B and for an order requiring production of the information in terms of section 17A. The District Court found that there had in any event been a waiver of the non-disclosure right.

The plaintiff appealed that decision.

### Decision

The plaintiff relied on the principle, accepted in cases involving legal professional privilege, that a client's identity would be protected if disclosure risked revealing confidential communications. The Commissioner argued that the statutory non-disclosure right was not the same as legal professional privilege and that the information sought was not protected on a plain reading of the words of the section.

Rodney Hansen J, accepting the Commissioner's argument, held that the protection afforded by section 20B was much more confined than legal professional privilege. It was a limited statutory right and there was no reason why it should be construed as if it were an extension to legal professional privilege. In accordance with the established principles of statutory interpretation, words should bear their plain and ordinary meaning but with reference to the context in which they appear and to the purpose of the legislation. _CIR v Alcan New Zealand Limited_ \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439 (CA) followed.

Dismissing the appeal the Court held that the statutory protection was not available as the names and IRD numbers were not tax advice documents for the purposes of section 20B.

Although it did not affect the outcome of the case his Honour overturned the finding of waiver by the District Court. He held that waiver did not arise under sections 20B - G as the right to non-disclosure did not arise automatically but must should be claimed following the detailed procedure set out in section 20D.

Finally, the fact that the plaintiff asserted that compliance with section 17 was impossible was no bar to the relief claimed. The practical difficulties of complying with the section 17 notice did not render the exercise of the power unlawful.

Te tūnga māngai tāke Tax agent status
=====================================

If you are a tax agent or intermediary, you play an important role in administering the tax system.

Our relationship with you is very important. The advice and assistance you give your clients will significantly influence their tax compliance.

Because of this we, and the New Zealand public, trust you to uphold the integrity of the tax system.

As an approved tax agent, you are expected to deal with our staff in a respectful and professional manner. If you do not, we may take that into consideration in determining whether you pose a risk to the integrity of the tax system.

Declining a tax agent application or removing an existing agent from the tax agent list
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may decline an application from someone wanting to be a tax agent, or remove an existing agent from the tax agent list if we think that person poses a risk to the integrity of the tax system. This includes the listed tax agent or key office holder. 

Some of the issues we may consider include (but are not limited to):

*   criminal offending
*   dishonest behaviour
*   failure to comply with personal tax obligations
*   breaching client confidentiality
*   serious or repeated performance issues.

We will work with you to sort out any issues affecting your ability to be a tax agent, but we can decide to refuse registration or remove your agent status if we consider you pose a risk.  Any steps we take will follow the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Examples of issues we may consider
----------------------------------

Example: personal tax obligations

Mikaere has been a tax agent for 15 years and has always provided an excellent service to her clients.

After breaking up with her partner, and as part of the division of relationship property, she bought her ex-partner’s share in their family home. This has placed tremendous financial pressure on her. Mikaere has an overdue income tax debt.

At a recent catch-up, her account manager asked about the debt. Mikaere explains her circumstances and that she cannot pay the debt immediately but understands the importance of meeting her tax obligations, especially as a tax agent.

Mikaere applies for an instalment arrangement to pay the debt off over time. She follows the instalment arrangement, and it is expected that the debt will be paid off within the agreed timeframe.

We take any risk to the integrity of the tax system seriously.

The non-payment of tax by tax agents themselves is a risk. However, we do not consider that she poses enough of a risk to justify removing her as an agent. This is because Mikaere has taken steps to pay off her debt, including meeting the instalment arrangement.

Example: dishonest behaviour

John applies to be a tax agent after resigning from his role in an accounting firm 6 months ago. We find out that he is being investigated for dishonest behaviour in this role. The police have received a complaint that John misdirected clients’ tax refunds into his personal bank account.

John is later prosecuted and found guilty.

We take criminal offending very seriously.

We tell John that we intend to decline him as a tax agent and that he has 30 days to provide further information before we finalise our decision. He does not respond, so we decline his request to be an agent.

Example: serious performance issues

Jo has been a registered tax agent for 3 years. As part of our regular review, we asked Jo to provide the Authority to act documents for a random sample of clients. He did not reply or provide the documents within the specified time frame.

In response, we removed his access to those clients and requested information about another sample of clients. Jo again failed to respond to that request and again we removed his access to those clients.

We then fully reviewed Jo’s practice for compliance. This revealed significant integrity issues. Jo had been sharing his myIR logon details with an intern he had been supporting, which is against the myIR terms and conditions.

We took immediate steps to remove the logon.

Jo also had been adding his own bank account to his clients’ profiles instead of using the refund redirect function. Jo had been a member of a professional body but had recently been disqualified. When asked to explain the above issues, Jo refused.

We take any risk to the integrity of the tax system seriously.

We view Jo’s non-compliance and any breaches very seriously. As Jo is a registered tax agent with us he is seen as a trusted advisor. We tell Jo that we intend to remove his agency and that he will receive a letter giving him the opportunity to respond within 30 days. He does not respond and as a result his agency is removed.

Approved advisor groups
-----------------------

Approved advisor groups give tax advice and follow a certain code of conduct. We approve these groups if they meet the requirements under section 20B(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Organisations with approved advisor group status:

*   The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants
*   Accountants and Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand
*   CPA Australia
*   Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand
*   Institute of Certified NZ Bookkeepers
*   New Zealand Qualified Bookkeepers Association.

Tax advisors in approved advisor groups can claim the right of non-disclosure on behalf of a taxpayer.

Tax and social policy payments centred around our customers
===========================================================

> "I remember being a young woman in the 1980s dreading the delivery of tax forms and grappling with the complex end of year tax forms that never made sense to me, and that I inevitably stuffed up. I remember the fear each year of waiting for a tax bill to arrive and wondering how I managed to get a bill when I had no control over the money that went into my account, and how I was going to pay the bill. I love the fact the system is now automated. It has reduced end of year stress for me and others I know."  
> An Inland Revenue customer.

This year, we finished our multi-year programme to transform tax and social policy payments. Aotearoa New Zealand now has a modern, digital system that enables customers to do as much for themselves as possible, in ways and at times that suit them. The transformed system makes it easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts. It is:

*   based around customers' needs
*   easy to use
*   near real-time and highly automated
*   integrated with other systems and software
*   responsive and flexible
*   fit for the future.

Before transformation, it was getting more and more difficult for Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue to provide the level of service New Zealanders expected and deserved, and to quickly deliver what the Government wanted us to do. We needed to change to ensure we could deliver what was expected of us.

These expectations included cutting compliance costs for taxpayers, effort for businesses and the cost of running the tax system. A key aim was to make it more difficult for people to fall into overdue debt and easier for them to manage their tax payments.

We knew we needed to be able to respond more rapidly to changes the Government wanted us to make - what we did not know was just how important this would be. When COVID-19 arrived in early 2020, customers coping with the impacts of the pandemic needed us to get support to them as quickly and as easily as possible.

We were able to move quickly to support customers and the Government's response because of the changes implemented as part of our transformation. Our people have used their new capabilities and drive to help New Zealanders during these challenging times. We've rolled out changes to our system and processes and implemented new products while dealing with pandemic restrictions, earthquakes and building evacuations.

We could not have delivered all these changes successfully without the support of our partners, colleagues and the organisations we work with every day.

The tax and social policy system is a major national asset that underpins the wellbeing of all New Zealanders (2023)
====================================================================================================================

As you can read in this section, we are taking a broader, more proactive role as a steward of the system. We’re already helping to shape the future through:

*   providing high-quality evidence for future-focused policy discussions
*   implementing legislative changes within Te Tari Taake to keep up with a changing world
*   working with international agencies on global issues
*   developing our strategy for working with external providers as they play an increasingly bigger part in running tax and social policy services. 

Supporting New Zealand’s wellbeing into the future
--------------------------------------------------

As a steward of the tax and social policy system, Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue is uniquely placed to ensure its long-term integrity and help drive better outcomes and experiences for New Zealanders.

We are gearing up to take a more proactive stewardship role that looks to a longer-term view of the system, products and processes we and others are accountable for and the information we collect. Key pieces of work completed this year, and others under way, are helping to shape the future.

Show all

Evidence for future-focused discussions

Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue implements the Government’s Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. The current programme includes:

*   enacting changes to taxation of residential investment property
*   working on the role of tax in the sustainable economy and the environment
*   ensuring a fair and efficient tax administration, and
*   progressing international priorities.

This year, our policy work included a review of fringe benefit tax (FBT) published in August 2022. The last full review of FBT was in 2003 so a part of this latest review was to explore whether the tax, as currently constructed, is fit for the future. Our findings are there for future governments to consider when determining their tax and social policy work programmes.

Our findings noted that FBT continues to deliver its primary task—ensuring remuneration from employment is taxed whether it is paid in cash or as a non-cash benefit.

However, we noted it is not clear that the tax functions well—stakeholders spoken to said it imposes a high administrative and compliance burden relative to the tax at stake. Some also believe FBT is not complied with by all businesses or enforced by us.

Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue also released 2 documents aimed at providing high-quality information and evidence for discussions around tax policy.

In August 2022, we published a long-term insights briefing on tax, foreign investment and productivity. The briefing supported the OECD’s conclusion that New Zealand has a relatively high cost of capital, which has the potential to adversely impact productivity and economic performance.

We noted that many factors can affect productivity outside of company tax settings.

The briefing considered the pros and cons of a set of policy reform options that could affect costs of capital. While the options all had some benefits, they also all came with their own trade-offs that would have to be managed if any changes were to be made.

In April 2023, we published a report on a 2-year research project that looked at the effective tax rates of 311 of New Zealand’s wealthiest families.

A key finding was that the median effective tax rate paid by these families on taxable income was about 30% while the rate in relation to all income sources, including capital gains, was 8.9%. In making these calculations, we used a comprehensive set of data that included information provided by the families themselves.

Global solutions for global tax priorities

Internationally driven measures feature heavily in our work to ensure Aotearoa’s tax system contributes to global solutions for global tax issues.

A key change coming up is legislation enabling New Zealand to take part in an OECD and G20-led plan for a 15% global minimum tax on multinational groups.

The new rule would apply to around 24 New Zealand-headquartered groups and mean they are required to:

*   calculate their effective tax rates in each country where they operate, and
*   pay additional tax to New Zealand on ‘mobile income’ that has been taxed at less than 15%.

The rule would also allow our country to take part in collecting equivalent tax from groups headquartered in other countries if they’re not already subject to tax there.

Partnerships matter

Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue operates in a wider digital ecosystem that includes external providers that offer business solutions to their customers—some make tax just a part of their service or product.

Providers connect with us via our gateway services channel. This channel supports 75% of all customer interactions with us and all cross-government information-sharing. 2.7 million accounts across 1.9 million New Zealanders are directly supported by gateway services.

We receive requests from other providers to come onboard. Providers are taking an increased role where it benefits customers, tax compliance and Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue.

We’re developing a strategy outlining which providers we are able to work with, what data they should have access to and how they can use that data. It will help improve services to our customers and compliance results, within a robust risk framework.

Plenty to do for Aotearoa New Zealand

Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue has a view to the future, and we’re undertaking research and analysis to ensure the tax and social policy programmes we administer will be fit for purpose in the long term.

A good example is the work we have begun to review Working for Families. This project is focused on developing our long-term strategy on income support payments delivered through the tax system. It will consider what an ideal tax and transfers (social payments) structure could look like, what the implications might be, how the current tax credits could be improved and how support for customers could be more accessible and timely.

This work contributes to our stewardship obligations under the Public Service Act 2020.

We are also on a journey to becoming an organisation based on te Tiriti o Waitangi. We have a range of initiatives under way that will help us become a better Treaty partner over time and benefit Māori customers.

You can read more about what we’ve done to build our capability as a Treaty partner in the next section as well as our work to make Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue a diverse and inclusive workplace, and our governance and management.

[About us](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/about-us)
\[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] About this research The research was done to fill in gaps in New Zealand’s understanding of the taxation and income of the wealthiest New Zealanders. Inland Revenue gathered a lot of information from 311 of the wealthiest families in New Zealand. These families generally have a net worth of more than $50m. This information cannot be accessed by anyone except a small project team, and will not be used for tax compliance or audit activity. Inland Revenue also used information it already had or was publicly available. Economic income Everyone needs money to buy food, clothes, shelter and all other goods and services. There are many ways to gain this money. Most people work and are paid salary or wages. Often people talk about this as their ‘income’, and it is always taxed. Many people have investments, like savings accounts, shares or KiwiSaver. Some start businesses. Others make money by buying something of value, often property or a business, which they could sell later. Each of these things are taxed differently. When you add up all the ways people gain the ability to spend money, that is called their ‘economic income’. Main finding The effective tax rate (tax paid divided by economic income) of the families we researched varied considerably, depending on how their economic income was gained from 2015 to 2021. The median (middle) effective tax rate was 8.9%. How this compares to other people Treasury has recently published an analysis on the effective tax rates on economic income of New Zealanders more generally. The Treasury analysis doesn’t include tax from companies and trusts owned or controlled by the individuals. But for much of the population a general comparison can be made. If you subtract Govt. paid benefits away from someone’s tax, and add GST paid in, then a middle wealth New Zealander has an effective tax rate of 20.2% according to the Treasury research. The comparable median for the wealthiest families in New Zealand, from Inland Revenue’s research, is 9.4%. Explanation Compared to the rest of the population, the wealthiest people in New Zealand tend to earn more through their investments rather than from a salary or wage. The graph over the page shows the personal taxable income of the wealthiest families in New Zealand alongside other forms of economic income. In 2022 Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue, researched how much tax the wealthiest families in New Zealand pay compared to their economic income. Tax and the economic income of the wealthy April 2023 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Personal taxable income The wealthiest people in New Zealand pay a higher rate of tax on their personal income than most people - things like wages, salary, interest and dividends. The median in the group researched was around 30% tax paid on $268,000 of personal taxable income. Someone on the median wage, with no other taxable income, pays around 21% of their wages in income tax. Capital gains Personal taxable income is only a small part of the economic income of the wealthiest New Zealand families. Economic income also comes from the things you buy or own increasing in value. These things can be sold to gain the cash needed to buy goods and services. From 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2021 the researched families got most of their economic income from increases in the value of businesses, property and financial portfolios they own or control. This is called capital gains. These increases in value are mostly not taxed as part of personal taxable income. However, the report accounts for tax paid by the businesses themselves. Most of the capital gains made by the researched families came through increases in the value of businesses they own or control. However, economic income gained from businesses, property, and financial portfolios all had a similar impact on lowering their effective tax rate. This group hold many of their assets in trust. Sixty-seven percent of the economic income made by the wealthiest families in New Zealand is made in trusts. The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

Tax avoidance - fraud on a person affected by the arrangement
=============================================================

2012 case note – Tax avoidance and fraud - party to the arrangement, meeting of the minds, person affected by the arrangement.

Case

TRA 011/10

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The Commissioner is not required to satisfy herself that the taxpayer is fully aware of all aspects of an arrangement or that the taxpayer has not been the victim of fraud by a third party in relation to an arrangement to apply the general anti-avoidance rule.

### Facts

In the income tax years ended 31 March 2004 to 31 March 2006, the disputant participated in an arrangement which purported to constitute an employee indemnity fund ("the EIF") for the benefit of the disputant's employees.

Ultimately, the disputant claimed deductions in the relevant income years for contributions, fees, insurance and interest paid under the EIF. The Commissioner reversed the deductions and assessed the disputant for shortfall penalties.  
The parties to this matter agreed to have a preliminary question of law heard by the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") before proceeding to a hearing on the substantive issues in dispute:

*   Even if there was a fraud on the disputant in relation to any arrangement, either wholly or in part, does that preclude sections OB 1, BG 1 and GB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the Income Tax Act 2004 from applying to the arrangement?

### Decision

The disputant asserted that the EIF was fraudulent and as a consequence the contributions paid by the disputant (by way of loan) to the relevant fund never existed. Accordingly, as the transactions were not genuine, the contribution payments could trigger no deductions (albeit the disputant maintained it was still entitled to deductions for payments made relating to insurance, interest and fees on the basis of fraud or misappropriation pursuant to section DJ 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004). The disputant asserted that where there is such a fraud there can be no tax avoidance.

**_Fraud_**

The TRA confirmed that there is no general crime of fraud in the common law albeit it has a clear meaning in criminal law of "dishonesty" (noting that to some extent it overlaps with the meaning of fraud in civil law and equity). For the purposes of this dispute, the TRA confirmed that "fraud" is taken to encompass any conduct as a result of which the disputant has not given informed consent as to the true nature of the scheme in which it participated (which the TRA considered would include being the victim of either civil or equitable fraud).

Further, the disputant had asserted that where there is evidence of fraud, the TRA was required to look behind the arrangements and analyse the substance or the real legal relationship to determine the basis upon which the disputant should be taxed. The disputant relied on the decisions of _Calkin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 440 and _R v Connolly_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,844. The Commissioner rejected these arguments and the TRA agreed with the Commissioner. In particular, the TRA pointed out that Court in _Calkin_ did not consider whether fraud nullifies a transaction for tax purposes and the issue in _Connolly_ was sham (and sham is not an issue in the current dispute).

**_Avoidance_**

After setting out the leading case law on the general anti-avoidance rule, the TRA confirmed that it was clear from the Agreed Statement of Facts that there was a plan or understanding between the disputant and the participants/promoters of the EIF.

Further, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the combined effect of section BG 1 and the definitions of "arrangement" and "tax avoidance arrangement" means that even if a taxpayer is the victim of fraud, a tax avoidance arrangement can still exist.

The TRA confirmed that the intention of the parties in entering the arrangement is irrelevant and an arrangement does not require consensus or a meeting of the minds (referring to _Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2012\] NZCA 128, (2012) 25 NZTC 20,120, _Peterson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2005\] UKPC 5, \[2006\] NZLR 433 and the dissenting judgment of Thomas J in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v BNZ Investments Ltd_ \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450). Accordingly, the TRA concluded that it was irrelevant that the disputant may not have been aware of the full details of the arrangement or that its knowledge did not extend to all steps and transactions by which the arrangement was carried into effect.

The Commissioner had asserted that the purpose of section BG 1 would be hindered if taxpayers could allege they were unaware of the full particulars of an arrangement and therefore should avoid the application of the general anti-avoidance rule. The Commissioner submitted that the disputant's contentions did not support the purpose of section BG 1 and the TRA agreed.

In addition, the TRA considered that the arrangement had a purpose or effect of tax avoidance. The disputant claimed tax deductions that relieved it of liability to pay income tax (and any subsequent reversal of those deductions by the disputant did not erase that tax advantage) and so there was "tax avoidance" as defined. Further, the TRA was able to infer from the features of the arrangement that it had a clear purpose or effect of such tax avoidance.

The TRA also confirmed that once a tax avoidance arrangement is established, the arrangement is void as against the Commissioner and the Commissioner can adjust the deductions of any person affected by the arrangement so as to counteract the tax advantage. The TRA noted that there was no requirement that the relevant person be a party to the arrangement to be a person affected by the arrangement. The TRA ultimately held that regardless of whether or not the disputant was a party to the arrangement, it was affected by the arrangement in that it claimed deductions in respect of the EIF.

**_The effect of any fraud_**

Finally, the TRA also confirmed that, while there are indicators of fraud in this case, any fraud on the disputant by a third party is not relevant to the application of section BG 1. The disputant has legal remedies available to pursue against those third parties and this does not affect the Commissioner's ability to adjust the income of taxpayers who are affected by a tax avoidance arrangement.

Tax bill increases fairness, modernises tax system
==================================================

**06 April 2017**

A new tax bill introduced into Parliament today will help modernise our tax administration while ensuring that the current system works as it should, says Revenue Minister Judith Collins.

“The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill contains proposals relating to collecting employment and investment income information.  The proposals will help Inland Revenue to ensure that people are on the right tax code and receiving any entitlements correctly.”

The Bill also contains proposals to modernise the taxation of employee share schemes.

Employee share schemes are arrangements where companies provide shares or share options to their employees as part of an employee’s remuneration.

Changes proposed in the Bill include new rules to ensure the tax treatment of employee share schemes is consistent with other forms of employment income. This includes providing a deduction for the employer for the cost of shares in line with other forms of remuneration.

“The employee share scheme measures proposed in the Bill are based on feedback from two rounds of public consultation in May and September 2016. The consultation process has been valuable in shaping the reforms contained in this Bill.

“For example, the original proposals raised the possibility of abolishing the tax regime for widely offered schemes, but in response to feedback the rules are being retained, but simplified and improved.

“There will also be another opportunity to provide feedback on the Bill during the Select Committee process.

“Through the consultation process, the Government also became aware of practical issues facing start-up companies offering employee share schemes.

“To address these issues, my officials are currently developing a public consultation document that refines the start-up proposal that was contained in the 2016 issues paper. I hope interested parties will provide feedback on these proposals too,” Ms Collins says.

Ms Collins says a range of measures addressing taxpayers’ concerns such as issues with demergers and decommissioning costs for petroleum miners are addressed by the Bill. There are also a number of GST-related matters included.

“And there is a proposal to add five new charities to the list of donee organisations eligible for tax benefits. These are, Byond Disaster Relief New Zealand, Flying for Life Charitable Trust, Médecins Sans Frontières New Zealand Charitable Trust, Tony McClean Nepal Trust, and Zimbabwe Rural Schools Library Trust,” Ms Collins says.

Tax case sentences in the courts for the end of 2019
====================================================

**06 January 2020**

Tax crime happens when people cheat the tax system through deliberate and dishonest behaviour with the aim of obtaining financial benefit.

While most people are honest and pay tax on all their income, those that intentionally avoid paying tax or claim money they aren't entitled to, are robbing honest people of services they might have had.

That's why we help people do the right thing and take action when people deliberately try to avoid paying tax.

Here are the cases that reached the point of sentencing towards the end of 2019.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Michael Robert Hills**

A Christchurch man who paid other creditors instead of his tax bill was sentenced to 11 months home detention and ordered to pay more than $16-thousand dollars in reparations.

Michael Robert Hills ran Mead Building and took over another business in August 2012, significantly increased staff numbers. He made a deliberate decision to take tax deductions from staff wages but not pay the money on to Inland Revenue.

As a result, there is a total of unaccounted core tax deductions for the company of **$595,312.77**. Mead Building Limited also owes **$16,833.40** for unpaid KiwiSaver Employer Contributions, money that the Company’s employees have also missed out on.

Hills was charged with one representative charge of aiding and abetting Mead Building to make the deductions ‘for a purpose other than payment to’ IR. The company is now in liquidation.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V** **Boonrouen Thongskul, Sirirat Kampeng, Anchalee Minwong, Chanaratt Thongskul and Anuchit Tongskul**

Five members of one family were sentenced to prison and home detention or ordered to pay reparations after a $2.3 million tax evasion case brought by Inland Revenue.

They’ve been ordered to pay more than $2.2 million in reparations by the High Court in Wellington.

[https://media.ird.govt.nz/articles/five-members-of-one-family-sentenced-for-tax-evasion/](https://media.ird.govt.nz/articles/five-members-of-one-family-sentenced-for-tax-evasion/)

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Lance Patrick McAuley**

A lawyer who ignored repeated warnings from his tax agent and Inland Revenue was sentenced to 7 months home detention and 300 hours community work in October, on tax evasion charges.

Lance Patrick McAuley was also ordered to pay $10,000 in reparation. He was responsible for deducting PAYE and other tax payments for staff in two transport companies. The money should have been paid to Inland Revenue.

Throughout the offending, McAuley received income of $367,935 from the two companies, as well as paying himself salary/wages directly from one, earning a total of $521,109.00. As a result of McAuley’s actions the outstanding tax debt is $563,048.76.

Both companies placed into liquidation at the Commissioner’s petition with the liquidators’ final report concluding that McAuley was ‘trading recklessly’.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Lindsay and Roger Scott**

Two Hamilton brothers were sent to prison for significant tax and charities fraud.

In the Hamilton District Court this week, Judge Kevin Phillips sentenced 61-year-old truck driver Lindsay Scott to 3 years 6 months in prison. His older brother Roger, a 64-year-old lab technician, was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.

[https://media.ird.govt.nz/articles/hamilton-brothers-sentenced/](https://media.ird.govt.nz/articles/hamilton-brothers-sentenced/)

****Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Vanessa Joy Harris****

An Auckland woman was sentenced to 6 months community detention and 60 hours community work for not paying staff PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue.

Vanessa Joy Harris faced 56 charges of aiding and abetting two residential building companies - Harris Built and Harris Holdings.  She was also ordered to pay $80,000 in reparations. Her husband was the sole director of both companies. 

Deductions made from employee’s gross wages but not paid to IR when they were due. The total offending in both companies amounts to $357,332.45.

Harris was responsible for the day to day management, staff, finances and tax obligations of both Harris Built and Harris Holdings.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Ian David Wilson**

A company director who ran three horticultural contracting businesses was sentenced to 6 months home detention for aiding and abetting his businesses failure to file PAYE returns.

Ian David Wilson faced 29 charges covering an almost two-year period.

During that time, Inland Revenue had various conversations with Wilson and with the employees and accountant of the companies he ran about the failure to file returns and/or pay tax as required.

Hills admitted her made the financial decisions for the company and decided when PAYE would be paid.  All three companies are now in liquidation.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Michelle Augustine**

A dispute over child support payments saw a woman sentenced to five months home detention and ordered to pay $5,000 in reparations.

Michelle Augustine did the books for her partner’s company Absolutely Hammered Ltd (AHL) and her son Jason worked for the company.

He was made a liable parent after a birth certificate named him as the father of a child. Child support deductions were to come from his wages, but his mother refused to make the deductions.

Augustine told IR investigators that her son was not the child’s father, that she was aware of the consequences of not deducting child support and that she was not going to make the deductions.

She was also advised of how to dispute her son’s child support liability. Between 31 July 2014 and 31 January 2017, AHL failed to deduct child support payments of $20,463.81.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Peter Martin Coleman**

An Auckland man, who a judge says used Inland Revenue as a bank to prop up failing businesses, was sent to prison for nearly five years.

Peter Martin Coleman was sentenced yesterday in the Auckland District Court to 4 years and 9 months in prison on a raft of tax charges under the Crimes Act and the Tax Administration Act. His actions resulted in an actual loss to Inland Revenue of $1,071,837.49.

****Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Mara Sorm****

A Waikato baker was sent to prison for nearly five years for persistent and premeditated multi-million-dollar tax evasion over six years.

Mara Sorm was found guilty by a Hamilton jury on 52 charges of tax evasion relating to himself, his wife, and their company after failing to declare some $6,500,000.00 in cash sales. He was sentenced today in the Tauranga District court to 4 years, 9 months in prison and ordered to pay $500,000 in reparations.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V** **Robert William Lee Grant**

An Auckland company director was sentenced to 12 months home detention on tax evasion charges.

Robert William Lee Grant faced 71 charges covering not filing a return with the intent to evade GST, evasion of GST and knowingly not deducting PAYE with the intent to evade tax.

Grant was responsible for the finances and administration of the companies. His tax agent encouraged Grant to file returns which were overdue, to pay outstanding tax, and warned him that penalties (including prosecution) might follow.

The total amount of tax shortfall owing is $502,573.56

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Umesh Patel** 

An Auckland company director was sentenced to 3 months community detention plus 125 hours community work on tax evasion charges.

Umesh Patel ran Vista Infotech NZ Limited and between 2012 and 2015 failed to pay PAYE returns, paid net wages, and deducted employees PAYE totalling $102,807.86 to Inland Revenue.

The Defendant was aware that PAYE was outstanding and understood that it was an amount held in trust for Inland Revenue.

In an interview he told IR investigators he knew PAYE would not be paid when it was due and that he preferred to pay other creditors over Inland Revenue to keep the business going.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Clifford Desmond Meikle**

The owner of a transport company was sentenced to 10 months home detention for failing to file PAYE, GST and income tax returns.

Clifford Desmond Meikle ran Meikle Transport and Meikle Transport Holdings which changed their names to CDM and JML respectively and both went into liquidation in 2013.

Meikle has also sentenced to 10 months post detention conditions which includes attending counselling for grief and mental health issues.

The amount owing is between $466,451.45 and $627,221.31

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Jignesh Prakashkumar Purohit**

A former Auckland auto mechanic was sentenced to 12 months home detention on money laundering and tax fraud charges.

Jignesh Prakashkumar Purohit also had six months post home detention conditions imposed on him.  He has repaid more than $70,000 of the money he obtained fraudulently.

In February 2016 another man in NZ on a student visa opened a company but was then deported.  The company never traded but Purohit still filed GST returns for it. Between May 2016 and 12 April Purohit systematically withdrew around $87,000 in cash from ATMs around the Auckland and Sydney areas.

He recruited at least three other Indian students to incorporate companies, open bank accounts and rent PO Boxes. Purohit and his wife moved to Australia in early 2018 but he travelled almost monthly back to New Zealand to check PO Boxes and withdraw money.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V** **Jarred Marshall Nathan/HF Devanning Limited**

A man who ran a Christchurch furniture removal firm was fined $1,350 for failing to file GST, PAYE and income tax returns.

Jarred Marshall Nathan faced 27 charges of aiding and abetting his firm HF Devanning Ltd in not filing the required paperwork.

Despite Inland Revenue using significant time and resource to encourage Hills to comply with his tax obligations, all returns remain outstanding.

Hills has also failed to make any tax payments towards the Company's potential tax liability.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Kamlesh Jattan**

An Auckland man, whose company sold EFTPOS terminals and barcode scanners, was sentenced to four months community detention and 100 hours community work on tax evasion and tax fraud charges.

Kamlesh Jattan, through a tax agent, filed 18 GST returns between 2011 and 2014 as well as three income tax returns. He was audited in 2016 and asked to provide a copy of bank accounts for his company.

Bank accounts obtained directly from the bank by IR showed Jattan had left out 88 transactions and recalculated the opening and closing balances.

The total tax shortfall was $164,938.92.

=====================================

**04 June 2020**

New legislation introduced to Parliament today will support growth and assist businesses on the road to economic recovery, said Revenue Minister Stuart Nash.

“The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes that businesses can get tax deductions for ‘feasibility expenditure’ on new investments,” said Mr Nash.

“We’ve already introduced R&D tax credits to support investment in research and development. This new proposal is the next step in giving businesses the confidence to invest in growth – even when some of their ideas don’t work out.

“Business owners tell us that costs incurred in exploring a new asset or business model are often not tax deductible and this can deter them from investing in growth and innovation. The new legislation addresses these barriers to help unlock investment.

“Businesses would be able to claim a deduction spread over five years for feasibility expenditure incurred in investigating a new asset, process or business model even if it is subsequently abandoned.

“To keep things simple and reduce compliance costs, particularly for small and medium businesses, qualifying expenditure of less than $10,000 would be immediately deductible in the current income year. This helps with business cash flow.  

“We are supporting Kiwi companies to innovate and grow by making it easier to invest in new assets and business models. Current rules can be problematic. We are making the system fairer and keeping compliance costs low for businesses,” said Mr Nash.

The bill also contains the following proposals that have previously been subject to public consultation:

• New rules governing purchase price allocation, where parties to the sale of two or more assets with different tax treatments allocate the sales price between the assets for tax purposes.

• New rules from the ongoing review of the taxation of land, particularly in relation to investment property and speculators. The changes will improve efficiency of the tax system and encourage productive use of land and properties.

• Allowing dairy and beef cattle farmers who have unexpected taxable income as a result of their herd being culled (in pursuit of eradicating Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand), to evenly spread that income forward over six years.

“This bill promotes growth while maintaining the integrity of the tax system.

“Restoring our economy requires a broad-base low-rate tax system with strong integrity. The fairness and integrity of our system means rules work as intended and everyone pays their fair share, which allows the government to continue providing vital services, functions and support.

“The changes put us in a stronger position for economic recovery,” said Mr Nash.

Tax changes throw cash lifeline to SMEs
=======================================

**30 April 2020**

A significant package of tax reforms will be pushed through all stages in Parliament today to throw a cash flow lifeline to small businesses.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Bill gives businesses more than $3 billion in tax refunds as they deal with the economic impact of the virus.

“This response delivers the single biggest government support package to businesses via the tax system in modern New Zealand history, and more is yet to come,” Mr Nash said.

“As the Prime Minister and Finance Minister have said we are constantly monitoring the situation for business and adjusting our support as required. Just yesterday we indicated additional support will be coming for commercial leases.

“We will keep supporting business and jobs where we can to cushion the blow of the virus and ensure New Zealand is well positioned for recovery.”

“Today’s changes mean cash could start flowing to businesses via the tax system as early as next week. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are feeling the pain now. We are moving urgently to get cash into their hands as quickly as possible, by taking current losses back to a prior year.

“My strong advice to businesses is to talk to their accountant, bookkeeper or tax agent, or log onto the MyIR portal as quickly as possible to ensure they take advantage of the government support as soon as changes come into effect this week.

“The tax refunds will be a cash lifeline for businesses with non-wage fixed costs, like rent, interest and insurance. Some don’t want to take on extra debt with a bank loan. Without this support these otherwise viable SMEs may be forced to close.

“The changes were signalled two weeks ago and design features have now been finalised after discussions between Inland Revenue and external tax practitioners. I am grateful to the accounting and legal profession and IR officials for their rapid work on this legislation.

“The omnibus bill deals with tax and regulatory changes to support businesses and others get through the economic shock caused by COVID. The main measures will:

• introduce a tax loss carry-back regime to provide cash flow quickly to businesses, by allowing losses to be carried back one year;

• allow IR to change due dates, timeframes or other procedural requirements for tax returns for taxpayers affected by COVID-19;

• ensure the treatment of benefits and pensions paid to New Zealanders stranded overseas is consistent with the treatment of equivalent payments in New Zealand;

• bring forward the commencement date of certain protections relating to high-cost consumer credit contracts;

• prevent famers and others working with animals having to call in vets to undertake minor surgical procedures during the lockdown; and

• extend the timeframe for certain Crown entities to provide planning documents to responsible or shareholding Ministers.

“Other tax changes just before the lockdown involved a $2.8 billion support package for business.

“It gives $2 billion in tax deductions to landlords through depreciation on commercial buildings. It removes 95,000 taxpayers from the provisional tax regime by raising the tax threshold to $5,000; allows businesses to claim back more for spending on low-value assets like laptops and phones; and allows interest to be waived on late payments.

“The wage subsidy has also been a vital factor in small business survival. Around 97 per cent of businesses who received the subsidy are either sole traders or firms employing fewer than 20 staff.

“More than $1.25 billion has been paid to about 188,000 sole traders. A further $4.27 billion has gone to 160,000 small businesses that employ between one and 19 staff. Almost 8,900 medium-sized firms, with 20-99 staff, have been paid $1.3 billion.

“SMEs can also call on government support to pay for professional advice to plan for survival and recovery from the economic shock caused by COVID. A $25 million business consultancy fund will pay for tailored specialist support such as business continuity planning, finance and cash flow management, HR and staffing issues.

“The global pandemic and economic crisis is hitting every nation hard. We are moving to cushion the blow for businesses and workers in this country as Alert Level 3 opens up the economy to prepare for recovery,” Mr Nash said.

Tax cheat rips off tourists
===========================

**22 April 2015**

A Bay of Plenty man has been sentenced to 10 months' home detention after he used backpackers' and other tourists' IRD numbers to file false PAYE tax returns.

Inland Revenue's group manager of investigations and advice, Patrick Goggin, said Harjinder Singh ripped off New Zealand taxpayers for more than $260,000 after claiming backpackers and other tourists he hired as temporary workers on his kiwifruit farm were still employed by him.

"The wage figures Singh submitted to us for the temporary workers were higher than they should have been," said Mr Goggin.

"He hired them as temporary workers but after they had moved jobs or left New Zealand, Singh continued to use their IRD numbers to put through portions of his permanent staff's wages.

"Singh's actions were selfish and posed a real risk. He logged some of the permanent staff's wages under the IRD numbers of the temporary workers who no longer worked for him. This means, by using the wrong IRD numbers, Singh could have helped his permanent staff to defraud the system by effectively reducing their declared income. This could have led to staff members getting more family assistance tax credits than they were entitled to, or reducing the amount of child support they may have had to pay.

"Singh could also have misused the numbers to employ and pay illegal immigrants," he said.

Inland Revenue was contacted by a handful of backpackers concerned they had been taxed on money they had not earned.

"We acted quickly to stop Singh and help the additional 120 victims we also identified whose IRD numbers were likely to have been misused," said Mr Goggin. "Where applicable, we have refunded any overpaid tax.

"Inland Revenue takes criminal activity like this seriously. There's always a small minority who will try and cheat honest taxpayers out of money that pays for services like our schools and hospitals.

"Some backpackers whose IRD numbers were ripped off are worried they won't be able to return to New Zealand due to Singh's actions causing possible breaches to their work visa.

"Protecting our customers' identities from misuse is something Inland Revenue takes seriously. It's important we all protect our IRD number the best we can and treat it with the same secrecy as our banking pin number," he said.

Inland Revenue has recovered the $262,458 Singh owed. The 36-year-old was sentenced at Hamilton District Court yesterday after pleading guilty to 16 charges of PAYE evasion.

[Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-budget-measures-act-2012 "Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2012")

Tax credit changes
==================

As part of Budget 2012, changes were made to three tax credits that have become outdated - the income under $9,880 tax credit, the tax credit for childcare and housekeeper expenditure, and the tax credit for the active income of children. The first two credits were repealed while the last was replaced by a limited tax exemption.

_Sections CW 55BB, LC 3 to LC 12, YA 1 and schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and 24B, 24H and 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

As part of Budget 2012, changes were made to three tax credits that have become outdated - the income under $9,880 tax credit, the tax credit for childcare and housekeeper expenditure, and the tax credit for the active income of children. The first two credits were repealed while the last was replaced by a limited tax exemption.

#### Background

These credits were identified by the Government as poorly targeted, outdated and inconsistent with New Zealand's broad-based, low-rate tax framework. Claiming the credits was often the sole reason for many people filing tax returns.

#### Key features

*   Three tax credits have been changed, effective from the 2012-13 and later tax years:
    *   the income under $9,880 tax credit (referred to in the legislation as the "transitional circumstances tax credit");
    *   the tax credit for childcare and housekeeper expenditure;
    *   the tax credit for the active income of children.
*   The first two credits have been repealed, while the last has been replaced with a limited tax exemption.

#### Detailed analysis

#### _Repeal of tax credits_

The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2012 repeals sections LC 3 through to LC 12. These are the sections dealing with the income under $9,880 tax credit, the tax credit for childcare and housekeeper expenditure, and the tax credit for the active income of children.

Several consequential omissions or amendments to definitions in section YA 1 have also been made, reflecting that these credits have been repealed. Section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been similarly amended.

#### _Transitional rules_

These changes have effect from the 2012-13 tax year. This application date is possible as, by and large, these credits are claimed at year-end by filing tax returns. However, it was possible to claim two of the credits - the income under $9,880 credit and the credit for the active income of children - during the year through the PAYE system. Because of this, the amended Act contains transitional provisions.

The objective of these provisions is to allow employers to continue their current payroll and PAYE-withholding practices until 31 March 2013. The transitional rules are also designed to ensure that a taxpayer receiving these credits through the PAYE system is not required to file solely because of this. To support this objective, people currently claiming these credits through the PAYE system will be able to get the benefit of the credits in the 2012-13 tax year if they do not file a tax return. If they do file, their tax liability will be assessed as it is for other taxpayers; the credits will not be available. This may mean that they have tax to pay as their employer will have deducted insufficient tax throughout the year.

Schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act and section 24B of the Tax Administration Act are amended, both with effect from the 2013-14 and later tax years. The effect of these amendments is that the "ML" tax code, which allows a taxpayer to claim the income under $9,880 tax credit through the PAYE system, remains available for the remainder of the 2012-13 tax year, after which it is repealed.

These amendments work in concert with the repeal of section 24H(7), which has effect from the beginning of the 2012-13 income year. This provision prohibited the use of the "ML" code by someone who was not eligible for the tax credit; the omission of the provision means people are able to remain on the "ML" code despite the repeal of the credit.

There is no specific provision in the Income Tax Act that provides for the tax credit for the active income of children to be claimed through the PAYE system. Instead, this is achieved under a Commissioner's discretion in section RD 11, which allows the Commissioner to modify the PAYE rules in respect of a class of persons. The Commissioner will continue to exercise this discretion, allowing the credit to be claimed through the PAYE system, until 31 March 2013.

#### _Limited tax exemption for children_

New section CW 55BB is inserted providing that a school child does not need to pay tax on up to $2,340 of income which is not taxed at source (such as money for mowing the neighbour's lawn). The exemption does not apply to income on which tax has already been paid, such as salary and wages or interest.

If a child earns more than $2,340 from income which is not taxed at source, the exemption does not apply to any of the income. The child is required to pay tax on the full amount.

For the purposes of this new section, a school child is someone who is:

*   14 or under;
*   15, 16 or 17 and still attending school (excluding tertiary institutions); or
*   18, and turned 18 on or after 1 January in the previous tax year and continued at school.

**Example**

Kate is at secondary school and has a part time job at the local retail store earning about $2,000 a year. Her employer deducts PAYE from her wages each week. Kate also gets paid for the occasional babysitter job for neighbours. She makes around $300 a year from babysitting. She also earns $50 in interest on her savings from which Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) is deducted.

Under the previous tax credit for a child's active income, Kate could file a tax return to claim back her PAYE, but not her RWT. The tax credit would also offset the tax payable on her babysitting income. With the new child's income tax exemption, Kate would not be required to file and pay tax on the babysitting income. She would not be able to claim back the PAYE or RWT.

#### Application date(s)

These changes apply for the 2012-13 and later tax years unless specified above.

We provide guidance for payments provided to private schools. For further information refer to:

[QB 22/08 and QB 22/09 Factsheet GST and Income Tax – Payments made by parents to private schools](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/fact-sheets/2022/qb-22-08-and-09-fs)

How much you can claim
----------------------

The total you can claim in a tax year is the lesser of:

*   33.33% of your total donations
*   33.33% of your taxable income.

If your total donations were more than your taxable income, you can split your donations with your spouse or partner. You would claim up to your amount of taxable income and your spouse or partner would claim the rest, up to their amount of taxable income.

You can see an example of splitting donations with your spouse or partner in the blue box at the bottom of the page.

Splitting donations with your spouse or partner
-----------------------------------------------

When you submit your donation receipt in myIR, let us know how much of it you want to give to your spouse or partner.

We'll make sure your spouse or partner gets this amount. They do not need to submit the receipt themselves.

You can do this even if the receipt is in your name only.

Am I eligible for a tax credit for my donation?
-----------------------------------------------

If certain criteria are met, you, as an individual, can claim a donation tax credit on a donation of $5 or more. You cannot claim a donation tax credit on behalf of a company, trust or partnership. Check your eligibility for each donation receipt.

4-year limit for claiming
-------------------------

For a donation you made, you can submit the receipt at any time within 4 years of:

*   1 April, following the end of the tax year in which you made the donation, if you have an early or standard [balance date](/api/glossary/item?id={28AACCE7-DC17-4ED8-B93C-9BEEFB29DA97})
    
*   the day after the end of your [income year](/api/glossary/item?id={C22119C2-DA55-43C5-9A63-91A0425427D3})
    , corresponding to the tax year in which you made the donation, if you have a late balance date.

Any credit you are due will apply to the tax year the donation was made, not the year you submitted the receipt.

[Balance dates](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/balance-dates)

What needs to be on your receipt
--------------------------------

You need a receipt for every donation you want to claim.

The receipt needs to:

*   be in your name, or your spouse or partner's name
*   show the amount and date of the donation
*   clearly state that it's for a donation
*   be signed by an authorised person
*   be on the organisation's letterhead or show its name and official stamp
*   show the organisation's [IRD number](/api/glossary/item?id={9790312F-B4BA-4722-A470-3DCD1DBAE206})
     or registration number with Charities Services
*   show the word 'copy' or 'replacement' if it's a replacement receipt.

If you want to claim for a donation of $5 or more made over the phone, you need a receipt from the approved organisation. A copy of your phone bill is not a receipt.

Other ways to donate
--------------------

You can ask your employer to deduct donations from your pay and pass them on to approved charities or organisations. We call this payroll giving.

For every dollar you donate, you get 33.33 cents back as a tax credit. The credit reduces the amount of PAYE or withholding tax you pay.

[Payroll giving as an employee](/roles/employees/payroll-giving-as-an-employee)

Example - Splitting donations with your spouse or partner

Your taxable income is $1,000 but you have donation receipts totalling $1,500.

You're only eligible to claim $1,000. However, if your spouse or partner has taxable income of $500 or more, they can claim the other $500 from the donation receipts.

Reductions to personal income tax rates are to be phased in over three years, beginning 1 April 2009. These changes are in addition to the tax cuts that came into effect on 1 October 2008. The package has two key elements:

*   changes to personal income tax rates and thresholds, and
*   the introduction of an independent earner tax credit (IETC).

### Key features

The Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to provide tax cuts for individuals. The main features are:

*   The changes will be rolled out progressively in three stages from 1 April 2009.
*   As well as changes to thresholds at which personal tax rates apply, the 21% rate will drop to 20% from 1 April 2011, and the 39% rate will drop to 38% from 1 April 2009, and again to 37% from 1 April 2010.
*   The introduction of the independent earner tax credit (IETC). This will be available to individuals who earn $24,000 and over, at a maximum yearly amount of $520 from 1 April 2009, and $780 from 1 April 2010. It is abated at 13 cents for every dollar of income earned over $44,000.
*   Banks and other financial institutions will be able to apply a new optional 38% resident withholding tax (RWT) rate from 1 April 2009.
*   A number of consequential changes have been made to parts of the tax system affected by the changes to personal tax rates. These include fringe benefit tax rates, the employer superannuation contribution tax and thresholds for extra pay and secondary tax codes.

### Application dates

The personal income tax cuts will be phased in over three years, starting on 1 April 2009, with further cuts starting on 1 April 2010. The final cuts will begin on 1 April 2011.

### Detailed analysis

#### Personal tax rate reductions

Under the previous legislation, the following tax rates applied to personal income:

| From 1 October 2008 |     |
| --- | --- |
| $0 - $14,000 | 12.5% |
| $14,001 - $40,000 | 21% |
| $40,001 - $70,000 | 33% |
| $70,001 and over | 39% |

Following enactment of the Taxation (Urgent Measures and Annual Rates) Act 2008, the following personal tax rates will apply (changes bolded for emphasis):

| From 1 April 2009 |     |
| --- | --- |
| $0 - $14,000 | 12.5% |
| $14,001 - **$48,000** | 21% |
| **$48,001** - $70,000 | 33% |
| $70,001 and over | **38%** |

| From 1 April 2010 |     |
| --- | --- |
| $0 - $14,000 | 12.5% |
| $14,001 - **$50,000** | 21% |
| **$50,001** - $70,000 | 33% |
| $70,001 and over | **37%** |

| From 1 April 2011 |     |
| --- | --- |
| $0 - $14,000 | 12.5% |
| $14,001 - **$50,000** | **20%** |
| **$50,001** - $70,000 | 33% |
| $70,001 and over | 37% |

Salary and wage earners will receive the tax cut through a reduction in the PAYE tax their employers withhold on their regular pay. Self-employed and other non-salary and wage earners will receive the tax cut when they file a tax return or request a personal tax summary at the end of the tax year.

#### Consequential changes to other parts of the tax system

To ensure that the changes to the personal tax rates and thresholds flow through the tax system correctly, a number of changes to other parts of the tax system have been made. These include fringe benefit tax rates, the employer superannuation contribution tax and thresholds for extra pay and secondary tax codes.

No immediate changes have been made to the tax rate structure that applies to portfolio investment entities (PIEs) to reflect the new personal tax rate structure. The government has indicated that the associated changes to the PIE tax rates will be considered after further consultation with the managed funds industry, with any changes likely to apply from 1 April 2010.

Similarly, the government has indicated that the necessary changes to the resident withholding tax (RWT) rates on interest will not be fully implemented until there has been further consultation with banks and other financial institutions. However, banks and other financial institutions will be able to apply a new optional 38% RWT rate from 1 April 2009. The government has indicated that it is likely that changes to the RWT rate structure to fully reflect the new personal tax rate structure will apply from 1 April 2010.

#### Independent earner tax credit (IETC)

The independent earner tax credit (IETC) is a credit for middle-income taxpayers who do not receive core assistance from the government.

To be eligible for the IETC, a person must earn $24,000 and over and must not receive a benefit, Working for Families tax credits or New Zealand superannuation. The IETC is available to New Zealand tax residents only.

The maximum yearly amount of the credit is $520 from 1 April 2009, and $780 from 1 April 2010. The IETC is abated at 13 cents for every dollar of income earned over $44,000.

Salary and wage earners can receive the IETC regularly in their pay packets by electing a new tax code with their employer. The new code is "ME".

Self-employed and other non-salary and wage earners can receive the IETC when they file their tax return or when requesting a personal tax summary at the end of the tax year.

People who already receive specified types of government assistance such as benefits, Working for Families tax credits, New Zealand superannuation, veterans' pension, or foreign pensions and benefits will not be eligible for the IETC.

##### Benefits

People who receive the following benefits are not eligible for the IETC:

*   domestic purposes benefit
*   emergency benefit
*   independent youth benefit
*   invalids' benefit
*   sickness benefit
*   unemployment benefit
*   widows' benefit.

##### Working for Families tax credits

People who receive Working for Families tax credits are not eligible for the IETC.

If a person's spouse or partner receives Working for Families tax credits, the person will not be eligible for the IETC. This is because the Working for Families scheme is a family-based entitlement.

##### New Zealand superannuation and veterans' pension

Individuals who receive New Zealand superannuation and the veterans' pension are not eligible for the IETC.

##### Foreign pensions and benefits

Individuals who receive pensions and benefits paid by overseas governments that are similar in nature to New Zealand superannuation, the veterans' pension, Working for Families tax credits or income-tested benefits will also not be eligible for the IETC. Whether the foreign income is exempt under New Zealand or foreign law is not relevant to the question of whether it is of a similar nature to one of the income categories listed above.

This ensures that people who are receiving income assistance from the New Zealand government and those receiving assistance from overseas governments are treated equally.

##### Benefits that don't affect IETC eligibility

People who receive student allowances, ACC payments, paid parental leave or the accommodation supplement will be eligible for the IETC if they meet the other eligibility criteria.

#### Part-year entitlement to the IETC

The IETC will be pro-rated for people who receive a benefit, pension or Working for Families tax credits, or who were non-resident for tax purposes, for only part of an income year. The amount of IETC is based on the number of whole months that the person is resident in New Zealand and does not receive a disqualifying payment.

**Example 1: Receiving an unemployment benefit for part of the year**

Andrew receives the unemployment benefit, which is a disqualifying payment. On 15 May 2009, Andrew starts a new job as a carpenter. During the 2009-10 income year, Andrew earns $30,000 and receives no other disqualifying payments apart from the unemployment benefit that he received during April and May.

Andrew is eligible for the IETC as he earns over $24,000. Because he earns under $44,000, the abatement of 13 cents in the dollar does not apply. However, his IETC is proportionally reduced for the two months - April and May - that he received the unemployment benefit.

The amount of IETC that he is entitled to is calculated as follows:

**(IETC - abatement) x credit period months / 12**

"Credit period months" is the number of whole months during which the person receives no disqualifying payments and was resident in New Zealand. Andrew received no disqualifying payments during the months from June 2009 to March 2010. The number of whole months during which Andrew receives no disqualifying payments is therefore 10.

Andrew's IETC is calculated as follows:

**($520 \- $0) x 10 / 12 = $433.33**

* * *

**Example 2: Resident in New Zealand for part of the year**

During the 2009-10 income year, Amy earns $45,000 and does not receive any disqualifying payments. She is therefore eligible to receive the IETC. As she earns over $44,000, her IETC is abated at 13 cents in the dollar.

She is resident in New Zealand for tax purposes between 1 April 2009 and 22 January 2010. On 22 January, she leaves New Zealand to move permanently to the United Kingdom. As she is not tax-resident in New Zealand from 23 January, she is not entitled to the IETC for the months of January, February and March.

Amy's IETC is calculated as follows:

**($520 \- $130) x 9 / 12 = $292.50**

Tax depreciation treatment of patents
=====================================

2006 remedial changes to the tax depreciation rules for patents and plant variety rights.

##### Sections DB 31(4)(a) and (b), DZ 14, EE 16(4)(b) and (5)(b), EE 16(6), EE 24B, EE 27(1)(b) and (c), EE 27B, EE 37(2), EE 51(1)(b) and (c), EE 51(3)(a), EE 51(5)(a) to (d), EE 58, and definitions of "acquire" and "dispose" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004

A number of remedial changes have been made to new tax depreciation rules for patents and plant variety rights, which were enacted as part of the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005. The changes deal with several unintended consequences of the rules and further simplify the tax depreciation rules for patents (and patent applications) and plant variety rights.

### Background

As enacted by the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005:

*   For patent applications lodged with a complete specification before 1 April 2005 and granted to a taxpayer in their 2005-06 or a later income year, a "catch up" depreciation deduction for the period the patent application was pending is allowed in the year the patent is granted.
*   For patent applications lodged with a complete specification on or after 1 April 2005, a deduction for depreciation is allowed in the income year the application is filed and in subsequent years (including years when the patent is granted).
*   Plant variety rights acquired or granted in a taxpayer's 2005-06 or later income year are depreciable property.
*   For plant variety rights applications that are granted in a taxpayer's 2005-06 or a later income year, a "catch up" depreciation deduction for the period the application was pending is allowed in the income year the rights are granted.

These rules were enacted mainly by the addition of new sections EE 27B, EE 27C, EE 27D and EE 27E to the Income Tax Act 2004.

However, the rules as enacted contained the following unintended consequences:

*   They double counted the period a patent (and patent application) or plant variety rights were held when calculating the amount of depreciation loss allowed - first under sections EE 27B to EE 27E and then under section EE 16. This double counting has the effect of reducing the amount of depreciation allowed.
*   They did not take into account the "remaining legal life" of a patent (and patent application) or plant variety rights when additional costs in relation to these rights were incurred. This also had the consequence of lowering the amount of depreciation allowed.

### Key features

New section DZ 14 provides a one-off "catch up" deduction for the period a patent application was pending for patent applications with complete specifications lodged before 1 April 2005 that are granted in the 2005-06 or a later income year. New section EE 24B provides a one-off "catch up" depreciation deduction for plant variety rights applications that are granted in the 2005-06 or a later income year.

Sections EE 27B to EE 27E have been replaced by new section EE 27B, which provides the correct annual rate for patents granted in a person's 2005-06 and subsequent years. This new provision provides the correct depreciation rate for a patent that has been granted (taking into account factors such as depreciation previously allowed for the patent application and any additional costs incurred).

Existing section EE 27 applies to patent applications with complete specifications that are lodged on or after 1 April 2005 and plant variety rights that are acquired or granted in the 2005-06 or a later income year.

A number of other consequential amendments have been made to sections DB 31(4), EE 16, EE 27(1), EE 37(2), EE 51 and to the definitions of "legal life" in section EE 58 and "acquire" and "dispose" in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The definition of "patent application date" in section OB 1 has been repealed.

### Application date

These changes apply from 1 October 2005 to:

*   patent applications lodged with a complete specification before 1 April 2005 that are granted in the 2005-06 or later income years;
*   patent applications lodged with a complete specification on or after 1 April 2005; and
*   plant variety rights acquired or granted in the 2005-06 or a later year.

_Correction: The Commentary on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill incorrectly referred to patent applications with complete specifications lodged before 1 April 2007. The correct date is 1 April 2005._

Tax evasion prison sentence a warning for hospitality sector
============================================================

**04 October 2019**

Recent successful court action against the owners of more than 20 Thai takeaway restaurants should serve as a warning that Inland Revenue will track down and prosecute businesses deliberately hiding cash sales – no matter how long it takes.

Five members of one family were sentenced this week after a multi-year tax evasion investigation. One was sent to prison for two years and 8 months and three will serve home detention sentences. The five were also ordered to pay a total of more than $2.2 million in reparations.

Inland Revenue has today launched a fresh hidden economy campaign targeting the hospitality sector which includes restaurants, cafés, bakeries, takeaway shops and liquor outlets. 

IR spokesperson Richard Philp says hiding cash sales creates an uneven playing field and gives some a leg up at the expense of others.

“What happened in the Thai House case was despicable.  Cash sales were deliberately suppressed to pay less tax. An aggravating feature was that the declared income of two of the defendants was low enough to qualify for a Working for Families Tax Credit in  some years.

“There was an extensive investigation into the family group with searches of private properties turning up business records, luxury goods and cash in some instances. At one point in the trial the cash deposited in personal bank accounts was said to be more than $9 million. 

“As these siblings found out, undeclared income leaves a trail which can be easily uncovered. Cash sales don’t fly under the IR radar and people who accept cash and don’t put it through the till should expect contact from IR.”

Investigation work into the hidden economy uncovered $108.8 million worth of unpaid tax in 2018/19.

“The hospitality sector has high risks when it comes to hidden economy activity and undeclared income because of the high number of cash transactions and the more short-term nature of employees,” Richard Philp says.

“We see things like staff being paid under the table and inconsistencies between supplies bought and goods sold. Cash leaves a clear trail for IR to follow. And we do follow through no matter how long it takes.

“If you’d rather sleep easy at night, keep good records and put cash sales through the till.  Our best advice is to record everything, declare every dollar and make sure you’re charging GST if required.”

Richard Philp says most hospitality businesses are paying the right amount of tax and have good bookkeeping practices.

“But there are those that don’t. That’s a shame because knowing the books are all in good order takes a huge weight off a business owner’s shoulders. It not only helps with tax obligations but also provides a more accurate view of cash flow, allows greater access to finance and ensures a business is correctly valued.

“There are software packages on the market to help businesses of any size to log income and expenses – and the purchase of them is tax deductible. Even a simple spreadsheet is better than no records and can work just as well.

“All taxpayers play an important role in helping us protect the integrity of the tax system by making sure everyone pays their fair share. Afterall, tax pays for the essential things that make New Zealand a great place to live,” Richard Philp says.

If you think someone’s not being honest about their tax you can anonymously report tax evasion [https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/report/report-tax-evasion.html](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/report/report-tax-evasion.html)

You can contact Inland Revenue if you think hospitality businesses are not declaring their full earnings [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89e1e6faf9e0fde8e5e0fdf0c9e0fbeda7eee6fffda7e7f3)
.

Or, as a business owner, you can also tell IR voluntarily about your own tax situation especially if you think there’s something wrong with your tax returns because you’ve left out some cash sales [https://www.ird.govt.nz/tasks/make-a-voluntary-disclosure](https://www.ird.govt.nz/tasks/make-a-voluntary-disclosure)

Tax evasion software prompts stern warning
==========================================

**12 December 2022**

Inland Revenue has issued a new [Revenue Alert](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/revenue-alerts/2022/ra-22-01)
 warning of severe consequences for anyone who has or uses Electronic Suppression Software Tools (ESST) to try to evade tax.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Tony Morris says the threat that ESS tools pose to the integrity of the tax system is significant.

“These tools create the electronic version of two sets of books. Using this software amounts to tax evasion, and an aggressive form of tax evasion at that.”

“There is no other purpose to ESST other than to facilitate tax evasion or money laundering.  ESST seriously undermines the integrity of the tax system and IRD has an obligation to honest businesses to stamp out its use.

“The ESS methodology is clearly designed to facilitate money laundering and depending on the facts of a case, Inland Revenue may consider money laundering charges.

” Inland Revenue has already identified a number of customers in New Zealand who may have been exposed to ESS tools. That number is expected to grow so IR is working hard to identify who else has been exposed. When we find them, we will come knocking.”

“ESS tools are being used globally to systematically alter point-of-sale data collected by a business in order to understate or completely conceal revenue for the purpose of evading tax. “

“In response to the growing threat, a number of stiff measures were introduced into law in April this year.  Inland Revenue will consider using all available options to respond whenever these tools are found, to protect the veracity of our tax system.

“It is an offence to manufacture, develop or provide a suppression tool to anyone in New Zealand. The penalty is a fine up to a maximum of $250,000. Where ESS tools are used to evade paying tax people can face prosecution and up to five years in prison.

“Where we identify specific instances of ESS tools being used to evade tax, Inland Revenue will require payment of any evaded tax, plus 150% shortfall penalties and use of money interest.  Where payment is not made, the Commissioner will consider applying for the taxpayer to be put into bankruptcy or liquidation.”

ESS works by targeting the integrity of transactions, software, internal memory, external filing, or reporting to delete, change, or simply not record select sales data and transactions.

Tony Morris says “Anyone who believes they may have become involved with ESS tools, should discuss the matter with their tax advisor or Inland Revenue.  They should also consider whether they may need to make a voluntary disclosure.”

Guidelines for making a voluntary disclosure are contained in Standard Practice Statement SPS 19/02 and on the Inland Revenue website [Voluntary disclosures (ird.govt.nz)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tt/pdfs/standard-practice-statements/shortfall-penalties/sps19-02.pdf?modified=20200316221619&modified=20200316221619)
_._

**Background:**

The term “electronic sales suppression tool” is defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as meaning:

A software program, device, tool, or other thing, part of a thing, or combination of things or parts,—

(a) that can hide, conceal, modify, falsify, destroy, or prevent the creation of a record that—

(i) a person is required under a tax law to make or keep; and

(ii) is, or would be, created by a system that is or includes an electronic point of sale system; and

(b) the use of which would lead to a reasonable conclusion that 1 of its principal functions is to facilitate the concealment, modification, falsification, destruction, or prevention of the creation of a record.

A new civil penalty and two new offences have been introduced in relation to involvement with ESS tools:

*   New section 141EE establishes the ESS penalty of $5,000 for the acquisition or possession of a suppression tool.
*   New section 143BB establishes an offence of manufacturing or supplying a suppression tool. A person convicted of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to $250,000.
*   New section 143BC establishes an offence of acquiring or possessing a suppression tool. A person convicted of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to $50,000.

Tax for New Zealand tax residents
=================================

As a New Zealand tax resident, you'll generally pay tax on your worldwide income.

If you do not know your tax residency status, you'll need to work it out. 

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

Applying for an IRD number
--------------------------

An IRD number is a tax identification number that you'll need in most cases if you're earning income in New Zealand.

*   It allows you to pay the right amount of tax from the start instead of higher 'no-notification' rates.

[IRD numbers for individuals](/managing-my-tax/ird-numbers/ird-numbers-for-individuals)

How types of worldwide income are taxed
---------------------------------------

As noted above, being a New Zealand tax resident, you'll generally pay tax on your [](/api/glossary/item?id={6C6937DA-4F22-4566-8CBF-A870CB1AAE54})
worldwide income. You'll need to pay tax on your overseas income even if:

*   you do not bring it into New Zealand
*   the other country or territory has deducted tax.

### Possible exemption

If you're a new tax resident or returning to New Zealand after 10 years, you may qualify for a 4-year temporary tax exemption on most types of foreign income.

[Temporary tax exemption](/roles/nz-tax-residents/exemption)

### Double tax agreements

If your country or territory has a double tax agreement with New Zealand, it may affect how different types of income are taxed.

[Double tax agreements (DTAs)](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements)

### Common types of income

We've described some common types of income in the following list.

International tax can be complex and you may want to consult a tax professional if you're in doubt about your situation.

Show all

Earning income from employment

If you're an employee, your New Zealand employer will deduct tax each time you're paid. This is called pay as you earn (PAYE) and covers your income tax and an [ACC earners' levy](/api/glossary/item?id={D0B72E97-AB1D-4CE0-A5DA-DE14E7717B67})
, New Zealand's accident insurance scheme.

When you start working in New Zealand, you’ll need to give your employer your IRD number and tax code.

*   You provide this information on an IR330 form.
*   If you do not give this information to your employer, you'll be taxed at a higher rate.
*   You will usually not need to file a tax return if your only income is from New Zealand employment and you have been on the correct tax code.

If you're working for an overseas employer, you'll need to include this amount on your Individual tax return - IR3. This is true even if you have the 4-year temporary tax exemption.

Earning income from self-employment

If you're self-employed, you'll need to report your income and claim expenses in an Individual tax return - IR3.

If you're getting schedular payments, you'll need to give your tax rate to the payer on a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C form.

[Schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

  

If the amount of tax you owe at the end of the tax year is over $5,000, then you'll need to pay provisional tax during the next tax year.

[Tax rate notification for contractors IR330C 2024 (PDF 83KB) Download form](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir300---ir399/ir330c/ir330c-2024.pdf?modified=20240829014518&modified=20240829014518)

Interest you earn in New Zealand or overseas

If you become a New Zealand tax resident, you'll need to let your New Zealand bank or financial institution know so they can deduct [resident withholding tax (RWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={BEA5D13B-2EC0-45C7-881F-46537F7BF005})
 from any interest you earn.

You'll need to provide them with your IRD number and elect your RWT rate on the form they provide. If you do not, your bank or financial institution will use the highest rate.

The financial arrangements rules may apply to interest you earn. If you go over certain thresholds, you'll need to use a method that spreads your income or expense over the arrangement's term. Whether or not you need to use a method, you'll usually need to calculate a base price adjustment when the arrangement finishes.

You need to declare interest you earn overseas even if it is not brought into New Zealand and even if tax has been deducted in the overseas country or territory. You may be entitled to a tax credit for income tax paid overseas. Double tax agreements may affect the amount withheld.

If you have the 4-year temporary tax exemption, you do not need to include foreign-sourced interest income in your Individual tax return – IR3.

Note that different rules apply if you invest in a portfolio investment entity (PIE). See our guidance for PIEs later in this list.

[Financial arrangements rules](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/interest-and-dividends/financial-arrangements-rules)

Dividends from shares in New Zealand

If you get dividends from a New Zealand company, you should get a statement showing how much [resident withholding tax (RWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={BEA5D13B-2EC0-45C7-881F-46537F7BF005})
 and imputation credits have been deducted.

If you need to file an Individual tax return - IR3, you'll need to enter these amounts correctly along with your gross income.

Dividends from overseas companies

If you have shares in a company which is not a [controlled foreign company (CFC)](/api/glossary/item?id={0794DF7E-BE76-431E-BB21-8E2BBC594B5B})
, you'll need to consider whether the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules apply.

If your holdings are over $50,000, you'll probably need to calculate FIF income using 1 of 5 methods. The most common method is the fair dividend rate. This method calculates your FIF income as 5% of your opening value plus an adjustment for any shares bought and sold in the same year. Any result will also be affected by currency fluctuations.

There are a number of exemptions and you should either:

*   read the Guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461
*   consult a tax professional if these rules might apply to you.

If you return FIF income, you do not need to put any dividends in your tax return. 

You may also need to make a disclosure of your interests but there are exemptions.   

If your holdings are under $50,000 and you do not choose to use the FIF rules, you'll need to put the dividend amounts in your Individual tax return - IR3. Note that you cannot claim Australian franking credits.

If you have the 4-year temporary tax exemption, you do not need to declare dividends from a foreign source or apply the FIF rules.

[Foreign investment funds (FIFs)](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign-investment-funds-fifs)

Portfolio investment entities (PIEs)

A portfolio investment entity (PIE) is an entity which invests contributions from its investors in different passive investments, for example KiwiSaver schemes. There are different types but the most common is a multi-rate PIE. These pay tax based on an investor's prescribed investor rate (PIR).

You'll need to advise your multi-rate PIE of your PIR. Your PIR is based on your income in the previous two income years. There are 3 PIRs: 10.5%,17.5% and 28%.

[Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) for New Zealand residents](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/income-from-portfolio-investment-entities-pies/portfolio-investment-entities-for-new-zealand-residents)

For the 2020 and earlier tax years, if your PIR is too low, your PIE income is included in your annual income tax assessment. If your PIR is too high, you cannot get a refund. It's important to review your rate each year.

From 1 April 2020, there is a new process to deal with under and over payments. A separate PIE calculation will be made using your correct PIR for the year. If any of your PIE income or loss was not taxed at your PIR, the tax difference will be included in your tax to pay or refund due as part of your income tax assessment.

Also, we can now instruct a PIE to change your PIR if we believe you're on the wrong rate during a year.

You can use our calculator to help find your PIR. Note that if you have the 4-year temporary tax exemption on most types of foreign income, you can use a 0% PIR if you invest in a foreign investment zero rate PIE.

[Find my prescribed investor rate](/roles/portfolio-investment-entities/find-my-prescribed-investor-rate)
 

If you invest in a PIE that is listed on a stock exchange (a listed PIE), any dividend paid will have a 28% imputation credit attached.  You do not need to include this dividend in your Income tax return. However, if your marginal tax rate is below 28%, you may want to include the dividends if you have other income taxed at source.

[Portfolio Investment Entity Guide IR860 2019 (PDF 558KB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir800---ir899/ir860/ir860-2019.pdf?modified=20240724043550&modified=20240724043550)

Interest in an overseas life insurance policy

Foreign investment funds, or FIFs, have already been mentioned for dividends from companies overseas.

FIFs are also relevant if you have an interest in a life insurance policy not offered or entered into in New Zealand.

If this may apply to you, we suggest you read the Guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461.

[Foreign investment funds (FIFs)](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign-investment-funds-fifs)

Controlled foreign companies (CFCs)

Controlled foreign companies are based overseas but controlled by a small number of New Zealand residents. The company must not be a tax resident in New Zealand or must be treated as foreign under a double tax agreement.

If you have greater than 10% ownership in a CFC, you may need to attribute income and include it in an Individual tax return - IR3.

You may also need to make a disclosure of your interests.

We recommend you consult a tax professional if the rules may apply to you.

[Controlled foreign companies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies/controlled-foreign-companies)

Foreign superannuation funds and pensions

Foreign superannuation funds are created outside of New Zealand to give retirement benefits to individuals.

If you were a New Zealand tax resident when you acquired the rights to a foreign superannuation fund, then the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules may apply.

They can also apply where you were a non-resident taxpayer when you acquired the rights and have previously applied the FIF rules consistently, having included FIF income in a return before 20 May 2013.

Since 2014, most withdrawals from foreign superannuation funds are dealt with under a separate set of rules.

You'll need to pay tax on lump sum withdrawals and transfers using either a formula or schedule method.

If you were a non-resident taxpayer when you acquired the right to a foreign superannuation fund, then you may be entitled to a 4-year exemption on lump sum withdrawals. This is different from the 4-year temporary tax exemption on most types of foreign income.

If you get a pension from a foreign superannuation fund, this will usually be taxable in the year you get it.

Social security pensions from New Zealand or overseas

You'll most likely need to include this income in an Individual tax return - IR3. If you come from a country or territory that has a DTA with New Zealand, you'll need to check that agreement. In most cases, New Zealand has full taxing rights on pensions, but not all agreements are the same.

Buying and selling property in New Zealand or overseas

A gain made from selling a property may be taxed if you had the intention to sell it when you bought it.

However, there are also bright-line tests which tax any gains from the sale of residential property regardless of your intention when you buy. Any gains need to be included in a tax return.

The bright-line tests apply to properties:

*   bought on or after 1 October 2015 to 28 March 2018 and sold within 2 years
*   bought on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years
*   bought on or after 27 March 2021 and sold within 10 years.

If you're an [offshore person](/api/glossary/item?id={C27574DA-8DD9-4D59-8794-E560E12FE3BB})
, you may need to have resident land withholding tax (RLWT) deducted from the sale. You can claim this amount as a credit when you include the gain in your tax return. 

[Buying and selling property](/property/buying-and-selling)

Rental properties in New Zealand or overseas

If your properties are in New Zealand, you'll need to pay tax on any profit you make. You'll need to keep receipts and detailed records of any expenses you claim.

If you have debt in relation to the property, you'll need to consider how the financial arrangements rules apply to you. You may need to spread any expenditure over the life of the loan.

[Financial arrangements rules](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/interest-and-dividends/financial-arrangements-rules)

  

If the debt is in a foreign currency, changes in the currency's value will affect your results and may lead to unexpected income. Also, if you have an overseas mortgage on your rental property, you may need to pay [non-resident withholding tax (NRWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={578794B4-48A0-426D-9A98-A7580953B8D5})
 or approved issuer levy (AIL) in New Zealand on the interest paid overseas. We recommend the advice of a tax professional in these situations.

[Renting out an overseas property](/property/renting-out-residential-property/tax-by-rental-property-type/renting-out-an-overseas-property)

Buying and selling shares

If you buy and sell shares regularly, you may have to pay tax on the gains. 

If the shares are in overseas companies and you're in the FIF rules, you do not need to include any gains separately as they will be taken into account in the different methods.

[Foreign investment funds FIFs](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign-investment-funds-fifs)

Trusts

If you're a New Zealand tax resident and a beneficiary of a trust, you're taxable on your worldwide beneficiary income. This includes income from any trusts settled overseas.

If you do receive money or property from overseas, including inheritances, we advise you to read the following interpretation statement. It explains distributions from foreign trusts.

[Interpretation statement - IS 19/04 - Income tax - Distributions from foreign trusts (Tax Technical)](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/interpretation-statements/is-19-04---income-tax---distributions-from-foreign-trusts)

  

There is a special rule which applies where you become a tax resident after having been a non-resident for less than 5 years. In this situation, you're taxed on your beneficiary income and distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts for the period of your absence.

If you're a New Zealand tax resident and settle a trust overseas with no New Zealand trustees, you'll need to make a disclosure.

[Settlors of trusts disclosure IR462 2019 (PDF 76KB) Download form](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir400---ir499/ir462/ir462-2019.pdf?modified=20240724043511&modified=20240724043511)

Filing a tax return as a New Zealand tax resident
-------------------------------------------------

You may need to file an Individual tax return - IR3 to report your income from sources in New Zealand and overseas.

*   If you become a New Zealand tax resident during the [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
    , you'll need to show the breakdown between the New Zealand income you earnt as a non-resident taxpayer and your worldwide income as a New Zealand tax resident. Use the Individual tax return - IR3 to do this.
*   If you're leaving New Zealand and becoming a non-resident taxpayer, you may need to file a return for the income you earnt as a New Zealand tax resident.

Te tāke mā ngā kaiutu tāke kainoho-tāwāhi Tax for non-resident taxpayers
========================================================================

As a non-resident taxpayer, you'll generally pay tax on income you earn from New Zealand sources.

If you do not know your tax residency status, you'll need to work it out. 

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

Applying for an IRD number
--------------------------

An IRD number is a tax identification number that you'll need in most cases if you're earning income in New Zealand.

It allows you to pay the right amount of tax from the start instead of higher 'no-notification' rates.

[About tax codes](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/about-tax-codes)
 

How types of income from New Zealand sources are taxed
------------------------------------------------------

As noted above, being a non-resident taxpayer, you'll generally pay tax on income you earn from [](/api/glossary/item?id={D699D7EA-502F-4FEC-BA1E-B1423F20FA7C})
New Zealand sources.

### Double tax agreements

If your country or territory has a double tax agreement with New Zealand, it may affect how your New Zealand income is taxed.

[Double tax agreements (DTAs)](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements)

### Common types of income and exemptions

We've described some common types of income and exemptions in the following list.

International tax can be complex and you may want to consult a tax professional if you're in doubt about your situation.

Show all

Earning income from a New Zealand employer

If you're an employee, your New Zealand employer will deduct tax each time you're paid. This is called 'pay as you earn' (PAYE) and covers your income tax and an [ACC earners' levy](/api/glossary/item?id={D0B72E97-AB1D-4CE0-A5DA-DE14E7717B67})
, New Zealand's accident insurance scheme.

When you start working in New Zealand, you’ll need to give your employer your IRD number and tax code.

*   You provide this information on an IR330 form.
*   If you do not give this information to your employer, you'll be taxed at a higher rate.
*   If you are leaving New Zealand permanently before the end of the tax year your tax position may be able to be finalised. Contact us to discuss your situation.

Keep in mind that if you're in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period, you'll become a New Zealand tax resident. This status is backdated to the first of those days.

Also be aware that your immigration status may not allow you to work in New Zealand. However, you still must pay tax if you do work illegally.

You can work out your tax code with our online tool or in the Tax code declaration - IR330 form.

[Work out my tax code](/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b872A2B00-7959-4C6E-8D21-D7716E49753D%7d%40en)

Non-resident taxpayers with special rules

There are special rules which apply to certain non-resident taxpayers. These rules may, for example:

*   exempt certain income if the conditions are met
*   set a special tax rate.

You can find out more about the following types of non-resident taxpayers. Their links are listed after the introduction on the 'Non-resident taxpayers' page.

*   Diplomatic personnel
*   Experts and trainees visiting from overseas
*   Non-resident contractors
*   Non-resident crews of visiting pleasure craft
*   Non-resident employees
*   Non-resident entertainers and sportspeople
*   Overseas fishing crew working in New Zealand
*   Recognised seasonal employer (RSE) workers.

Interest, dividends and royalties

If you're getting interest, dividends or royalties from a [](/api/glossary/item?id={D699D7EA-502F-4FEC-BA1E-B1423F20FA7C})
New Zealand source, you'll probably pay [](/api/glossary/item?id={578794B4-48A0-426D-9A98-A7580953B8D5})
[non-resident withholding tax (NRWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={578794B4-48A0-426D-9A98-A7580953B8D5})
 on this income. In the case of interest, you may choose to pay the approved issuer levy (AIL) instead.

*   If the correct rate of NRWT or AIL has been deducted and it's your only income, then you will not need to file a tax return.
*   If the wrong amount of NRWT is deducted, you'll need to include the income in a tax return.

AIL is a levy of 2% instead of NRWT on certain debt. As a levy, you probably will not be able to claim it as a credit in your country or territory of tax residence, but it may be of use where you're not taxed on that interest.

There are default rates of NRWT, but if New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA) with your country or territory of tax residence, the rate will often be lower.

Note that different rules apply if you invest in a portfolio investment entity (PIE). See our guidance for PIEs in this list.

Portfolio investment entities (PIEs)

A portfolio investment entity is an entity which invests contributions from its investors in different passive investments. Non-resident taxpayers have a prescribed investor rate (PIR) of 28%.

However, if you become a notified foreign investor (NFI), you'll be able to invest in zero-rate or variable-rate PIEs and pay a lower rate.

If you stop being an NFI, you should consult the guide for PIEs - IR860.

Trusts

If you're a non-resident taxpayer and have settled a trust overseas which has a New Zealand resident trustee, there is a special disclosure regime. If you do not meet the requirements of that regime, the exemption for foreign-sourced income will be lost.

[Foreign trusts with New Zealand resident trustees](/international-tax/foreign-exemption-trusts)

  

If you're a non-resident beneficiary of a trust with income from New Zealand sources, you'll be taxed on any income and distributions you get from the trust.

*   You'll need to check with the trustee to see if they deducted the tax for you.
*   You may need to file a tax return depending on the type of income you get from the trust and complete an IR307 form if that income is from a foreign or non-complying trust.

Buying and selling New Zealand property

A profit made from selling a property in New Zealand may be taxed if you intended to sell it when you bought it.

There is also a bright-line test that taxes any profit on the sale of a residential property if it is sold within a set period of time, unless an exclusion or rollover relief applies. This is called the bright-line period.

For residential property sold on or after 1 July 2024, the bright-line test looks at whether your bright-line end date is within 2 years of your bright-line start date. The start date is usually the date the property’s title is transferred to you and the end date is usually when you entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell. 

For residential property sold before 1 July 2024, your profit may be taxable if the property was acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years. A property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into.

If it is taxable, you’ll need to complete a Bright-line residential property sales information form - IR833 and include any profit in your tax return.

If you're an [offshore person](/api/glossary/item?id={C27574DA-8DD9-4D59-8794-E560E12FE3BB})
, you may need to have residential land withholding tax (RLWT) deducted from the sale. You can claim this amount as a credit when you include the profit in your tax return.

[Buying and selling property](/property/buying-and-selling)

Rental properties in New Zealand

Any rental income you earn in New Zealand is taxable. You'll need to include this in your tax return and keep detailed receipts and records for any expenses you claim.

You may need to deduct [](/api/glossary/item?id={578794B4-48A0-426D-9A98-A7580953B8D5})

----------------------------------------------

You may need to file a Non-resident individual tax return - IR3NR to report your ongoing income from New Zealand sources after you have left New Zealand. However, you do not need to file if your only income is either:

*   from interest, dividends and royalties and tax has been deducted correctly.

Tax implications of working for accommodation
=============================================

Providing a person with accommodation in exchange for work can have income tax and GST implications, for both the provider and the worker. 

Common situations include seasonal and casual labour in the farming, hospitality and tourism industries. In these industries, backpackers, travellers from overseas, university students, seasonal workers and other casual workers are often taken on to harvest crops, pick fruit, garden, paint, clean, cook, make beds, work in bars and wait at tables. As part of the arrangement, they get a place to sleep and may also get food to eat instead of or as well as payment for the work.

Tax issues are not confined to these industries or situations. Potentially, there will be tax to pay whenever a worker does work for someone else who gives them accommodation as "part of the deal". This is whether the worker also gets money for doing the work or not. It could also be despite the worker being called a "volunteer".

The following is a summary of how the tax laws apply to the situation of working for accommodation:

### Income tax

Most income tax issues arise where work is done as an employee.The test for whether someone is an employee is discussed below but **if a worker is an employee, the "market rental value" of the accommodation must be treated as salary or wages**. It will be income to the worker and the employer will have to comply with the PAYE rules. This means the employer must include details on their current employer schedule or employment information and pay the worker's PAYE.

#### Market rental value

"Market rental value" is what is likely to be paid for similar accommodation in a comparable location by someone who is not related to the employer or employed by them. In a backpacker hostel, for example, it is likely to be the room rate for the room that the employee occupies. In a farming situation, there may be different factors to consider before arriving at a figure, but a judgement must still be made using relevant information and on a reasonable basis.

The employer is responsible for coming up with a reasonable estimate of the market rental value of the accommodation. You can find guidance on this in the Commissioner's Statement [CS 16/02 _Determining "Market Rental Value" of Employer-Provided Accommodation_](/commissioner-s-statements/cs-1602-determining-market-rental-value-of-employer-provided-accommodation)
. 

####  Who is an employee?

Whether a worker is an employee or not depends on the particular circumstances, and especially the terms of the agreement or arrangement to do the work. Various tests developed by the Courts must be applied.

It is possible that when all the circumstances of engaging the worker to do the work are considered, and the tests applied, it will turn out that the worker is an independent contractor rather than an employee or, in rare cases, a volunteer.

However, situations where it is more likely that a worker is an employee include where:

*   the worker is subject to expectations, restrictions and controls as to the hours they work, tasks they perform and how they perform them
*   the worker is required to do the work as a condition of being provided accommodation
*   the worker gets substantially less cash than might be expected for the work required but does get "free" accommodation instead
*   the worker is provided with the accommodation in consideration of or in return for providing work that is of benefit to the business
*   it is the sort of work that comparable businesses would engage employees to do.

These are not the only factors that might make a difference either way. It could make a difference if, for example, the worker has to provide the equipment needed to do the work or there is an agreement saying that someone is not intended to be an employee. These factors should be taken into account but, on their own, are unlikely to outweigh other factors.

It is especially important to recognise that a worker does not have to be getting paid cash to be an employee.

You can find more information on the tests to apply in:

*   our Interpretation guideline [_IG 16/01 Determining employment status for tax purposes (employee or independent contractor?)_](/internet/ird/technical-tax/interpretations/2016/interpretations-2016-index.html)
    , and
*   our guide [_Self-employed or an employee (IR336)_](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/gst/ir336-guide-self-emp-or-employee.html)
    .

#### Deducting expenses for tax

A business owner may be able to **deduct expenses** incurred in providing the accommodation and other benefits to a worker, whether the worker is an employee or not. This is subject to the normal deductibility rules, including limitations on capital and private expenditure. So, the cost of groceries, heating, and bedlinen, for example, should give rise to a deduction. The expense for some items should be apportioned if they are not only incurred for providing accommodation to workers. PAYE paid to Inland Revenue will also be deductible.

### Goods and services tax

#### Business owners

A business owner will be liable for GST on the supply of accommodation to workers, whether employees or not, if the accommodation is in a commercial dwelling such as a hotel, motel, farm stay, inn, hostel or camping ground. For example, this means that there could be GST payable on accommodation provided to workers in backpacker hostels.

The supply to the worker will be of "domestic goods and services" and the amount of GST payable will be based on the open market value of the services supplied by the worker. In the context of a backpacker hostel, it is likely to be an amount equal to the minimum hourly wage for the hours worked and how long the worker stays there - stays of more than 4 weeks attract less GST.

Providing accommodation in a dwelling is an exempt supply but a commercial dwelling is not a "dwelling". The business owner will therefore be able to deduct input tax on goods and services acquired for a commercial dwelling but not for a dwelling.

#### Workers

For the worker, it will be important to establish whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. An employee will not be liable for GST on the services they provide to get accommodation.

##### Note

If they are not an employee, they will need to register for GST (and charge GST on their services) where the consideration they receive in a year for their services (including the value of their accommodation from all the people they work for) is more than $60,000.

### Other issues for employers

#### Fringe benefit tax

Employers should note that non-cash benefits apart from accommodation can also mean they have **fringe benefit tax** obligations. The use of a motor vehicle and subsidised transport are common examples, but other benefits could also be subject to FBT.

#### Work permits and other legal obligations

Working for accommodation arrangements will often require issues other than tax to be considered. These include the requirement for some workers to have work permits before they can work in New Zealand, and compliance by employers with their obligations under employment law. For more information, visit the [New Zealand Immigration](http://www.immigration.govt.nz "This link to an external website will open in a new window.")
 and [Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment](http://www.employment.govt.nz "This link to an external website will open in a new window.")
 websites.

#### Tax code declaration and IRD numbers

Each employee must complete a [_Tax code declaration (IR330)_](https://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/businessincometax/ir330-form-tax-code.html)
 and [apply for an IRD number](https://www.ird.govt.nz/how-to/irdnumbers/apply-for-ird-number-index.html)
. Employers must also ensure that they meet their obligations under other legislation that requires them to make payments to Inland Revenue such as ACC, KiwiSaver, Child Support and Student Loans.

If you have any concerns about compliance with the tax obligations discussed here, you should discuss the matter with a tax professional or Inland Revenue.

Asset sales can be complicated since they often include different types of assets, each of which can be treated differently for tax purposes.

This page covers:

*   different parts of a sale and how they are treated tax-wise
*   potential issues that may be relevant.

We recommend you also speak to a tax professional about your specific situation, so the sale is treated correctly for tax purposes.

Show all

Depreciable assets and intangible property

You can claim depreciation on some types of capital assets including:

*   fixed assets like manufacturing machinery, vehicles or equipment
*   intangible property with a fixed useful life, like the granting of a lease or the right to use trademarks, patents, or copyrights.

If these assets are sold above their tax book value, then the seller must include the excess depreciation deductions they claimed previously as income in their tax return.

The buyer can claim a depreciation deduction on the asset bought.

Buildings are treated a little differently as the depreciation rate for buildings has changed over time, and depends on whether the building is residential or non-residential. If you sell a building we recommend you tax seek advice on whether the depreciation claimed (or not claimed) was correct and whether there is any depreciation recovery income that you need to return.

[Depreciation](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation)

Earn-out payments

These are when part of the purchase price is paid over time, depending on how the business performs.

Whether earn-out payments are taxable depends on the terms of agreement, so it’s worth getting professional tax advice.

In general, if the earn-out payments specifically relate to the sales and services provided and the performance of the business, then they’re taxable. The seller would need to declare income and the buyer can claim an expense each time a payment is made.

However, if the payments relate to the business’s assets and are really just paying off the purchase price over time, then it depends on how the sale price was allocated between taxable and non-taxable assets.

For example, if the sale price was allocated 50% taxable and 50% non-taxable, then the earn-out payments are allocated the same way. The seller would need to declare income of 50% of the earn-out payment, and the buyer could claim 50% of the payment as a business expense.

Employee leave and redundancy payments

The seller can claim the cost of employee leave provisions (for example, paying out holiday pay) as an expense in the year they sell the business.

The buyer can usually claim any redundancy payments they make (for example, an employee who is not needed under the new owner) as an expense, unless the payment was part of the sale price for the business.

Exit inducement payments

Generally, any part of an asset sale that relates to paying employees or independent contractors is taxable.

An exit inducement payment to an employee or contractor to leave their job or take another one may be agreed to be made and the cost of this paid by the buyer as part of the sale.

The employee or contractor must declare this income in their return and pay tax on it, while the buyer can claim this cost as an expense.

Financial arrangements

These are a type of transaction that has a lending component.

When a financial arrangement is sold, a wash-up calculation is needed to work out if there is any taxable income. This depends on what income the seller had during the term of the financial arrangement, how much they’ve already declared in their tax returns, and what expenses they’ve already claimed.

Financial arrangements can be complicated, so we recommend you speak to a professional tax advisor about your specific situation.

Financing costs

Interest and other financing costs related to the sale and purchase of a business can usually be claimed as an expense.

GST

If a business is sold as a going concern (while still operating and making a profit), and if both buyer and seller are GST-registered, then the sale can be zero-rated (GST charged at 0%).

If this is done incorrectly, or if GST is charged or refunded when it should not have been, that can lead to a large tax bill for either side.

Most asset sales that include land and buildings should also be zero-rated for GST.  

[Zero-rated supplies](/gst/charging-gst/zero-rated-supplies)

Goodwill

Goodwill may be either:

*   personal or business goodwill (attached to a business and dependent upon the personal relationships between the proprietor and customers)
*   local or site goodwill (attached to the location and premises).

Income tax depends on the type of goodwill sold. Working out what kind of goodwill is being sold usually involves a professional tax advisor.

If the sale involves both types of goodwill, then some parts of the payment will be taxable and some will be non-taxable. You'll need to allocate the payment accordingly. 

#### Personal or business goodwill  

Personal or business goodwill are generally non-taxable (capital) assets.

For example, payments for goodwill are not declared as income or claimed as a business expense when they relate to:

*   the good reputation of a business
*   an established client base
*   trade names, trademarks and logos.

#### Local or site goodwill  

Payments for goodwill are usually taxable when they relate to the physical premises the business operates from, or a lease or sub-lease.

This situation can come about when a seller grants a lease to the buyer (if they own the business premises), or as part of the asset sale sub-leases the premises (if they’re leasing it themselves) or assigns their lease to the buyer.

For example, payments for goodwill relating to the lease of licensed premises like hotels, restaurants or fast food outlets:

*   are included as income in the seller's income tax return
*   may be claimed as a business expense by the purchaser if they come under depreciation rules that relate to fixed life intangibles.

Land

The profits from the sale of residential land (and any buildings on it) is generally taxable if you bought the land either:

*   on or after 29 March 2018 and sold it within 5 years of buying it
*   intending to resell it and do so at any time.

Other taxable land sales include:

*   land bought for a business you or an associate run that deals in, develops, subdivides, or erects buildings on land
*   land bought, regardless of whether or not the land was bought for the business, if you or an associate run a business that deals in, develops, subdivides, or erects buildings on land and the land is sold within 10 years.

[Buying and selling property](/property/buying-and-selling)

[Associated with property](/property/buying-and-selling/when-you-need-to-pay/associated-with-property)

Lease inducement and surrender payments

Lease inducement and surrender payments are treated as a landlord’s income and can be claimed as an expense by the business tenant who makes the payment.

Legal and other sale-related costs

You can claim up to $10,000 of legal expenses in a tax year, including in relation to the sale of the business.

If legal fees exceed the $10,000 threshold and they are incurred in connection with valuing trading stock they may be deductible.

Other sale related costs include consulting and brokerage fees.

In general, these costs are non-taxable and cannot be claimed as an expense by the buyer as they relate to the long-term structure and holding of the business and are therefore capital in nature.

Patents, timber, mineral and other rights

Payments for the following rights and any other rights to take natural resources from the land are generally taxable:

*   patents
*   timber
*   minerals
*   removing crops from the land.

Personal property held for sale or exchange

For tax purposes, this is any property that is not land. If it’s bought with the main intention of reselling it, then the profit will be treated as the seller’s taxable income. The same can also apply if your business usually trades in the kind of property that’s being sold.

It’s also possible that if you buy and develop an asset, intending to make money by reselling it (for example, restoring a car or a vintage guitar) then your profit may also be taxable income.

These assets are effectively trading stock, which means the seller is taxed on the income and the buyer can claim the cost as an expense.

Restrictive covenants

An example of a restrictive covenant is when the buyer pays the seller not to open a similar business in the same area.

These payments are generally taxable to the seller, while the buyer can claim this cost as an expense in their income tax return.

Trading stock

Any part of the business sale price that relates to trading stock is taxable.

When trading stock is sold along with other assets, the total sale price must be allocated between the trading stock and other assets to reflect their separate market values.

Types of grants and subsidies
-----------------------------

Show all

Government grants and subsidies

Government grants and subsidies are voluntary payments made out of public funds by local and central government. They are made to further objectives in the public interest, such as to support a particular industry, cause or purpose, or in response to an event such as a natural disaster.

There are specific tax rules that apply to government grants and subsidies made to businesses. We call these the ‘grant provisions’.

Your business may receive other types of payments from the government that are not government grants. These might be donations, loans, various research and development payments or payments for services that you have provided. The grant provisions do not apply to these payments. Instead, your business will need to apply ordinary tax rules to decide if these payments are taxable or not. For example, if your business gets a payment for providing a service, this would usually be taxable.

The grant provisions only apply to grants and subsidies received by businesses. If you are in business and you receive a government grant or subsidy for your business, the grant may be taxable or non-taxable depending on what the grant was given for.

### Grants or subsidies to replace lost income or to supplement income

If your business receives a government grant or subsidy to replace business income that your business has lost or will lose, or to assist with cashflow, the payment will generally be taxable. The grant should be included as income in your business tax return.

If you use the grant to pay any expenses, your business can still claim a deduction for those expenses.

### Grants or subsidies for deductible expenditure or depreciable property

If your business received a government grant to fund either deductible expenditure or depreciable property, the grant will be non-taxable and you do not need to include it in your business tax return. However, you cannot claim a deduction for the expense funded by the grant. If the funding you received was less than what you spent, the part of the cost that is not funded by the grant is still deductible. Where surplus funds are spent on deductible expenditure, then deductions are denied to the extent of the grant payment.

### GST

Grants from central government are liable to GST (unless the supply is exempt):

[Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1992/0323/latest/DLM168851.html)

Grants are liable for GST and should be included in your GST return if all of the following apply:

*   you receive a grant or subsidy from central government (for example, from a government department)
*   you are, or are liable to be, GST registered
*   the grant or subsidy is for use in your taxable activity.

Sometimes central government may make grants to businesses through a delivery partner agency (who makes the payments on their behalf). In these cases, you need to consider whether, for GST purposes, the grant is actually from central government or the partner agency. If the grant is not from central government, see the next section for how to treat these payments.

Example: Government grant for operating expenditure

A $5,000 grant made by the government towards your business’s general operating expenditure will be non-taxable. You cannot claim a deduction for $5,000 worth of operating expenses.

Example: Government grant for depreciable property

A $4,000 grant made by the government towards the purchase of an item of depreciable property will be non-taxable and the value of the item for depreciation purposes will be reduced by $4,000.

Example: Government grant for employing staff

A $30,000 grant made by the government towards employing staff, where any surplus may be used for general operating expenditure will be non-taxable. You cannot claim a deduction for $30,000 worth of expenditure which may be a combination of staff costs or other deductible expenditure.

Non-government grants and subsidies or other payments

Your business may receive a grant or subsidy from an organisation that is not part of local or central government, for example, a charity, bank or industry group. Your business may also receive other payments that are not in the nature of a grant or subsidy such as relief payments from mayoral relief funds.

Non-government grants and other payments are subject to ordinary tax rules. This means that non-government grants or other payments that are for operational expenses or to replace lost income are usually taxable and your business can generally claim a deduction for the expenses incurred. These include payments to:

*   cover a shortfall in profits or to replace lost income
*   assist with cashflow
*   meet a specific operating expense such as to replace trading stock
*   cover other deductible expenses such as repairs and maintenance work to business assets.

Non-government grants for capital expenses are, generally not taxable. If the grant is for depreciable property, a depreciation loss may be available. However, the capital contribution rules may apply:

[Capital contributions](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation/capital-contributions)

Where the capital contribution rules apply, generally, your business can claim depreciation on the cost of the asset reduced by the amount of the grant. Non-government grants for capital expenses include payments to:

*   buy, add to or reinstate a capital asset that is part of a business
*   assist with starting or winding up a business or part of a business.

### GST

Unlike government grants from central government, grants from local government or non-government organisations are not generally liable to GST. Generally, even if you are GST registered, you do not need to include such grants in your GST return. However, if the payment is for goods or services you have provided, then it will be liable to GST if you are, or are liable to be, GST-registered.

Cyclone-related grants and subsidies

In early 2023, the government provided grants to businesses and other organisations following Cyclone Gabrielle. Specific information on these grants can be found here:

[January and February 2023 weather events](/topics/tax-relief-for-emergency-events/january-and-february-2023-weather-events)

Specified suspensory loan and repayment

If you are given a specified suspensory loan and you do not have to pay it back, the amount left unpaid is counted as gross income.

You'll need to split what is left unpaid into 3 equal amounts and add them as gross income across 3 years. 1 for the year repayment is no longer needed, and the others for each of the 2 years after that.

Wage subsidies and being an employer

When you get a wage subsidy, for example Work and Income’s Flexi-wage, you'll need to be registered as an employer. You'll also have your employer responsibilities, for example deducting PAYE and paying FBT (fringe benefit tax).

Tax on MSD benefit disallowed
=============================

2009 case note – Procedures in the Tax Administration Act the only way to challenge an assessment in the majority of cases - Income tested benefit, PAYE, ACC.

Case

Irene Yeh Leng Goh v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994, Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001

### Summary

An application for judicial review of a decision of the Commissioner was struck out. The decision related to tax payments made by the Accident Compensation Corporation ("ACC"), reimbursing certain previously paid benefits.

### Impact of decision

The Court reinforced the fact that the procedures in the Tax Administration Act ("TAA") are the only way to challenge an assessment in the majority of cases.

### Facts

Between March 1998 and September 2005, the plaintiff received a domestic purposes benefit (the "benefit") from the Ministry of Social Development ("MSD"). During that time, MSD had on behalf of the plaintiff paid PAYE to Inland Revenue on the benefit.

The plaintiff was later found to be entitled to compensation from ACC for the period in which she was paid the benefit. The plaintiff was entitled to a lump sum payment of backdated ACC weekly compensation in relation to the 1998 to 2005 income tax years as well as ongoing weekly compensation from November 2005.

Because the plaintiff was no longer entitled to the benefit she had previously received from MSD; ACC calculated the lump-sum backdated entitlement by deducting an amount equivalent to the gross amount of the benefit paid by MSD for that period.

ACC paid to MSD the net amount of the benefit previously paid and paid Inland Revenue an amount equivalent to the PAYE tax deductions that MSD had paid Inland Revenue on behalf of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff brought judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner, challenging his decision to disallow her claim to a tax credit of around $10,000. The plaintiff claimed that ACC had no statutory right to deduct an amount equivalent to the PAYE tax paid on her behalf by MSD, and that ACC had no power to pay that amount to Inland Revenue.

The Commissioner applied to strike out the plaintiff's claim on the basis that the judicial review proceedings amounted to an abuse of process and nevertheless the claim was untenable.

### Decision

**_Abuse of process_**

The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff's claim amounted to an abuse of process.

The Court referred to the Court of Appeal decision of _Westpac Banking Corporation v Commissioner or Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 99 (CA), for the proposition that the TAA makes it clear that in almost all cases the only means of challenging a decision of the Commissioner is pursuant to the procedures contained in Parts IVA and VIIIA of the TAA.

The Court held that as the plaintiff was not satisfied with the Commissioner's adjudication decision, she should have issued challenge proceedings pursuant to the TAA.

**_Claim untenable_**

The Court cited _Buis v Accident Compensation Corporation_ (unreported, HC Auckland, 6 March 2009) and agreed with Rodney Hansen J that the excess benefit payment is the "grossed up" sum. Both the net amount, after tax, and the tax portion are required by section 252 of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 to be withheld from the person entitled to compensation and dealt with in accordance with other statutory provisions or interdepartmental arrangements. The requirement is that the total sum is to be refunded to MSD.

The plaintiff is in the same position she would have been if she had never received the domestic purposes benefit in the first place. The ACC payment has replaced the benefit, and with a legitimate surplus to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff's contentions were correct, and by some means or another she was to get a credit for the $10,000, then she would receive a windfall of that amount.

Selling a business through a sale of its shares is often less complicated than selling business assets – a share price is agreed on for the shares and payment is made with no need to consider asset tax valuations.

Shares are personal property and when a sale involves the shares in a company you operate a business through gains are usually non-taxable. The amounts may be taxable if you:

*   originally bought the shares for resale instead of long-term investment
*   deal in shares.

In these 2 situations, any profit from the share sale will be taxable, and you will need to include it as income in your tax return.

This page covers tax-related issues or topics that can come up when selling shares in a business. We recommend you speak to a professional tax advisor about your specific situation.

Earn-out payments

These are when part of the purchase price is paid over time, depending on how the business performs.

Whether earn-out payments are taxable depends on the terms of agreement , so it’s worth getting professional tax advice.

In general, if the earn-out payments specifically relate to sales and services provided and the performance of the business, then they’re taxable. The seller would need to declare income and the buyer can claim an expense each time a payment is made.

If the payments only relate to the share sale price, then they’re usually not taxable.

Financing costs

Interest and other financing costs related to the sale and purchase of a business can usually be claimed as an expense.

GST

The sale of shares is usually GST exempt, meaning it's not subject to GST and is not included in a GST return.

[Charging GST](/gst/charging-gst)

Imputation credits

Currently, if a company has more than a 34% change in shareholder ownership due to the sale of shares, it cannot carry forward imputation credits it holds at the time of sale.

[Imputation for companies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies/imputation-for-companies)

Legal and other sale-related costs

This includes consulting fees, brokerage and other related costs. As most business share sales are capital (non-taxable) then the related costs usually cannot be claimed as an expense.

However, you can claim up to $10,000 of legal expenses in a tax year.

Other warranties or indemnities

Whether these are taxable depends on what the warranty or indemnity is in relation to.

For example, if a warranty given by the seller is in relation to a taxable asset, then the payment made by the buyer to the seller to obtain the warranty is likely to be taxable and able to be claimed as an expense by the buyer.

You may want to speak to a tax professional about your situation.

Restrictive covenant payments

An example of a restrictive covenant is when the buyer pays the seller not to open a similar business in the same area.

These payments are generally taxable to the seller, while the buyer can claim this cost as an expense in their income tax return.

Tax losses

Currently, a company needs to maintain minimum voting interests of 49% in order to carry forward tax losses. If due to the sale of shares this percentage is not met, the company cannot carry forward any tax losses made before it sold the business shares.

This report provides you with an update on various aspects of the High-Wealth Individuals (HWI) Research Project and attaches a copy of the draft report. Our last progress update report was dated 30 November 2022 \[IR 2022-445\]. Status of Project/initial conclusions 2. We attach a copy of the draft report of Inland Revenue’s High Wealth Individuals Research Project (the Project), which is nearing readiness for release. This draft is undergoing its second stage of peer review. The draft report outlines the results of our analysis to date, alongside the background Project methodology. The results at this stage are still preliminary. 3. As you are aware, the report investigates the average effective tax rates of a group of 311 New Zealand families identified as having high net worth for New Zealand. The comprehensive range of ETRs based on economic, rather than taxable income, and measured across key asset classes, is intended to advance our knowledge of the progressivity of the New Zealand tax system. 4. The data received from the Project population, together with information from Inland Revenue databases and other sources, has now been analysed within the Project, with appropriate conclusions developed. 5. At a very high level, those conclusions include: a. The median ETR calculated based on the personal taxable income of the group is approximately 30%. This is consistent with the progressive personal tax scale. b. The main source of untaxed income used in calculating the various ETRs in the report is capital gains (both accrued and realised). There is a high degree of volatility in capital gains or losses over the Project period and between asset categories. c. However, ETRs based on the wider concept of economic income are considerably lower than those based on taxable income. When all sources of income are included, the median Project period ETR of the families in the population is 8.2% and the weighted-mean ETR is 8.5%. 1 d. The inclusion of GST only has a small impact: the median Project period ETR is 9.0% when GST is included (a difference of 0.8 percentage points). Next steps in the Project 6. Following completion of the second peer-review process at the end of February, any recommended amendments will be made in March. Results are subject to verification, which will occur during February 2023. It is expected the final report will be published in April 2023. 1 Including imputed rents in income.

We will provide you with a copy of the final report prior to publication. 8. A copy of the final report will be made publicly available on the Inland Revenue High-Wealth Individuals Research Project webpage. 9. A plan for communications regarding the release of the final report is being finalised. This will at a minimum involve the release of a press statement by Inland Revenue, alongside a High Wealth Individuals Research Project fact sheet and plain language one page summary. There will be some internal messaging within Inland Revenue to ensure contact teams are aware of the report. 10. We expect there to be some demand for pre and subsequent briefings to key professional groups. We intend to brief a small group of key stakeholders, on a confidential basis, the day prior to the release of the report. This will help ensure the report is accurately reported in the media. To that end we will prepare briefing material. 11. We are currently working with our marketing and communications team on how best to handle these steps. We will work with your office on release of the report and on any steps your office may wish to take. Key talking points 12. You may wish to have available some key points, when considering any external enquiries for example. We have included some key points and messages as an attachment to this report. 13.

It focuses on just over 300 of the wealthiest tax-resident New Zealanders and their direct household family members, in the years 2015-21. The Project, and resulting report, was the subject of specific funding in the 2021 Budget. The report will be presented early and under budget. 2 The Project paints a more comprehensive picture of the tax system and its progressivity (and therefore fairness) and gives Inland Revenue more robust evidence to provide tax policy advice. The principal approach is to measure the average effective tax rates (ETRs) of the high- wealth group, based on a comprehensive definition of income, and compare those to the ETR on income as defined by tax law (taxable income). 3 An (average) effective tax rate (ETR) is the amount of tax paid relative to a measure of income. Measuring ETRs relative to a comprehensive measure of income, including taxable and non-taxable sources, illustrates the extent to which high-wealth individuals earn income that is untaxed, or subject to lower tax rates than personal taxable income. The taxes included are personal, corporate and trustee tax. 4 The key findings show firstly that the taxable income of the group is subject to tax at a median ETR of 30%, consistent with the statutory personal tax scale. When certain classes of additional income, and their associated tax, are added, the ETR of the group over the Project period drops substantially. When all sources of income are aggregated the median Project period ETR of the families in the population is 8.2% and the weighted-mean ETR is 8.5%. The main form of additional income added is capital gains. Adding GST brings the median ETR to 9.0% 5 The report also finds that the high-wealth population earn a significant amount of income through trusts and business entities. Inclusion of the income from these structures significantly reduces the population’s ETRs. 6 Inland Revenue carried out this research by using its information base (and public databases) as well as refining that through collecting information from the high wealth individuals. 7 The Project methodology has been subject to comment from an advisory group of external economic, statistical and tax experts known as the Methodology Advisory Group. The Report’s findings have been peer reviewed by two reviewers. 8 For the Project, Inland Revenue has made use of a new statutory power to collect information for tax policy purposes. The power has proved effective. The high-wealth individuals concerned (and their advisers) have been very cooperative throughout the process. The overall response rate has been approximately 90%. 9 Inland Revenue has and will preserve the privacy and confidentiality of all information the Project has collected from the Project population– a comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment has been published. That information will not be used to reassess anyone’s taxable income and raw collected data will be destroyed when the report is finalised. The report does not disclose data on specific individuals and meets a set of confidentiality standards similar to those used by Stats NZ. 10 The report also looks at the ratio of GST to income across the New Zealand population. In common with other research, it finds that based on Household Economic Survey data for the general population, the GST-to-income ratio declines with income. This trend largely continues based on survey data from the high-wealth population, although data differences result in some volatility in the ratio. For the Project population, the inclusion of GST increased the median Project period ETR (based on economic income) by 0.8 percentage points.

This paper assesses the distributional impacts of GST at the household income and expenditure levels. 2. There is debate in the literature as to whether the distributional impacts of consumption taxes, such as GST, should be assessed relative to expenditure or income. This is because the GST to income ratio is significantly affected by savings and borrowings, such that results for an individual based on a single year’s income differ significantly to results over a longer period. Some argue that an expenditure base better smooths out these lifecycle effects. There are however conceptual challenges with both an income and an expenditure base. 3. Similar to the approach taken in recent literature (e.g., Fiscal Studies vol. 43.1 Reassessing the Regressivity of the VAT in OECD countries) we assess households’ GST burden relative to both an annual expenditure and income base, across income deciles. We use a similar method to that in the Fiscal Studies paper, although our analysis is based on the average income and expenditures per decile, rather than household unit record data as in that paper. This will reduce the accuracy of our results. We provide results for New Zealand based on Household Economic Survey data for the 2015/16 and 2018/19 years. 4. Our findings are similar to those in international literature. The GST to income ratio declines as income increases (i.e., GST is regressive with respect to households’ annual disposable income). This is consistent with higher deciles having higher savings rates. 5. Our results also show that the GST to expenditure ratio is broadly proportional or slightly regressive for households in New Zealand, depending on how the expenditure base is defined. The results are particularly sensitive to whether interest payments and contributions to savings (included in HES) are excluded from the expenditure base. The GST to expenditure ratio is broadly proportional when interest payments and contributions to savings are not included in the expenditure base, whereas it is slightly regressive when they are included. 6. We extrapolate our results to the high-wealth individuals (HWI) research population based on the mean and median family (taxable) income in this population. Adding in the high-wealth individuals results in an extrapolation of the above trends; for the GST to income ratio a declining trend continues. This result is based on modelling the expenditure of the high-wealth individuals based on the relationship between income and expenditure. We expect to be able to improve these estimates once we have survey data of the population’s expenditure (currently being sought in the HWI research project). IR2022/327: GST Distributional Analysis Page 3 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Purpose 7. This paper provides analysis of the distributional impacts of GST at the household level. Analysis Assessing the distributional impacts of GST 8. In the literature, there is debate as to whether the distributional impacts of consumption taxes should be assessed relative to annual income or expenditure. The results depend on which base is chosen. When considered as a portion of annual income, GST will appear regressive as higher income households tend to have higher savings rates and therefore lower consumption relative to income. However, when considered as a portion of expenditure, the outcome will depend on the distributional effects of exemptions from the tax. Both an income and an expenditure-based approach can be useful in providing a perspective on the distributional impacts of GST. 9. Measuring the GST burden relative to annual income allows a combined analysis with direct taxes – allowing an assessment of the distributional impacts of the whole tax system. Proponents of using an annual income measure also argue that an annual income measure is useful as the timing of taxes can be important, especially for credit constrained borrowers. For the high-wealth individuals research project, the GST burden of the cohort will be calculated to get a fuller picture of the total burden of tax paid by this cohort. 10. However, the GST to income ratio is significantly impacted by savings and borrowings, meaning that for an individual an annual measure will be significantly different to a measure over a longer period. For example:  As individuals who are currently higher income tend to save a greater proportion of their income, they typically have a low burden of GST relative to income. However, if they eventually spend that saved income it will be subject to a consumption tax at that point of time - and they may then have a high burden of GST relative to income. Therefore, using an annual income base for savers will make their single year’s GST to income burden appear lower than it will be across their lifetimes.  Further, for dis-savers, expenditure may be a better measure of an individual’s wellbeing than income. For example, someone who has retired but has savings, or someone who has inherited wealth, may have low income but high expenditure. These individuals will appear to be paying a high share of GST relative to income. However, their current income level does not give an accurate picture of their welfare level. 11. Analysing the GST burden relative to expenditure can smooth lifecycle effects. However, the argument in favour of an expenditure base is subject to limitations. For example, wealthy individuals are more likely to pass on significant wealth as inheritance and therefore they will not pay GST on their full IR2022/327: GST Distributional Analysis Page 4 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] lifetime income. 1 Further, as discussed later there are competing arguments as to what to include in an expenditure base, meaning there is no perfect base. 12. Given these competing arguments our analysis considers the GST burden both relative to annual income and expenditure. This is consistent with previous work such as Fiscal Studies vol. 43 paper, Reassessing the Regressivity of the VAT, Alastair Thomas, 2022 (referred to below as Thomas). However, an important point is that the distributional impacts of GST should be considered as part of the distributional impact of the tax and transfer system in totality. In particular, New Zealand’s tax and transfer system relies on tools other than GST to achieve progressivity and redistribution. Previous studies 13. Thomas (2022) assessed the distributional impacts of value added taxes (VAT) relative to annual income and expenditure for 27 OECD countries. The results are plotted below for the 10 income deciles (based on data collected in the Household Economic Survey (HES) 2016 for New Zealand). 14. The GST to income ratio for New Zealand follows a similar declining trend to that of other OECD countries. For the OECD average, the VAT to income ratio declines from around 10.4% in decile 2 to 6.9% in decile 10. 2 Figure 1: VAT-income ratio (%) by income deciles according to Thomas (2022) Source: Thomas (2022; Table 2, p32). 15. For the VAT to expenditure ratio, Thomas finds that most consumption taxes appear proportional or slightly progressive. Progressivity will occur for this ratio when exemptions from the VAT provide proportionally more benefit to low spending or income households (although the exemption may still provide a greater absolute benefit to higher income households). However, in the case of New Zealand when assessed relative to expenditure, Thomas found a small degree of regressivity. Our results suggest that whether GST to expenditure is 1 Black, Devereux, Landaud and Salvanes (2022), “The (un)Importance of Inheritance”, Working Paper 29693, NBER” show for Norway that wealthy individuals on average leave significant inheritance while lower wealth deciles do not. Available at: The (Un)Importance of Inheritance (nber.org) 2 Decile 1 can be difficult to interpret as incomes in this decile may not be representative of the resources of the individual (e.g., if there is an annual loss), hence we compare decile 2 and 10. IR2022/327: GST Distributional Analysis Page 5 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] regressive in New Zealand depends on how the expenditure base is defined (in particular, whether interest payments and contributions to savings that are included in HES expenditure are included). Figure 2: VAT-expenditure ratio (%) by expenditure decile according to Thomas (2022) Source: Thomas (2022; Table 3, p33). Methodology - Inland Revenue calculations 16. We have replicated the approach taken by Thomas to estimate both the GST to income and GST to expenditure ratio for New Zealand (for the HES 2015/2016 and 2018/2019 years). We have extrapolated the results to also estimate the GST burden for the median and mean individual in the HWI project cohort. Our results for both ratios are presented by income deciles. 17. We used Thomas’ findings as a benchmark for our results. We replicate Thomas based on HES 2015/2016 to benchmark our results. We also recalculated our model using HES 2018/2019. There are some differences in our approaches - Thomas used a microsimulation model to do calculations at an individual household level. We use decile averages of household income and expenditures. Our modelling choice simplified computations but is likely to be slightly less accurate. Use of decile averages also limits our ability to order individuals or control for the size of the household. Nevertheless, our baseline results are similar to those of Thomas, giving us confidence in our approach. Elements of the calculation 18. The ratios calculated are, for the median household in each income decile: 19. To estimate the GST burden, relative to expenditure and income, we need to estimate the following for the median household in each decile:  The expenditure base.  The income base. GST/annual income GST/annual expenditure IR2022/327: GST Distributional Analysis Page 6 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\]  Consumption subject to GST (to estimate the GST burden). Defining the Expenditure Base for the GST to expenditure ratio 20. To determine the expenditure base for the GST to expenditure ratio, we start with HES data (2015/2016 and 2018/2019) on median household expenditure by decile (both aggregate expenditure and by subclass). We then remove certain expenditures from the expenditure base. There are arguments to remove expenditures from the base, for example when they do not allow an unbiased comparison of different deciles, they are infrequent and volatile so a single year may be misleading (such as for large durable goods), or they are not considered expenditures on final consumption 3 (such as interest payments). 21. Given there is a degree of subjectivity as to what expenditures to remove from the base we undertook our analysis with different definitions of the base.  Following Thomas, we exclude rents from the base. This helps treat renters and owner-occupiers equivalently in our estimations. If we were to include the rent category, this could bias our expenditure base by inflating the annual expenditure of renters vis-à-vis owner-occupiers, because the HES does not include imputed rents on owner-occupied housing. This drawback could also be resolved by including data on imputed rents for owner-occupiers. This data may be available later in 2022, or 2023, when the Treasury envisages completing a research project in this area.  We also tested excluding all expenditures related to purchases of motor vehicles and the housing capital stock. This is on the basis that these items are significant and purchased infrequently, and for housing it has special treatment in the National Accounts. These exclusions from the expenditure base did not materially affect our findings (so we do not present them separately in our results for the GST to expenditure ratio).  Finally, we excluded all expenditure on loan servicing and contributions to savings (which are included in HES expenditure). This excludes interest payments, contributions to savings, fines and money gifts. The argument to exclude these items is that they are not part of final consumption expenditure. As you will see in the results below, our estimates of the GST to expenditure ratio are sensitive to these exclusions. Definition of income (GST to income ratio) 22. To calculate the GST to income ratio we use median disposable income by decile. Disposable income is used given that consumption is out of after-tax income. Disposable income also reflects the redistributive effects that income taxes have on low versus high incomes. We estimate disposable income based on household income (individualised) less tax (this may overestimate income). 3 As defined by the National Accounts methodology. IR2022/327: GST Distributional Analysis Page 7 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 23. Income is sourced from HES (except for top earners as discussed below). HES income excludes certain gains that would be considered to form part of ‘economic income’. For example, accrued and realised capital gains and retained earnings in companies and trusts are excluded. Given wealth is unevenly distributed (estimates suggest that the wealth share of the top net worth decile is around 60%) 4 it is expected capital gains would be disproportionately earned by those in higher wealth deciles. Estimating GST “paid” 24. GST paid for the numerator of both ratios is estimated from HES data. For both ratios, we take average expenditure per decile (less the expenditure excluded from the relevant expenditure bases, as per above) and remove items that are either exempt from GST or zero-rated. This amount is then multiplied by the rate of GST to work out GST paid per decile. 5 25. To select the GST exempt or zero-rated expenditures, we follow the tax law. In estimating the tax burden, the following items were treated as GST exempt or zero-rated: international flights and overseas accommodation prepaid in New Zealand 6 ; life insurance and fees for financial services. Further, interest payments, contributions to savings (like KiwiSaver contributions), money gifts, and fines are treated as GST exempt when included in the calculation. Extending the HES Data Sample for Top Earners 26. We have extended the approach to include the mean and median family from the HWI research project population (“top earners”). We do this based on information on the mean and median (family) 7 taxable income of the HWI families in the database created for the HWI project. 8 This allows us to model the GST burden for the high-wealth population as a proxy of high-income earners. Both the median ($355,000) and mean ($896,000) high-wealth family, based on taxable income, are in income decile 10. 27. Data on the top earners are limited and we do not know much about their consumption patterns. The HES is designed to sample overall population living standards and does not properly sample the top earners. Domestic and 4 Official Information Act Response 20210012 - Request for Documents on Monetary Policy - Received 18 Jan 2021 - Published 22 Apr 2021 - The Treasury. 5 The GST rate is 13% on gross expenditure (15% of net expenditure). 6 This category should also include expenditures on international flights and accommodation paid outside of New Zealand, but HES doesn’t provide reliable data at the decile level, so it is omitted. 7 For the HWI project the ‘family’ is the identified HWI and their partner, and dependent children. ‘Household’ is a broader concept and includes all individuals living in a household. We do not have data on income of HWI households, but the demographic characteristics of our data sample suggest that both household income and family income may be very close definitions. An average HWI family consists of 2 people, 66 years old. 8 We consider that a cash-based measure of income is appropriate to base expenditure estimates off, given individuals will not consume all capital gains as earned and because we model the relationship between cash income and expenditure. The cash-based income is also more easily comparable with income in HES. IR2022/327: GST Distributional Analysis Page 8 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] international literature on this topic is also scarce. Given this, our approach is to model the level and composition of expenditure of the top earners, based on income. Modelled results are subject to assumptions and therefore increase the uncertainty about the ratios for this cohort. The HWI research project will collect survey data on the expenditure of the high-wealth families. We expect that this data (although not as detailed as HES) will be more robust than the modelled results. We will update the model when we have this data. 28. We estimate HWI expenditure by modelling the relationship between income and expenditure and extrapolating this relationship. We first estimated the amount each HES expenditure subclass (such as food, clothing, housing, health or transportation) increases as income increases across the income deciles (the consumption income elasticity). We then use the elasticities to project what the expenditures on these items would be at the mean and median income of top earners, and the total expenditure for the mean and median family. The estimates are statistically uncertain but are in line with evidence from other studies. For example, Henry (2014) 9 documents that higher- income individuals in the United States tend to spend more as a proportion of income on goods and services that can be considered discretionary and less on necessities (such as food, healthcare, or utilities) than individuals with lower income. We observe similar patterns across the HES data. 29. We have verified our results against international literature on high- wealth consumption patterns. Our estimated average propensity to consume (APC), that is estimated expenditure as a proportion of income, is consistent with international literature on the APC of high-wealth individuals. For the high- income families, we estimate the APC to be around 51 percent for $355,000 median income (and around 44 percent for $896,000 mean income). For comparison, the median income decile 10 APC estimated by the Treasury is around 61 percent. In the US, the APC for high-income households is estimated to be around 44 to 48 percent 10 . New Zealand and US empirical literature documents that the APC falls with income and wealth 11 - richer people save more of their income than lower-income households 12 . Based on this comparison our results for the level of expenditure seem reasonable. 9 Henry LaVaughn H.

Finally, we multiplied the extrapolated expenditures by the GST rate to calculate the GST burden for the top earners. This approach is comparable to Thomas. We applied the same expenditure base and GST exclusions as for the HES data sample discussed above to calculate both ratios. 31. One caveat is that there is a difference between the definition of income used by Thomas, the HES, and the IRD HWI database. Thomas and the HES use self-reported total gross household income. Self-reported income is typically under-reported 13 . Taxable income used for the HWI cohort is the average family income of the HWI families between 2016 and 2020. We believe that the differences between self-reported and administrative data, and the differences between the definitions of family and household for HWI, have minimal material effect on our baseline results. Like HES income, taxable income excludes certain gains that are considered economic income, such as non- taxable capital gains. Results 32. The GST to expenditure ratio across income deciles in New Zealand is proportional or slightly regressive depending on the expenditure base chosen. The results are particularly sensitive to the inclusion of interest costs and contributions to savings in the expenditure base. When interest costs and savings contributions are excluded from the expenditure base a broadly proportional trend is seen (yellow line figure 3). However, when they are included in the expenditure base a slightly regressive trend is observed (blue line figure 3). This is because interest costs and contributions to savings are a higher proportion of expenditure of high-income households. There are competing conceptual arguments as to whether interest costs should be included in the expenditure base, complicating the analysis of a GST to expenditure ratio. 33. Other expenditure areas modelled as not subject to GST make little difference to the GST to expenditure ratio. Outside of rents, savings contributions, interest payments and financial services, items not subject to GST in New Zealand are relatively small in relation to expenditure over the income deciles. Overseas travel, credit services and life insurance have minimal impact on the GST to expenditure ratio. We also find it makes minimal difference to the ratio if purchases of cars and housing are excluded from the expenditure base. 34. Consistent with international literature, the ratio of GST to annual income decreases as income increases. The GST to income burden for decile 2 is roughly twice as high as for decile 10. As noted, the measures of income used in this analysis do not include certain sources of income such as capital gains. Given wealth is concentrated in higher deciles in New Zealand, including capital gains would be expected to reduce the ratio for higher deciles more than lower deciles. Note however, these results provide a point in time estimate and 13 Decoster A. Loughrey, J. O’Donoghue, and D. Verwerft (2010), “How Regressive Are Indirect Taxes?,” Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, vol. 29, pp. 326-50. IR2022/327: GST Distributional Analysis Page 10 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] are impacted by individuals’ saving and borrowing behaviour. If an individual spends all their income over their lifetime the GST burden will be broadly proportional to their income (however as noted earlier there is evidence from other countries that wealthy individuals are more likely to leave inheritance and therefore not spend all their lifetime income). 14 35.The trends continue when we extrapolate to the HWI population. For both of the ratios, when we extrapolate to the mean and median HWI family the trend continues (the large dots in Figure 3 and 4). For example, the ratio of GST to taxable income is lower for the mean HWI family (disposable income $612,550) than the median decile 10 family (4.4% for the HWI mean versus 4.6% decile 10, for 2018/19 excluding housing and cars). 36. This modelling is subject to several limitations. It is based on households, so cannot be used to identify individual circumstances. It uses aggregate data and assumptions which means the results are approximations. Any policy implications should be considered in light of how the overall tax and transfer system meets the Governments objectives, including objectives for efficiency and compliance and administrative costs. 14 Results for this ratio are presented to be consistent with the GST to expenditure ratio; where an item has been excluded from the comparable expenditure base (e.g., rents) any GST relating to that item is not included in the GST to income ratio.

The Financial Collection will provide survey data on the level and (high-level) composition of expenditure of the high-wealth population. We can then update our modelling of the HWI population based on the survey data. While survey data may underreport expenditure, we expect survey data will provide more accurate information on the level and high-level composition of expenditure of the HWI cohort than the modelled results. A further refinement of the methodology in this paper is to break down savings and interest expenses to understand their relative contribution to the GST to expenditure ratio. 38. We intend to include GST in the measures we analyse in the public report on the effective tax rates of high-wealth individuals. This is because GST represents part of the tax burden of high-wealth individuals. The Treasury will also model GST as one of the taxes they consider in their work on effective tax rates relative to economic income and expenditure across income deciles 1 through 10.

This report provides information on a subproject of the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project (the Project). It reports preliminary results on effective tax rates for income from listed company holdings for high-wealth individuals (HWIs). 2. Sixty members of the Project population were identified as having declared holdings in sixty-one NZX listed companies (this includes holdings through trusts). These individuals are the population for this report. 3. We compare the listed company population’s average effective tax rate (ETR) on taxable income to the ETR when their income from investments in listed companies is included. The additional income included is share price gains and losses on significant holdings of listed companies. Company tax is included as tax in the ETR. 4. Because this ETR analysis only requires access to Inland Revenue tax records and public information on the listed companies, we have done this analysis over a longer period than generally applies for the Project – from 2005 to 2021. For robustness we also use the period 2008-2019, to cover a single, full business cycle (referred to as the BCS scenario). 5. The population earned $954 million in taxable income over the period. By comparison, capital gains earned through listed company holdings totalled $3.4 billion. However, capital gains were heavily concentrated (the top quartile earned 96% of measured income). 6. We have calculated ETRs over the whole period (rather than annually), given there is significant volatility in listed company income. We present results based on the ETR of the whole listed company population and based on individuals’ ETRs. The whole population measure is equivalent to the (income) weighted mean. 7. The results show an ETR for taxable income, for the whole population (or weighted mean), over the period of 34.5% (BCS: 33.9%). 1 When capital gains from the listed company investments are included, together with an attribution of company tax, the whole population ETR is reduced to 11.1% (BCS: 14.3%). 8. For individual measures, the median individual had an ETR of 26.5% (BCS: 26.3%). That is, 50% of the population had an ETR above approximately 26% and 50% had an ETR below approximately 26%. 9. Several individuals have an ETR significantly lower than the taxable income ETR; 28% (BSC: 31%) of the population have an ETR between 0% - 15%. While low ETRs occurred across the distribution, those with the highest capital gains tended to have a low ETR. Lower ETRs are generated when an increase in share price (capital gain) is not mirrored by an increase in the listed company’s taxable income. 10. The population ETR (11.1%) is lower than the median individual ETR as individuals with higher capital gains tend to have lower ETRs and contribute a larger proportion to the population ETR. 1 The period includes some years when the maximum personal tax rate was 38% or 39%.

Referred/Not referred Felicity Barker Policy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / /2022 IR2022/395: Listed Company Workstream Page 3 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 13. The High-Wealth Individuals (HWI) Research Project (the Project) is measuring average effective tax rates (ETRs) for high-wealth individuals based on three measures of income: taxable income, gross-cash income (broadly, including realised capital gains) and economic income. 14. The Project will test the impact of the inclusion of different income sources (and associated tax) on a baseline ETR (as well as calculating an all-income source ETR). This paper presents preliminary results for the project workstream that seeks to measure the ETR of income from significant investments in listed companies (referred to as significant listed companies, or SLC). This workstream compares the ETR on personal taxable income to the ETR when listed company income is included, for a subset of the research population with SLC holdings. 15. For this paper, listed company income includes both dividends and (realised and accrued) capital gains and losses from the change in share price. These are components of economic income. Company tax (both foreign and domestic) is included within the measure of tax. 16. The analysis in this paper therefore measures the ETR on: • taxable income from all sources for individuals who own SLCs; and • taxable income from all sources and the component of economic income from investments in SLCs for individuals who own SLC. 17. Several assumptions are made in the analysis (such as the use of traded prices for sold shares) which mean that the results should be seen as approximations rather than precise estimates. Methodology Population and timeframe 18. Listed companies are included in this data set where an individual in the high-wealth population is listed as a significant shareholder on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX). In general, these individuals will hold at least 5% of the company, but may alternatively be an office holder. Holdings through trusts and nominees will also be captured. 19. There are 61 companies and 60 individuals in this population. 20. Effective tax rates are calculated for two periods: 20.1 First 2005 – 2021. 2 This is the longest period for which we were able to obtain data. This analysis can be undertaken over a longer period than the analysis for the rest of the Project as it is based on tax records and public data from the NZX. 20.2 Second 2008 - 2019. Estimates over the 2005 – 2021 period may be biased if certain phases of a business cycle are overrepresented. For robustness, the analysis also restricts data to 2008-2019 which some consider as the last full business cycle experienced in New Zealand. Estimates over this business cycle are denoted by BCS. The BCS has 55 companies and 51 individuals. 2 All calculations are average effective tax rates (rather than marginal effective tax rates) – that is total tax divided by total income. IR2022/395: Listed Company Workstream Page 4 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 21. ETRs are calculated based on the total tax and total income of the population – this is equivalent to the weighted mean. They are also calculated for individuals (that is, each individual’s total tax divided by total income over the period). ETRs are calculated over the entire period given that there is considerable volatility in an annual measure due to share price movements being volatile. Effective tax rate on taxable income 22. The ETR on taxable income is calculated from IRD tax data as personal tax/taxable income. Taxable income includes income from salary, wages, interest, and dividends. Some points to note are: • imputation credits on dividends received are included as tax paid; • foreign tax paid (and eligible for a foreign tax credit) by the taxpayer on foreign income will be included in tax; and • taxable income is gross of imputation credits and foreign tax credits (to ensure that taxable income is a pre-tax amount). Effective tax rate on taxable income plus capital gains from investment in significant listed companies 23. To estimate the impact on effective tax rates of listed company income, income and tax from listed companies is added to taxable income and personal tax as follows. 23.1 The additional income included is the realised and unrealised gain or loss from owning the shares in the SLC. Capital gains are calculated by taking the individual’s holdings at the last day of each quarter multiplied by the change in share price for the next quarter. Realised gains are thus included through changes in holdings and valued at the end of quarter trading price. We call this “measured income”. 23.2 The additional tax included is company tax (both New Zealand and foreign) paid by the SLC attributable to the shares owned by the individual. 3 The company tax is reduced by imputation credits (IC) attached to dividends from the company that are received by the taxpayer (to prevent double counting of the company tax). These adjustments effect both the numerator (tax) and denominator (which includes gross income) of the ETR formula. 4 24. This means the ETR formula is: ETR= 푃푒푟푠표푛푎푙 푡푎푥 푝푙푢푠 푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푐표푚푝푎푛푦 푡푎푥 푚푖푛푢푠 퐼퐶 푇푎푥푎푏푙푒 푖푛푐표푚푒 푝푙푢푠 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 푓푟표푚 푆퐿퐶 푝푙푢푠 푎푡푡푟푖푏푢푡푒푑 푐표푚푝푎푛푦 푡푎푥 푚푖푛푢푠 퐼퐶 Summary of results The ETR on taxable income corresponds to the expected average statutory tax rate for high income earners 25. The results show an ETR for the whole population (or weighted mean ETR) based on taxable income alone over the period of 34.5% (BCS: 33.9%). Note, the period 3 Tax on companies held in trusts may be marginally understated as we do not include any additional tax paid on dividends by the trust in addition to the amount paid at the company level (i.e., the difference between the 28% corporate tax rate and 33% trust rate). We do not think this will be significant given the size of capital gain income versus dividend income. 4 PIE income and tax are not included in this measure. GST or indirect taxes or levies paid by the individuals are not included as tax. IR2022/395: Listed Company Workstream Page 5 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] includes some years when the maximum personal tax rate was 38% or 39% (less of these years are included in the BCS resulting in a lower taxable income ETR). 5 26. This result is to be expected under the progressive rate system that applied over the period. For comparison the average effective tax rate for someone earning $250,000 in 2018 (when the top tax rate was 33%) would be just under 30% 6 . Capital gains are volatile and have little relationship to tax paid 27. The graph below presents the total measured income and total tax of the whole population on an annual basis over the whole period. The population earned $954 million in taxable income over the period. By comparison, capital gains earned through listed company holdings totalled $3.4 billion. The graph also shows the percentage change in the NZX index. 28. It demonstrates that there is little correlation between capital gains from listed companies and tax paid (personal and corporate) on an annual basis. It also shows that capital gains income is highly volatile and there can be periods of gains and periods of losses (where ETRs will be negative). There appears to be a reasonable correlation between the income of this cohort and the change in value of the NZX. 7 While there are a range of individual ETRs, higher capital gains are associated with lower ETRs 29. When capital gains from the listed company investments are included, together with an attribution of company tax for each year, the median ETR is 26.5% (BCS: 5 The top personal income tax rate was 33% from 1 April 2011 to 1 April 2021. It was 39% for income over $60,000 from 1 April 2000 to 30 September 2008 and on income over $70,000 from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. It was 38% on income over $70,000 from 1 April 2009 to 30 September 2010. 6 Treasury analysis. 7 Note that the shaded area represents the Business Cycle Scenario (BCS). IR2022/395: Listed Company Workstream Page 6 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 26.3%). This means that in each scenario 50% of the population had an ETR less than around 26.5%, and 50% had an ETR more than around 26.5%. The median is slightly below the ETR on taxable income for the population and the tax rate on corporate profits. 8 30. The histogram below presents the number of individuals by ETR band for both scenarios (the pink bar is those with negative ETRs). 31. Around a quarter of the population had an ETR between 30-35% in the whole period scenario (20% in the BCS). For these individuals, corporate profits broadly approximated capital gains and dividend income over the period. 32. However, several taxpayers had ETRs that were significantly lower than the ETR on taxable income; 28.3% of individuals (BCS: 31.4%) had an ETR between 0%- 15%. While low ETRs are seen across the population’s income distribution, individuals with higher capital gains tended to have lower ETRs. The median ETR for the top quartile of measured income is 8.9% (BCS: 7.8%). 33. A low ETR occurs where a taxpayer earned significant capital gains compared to company profits. In these cases, taxation of company profits and dividends did not well approximate the income to the individual (from capital gains and dividends), and hence these individuals have low ETRs compared to personal tax rates. 8 The corporate tax rate was 30% prior to 1 April 2011, and 28% from then. IR2022/395: Listed Company Workstream Page 7 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 34. ETRs could also be negative (where the individual made negative capital gains over the whole period, but the company still paid tax) or significantly above personal tax rates when capital gain income is low compared to corporate profits over the period. 35. In the graph below individuals are ordered by size of measured income (in quartiles) and a line-of-best-fit plotted for the whole period and business cycle scenario. In each scenario the ETR declines as measured income increases. This demonstrates that higher capital gains are generally associated with a lower ETR. 36. The line-of-best-fit is steeper for the business cycle scenario because by removing the gains made following 2019, some of the HWIs with relatively high ETRs are removed from the top decile (i.e., prior to the rise in the NZX in 2020 some HWIs had low levels of capital gains) and are placed in lower deciles. Note that this graph for the line-of-best-fit excludes observations that have an ETR greater than 50% and less than 0%. IR2022/395: Listed Company Workstream Page 8 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Capital gains reduce the weighted average ETR compared to the median 37. For the whole population or weighted mean (i.e., when all the income and tax for the whole population is summed or each ETR is weighted by its share of income) the ETR over the period is 11.1% (BCS: 14.3%). 38. This is significantly lower than the median individual ETR, as the highest measured income taxpayers have a significant impact on the whole population measure due to their relatively high income (the top quartile earned 96% of measured income). These individuals with high measured income have a lower ETR making the weighted mean less than the median. 39. Several sensitivity checks were completed on the group ETRs. 9 These did not materially alter the results and were generally in the order of 1 percentage point. Consultation 40. The Treasury has been consulted on this report. Next steps 41. Officials will continue to work on additional ETR analyses as data from the disclosure statements are received. These will add information on: • Real property ownership; • Portfolio investments; • Non-portfolio entities (more-than 10%-owned that are not publicly listed). 42. Further additions to the listed company methodology will be to add in companies listed on other exchanges and held by the HWI population and to calculate a realised capital gains only measure of income from listed companies for the purpose of the gross-cash income. 9 For example, the results presented here include years the individuals were tax resident and had holdings in the SLC. Also including years when the individual did not have holdings or was not a tax resident in the period had a minimal effect on the population ETR. Including company tax in the denominator had an impact of decreasing the ETR by .4 percentage points (BCS: .7 percentage points).

This report provides you with an update on various aspects of the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project. Collection of information 2. The family details questionnaire achieved a high response rate, giving us confidence that we had successfully contacted most of the individuals in the initial population. In February, the entity collection was sent to HWIs and their partners. The purpose of this collection is to identify all non-portfolio entities (and trusts) linked to the family unit. The questionnaire was due to be returned by 4 April 2022. At the date of this report, we have received around 360 responses with around 100 people having sought extensions. 3. The financial collection is planned for June 2022. This collection will ask questions on portfolio investments, trusts, real property, and realised capital gains. Methodology 4. The Project will use the following three income measures to calculate effective tax rates (ETRs): taxable income, gross cash income, and economic income. Foreign income will be included to the extent it is taxable in New Zealand. Capital gains will be included within the gross cash income (realised gains) and economic income measures (realised and accrued gains). 5. One principle we will follow in calculating ETRs is symmetry between the income definition and taxes included. This means that for gross cash income we will include the share of corporate or trustee tax relating to realisation events. For economic income, we will include the tax entities paid in proportion to the families holding of those entities. Some taxes will be excluded from our analysis on materiality grounds or because they are difficult to collect information on. 6. We intend to estimate GST paid based on HWI’s estimated consumption. We do not have direct measures of consumption of the population so will need to estimate their consumption. We are considering different approaches to this. 7. Gifts and inheritances will be included in our calculation of income to the extent that these gifts and inheritances subsequently generate income. We will seek information on the value of inheritances from the individuals. Data progress 8. Following the construction of our database, we can now provide summary statistics for the lead individuals from the HWI population on a taxable income measure. This information is already held by Inland Revenue in our database. IR2022/125; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 2 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Purpose 9. This report updates you on progress on the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project (the Project). 10. The major milestones in the Project since the last update have been processing the family details survey responses and issuing the second information collection, the entity collection. Collection of information Family details and entity collections 11. The family details collection has ended. This questionnaire achieved a high response rate, giving us confidence that we had successfully contacted most of the individuals in the initial population. The information has been processed and updated into our secure database ready for the next step of the process. 12. In late February, the entity collection was sent to HWIs and their partners. The purpose of this collection is to identify all non-portfolio entities (and trusts) linked to the family unit. As with the family details collection, these requests were issued under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) meaning that individuals are legally required to respond. 13. In the entity collection, non-trust entities are required to be disclosed where the family unit (including through trusts) owned more than 10% of the entity in any year from 2016-2021. Each family members ownership interest (percentage ownership) is then separately reported. Both direct and indirect interests in entities are required to be disclosed. For trusts, a trust is required to be disclosed if a family member was a beneficiary, settlor or appointer of a trust with gross assets over $1 million in any year 2016-2021. 14. The questionnaire was due to be returned by 4 April 2022. Some recipients (around 100) have requested and been granted an extension of time until 29 April. At the date of this report, we have received around 360 responses (out of a total population of around 650). 15. Our initial population was 406 high-wealth family units. We have excluded around 30 family units from the collection on the following grounds: compassionate grounds, non-resident for the entire period of the study, or they provided evidence that their net wealth was well below $20 million for the entire period of the study. Where we have good internal data on individuals excluded from the collection on compassionate grounds, these people may remain in the study population. Furthermore, there were 15 people in the population who we have not been able to contact through any means. This leaves a final population of around 361 family units for the collection. 16. The financial collection is planned for June 2022. This collection will ask questions on portfolio investments, trusts, real property, and realised capital gains. For entities income and balance sheet measures, Inland Revenue generally already has this information through the IR10 statement. There are however gaps in this information for the population. For this reason, we are intending to undertake a separate targeted collection of entity financial information in late June. This will involve only asking individuals for this information when we have insufficient internal information. s 9(2)(h) IR2022/125; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 3 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Methodology Update on methodology 17. We have held two meetings on the methodology with the Methodology Advisory Group (MAG) and a third will be held in April. As you will recall, the MAG is a group of 10 experts from the economic, legal, accounting and statistical fields. Three notes were prepared for the MAG, on income bases, included taxes and capital gains. Below is a summary of some key points. Income 18. The Project will use the following three income measures to calculate effective tax rates (ETR): i. Taxable income = Personal taxable income as defined by New Zealand tax law (this will include taxable capital gains). This provides a comparator for the other two measures, which use an income base broader than taxable income. ii. Gross cash income = Personal taxable income + untaxed realised capital gains and accrued gains on portfolio investments. 1 This measure is based on how a realisation-based capital gains tax may be designed. iii. Economic income = Personal taxable income + untaxed realised gains + accrued capital gains. 19. Economic income will also include a secondary measure that includes imputed rental income from owner-occupied housing. This is a measure of the value one obtains from living in their own home, as opposed to renting it out. 20. Foreign income will be included to the extent it is taxable in New Zealand. 2 Calculation of capital gains 21. Capital gains will be included within the gross cash income (generally, realised gains) and economic income measures (realised and accrued gains). 22. While any assets could potentially give rise to capital gains, we are limiting our focus to the asset types most likely to give rise to material and measurable gains. The assets that we will calculate capital gains for are: • real property (residential and non-residential), • businesses (companies, partnerships, and trusts), and • financial (portfolio) assets. 23. Capital gains will be calculated for the period of the study (2016 – 2021). Accrued gains (for economic income) will be calculated for every year of 2016- 2021, either based on modelled annual values or listed prices. As New Zealand does not have a capital gains tax, the calculation of realised gains for assets without a listed price requires the establishment of a ‘cost base’. We intend to use 1 April 2016 (or the 2016 balance date) as the valuation date for the cost 1 This measure is largely based on realised gains, however, to reduce compliance costs income from portfolio investment will be calculated as an aggregate of Closing balance less Opening balance (less contributions, plus capital pay outs). 2 This avoids many of the problems of whether and how to include foreign taxes in the tax measure, including how to source that information. It also avoids questions of how to treat gains and losses from currency movements, which in some cases may dominate other gains. For income taxable in New Zealand, foreign tax credits will be recognised. IR2022/125; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 6 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Analysing information Data progress – Taxable Income example 36. Following the construction of our secure database, we can now provide summary statistics for the lead individuals from the population on a taxable income measure. This information is already held by Inland Revenue. 37. Both taxable income and the ETR have been calculated using fields from the Individual Income Tax return (IR3). We still need to adjust for individuals who did not need to file an IR3 for a specific year, had negative taxable income, and include Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income and tax. 38. The summary statistics below include income received directly by the individual from: income with tax deducted, interest and dividends, Trust and Estate, Partnerships, overseas, property. See the appendix for further details on income types included. 39. We have calculated the ETR by taking the tax calculated on the above sources dividing by the above-mentioned taxable income. The analysis demonstrates current tax rates for individuals, that being the progressive marginal tax scale. The purpose of the taxable income ETR is to provide a comparator to the broader ETR measures we will calculate. 40.

This report updates you on progress on the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project (the Project). 2. The major milestones in the Project have been contacting individuals in the population and undertaking the first information collection (the family details collection). Contacting individuals and family details collection 3. In late October, 405 individuals were contacted advising them they are part of the Project. They were provided with a description of the Project and information on the upcoming requests. Their tax agents were also contacted. Agent authorisation was sought for the Project. A webpage describing the Project is on the Inland Revenue website. 4. At the initial letter drop, we anticipated there would be valid reasons for some people to be excluded from the population. Around 25 people have been excluded for reasons such as that they were never of high net wealth 1 , were non-resident over the relevant period, or are deceased or seriously ill and therefore lack capacity to respond. Individuals have not been excluded because their wealth declined over the relevant period as doing so would skew the results. Three people in the initial population have not been able to be contacted. 5. The first information collection involved sending letters requesting family details. These were sent to the Project’s population on 3 November 2021, with emails sent on 4 November 2021. These requests were issued under the new s 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Responses were required by 24 November 2021, although some extensions have been granted due to delays in delivery. 6. 7. Work is well underway preparing for the second information collection - which will collect information on the entities that are linked to the High-Wealth Families. Requests for this information are now due to be sent out early February 2022. Listed company workstream 8. Within the Project there is a listed company workstream that does not rely on collected information. 1 Our population has been split into family units (lead, partner, dependent children) that are smaller than the groups monitored by Inland Revenue’s compliance area (which may consolidate siblings with joint business ventures, for example). These smaller units have lower net wealth than the groups used for compliance reasons in some cases. This is the main reason some groups were found not to be high wealth despite being within the initial population. s18(c)(i) IR2021/592; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9. The listed company workstream will examine a subset of New Zealand's high-wealth individuals (HWIs) holding a substantial amount of wealth in publicly listed companies. This information will help Inland Revenue build an understanding of how income, particularly from capital gains, may lead to changes in measured income and effective tax rates. Furthermore, we do not anticipate additional compliance costs being imposed on the HWI population as a result of this workstream. 10. For each individual in the subset, longitudinal data on the income and capital changes (additional sales or purchases or changes in the structure of capital) derived from their holdings in a publicly listed company (or group of companies) will be collected from proprietary financial market terminals (for example, Bloomberg terminal). This information will be compared to longitudinal tax data on these individuals. This will give us a better understanding of how income flows from capital gains may lead to changes in measured income and effective tax rates. 11. To date, the listed company workstream has collected publicly available data on the subset of HWI groups and their holdings in publicly listed companies. 12. During December 2021, the listed company workstream will collect longitudinal data on the income and capital flows derived from each individual’s listed company holding. Use of section 17GB 13. Information for the Project will be collected under section 17GB of the TAA. When the Commissioner uses s 17GB of the TAA to collect information, there is a statutory limitation on the Commissioner using that information in proceedings. The Commissioner can take operational steps to ensure compliance with that limitation. For this Project, it means that information collected using s 17GB can be strictly ringfenced from Inland Revenue staff not working on the Project. This protects the integrity of future investigations by ensuring that information collected under s 17GB cannot be challenged. 14. One concern of individuals is that information they provide might be used to reassess their tax liability. By using s 17GB, we can reassure participants that their information will not be available for reassessment of their tax liability. 15. Section 17GB will be used each time information is to be collected from participants in the Project to ensure that all information collected receives the statutory protection in the section. Compliance strategy 16. We expect that some individuals will not comply with the information requests. We are developing a compliance strategy that is consistent with the Commissioner’s general compliance policy, such as ensuring that customers can get it right from the start, while reflecting the unique nature of, and challenges associated with, the Project. The compliance strategy will need to be iterative, taking account of individuals’ responses as these become clearer. 17. The strategy emphasises pro-active facilitation, with the aim of maximising response rates to the information requests while minimising the need for more formal compliance steps. The pro-active facilitation includes providing information resources for the individuals, working closely with their tax agents, and establishing a contact team to manage correspondence. A web-based ‘collaboration site’ has been established to share information, and a Methodology Advisory Group (see below) has been established to provide challenge and input into the methodology for calculating income and effective tax rates. IR2021/592; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 3 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. The request for information is broken into three stages. There will also be a staged approach to compliance, with an increased focus on enforcement in stages two and three, as compared to stage one (given the minor nature of the information sought at that stage). 19. At each stage of the Project, a follow-up letter will be sent to those who do not respond within the required timeframe. This has been done for the first information collection. 20. An option available to the Commissioner in the event of non-compliance is to seek court orders requiring the provision of the information. There are serious consequences for non-compliance with a court order under the TAA. It is also an offence under the TAA not to provide the required information. Methodology Advisory Group 21. A Methodology Advisory Group (the MAG) has been set up to advise and comment on the technical measurements of income and effective tax rates. The MAG is an external reference group made up of representatives from Inland Revenue and the economics and tax community. 22. The MAG will provide feedback on the work undertaken. However, we will continue to retain full responsibility for the work. 23. The MAG will help to improve the quality of the Project and thereby improve public perception and understanding of the Project. Supporting public debate of tax policy through improved information is a key outcome of this Project. 24. The focus of the MAG will be the technical methodology used in calculating measurements of income and effective tax rates. We are still investigating the focus for each meeting, but they are likely to include the following: • Definitions of income. • Calculation of effective tax rates. • Approaches to valuation of assets, such as unlisted companies. • The derivation of income measures based on the above. 25. It is planned that the MAG will convene quarterly, with the initial meeting scheduled to take place in December. Next steps 26. We plan to report to you in March 2022 to provide an update on the entity collection process and listed company analysis.

This report provides you with an update on various aspects of the High-Wealth Individuals (HWI) Research Project. Our last progress update report was dated 6 April 2022 \[IR 2022-25\]. Collection of information 2. Following completion of the family details questionnaire in November 2021, and the entity collection in February 2022, the third collection request, concerning financial information, was issued on 9 June 2022 as planned. 3. This seeks focussed information to complement data already held by the Commissioner or otherwise available. HWI households have until 24 August to respond to the questionnaire. 4. Response rates for the first two collections have been high; over 90% for the entity collection. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor compliance closely. 5. A subsidiary set of questions will be sent to a subset of approximately 80 - 100 HWIs in mid-July, targeted at obtaining certain financial data for individuals and entities (trusts, companies, and partnerships) for which we have insufficient financial data from returns and other sources. Methodology – listed company work stream, trusts methodology, and foreign income 6. Significant progress continues to be made on development of the analytical methodology including that relevant to particular categories of entities, and preparation for writing of the final report. 7. Two areas of conceptual difficulty relate to the measurement of foreign income and taxation, and to the treatment of income derived by trustees, including how this can reasonably be attributed to those HWIs connected to the trust. Papers on these issues have been prepared for the next meeting of the Methodology Advisory Group. 8. We have also made progress on the listed company workstream. This workstream uses publicly available data on shareholdings and prices of listed companies to calculate the capital gains and corporate tax from holdings of listed companies over the period 2004-2021. We will report to you on this workstream in August. Purpose 9. The purpose of this report is to provide you with an update on the HWI Research Project, specifically on the progress of the information collections and development of the methodology. We previously updated you on 6 April 2022 \[IR2022-125 refers\]. IR2022/355: High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 2 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Collection of information Entity and Financial collections 10. As previously reported, two collection exercises have been undertaken. The first, in November 2021, collected information about the HWI’s immediate family – domestic partners and dependent children - so that our analysis can be undertaken based on the family unit, comparable to Stats New Zealand’s Household Economic Survey. The second, in February 2022, asked for additional information concerning some entities such as trusts and companies. The criteria were carefully described in guidance issued to each HWI and domestic partner. 11. The response rate to these requests has been high. Although some responses are still being received, the overall rate is about 90% for both of these collections. 12. On 9 June 2022, the third information collection process was initiated using section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This collection uses the same mix of secure email and physical channels. The questions asked focus on filling gaps in our knowledge of the affairs of each HWI family, and do not generally cover information which we already hold or can reasonably access (e.g., most real property data which we can access through public records). 13. The main areas of inquiry, relating to the years 2016 to 2021 (except as noted), are summarised below. These were contained in a spreadsheet-based disclosure statement which each addressee is required to complete and return: (a) An estimate of household spending in the 2019 year (to assist with calculating the effect of GST) and a question about gifts and inheritances received in the last 50 years; (b) Real property information - the address of the family’s principal residence, and information on properties held by bare trustees or nominees to complement data we obtained from public records; (c) Details relating to trusts - for each in-scope trust, information about the relationship (settlor, appointor, trustee etc), real properties held, settlements made, distributions; (d) The portfolio investments of the family, including opening bank balances, fund balances, contributions and distributions; (e) Distributions, ownership changes, and capital investments into identified non-portfolio entities. 14. Initial feedback indicates that a number of individuals are already engaging constructively. Enquiries have been received through the helpline and some responses have already been submitted. We have sought to ensure in our guidance that the rationale for the questions is clearly communicated. 15. The HWIs have until 24 August to respond. Supplementary targeted requests during July 16. A supplementary set of requests will be sent in mid-July. It is expected that 80- 100 individuals will receive this targeted request. 17. The object of this targeted collection is to fill knowledge gaps on entities which Inland Revenue does not have sufficient existing data (from IR 10 and other resources) to calculate the various income measures. IR2022/355: High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 3 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. The work on design of this supplementary request is well advanced. Monitoring compliance 19. Although there has been a high response rate for the first two collections, we continue to review our compliance options. 20. We have used a number of approaches to support compliance, including having a dedicated email-based support unit, web resources, ongoing liaison with tax agents and advisors, and an ascending sequence of communications reminding HWIs of their obligations. We have also developed policies allowing for extension of time if needed. The key strategy, which has largely worked well to date, is about communication and persuasion. We have continued to receive responses to the entity collection over recent weeks. 21. At this point we have made no operational decisions about stronger compliance options, namely the use of civil court orders, or prosecution for failure to provide information, under the Tax Administration Act 1994. We will continue to consider our compliance strategy and options over the coming months. Legal questions raised by commentators 22. As mentioned at a meeting with you on 21 June, one of the interesting sessions at the International Fiscal Association (IFA) conference concerned the scope of section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act, which is the power we have used to collect information for the Project. This session was presented by barrister Andrew Butler. 23. In the presentation and subsequent discussion, the presenter and members focussed on the following points: (a) The power is new, enacted in 2020, and differs from existing information gathering powers through its focus on the purpose of tax policy improvement. (b) The protections built into the provision, to prevent wider use being made of the information gathered, are different from similar legislation (the specific example used was the Statistics Act) in a number of respects. Commentators raised the question of whether this was appropriate, or whether the protections in section 17GB should be strengthened. (c) That the BORA prohibition on unreasonable search is a relevant consideration in the use of the power. (d) A concern that other state agencies could adopt similar policy provisions over time, giving agencies broad powers to collect information from individuals. (e) The difference between collecting information for the administration of the tax system, which occurs largely outside public and political debate, and collecting information for policy development, which is often the subject of public and political debate, and whether this puts the Commissioner in an unusual or difficult position. 24. Many of these points have been raised by other stakeholders and have each been considered as we developed our approach to the collection of information for the Project. However, we took away three main points from the session. IR2022/355: High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 4 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] a. First, there is ongoing interest in the Project and the limitations on the use of the power at law, of which we need to remain cognisant. b. Second, as previously reported to you, stakeholders have some concerns with the design of the power that we will continue to monitor in our policy work. c. Third, the importance of ensuring adequate BORA input in the design of legislation. Methodology Update on issues for discussion at next Methodological Advisory Group (MAG) in August 25. Our methodology will be subject to peer review by an academic reviewer. In addition, the MAG, made up of 10 subject matter experts from outside Inland Revenue, has been formed to provide input into the methodology. This group last met on 13 April 2022 and is expected to meet again in early August. It continues to be a valuable source of insights into the approach we should take in our final report. 26. At the 13 April meeting, the group discussed a paper prepared by Inland Revenue staff on Valuation and Capital Gains in the context of establishing our income measures, including possible options for calculation of realised and unrealised capital gains. This included discussion on how unlisted companies would be valued (using Comparable Companies Multiples Analysis method), the classifications of real property assets and the use of 2016 values as the relevant cost base for realised gains (our measurement period is 2016-21). 27. Two topics which will be discussed in the MAG in August are areas of significant conceptual difficulty. These are our proposed approach to allocating income and trustee tax arising within trusts, and the way that we deal with foreign income and taxes. Trust income allocation 28. Income within trusts is likely to be a material component of the total income of HWIs and their families. To recognise this when calculating ETRs, we plan to calculate trust income consistently and then attribute that income to individuals who have a significant interest in those trusts. 29. When calculating economic income ETRs we intend to apply a similar approach to that used with companies. That is, deeming income to an individual to include any distributions received from the trust plus any increase in value of the trust (both realised and unrealised capital gains) and any income retained within the trust (undistributed). We will apply this across each asset class, for example, real property, portfolio investments and non-portfolio investments. To balance this, tax paid in ETR calculations should include any tax individuals personally paid on taxable distributions they received, together with a portion of tax paid by the trust over the examined period. 30. We propose to attribute the calculated accumulated income amounts to HWIs and their families on the basis of the trust’s relationship to them, using three methodologies. First, we will look at whether all of the trust’s beneficiaries are members of the HWI’s family. Then we will consider the degree of control the family held, for example through powers of appointment. Finally, if neither of IR2022/355: High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 5 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] those approaches applies, allocation will depend on the level of distributions made in the past (or to which an identifiable entitlement exists). Foreign income and foreign taxes 31. Our methodology proposes to include foreign income if practically possible. This would also include foreign income taxes if they are similar in nature to New Zealand income taxes which have been imposed on the foreign income as part of the ETR analysis. 32. It is often impractical and costly to access the information concerning both foreign income and taxes. We therefore propose the following approach to different types of foreign income for the economic income and gross cash income measures: a. Foreign portfolio income earned directly by individuals and trusts – this is income from investments such as foreign portfolio shares (FIF interests) and foreign debt. We will have the necessary income information from disclosures in the Financial Collection to include this income in the ETR calculation. We also have the necessary tax information from tax data bases and will include foreign taxes that are reported as “overseas tax paid” on the New Zealand tax returns (for the foreign tax credit). b. Foreign non-portfolio entities (usually CFCs) owned directly by individuals and trusts –if an individual or trust has received a taxable dividend from a controlled foreign company (CFC), or has attributed passive income, that income and the corresponding tax will be included in the ETR. However, due to incomplete information on the income and foreign taxes of the CFC itself, we are intending to not include its income in the income measures. It appears from our analysis that this ownership structure is not common, hence this will not have a material effect on the results. c. Foreign subsidiaries of domestic non-portfolio entities (for example, an HWI owns more than 10% of a New Zealand corporate group that has some foreign subsidiaries) – for listed non-portfolio entities (approximately 70), foreign income will be implicitly included. This is because capital gains from share price movements, included as income, means the value of foreign operations are included in the valuation. Both foreign and domestic tax are then included in the calculation. For unlisted companies, our internal data (such as IR 10 information) is limited to New Zealand group members, and as such we are not able to include foreign income and foreign taxes of the group for the measures (apart from information included with dividend income). Analysis and reporting 33. Given the response rates to the first two information collections, and progress made in collating and organising the department’s other information sources, we have been able to commence some analytical work. Work has also begun on designing and writing the final report itself. Consultation 34. We have consulted with the Treasury in preparation of this report. Next steps 35. We plan to report to you in August on the listed company workstream.
POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Date: 26 May 2021 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2021/197 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Note the contents of this report 14 June 2021 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Phil Whittington Chief Economist, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Principal Policy Advisor, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a)s 9(2)(a) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 1 of 10 26 May 2021 Minister of Revenue High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Executive summary 1.Inland Revenue received funding for its budget bid Ensuring the tax system is operating fairly for the two years to 30 June 2023. 2.In order to provide evidence-based policy advice and support perceptions of fairness about the tax system, it is necessary for Inland Revenue to be able to describe the progressivity of the tax system and accurately calculate the costs and benefits of any tax policy change. 3.However, a lack of information about forms of economic income which are generally non-taxable (especially capital gains) limits Inland Revenue’s ability to provide evidence-based policy advice on the above issues. Estimates from overseas indicate that a disproportionate share of the income of High Wealth Individuals (HWIs) is capital gains, implying that the information gap is most acute for HWI customers. As a result, being able to calculate the economic income of this group would improve Inland Revenue’s ability to provide advice. 4.Although internal and proprietary information can be used to partially construct measures of economic income across the income distribution, there are specific data gaps that require additional information to be collected from HWIs in order to reasonably estimate their economic income. 5.Inland Revenue intends to collect information to fill this gap using the new powers under section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The information collected will be directly relevant to calculating the economic income of HWIs. Furthermore, the information will only be used to provide advice for the development of policy for the improvement or reform of the tax system. 6.The information will be used to produce a comparison of the effective tax rates on economic income for HWIs. The HWIs that will be within scope for this research are those who are already in the compliance managed population, with an estimated net worth above $50m in a given year or who meet other criteria indicating substantial net worth. This report will be used to improve future advice on tax policy and to publicly report on the progressivity of the tax system. 7. 8.Our intention is to collect the highest quality information from customers in a timely manner, while also minimising the costs of compliance and protecting the privacy of individuals. 9.In order improve the quality and timeliness of the information collection, Inland Revenue intends to: •Limit questions asked to those that are necessary and reasonable to ask (given compliance costs and existing information) and clearly match the policy purpose, s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 2 of 10 •Ring-fence the collected information, •Consult in order to increase buy-in and improve the clarity of the questions. 10.We plan to begin consulting with the tax community from 14 June. The focus of this initial consultation is to raise awareness with those potentially impacted by the project, this will help increase public buy-in and compliance. 11. Recommended action We recommend that you: 12.note the contents of this report. Noted 13.refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance for their information; Referred/Not referred Phil Whittington Chief Economist, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 26/05/2021 Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / /2021 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 3 of 10 Background Why is Inland Revenue undertaking this research? 14.A key gap in Inland Revenue’s evaluation of equity and efficiency implications of the current tax system in an evidence-based way is information on full economic income –which is equal to an individual’s ordinary income plus accrued capital gains. 15.An individual’s economic income provides a more comprehensive view of their ability to pay than ordinary income, and by considering varying measures of income it is possible to more fully evaluate tax settings in an empirical manner in terms of efficiency, equity, and individual’s ability to pay. 16.For this evaluation, in theory, Inland Revenue would want information on the full economic income of all New Zealanders. Such a process would be extremely time consuming, and for most of the population it is unlikely it would produce significant additional insights to the work currently underway at Treasury with respect to effective tax rates (ETRs) and economic income across the New Zealand population (noted in Appendix One). 17.After discussing the work currently underway across the New Zealand Government and evaluating gaps in our knowledge, Inland Revenue intends to focus on building a picture of the economic income for HWIs based on their individual information, the information of related entities, and where appropriate information on associated persons. 18. 19.The below process outlines Inland Revenue’s intended use of the approved funding over the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years cumulatively ($5m). 20.Inland Revenue wants to provide a high-quality report following best practice for data and analytics – in order to produce the strongest evidence base for future tax policy advice. Such a process requires: •Inland Revenue to use internal expertise to update complex entity mappings associated with HWIs, identify and incorporate proprietary datasets, undertake an information collection program, verify information, and follow up with non-respondents in order to ensure high quality information is available for analysis. •The use of experienced internal microdata researchers to undertake comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the information in a way consistent with overseas research. 21. 22.The design process used could allow Inland Revenue to repeat the collection and report at regular intervals in the future. If longer-term funding was secured we aim to repeat this collection every three years to coincide with the regular Stats NZ s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 4 of 10 Household Economic Survey Wealth Module – allowing the Department to utilise insights from these data sources to build an understanding of tax paid as a proportion of economic income over the population as a whole. 23.An outline of other work underway across government on wealth and economic income distributions is provided in Appendix One. Priority information gaps – capital gains and wealth information for HWIs 24.The gaps in our current information and the impact this has was highlighted in the Tax Working Group (TWG) 2019 report. Two clear areas where Inland Revenue was unable to provide evidence-based policy advice were with regards to: •The progressivity of the existing tax system based on definitions of ability to pay/income that are wider than taxable income (e.g. economic income). •The quantum of accrued and realised capital gains in a given year, for both revenue estimates and measures of this specific income source. 25.Overseas it has been established that those with the greatest ability to pay (those with high economic incomes) tend to disproportionately earn their income from capital gains – and that high income earners receive a disproportionately large amount of total capital gains income. In Gravelle (2020) it was shown that the top 0.001% (approximately 1,500 taxpayers) of those who earn income in the United States sourced 56.4% of their income from realised capital gains. 1 This can be compared with all income earners in the United States where 9.1% of income is sourced from capital gains. 26.Knowledge of the capital gains earned by high income individuals in New Zealand would contribute to the ability to analyse both questions highlighted during the TWG process. 27.Given Inland Revenue’s current inability to provide a comprehensive answer to these questions, the TWG made the following recommendation: To better understand the profile of capital income, wealth and its owners in New Zealand, the Group recommends that the Government: •fund an oversampling of HWIs in existing wealth surveys •include a question on wealth in the Census •request the Department to regularly repeat its analysis of the tax paid by HWIs (Inland Revenue, 2016) •commission research, using a variety of sources of data on capital income (including administrative data) to estimate the wealth of individuals. 28.To improve Inland Revenue’s ability to answer questions related to economic income in the future, a time series of net worth profiles for the existing compliance managed HWI population and associated entities will be produced. For a population of around 400 compliance managed HWIs this corresponds to potentially as many as 30,000 entities that require valuation and attribution to the appropriate HWI group. 29.In building these profiles there will be significant investment in improving internal data availability and utilising external sources. However, there are data gaps that cannot be filled through existing processes related to HWIs or proprietary data on the New Zealand population. As established in report SNZ-MM2004, Stats NZ has 1 Gravelle, 2020. "Sharing the Wealth: How to Tax the Rich," National Tax Journal, National Tax Association; National Tax Journal, vol. 73(4), pages 951-968, December. IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 5 of 10 difficultly capturing representative information about the wealth of HWIs – and as the information collected is only for a point in time, they are able to say even less about capital gains income. 30.As noted in report T2020/2965 this gap in the wealth data reduces the ability to describe the wealth distribution in New Zealand, requiring government officials to impute data from unverifiable external sources (e.g. the NBR rich list) or based on the taxable income flow attributed to them. This creates significant uncertainty about how to measure capital gains income and thereby economic income. Furthermore, it generates uncertainty about the true wealth distribution in New Zealand. 31.As a result, additional wealth information for a period of time will need to be collected directly from HWIs for the policy purpose described above. 32.This information will be used to produce a public report on the effective tax rate paid out of economic income for HWIs, to be published in mid-2023 (the ETR report). This report will be used to answer questions related to the progressivity of the current tax system and the quantum of capital gains income, to provide an information base for future discussions about tax policy in New Zealand. Collecting information 33.Information collected will be combined with other sources of data which are relevant for these purposes, including proprietary data and information already held by Inland Revenue or likely to be collected in the future in administration of the Revenue Acts. One example is the trust administration information which is planned to be collected at about the same time (during 2022) under new rules also enacted at the same time as section 17GB.The exact nature of the trust data (e.g. as to settlements, trustees, beneficiaries etc) is aimed at ensuring compliance with current trust income tax rules but will contain information of relevance to the wealth information exercise. 34.This internal information collation exercise should provide a strong initial basis for evaluating the economic income of HWI groups. However, there are still likely to be gaps in the Department’s information about HWIs’ economic income on the basis of non-taxed income. As a result, Inland Revenue intends to use section 17GB to collect this information from HWIs. 35. The information Inland Revenue intends to collect 36.Inland Revenue intends to collect information that it is currently unable to build a reasonable measure of. We will not know the exact questions that will need to be asked until internal data cleaning is undertaken. 37.However, the nature of the likely information is clear. There will need to be collection for a number of personal items, loans, and bank deposit information in order to accurately calculate both wealth and capital gains income over the period. Furthermore, where there are non-tax paying entities (e.g. trusts that do not have s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 6 of 10 taxable income) that hold assets it will be necessary to directly ask for information on the assets held in these trusts. 38. 39.Future collection could also occur on a three-yearly basis, matching the collection schedule of Stats NZ’s Household Economic Survey Net Worth module. The information collected would refer to the prior three years, in order to generate a consistent annual time series that can be used for future policy reporting and estimates of tax progressivity. 40. 41. 42. 43. s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(g)(i) s 9(2)(h) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 7 of 10 44. 45. 46. Consultation 47.We plan on undertaking two levels of consultation for this work: initial consultation to communicate the rationale for the collection and technical consultation to socialise the design and questions asked. 48.The initial discussions will mainly be face to face with key groups and specialist practitioners. It is not proposed that we issue any major public discussion documents or undertake public awareness campaigns. These discussions are intended to be done quickly but are important from the point of view of maximising compliance with the requests for wealth information which will follow. The key goals are therefore: •Increasing public buy-in and compliance. •Understanding and minimising barriers to efficiently obtaining the information we require. •Refining the nature of that information. s 9(2)(h) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 8 of 10 49.The purpose of consultation is not to determine whether we should collect the information. It is to communicate that we are collecting this information and is focused on improving response rates and social buy-in for the collection. 50.First, a fairly short period of high-level and targeted consultation will take place as soon as practicable (termed “initial consultation”). This will mainly involve discussion with some key tax advocacy groups and the major tax advisers, with the goal of explaining how we propose to use the power. There will also be discussions with public sector agencies at this time, e.g. Treasury, Stats NZ, the Privacy Commissioner. 51.We intend to commence communicating and setting up the initial consultation no later than 14 June 2021 with a view to completing discussions and considering feedback by 30 August 2021. 52.The key areas to form the basis of discussion in initial consultation will be explaining: •that this collection will occur in early 2022; •the purpose of the proposed exercise; •how we intend to minimise compliance costs by focussing on our knowledge gaps; •how we intend to protect the private information of the HWIs and their families; •our proposals for ring-fencing, and the type of analytics to be used (and how that is severed from the Department’s operational functions); •our intentions with respect to enforcement of the power; •how the information will be used – the end products - and whether any of it will be publicly reported. 53.The second period of consultation will be more focussed on the actual knowledge gaps we will seek to fill by using the new power. This will occur in two phases and is expected to stretch out until March 2022. 54.Inland Revenue also intends to publish operational guidance on how the Commissioner will use this power prior to any notices being issued. Future reporting 55.We plan on reporting to you after key milestones. This would involve the following reporting timeline: •May 2021: This report outlining the purpose of the project and the intended collection method. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(g)(i) IR2021/197; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Rationale and intended work Page 9 of 10 s 9(2)(f)(iv)

This report provides you with an update on various aspects of the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project. Our last progress report was dated 15 July 2022, IR 2022-355. 2. The major advances in the Project since the last update have been the near completion of the Financial Collections, finalisation of the methodology and peer review for the first half of the draft report. 3. Significant progress continues to be made on the effective tax rate (ETR) calculations and analysis of economic income for the remaining chapters of the report and following up with the non-compliant individuals. Collection of information Financial collection 4. As mentioned in the last report, the Financial Collection (Collection 3A) was issued on 9 June 2022. The original due date was 24 August 2022, although a large number of extensions were granted. At the time of writing, we have had an 87% response rate with a further 2% who still have a valid extension. 5. The Supplemental Financial Collection (Collection 3B), referred to in the last update, was issued in early August 2022. This sought a limited amount of information on the financial statements of entities owned by members of the Project population, where Inland Revenue had insufficient internal information. Ultimately, only 45 individuals were required to provide information. At the time of writing the response rate for Collection 3B is 93%. 6. We are processing the information from the collections and have started to compile the data to enable the calculation of ETRs for economic and other types of income. For some individuals who have not responded to notices, internal and publicly available data about them will still be used in the calculations. Compliance approach 7. As we have indicated in earlier updates, our compliance strategy has been designed to maximise the response rate, to enable the best data to feed into the calculations. This strategy has included early and ongoing consultation with professional bodies, provision of information explaining the Project, clear signposting of next steps and the information required from individuals, a dedicated contact team offering assistance to complete the responses and sending reminder letters when responses are overdue. We have also actively worked with a number of individuals to assist their compliance. 8. This end-to-end approach to compliance appears to have paid off as can be seen from the very high compliance rates across all four notices. As well as the good response rates to the two Financial Collections set out earlier, the Family Details and Entity Collection had response rates of 93% and 94% respectively. IR2022/445; High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9. A small number of individuals who are thought to hold significant wealth, but who had not fully complied with Entity and/or Financial Collections, are being contacted and individually managed to ensure their information is included in the ETR calculations. . 10. Whether enforcement action should be pursued against non-responders is an operational matter we are currently considering. Methodology 11. The methodology we are using to calculate ETRs has largely been finalised. As discussed previously, a Methodology Advisory Group (MAG) has provided comment and input into the development of the methodology. Our approach has also been subject to peer review by two peer reviewers from academia. 12. Following discussions with the MAG in August, some changes have been made to the methodology for trusts to simplify the approach used to measure and allocate income from trusts. In short, where the family have a sufficiently strong relationship with the trust, the income from the trust included will be the trust’s taxable income plus the capital gains on the trust’s measured assets. There is a set of trust attribution rules to determine how much of the undistributed trust income, if any, is allocated to families. Overall, there are around 1100 trusts in our data set. Under the attribution rules around 7% of reported trusts will not have income allocated to the high-wealth families due to the family not having a sufficiently strong relationship with the trust and not having had received distributions from the trust over the Project period. 13. We have also adjusted the approach to calculating income from portfolio investments as there were some inconsistencies in the data reported. Our approach to calculating capital gains from portfolio income will now be based on the annual opening value of the portfolio multiplied by a market-rate of return for that year. 14. We are currently updating the modelling of the amount of GST paid by the high- wealth group based on their survey responses. This modelling will look at the GST to taxable income, GST to economic income and GST to expenditure ratio of the high-wealth cohort. We have also started to analyse the data on inheritances. 15. Following an examination of responses to the financial collection, we have made other methodology choices and refinements. We are planning to have a wrap- up meeting with the Methodology Advisory Group in mid-December. 16. There has been a recent study undertaken in the United States by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) that has a similar goal and methodology to our study. 1 The CEA study estimates the average Federal effective tax rate, based on a comprehensive measure of income, for America’s wealthiest 400 families for the period 2010-2018. They find an average Federal effective tax rate of 8.2 percent. Sensitivity analyses yields estimates in the 6-12 percent range. The authors state that the low ETR is driven by preferential tax rates for capital gains and dividend income. 17. The number of families and the period of analysis in the CEA study is comparable to our study (320 families and 2016-2021, respectively). Their approach is more simplistic than the approach we are using, as the CEA have only used publicly available statistics. They estimated the tax paid by the 1 The CEA is an agency charged with providing the President of the United States objective economic advice. https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/23/what-is-the-average-federal-individual- income-tax-rate-on-the-wealthiest-americans/ s 18(c)(i)
IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 1 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6 September 2021 Minister of Revenue High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress update Executive summary 1. The High Wealth Individual Research Project (the Project) is progressing to schedule. A report on the effective tax rate (ETR) on economic income for High Wealth Individuals (HWIs) will be finished by June 2023. Collection of the substantive financial information is planned to begin in April or early May 2022. 2. Our focus over the last few months has been on bedding down the methodology we will use to calculate ETRs, putting in place internal systems and processes, and collating the data on the high wealth individual population that is already available to Inland Revenue. 3. 4. ETRs will be constructed for a range of income measures, including economic income and comprehensive income (which is economic income excluding imputed income). Material progress has been made on identifying what information is needed to construct these measures of income. The components of economic income (the most exhaustive measure) that will be used can be summarised as taxable income, accrued capital gains, imputed income, and windfall gains. Broadly, this information will be sourced as follows: • Taxable income: Taxable income of the entities and individuals. Information is being sourced internally from tax returns. • Accrued and realised capital gains: In short, this is the annual change in value of net assets held by a HWI family unit. Most of the information will need to be sourced from HWIs during the 2022 collection exercise. Values relating to listed companies and residential property will be sourced from external databases. • Imputed income: Imputed income is essentially the consumption benefit of owned assets. Only imputed income from residential accommodation will be calculated for the economic income measure. This information will be estimated using property value estimates from an external proprietary database. • Windfall gains: Primarily gifts received by an individual. This information will be requested from HWIs during the 2022 collection exercise. 5. A significant focus for the project is creating accurate and complete “entity maps”. Entity maps link an HWI family unit with all the entities they have beneficial ownership in. 6. s 18(c)(i) s 9(2)(h), s 18(c)(i) IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 2 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. We intend to undertake an information collection exercise this year that will seek information solely on an HWI’s entities. This is planned to begin in November this year and to be completed before the 2022 collection exercise. 8. 9. The next stage of stakeholder communications will begin in September. This round of discussion is aimed at tax agents and experts and is intended to build understanding and buy-in to the Project. This is important as the information collection will be completed by tax agents. We plan on sending out the attached communications document to stakeholders as part of this next stage. 10. Upcoming milestones for the Project include (a full list can be found in paragraph 66): • the collection and confirmation of the entities HWIs have beneficial ownership in, to begin in November 2021, and • estimating HWIs’ economic income that is generated from listed companies (BN2021/331 refers), already begun. 11. s 9(2)(h), s 18(c)(i) s 9(2)(h) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 4 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Purpose 15. This report provides details on the progress made on the High Wealth Individual Research Project (the Project). The Project will construct and collect information to produce a report by June 2023 on the effective tax rate (ETR) on economic income for High Wealth Individuals (HWIs). 16. To date, progress has been made on: • identifying the population, the family unit, and their entities (“entity mapping”) • sourcing and preparing internal and publicly available data and identifying where gaps exist • setting up internal processes to improve the response rate and quality of responses to the upcoming information request, and • completing the initial consultation and starting the technical consultation. 17. Timelines and future milestones are also provided within this report. Identifying the population, the family unit, and their entities Population 18. 19. This population is not necessarily the wealthiest individuals, nor a representative sample of the top of the income or wealth distribution. A HWI includes family members and associated entities (see below). 20. For this Project, tax non-residents are being excluded from the population under analysis. Non-residents largely fall outside New Zealand’s tax base and therefore including them would provide little insight in describing the progressivity of New Zealand’s tax system. 21. Individuals on the HWI list that have been identified as deceased will not be included. However, if a successor can be linked to the wealth, that successor will be included. 22. 23. No further exclusions to the Project’s population are currently being considered. Excluding non-residents and the deceased, we expect the Project’s population to be approximately 350 lead individuals. s 18(c)(i) s 18(c)(i) IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 5 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Family unit 24. Consistent with the academic literature, this research will look at Economic Family Units (an individual, their spouse, and dependent children 1 ) to define the HWIs of interest. However, we do recognise the limitations of defining HWIs in this way, as families do not only share resources one way. Entities 25. Determining the entities that HWIs are linked to, and derive economic income from, is one of the most important aspects to get accurate. 29. The new financial reporting requirements for domestic trusts (focused on monitoring compliance with the 39% rate) is expected to collect the type of information needed for entity mapping. However, these new requirements are only for the 2021–22 and later income years, whereas this Project is collecting information for the 2016 to 2021 tax years (BN2021/331 refers). Furthermore, the trust project will not collect all the information this Project requires. For this reason, the Project will collect trust information as well. The beneficial ownership gaps will be filled through a separate information collection exercise to begin this year. 30. We will request information from HWIs on the entities and structures to which they are linked (see Appendix 1 – Entity Links). Under this request, we will provide HWIs with the entity maps we have created through collating and refining publicly available information and provide them an opportunity to verify and add to the entity maps. 31. This entity mapping information request is planned to begin in November this year and to be completed before the substantive financial information request (scheduled for late April/early May 2022). By understanding the HWIs’ entities before the substantive request next year, we will be able to design a more targeted notice that should lower compliance costs for HWIs in 2022, while at the same time reducing the opportunity for interpretative differences. 32. The November request for entity information will not be made under a legal provision (that is, it will be a voluntary collection). However, to support response rates and quality, we propose that the information received will be ringfenced in the same way that information collected pursuant to section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) will be (that is, only accessible to the Project). If 1 The definition of dependent child used for the Project is that used by Stats NZ within their household survey: a child in a family who is aged under 18 years and not in full-time employment. s 18(c)(i) IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 6 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] HWIs do not respond to the November request, we will assume their existing entity map is accurate. Nevertheless, we propose to include questions regarding entities as part of the compulsory notice in 2022. 33. HWIs will have until early February 2022 to provide the entity mapping information. Sourcing and identifying internal and public information, and identifying where gaps need to be filled Information required to estimate ETRs 34. An ETR is equal to the tax paid by an individual and the entities they have an interest in divided by a measure of the income earned by the individual and those entities. 35. While the tax paid by the HWIs can be accurately obtained, calculation of the ETR requires us to determine the appropriate measure of income. The final report will calculate ETRs for different measure of income – including economic income. Calculating and comparing various income bases helps provide context and allows for a number of views of a person’s ability to pay tax (see Appendix 2 – Other income bases) for a description of the income bases we will use). 36. The primary components we will use to calculate these incomes measures are: • taxable income • accrued and realised capital gains • windfall gains, and • imputed income. Sources of this information (gifts, taxable income, and accrued capital gains) 37. The only income source for which we have a complete picture is taxable income. Taxable income of the HWI population and entities (explained below) for the period of analysis is being sourced internally from tax returns. 38. Some information on capital gains can be sourced from external databases, and the Project will seek to use these registers and databases where available. The use of public registers and databases increases the accuracy of the data we use and reduces the compliance costs on individuals. The registers that have been identified as worthwhile investigating include: • residential property titles • Companies Office register data • listed company ownership registers and share prices – Bloomberg, and • other more bespoke registers, including aircraft and carbon credit registers. 39. In most cases, however, we will seek information from HWIs to estimate capital gains. To calculate an HWI’s accrued capital gains, we will seek to collect information on, or to estimate, all net assets that the HWI has available to them (in effect, creating a personal income statement and balance sheet). We can then estimate the change in net assets year-on-year that cannot be explained by gifts or taxable income. This is equal to the HWI’s accrued capital gains. 40. Imputed income is, broadly, the consumption value of assets a person owns. It cannot be measured accurately as it is purely an imputed value. For this Project, IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 7 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] we will provide income measures with and without imputed income. However, only the imputed income from residential accommodation will be included in the income measure. This will be estimated based on the annual value of property from external proprietary databases. 41. Information on the value of windfall gains (for example, gifts) received during the 2016 to 2021 tax years (“the period of analysis”, BN2021/331 refers) will be requested from HWIs. Calculating change in net assets 42. As discussed, we will estimate capital gains from the change in net assets. Net assets will need to be estimated in many cases. We have divided net assets into eight broad categories: 1. Consumer durables/personal assets; for example, jewellery, art, and car collections. 2. Real estate. 3. Unlisted companies. 4. Listed companies. 5. Non-corporate businesses; for example, sole proprietors and partnerships. 6. Personal financial investments; for example, share portfolios and bank accounts. 7. Trusts (including entities held in a trust). 8. Foreign-held entities. 43. Indicators to support valuing these assets vary within each category. We have currently identified over 200 unique indicators that would be useful in estimating an HWI’s net assets. During the next three months, we will identify what data points are necessary and, therefore, what information we will request from HWIs. 44. We will not be asking HWIs to seek independent valuations of personal items or the businesses or property they hold. 45. Using internal valuation expertise, we have begun creating valuation models to use to estimate the value of unlisted/private companies and non-corporate businesses. Valuations of private businesses will always be an inexact art, but these models will help to ensure comparability and consistency to the extent possible. 46. For example, in the case of unlisted companies, information will be gathered on earnings for each year within the period of analysis. A range of valuation methods will be used to estimate the value of the company. This will then be compared to subsequent annual estimates to calculate a change in value of the company. 47. For trusts, we will collect information on all relationships an HWI has with a trust (trustee, settlor, power of appointment, and beneficiary) and impute a range of ownership values based on these relationships where the income cannot be accurately collected. 48. IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 8 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 49. Various statistical methods and assumptions will need to be made to estimate an economic income range and, subsequently, an ETR range for the Project’s population. Because an HWI’ net assets (unlike taxable income) cannot be observed, using various methods and creating a range will reduce the level of scrutiny and should therefore increase the recognition of the final result. Internal preparation of systems and processes 50. The substantive collection of financial account and personal item information to occur in late April or early May 2022 will be undertaken under Inland Revenue’s formal information-gathering powers (specifically section 17GB of the TAA). As previously reported to you (BN2021/331 refers), this will collect information for the 2016 to 2021 tax years. We have put in place internal processes for undertaking this collection. 54. To help ensure the information is properly ringfenced, work has been completed on preparing internal processes for collection. • Our collection and analysis platforms are secure, monitored, and ready for the quantity and type of non-tax data we expect to collect. Both platforms sit outside Inland Revenue’s tax collection application (START). • Only a small team of named data analysts, support staff and survey administrators will be able to view the individual responses. • We are working alongside the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to draft and publish a Privacy Impact Assessment for the Project. s 9(2)(h) IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 9 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 55. Compliance strategy 56. Ensuring good quality data and a high response rate will require a clear collection and compliance strategy. Our compliance strategy is designed to reflect best practice consistent with the Commissioner’s general policy. 57. The strategy will seek to deliver the highest possible level of voluntary compliance from the Project’s population. This will best ensure timeframes can be met. 58. A key part of our compliance strategy has been working with tax agents and other key stakeholders, such as the Law Society, in advance. During collection, support to HWIs (as well as advisors and agents) will need to be provided to answer queries. This will mainly be in the form of written/email communications. Phone support will be available where issues cannot be resolved by email, and this will be followed up with written confirmation. 59. 60. This messaging will outline that we may seek court orders and, in extreme cases, may prosecute for failure to provide the information. These options are a last resort, but the existence of these remedies may assist compliance with the notices. Communications with stakeholders 61. We have completed initial consultation on the Project with key stakeholders, including CA ANZ, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, and the Law Society. The purpose of this consultation was to raise awareness that a research project was forthcoming and to open relevant channels of communication with key players. As the collection will likely be completed by tax agents, we consider that improving their understanding and meeting their concerns will improve later response rates. 62. The consultation has been, and will continue to be, very targeted to a select group. Members of this group are either directly involved in assisting with the information collection exercise (tax advisors and umbrella groups) or stakeholders that will assist in ensuring the Project’s timelines are maintained (legal practitioners and advisory groups). 63. The consultation so far has been constructive, with stakeholders willing to engage and provide insights as to the best way to collect the needed information. Stakeholders are concerned the quality and timeliness of responses may be impacted by factors such as: • whether Inland Revenue are truly able to protect client information and privacy • high compliance costs in collating the information sought, and • the feasibility of collecting and analysing this amount of information. They are also concerned that this is the first time Inland Revenue has used the new information collection powers and therefore special care should be made around privacy. s 9(2)(g)(i) s 18(c)(i) IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 10 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 64. The next stage of communications will begin in September. This phase will reach a wider group of advisors and stakeholders. It will involve considerably greater detail, and so it should build on the work done so far with stakeholders. It will focus on how the collection exercise will be run and how the information gathered should be dealt with, but it will also still address the reasons for the exercise and the statutory issues, such as privacy. 65. We plan on sending out the attached communications document to stakeholders as part of this next stage. Timelines and next steps s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 11 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix 1 – Entity Links 68. As part of our entity collection, we plan on requesting HWIs to provide information where they (or someone within their family unit) have any of the following types of entity links. These entity links have not been finalised, but they are based on similar exercises completed by the Australian Tax Office. 69. Requesting these entity links allows us to collect information on the wealth held in those entities and attributed to an HWI. However, this list does not include all assets held by an HWI (for example, residential property held in their own name and portfolio investments). These will also be requested from the HWI as part of the substantive net asset request.

Ultimately, economic income seeks to measure the amount of real goods a person can consume. This is because real consumption is the best indicator of material well-being. 71. A person’s economic income can be measured as the amount they spend on consumption plus their change in wealth. A person’s change in wealth is included because wealth can be viewed as deferred consumption. The person could have increased their consumption but chose to defer it by saving it, thereby increasing their wealth. 퐸푐표푛표푚푖푐 푖푛푐표푚푒=푐표푛푠푢푚푝푡푖표푛+푖푛푐푟푒푎푠푒 푖푛 푤푒푎푙푡ℎ 72. Direct savings 2 plus capital gains determine a person’s increase in wealth. This can be reflected within the calculation of economic income. 퐸푐표푛표푚푖푐 푖푛푐표푚푒=푐표푛푠푢푚푝푡푖표푛+푑푖푟푒푐푡 푠푎푣푖푛푔푠+푎푐푐푟푢푒푑 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 73. Consumption and direct savings are the person’s monetary outflows; that is, what the person allocates their money to, plus imputed income (which is part of consumption). The monetary outflows are equal to the monetary inflows to the person; that is, how much money they receive. Calculating a person’s monetary inflows (taxable income and windfall gains) is simpler than their outflows. Overall, four components are needed to calculate an HWI’s economic income: 퐸푐표푛표푚푖푐 푖푛푐표푚푒=푖푚푝푢푡푒푑 푖푛푐표푚푒+푤푖푛푑푓푎푙푙 푔푎푖푛푠+푡푎푥푎푏푙푒 푖푛푐표푚푒+푎푐푐푟푢푒푑 푐푎푝푖푡푎푙 푔푎푖푛푠 We can adjust full economic income in measuring an individual’s ability to pay 74. The final report will calculate ETRs for different measures of income. Each of these measures gives a different perspective on an individual’s ability to pay. For example, while economists generally think owned assets give rise to a stream of consumption benefits (imputed income), this does not give rise to monetary income from which an individual could pay tax. 75. A brief description is provided of the five other income base measures (alongside economic income) and how they differ from each other. 3 1. Money income: This is income that a person can readily retrieve. Liquid money that can be turned into consumption easily. Tax systems are generally based off this definition. • Income from labour (wages) and capital (dividends and rents). Realised capital gains, money gifts and public and private transfers received are also included. Excluded are imputed income and accrued capital gains. 2. Market income: This is income obtained by the person transacting in the economy. The person has sacrificed something to receive this income (for example, selling your time or expertise). 2 Direct savings – for example, putting money in the bank or purchasing more assets. 3 An example of imputed income is imputed rent (the amount a person would be willing to pay in rent to live in their owner-occupied property). “Gifts” encompasses inheritances and gifts in kind. IR2021/352 - High Wealth Individual Research Project: Progress Update Page 13 of 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Money income minus all gifts and transfers received. 3. Disposable income: Money available to the individual after transfers and taxes. • Market income after tax and all transfers received. 4. Comprehensive income: Similar concept to economic income. • Economic income excluding imputed income from the consumption of owned assets. 5. Taxable income: Defined within legislation and country specific. • As defined under section BD(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 76. Because imputed income is notoriously difficult to accurately measure and understand (even imputed income from residential accommodation), comprehensive income is likely to be the income base most widely recognised.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Income tax rates are the percentages of tax that you must pay.

The rates are based on your total income for the tax year. Your income could include:

*   salary or wages
*   a Work and Income benefit
*   schedular payments
*   interest from a bank account or investment
*   earnings from self-employment
*   money from renting out property
*   overseas income.

Some income is taxed before you get paid. This includes salaries, wages, Work and Income benefits, schedular payments and interest. The amount of tax your employer or payer deducts depends on the tax code and income information you gave them.

You might get a refund or have tax to pay at the end of the tax year if you've been taxed at the wrong rate during the year. It's important to use the correct tax code.

Other income is not taxed before you get paid. This includes income from self-employment or renting out property, and some overseas income. You pay tax on this income at the end of the tax year. The amount of tax you pay depends on your total income for the tax year. 

Income tax rates
----------------

New Zealand has progressive or gradual tax rates. The rates increase as your income increases.

| $53,501 - $78,100 | 30% |

Secondary tax rates
-------------------

If you have more than one source of income, you pay secondary tax. This helps you pay the right amount of tax so you do not get a bill at the end of the year.

The amount of secondary tax you pay depends on the secondary tax code you give your employer or payer.

### Secondary tax codes and rates from 31 July 2024

| Estimated annual total income from all sources | Secondary tax code for the second source of income | Secondary tax rate (before ACC levies) |

Disposing of trading stock

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

How you dispose of your trading stock, and to who, can affect how it is taxed.

Disposing of trading stock at below market value
------------------------------------------------

If you dispose of trading stock at below market value, it's usually taxed as if it was sold (and purchased by the recipient) at market value. This includes stock you take for your own use or sell to an associated person for less than market value.

In some situations, the disposal at a discounted or zero value is not treated as if it was sold at market value. This includes disposals:

*   to non-associated persons in the normal course of business, from 1 April 2024 (you must be able to show you have a business reason)
*   under a relationship agreement
*   to approved donee organisations from 1 April 2024.

[Approved donee organisations](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/tools/_/)

### Donating trading stock - temporary relief measures ending 31 March 2024

From 17 March 2020 to 31 March 2024, legislation made it easier for businesses to donate trading stock to approved donee organisations (which are mostly registered charities), public authorities and non-associated persons. 

Normally if you give your business’s trading stock away, you pay tax as if you'd sold it. But if you donated trading stock in this period, this might not apply. For example, to help people affected by COVID or because of the January or February 2023 weather events.   

This temporary relief means that you do not have to return deemed income as if you had sold the stock.

The Orders extending the temporary relief can be found on the New Zealand legislation website.

[Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2023](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2023/0016/latest/whole.html?search=y_regulation%40regulation_2023__rc%40rinf%40rnif_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1#LMS816932)

[Tax Administration (Extension of Period of Relief for Certain Disposals of Trading Stock) Order 2022](https://legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2022/0055/latest/whole.html)

You can find more information about the temporary relief in the Tax Information Bulletin.

**Disposal of business assets that include trading stock**
----------------------------------------------------------

In this situation you will need to know how income tax applies to each kind of asset, including trading stock.

During some events we may offer additional support so please check the specific events listed on this page or the Discretionary relief page.

[Discretionary relief](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-equalisation-scheme/discretionary-relief)

There is also information about extra relief and support for customers affected by the January and February 2023 weather events.

[January and February 2023 weather events](/topics/tax-relief-for-emergency-events/january-and-february-2023-weather-events)

### Unable to file or pay on time

We understand you may be unable to file or pay your tax on time and we have several ways to help you through this. You don’t need to contact us right now. Get in touch when you reasonably can.  You may continue to receive computer generated letters and notifications from us however we understand if you’re prioritising your immediate response and recovery.

### Paying in instalments

Once you know what you can afford to pay, you can set up an arrangement to pay in instalments. You can set this up in your myIR account or over the phone with us. This will stop late payment penalties from applying.

[Paying by instalments](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying/paying-by-instalments)

### Penalties

We can remit penalties if being affected by an emergency event stopped you from being able to pay or file on time. You will still need to file the relevant return and pay the tax as soon as reasonably possible. Contact us once you have made payment.

[Remitting payment penalties](/managing-my-tax/penalties-and-interest/penalties-and-debt/waiving-payment-penalties)

### Interest

For some emergency events we can remove interest that has been charged if you were affected. If you’ve been affected by an emergency event, find out if your interest can be removed.

[Discretionary relief](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-equalisation-scheme/discretionary-relief)

Support for you or your family

If you receive or pay Working for Families or Child Support, and your family’s situation has changed because of an emergency event, you may need to let us know.

### Child support

If your family income or situation has changed this may affect your entitlements or payments. If you have concerns or questions, or you are having trouble making our payments by the due dates, please call us on 0800 221 221.

[Estimating your income for child support](/child-support/managing/income)

### Working for families

Working for Families can be claimed weekly, fortnightly or at the end of the year.  As your entitlement is based on your yearly family income, your entitlement may change if your family income has been affected by the emergency event. You can update your estimated family income through myIR. 

There may also be event specific variations so please check the specific event information listed below

[Update my family income](/working-for-families/managing/update-my-family-income)

### Grants and relief payments for individuals and families

In an adverse or emergency event civil defence payments may be made available from Work and Income (Te Hiranga Tangata). Civil defence payments can help cover the costs of:

*   Food
*   Bedding
*   Clothing
*   Accommodation
*   Loss of income.

Because expenditure incurred on food, bedding, clothing and accommodation are all in the nature of private household expenditure, there are no tax consequences that arise if you receive these payments.

There are also no tax consequences that arise if a payment for loss of income is provided to a person who usually receives income from either employment or a benefit. If you are self-employed you may need to pay tax on the payment. Read 'Grants and relief payments for businesses' below.

### KiwiSaver – Savings suspension

A savings suspension is a temporary pause of deductions from your wages for up to 12 months. 

If you have been contributing for more than 12 months you can apply for a savings suspension through myIR. If you have been contributing for less than 12 months you will need to contact us to discuss this further.

[Taking a savings break - less than 12 months of contributions](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/making-changes-to-my-kiwisaver/taking-a-savings--break)

### Kiwisaver hardship withdrawal

You can apply for a hardship withdrawal of your KiwiSaver contributions if you have been contributing for longer than 2 months you will need to contact your Scheme Provider 

If you have been contributing for less than 2 months you can apply by downloading the KS5 on the IRD website and attaching this to a web message in myIR.

### Donations and Donee organisations

If you make a monetary donation to an approved charity you may be entitled to a tax credit.

[Tax credits for donations](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/individual-tax-credits/tax-credits-for-donations)

The page also includes a link to check whether the organisation you’re giving to is an approved donee organisation.

### Student Loans

There are a number of relief options available to people with student loans, including:

*   Self-employed people can apply to have their student loan assessments reduced
*   Salary and wage earners can apply for a reduced repayment deduction
*   Anyone who is studying full-time and is earning under the annual repayment threshold can apply for a repayment exemption.

These 3 options are available through myIR.

There is more information on our student loan financial relief on our website.

[I am having difficulty repaying my student loan](/student-loans/tracking-my-student-loan-balance/difficulty-repaying-student-loan)

Support for businesses and self-employed people

### Small Business Cashflow Scheme (loan)

If you have repayments for your Small Business Cashflow loan that you will not be able to meet due to an adverse event please contact us to talk about a variation to your repayment schedule.

### Provisional tax

If you think your annual income is going to drop because of an adverse event, you can choose to estimate your provisional tax for the year. This will reduce the provisional tax you have to pay. You may even get some of the provisional tax you’ve paid so far back. 

[Estimation option](/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/estimation-option)

### Income equalisation scheme

If you have a farming, fishing or forestry business you may be able to use the income equalisation scheme. We recommend you discuss the use of the income equalisation scheme with your tax advisor. 

When using the income equalisation scheme there are specific timeframes but you may be able to make a late deposit or an early withdrawal of funds in the scheme outside of the usual timeframes.  If you’ve been affected by an adverse event, find out if you can make a late deposit or an early withdrawal.

[Discretionary relief](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-equalisation-scheme/discretionary-relief)

### Donating your trading stock

Normally if you give your businesses trading stock away you still have to pay tax as if you had sold it. But if you've donated trading stock between 17 March 2020 and 31 March 2024, for example, to help people affected by COVID or because of the February 2023 weather events, this might not apply.   

[Disposing of trading stock](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/trading-stock/disposing-of-trading-stock)

### Grants and relief payments for businesses

During an adverse or emergency event, a range of grants or subsidies may be made available to businesses affected by that event. How these payments are treated for income tax purposes depends on where the payment originates from.

### Grants or subsidies received by businesses from public or local authorities

These are payments made by Government departments or other instruments of Government (public authorities), or regional and territorial authorities (local authorities), to assist businesses.  

For income tax purposes payments received from these sources are treated in the following ways:

*   Where the payment is provided to subsidise expenses that would either usually be deductible to that business, or used to acquire assets that are depreciable, the payment is not treated as assessable income, but
*   a deduction is not allowed for the expenses when they are incurred by the business (to the extent that they are funded by the payment).  If the payment is used to acquire a depreciable asset, depreciation may be claimed on that asset but the depreciable cost base of the asset must be reduced by the amount of the payment used to acquire it.  The business needs to keep records of any expenses incurred.

Where the payment is made as a top-up of the income of the business, made in respect of expenditure that is not ordinarily deductible to the business, or is used to acquire non-depreciable assets, then their receipt is treated in the same way as grants or subsidies received by businesses from all other sources, as set out below.  
  
Further information regarding grants or subsidies received by businesses from public or local authorities can be found in our booklet Grants and subsidies (IR249).

[Tax on grants and subsidies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/tax-on-grants-and-subsidies)

### Grants or subsidies received by businesses from all other sources

If a business receives a grant or subsidy from a source other than a public or local authority, it will need to pay income tax on it if:

*   the payment is to reimburse the business for a loss of income
*   the payment is received as a subsidy for expenses that would usually be deductible to that business. The expense may be claimed as a deduction when it is incurred by the business.
*   the business does not use all of the payment received and any remaining amount goes into the businesses general fund. This remaining amount will be taxable no matter what the payment was originally received for.

A business is not liable for income tax on a payment that it receives if:

*   the payment is received to help pay for capital assets or expenses that do not produce income, or
*   the payment helps pay for or reinstate a capital asset that will be used to produce income.

When the payment is used to get or reinstate an asset that is depreciable, the cost price of that asset (on which a depreciation claim is based) must be reduced by the amount of the payment received.

There is more information regarding grants or subsidies received by businesses from all other sources in our booklet on Grants and subsidies (IR249).

[Tax on grants and subsidies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/tax-on-grants-and-subsidies)

### Grants, subsidies and GST

Government grants and other payments made by public authorities or on behalf of the Crown, are liable for GST when received by a GST-registered person (or a person who is required to register for GST) in relation to their taxable activity.  The payments must be included as income in the GST return.

There is more information on grants, subsidies and GST on our booklet on Grants and subsidies (IR249).

[Tax on grants and subsidies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/tax-on-grants-and-subsidies)

### Cash donations or koha

The receipt of cash donations or koha will not have any tax consequences where it is provided to assist in alleviating the effects of an adverse or emergency event.

Grants, subsidies and other relief payments are complex matters so please discuss with your tax advisor.

### Insurance payout

If you're registered for GST (or required to be registered) and receive a payout relating to your taxable activity then you will usually need to account for GST on the payout.

If the payment is for lost trading stock (livestock, sales goods) or consumables (hay, raw materials) or for loss of income or profits, it is also taxable income.

If the payment is for depreciable capital assets (barns, sheds, manufacturing plant, kilns) the insurance amount is required to be accounted for in calculating the amount of recovery of past depreciation claims.

If you received insurance for property that is pooled for depreciation purposes, decrease the book value of the pool by the amount of the insurance payout.

Usually, the insurance is income in the year the insured event takes place, if the extent of the damage can be ascertained at that time. 

This is complex matter so please discuss with your tax advisor.

### Irreparably damaged or destroyed assets

An asset, other than a building, that is irreparably damaged is treated as a disposal or sale of the asset and triggers a gain or loss for tax purposes.  Therefore, if the sale or insurance receipts received are less than your remaining book value for the asset you can claim this as a deduction. Read our Depreciation (IR260) guide for further information.

[Depreciation guide - IR260](https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir200---ir299/ir260/ir260-2023.pdf?modified=20230411024220&modified=20230411024220)

This rule does not apply to farming, horticultural and forestry improvements such as tracks, yards, bores or wells etc which are amortisable under section DO 4 and Schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007 – you can't claim the remaining unamortised portion.

This is a complex matter so please discuss with your tax advisor.

### Clean-up costs

It may be difficult to determine whether clean-up costs are capital or revenue.

This is a complex matter so please discuss with your tax advisor.

### Building demolition

Building demolition costs are not deductible, unless it was a temporary building' – one that has a finite life and will be demolished or removed:

*   from a construction site where it was erected, either before or when construction has finished.
*   when plant or machinery is removed or replaced, and the building was erected to house such plant or machinery

This is a complex matter so please discuss with your tax advisor.

### Lost business records

If you have lost business records due to an adverse event, you can:

*   Contact your suppliers and ask for copies of invoices or statements issued.
*   Ask your employees to supply a copy of their copy of the employment agreement.
*   Get replacement versions for documents such as tax code declarations ([IR330](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/complete-my-tax-code-declaration)
    ), Kiwisaver enrolment information ([KS2](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/making-changes-to-my-kiwisaver/changing-my-kiwisaver-contribution-rate/change-my-kiwisaver-contribution-rate)
     and [IR346K](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/starting-employees-in-kiwisaver/auto-enrol-employees-into-kiwisaver)
    ) or vehicle logbooks.
*   Where copies or replacement versions are not available please record details as best you can of the relevant transactions including dates, names and contact details, a description of the goods or services and amounts paid/payable.

Where a reasonable attempt has been made to reconstruct business records within a reasonable timeframe Inland Revenue will not penalise you for incomplete or missing records.

### Money borrowed to keep your business going

As long as the borrowed money is used for business purposes, the interest is tax deductible.

Tax Residence – transition operational position
===============================================

This transitional operational position relates to IS 14/01, which covers the application of the tax residence rules. It includes practical examples.

Interpretation Statement 14/01 replaces a number of items previously published by Inland Revenue, most notably “Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) Rules 1989: New Residence Rules” (_Public Information Bulletin_ No 180, June 1989) (PIB No 180).

The Interpretation Statement applies from 1 April 2014. This means that when a taxpayer is deciding whether they are a New Zealand tax resident who needs to file an income tax return for the tax year ended 31 March 2015 and later years, they need to consider the analysis contained in the Interpretation Statement, and apply it to the relevant tax year.

There may be some situations in which the new Interpretation Statement gives a different result from application of the earlier PIB No 180.

As Inland Revenue considers that the legal analysis contained in the Interpretation Statement represents the correct view of the law, taxpayers can ask Inland Revenue to apply the analysis contained in the Interpretation Statement to tax positions taken in earlier years. The Commissioner will apply the principles set out in the Standard Practice Statement on section 113 on a case by case basis to determine whether to amend past assessments. These are currently set out in“SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016).

Taxpayers who have taken a tax position in past years, correctly applying the analysis in PIB No 180, will not be required to alter the position they have taken for those past years. However, those taxpayers should apply the analysis set out in the Interpretation Statement from the date of issue going forward.

In circumstances where the legal analysis contained in the Interpretation Statement has already been applied to a taxpayer’s affairs (including where they are involved in a current dispute) Inland Revenue will continue to apply that analysis, and will not apply the approach in PIB No 180 to amend the previous position.

If you have reached a view on your tax residence under the approach in PIB No 180 and are unsure about how the Interpretation Statement might affect you, please see our Frequently Asked Questions below. These FAQs provide practical examples of the application of this transitional operational position.

If taxpayers or tax advisors have questions about this transitional operational position or the frequently asked questions, they can email Inland Revenue at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7f3c6dff5c2d4cec3c2c9c4c2e7ced5c389c0c8d1d389c9dd)

### FAQs Interpretation Statement 14/01 – Tax residence – Transitional operational position

**Q1:** I thought that I was no longer **resident** for New Zealand tax purposes because I will be gone for three years. Would I be resident under the approach in the Interpretation Statement?

**A1:** In the past some people have considered that if you are away from New Zealand for three years you will not be resident here. There is no ‘three-year away from NZ’ test in the legislation. All of your circumstances need to be weighed up to determine whether you are tax resident in New Zealand.

If you thought you were not resident because you would be away for a particular period of time, we recommend that you reconsider your position in light of the approach in the Interpretation Statement. This is particularly so if there is a dwelling in New Zealand that you could potentially live in.

* * *

**Q2:** I concluded that I am **not resident** for New Zealand tax purposes under the approach in PIB No 180. Do I need to do anything as a result of the publication of the Interpretation Statement?

**A2:** The Interpretation Statement applies from the date 1 April 2014.

Taxpayers who have taken a tax position in past years correctly relying on the approach in PIB No 180 are not required to alter the position they have taken for those past years, but those taxpayers should apply the analysis set out in the Interpretation Statement from 1 April 2014 going forward.

As noted in the answer to Question 1, there is no ‘three-year away from NZ’ test in the legislation. A taxpayer who concluded that they were not resident in New Zealand simply because they would be away from New Zealand for a particular period of time, without weighing up all of the circumstances, may wish to reconsider their conclusion.

If, during your absence from New Zealand, there is a dwelling in New Zealand that you could live in and you have strong connections to New Zealand, then you may wish to speak to Inland Revenue or a tax advisor regarding your position.

* * *

**Q3:** I do not have a dwelling in New Zealand, but thought I was **resident** under the approach in PIB No 180. Would I be resident under the approach in the Interpretation Statement?

**A3:** If there is not a dwelling in New Zealand that you could live in on an enduring rather than temporary basis, you would not be resident under the permanent place of abode test. However, bear in mind that to be non-resident you will also need to:

*   have been out of New Zealand for more than 325 days in total in a 12-month period;
*   not have been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in total in a 12-month period since satisfying the 325-day rule; and
*   not be absent from New Zealand in the service of the Government of New Zealand.

* * *

**Q4:** I live overseas and Inland Revenue has told me my student loan is / is not interest-free; does the new Interpretation Statement change this?

**A4:** No. Some of the situations where student loans are interest-free even when you are overseas require (among other things) that you are tax resident in New Zealand. Inland Revenue has considered all applications for interest-free student loans on the basis of the view in the Interpretation Statement, so your position will not have changed as a result of the publication of the statement.

* * *

**Q5:** I live overseas and have a rental property in New Zealand, does this mean I am tax **resident** in New Zealand?

**A5:** You will not be tax resident in New Zealand solely on the basis of having a rental property here. One of the residence tests for individuals is the “permanent place of abode” test. A property that has always been held as an investment would not commonly be a person’s permanent place of abode, however, in some circumstances it could be. Your overall connections with the property and with New Zealand would need to be weighed up. We recommend that you seek advice if you are unsure about your tax status.

* * *

**Q6:** What if in previous years the application of the Interpretation Statement would have meant that I was a **non-resident**?

**A6:**As Inland Revenue considers that the legal analysis contained in the Interpretation Statement represents the correct view of the law you can ask Inland Revenue to apply the analysis contained in the Interpretation Statement to tax positions taken in earlier years. The Commissioner will apply the principles set out in the Standard Practice Statement on section 113 on a case by case basis to determine whether to amend past assessments. These are currently set out in “SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016).

* * *

**Q7:** If I have already had the legal analysis in the Interpretation Statement applied to my circumstances, can I ask for my position to be reconsidered applying the analysis in PIB No 180 because the Interpretation Statement applies from 1 April 2014?

**A7:** No. The Commissioner considers that the legal analysis contained in the Interpretation Statement represents the correct view of the law. Any request for a reassessment will be considered on the basis of the analysis in the Interpretation Statement.

* * *

**Q8:** Applying the Interpretation Statement I have determined that I am a **not** a New Zealand tax **resident** and therefore I do not have to file a tax return. Do I have to revisit this decision every year?

**A8:** No, If you have applied the Interpretation Statement correctly then unless your circumstances have changed you will remain a non-resident for tax purposes.

* * *

**Q9:** I no longer reside fulltime in New Zealand but applying the Interpretation Statement I have determined that I am a New Zealand tax **resident**. Do I have to revisit this decision every year?

**A9:** Your circumstances may change meaning that you are no longer a New Zealand tax resident. Therefore, it is advisable that you regularly consider your tax residency status.

* * *

**Q10:** Where else can I get information on tax residence?

**A10:** There is information on tax residence on Inland Revenue’s website. Alternatively, if you are unsure how the Interpretation Statement applies to you, contact your tax advisor.

If taxpayers or tax advisors have questions about the transitional operational position or the frequently asked questions, they can email Inland Revenue at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c591a4bd97a0b6aca1a0aba6a085acb7a1eba2aab3b1ebabbf)

When a company is considered to be a New Zealand resident 
----------------------------------------------------------

A company is resident in New Zealand if it meets any of the criteria in the following table. A detailed discussion of the rules can be found in IS 16/03 Tax residence published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016) from page 36.

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 28 No 10 - October 2016](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-28---2016/tib-vol28-no10)

  

| Criteria | Description |

| Control by company directors is exercised in New Zealand | *   Those acting in their capacity as directors control the company here, whether decision-making is confined to New Zealand or not. |

Rules around permanent establishments
-------------------------------------

Double tax agreements (DTAs) with other countries or territories generally provide that a non-resident company with a permanent establishment in New Zealand will be subject to New Zealand tax on income derived here.

The definition of a permanent establishment can vary across different DTAs, but often uses the criteria in the following table.

| Criteria | Description |
| --- | --- |
| A permanent establishment for a business is a fixed place where the business activity is wholly or partly carried on. | This includes:<br><br>*   a place of management<br>*   a branch<br>*   an office<br>*   a factory<br>*   a workshop<br>*   a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources<br>*   an agricultural, pastoral or forestry property<br>*   a building or construction site, installation or assembly project that lasts more than six months. |
| The company may also have a permanent establishment in other circumstances. | This includes:<br><br>*   carrying on supervisory activities in connection with a building or construction site, installation or assembly project for more than six months<br>*   carrying on activities which consist or, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources situated in New Zealand<br>*   using substantial equipment in New Zealand, for more than six months, for or under contract with the enterprise<br>*   performing any operations for the felling, removal or other exploitation of standing timber. |
| The company does not have a permanent establishment if it only uses facilities in New Zealand for certain activities. | These are:<br><br>*   storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise<br>*   maintenance of goods or merchandise that are used for the storage, display or delivery of the company's merchandise<br>*   maintenance of goods or merchandise that belongs to the company but are used for processing by another entity<br>*   maintenance of a fixed place of business that is only used for purchasing goods or merchandise or collecting information for the company<br>*   maintenance of a fixed place of business that is used for any other activity of an introductory or supporting nature, such as advertising or scientific research. |

Applying for an IRD number for your company
-------------------------------------------

If your company is deemed to be a resident of New Zealand, you will need to apply for an IRD number by completing an IRD number application - resident non-individual form, IR596.

Dual resident companies and determinations
------------------------------------------

It is possible for a company to be resident in more than one country. This can lead to a number of undesirable outcomes such as potential double taxation and restrictions on maintaining an imputation credit account. We recommend companies carefully review their governance arrangements so that dual residence does not arise inadvertently.

On the other hand, dual resident companies can be used in tax avoidance arrangements. To address these concerns, Article 4(1) of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting requires non-individual taxpayers that are dual residents to apply to either competent authority for a determination of their residency for tax treaty purposes.

If there is no agreement, treaty benefits will be denied or only granted to the extent to which competent authorities can agree.

Inland Revenue and the Australian Taxation Office have agreed an administrative approach under which eligible taxpayers can self-determine their residence without the need to apply for a determination. This approach is designed to reduce compliance costs for eligible taxpayers. You can see the eligibility criteria on Tax Policy's site.

[Australia and New Zealand's administrative approach to MLI Article 4(1) (Tax Policy)](https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2019/2019-other-australia-nz-admin-approach-mli-article-4-1)

  

Companies that are not eligible for the administrative approach will need to apply to a competent authority for a determination. See Tax Policy for details of how to do this if the application is made to the competent authority in New Zealand.

Te tūnga nōhanga tāke mō te tangata takitahi Tax residency status for individuals
=================================================================================

Becoming a New Zealand tax resident
-----------------------------------

You become a New Zealand tax resident when the first of these happens:

*   you’ve been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period
*   you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand.

### Counting the 183 days

Also called the 183-day rule, you'll need to know how to count 'days present' in New Zealand.

*   Parts of days (such as the day you arrive and leave) count as whole days towards the 183 days.
*   The 183 days do not need to follow each other.

Your New Zealand tax residency status is backdated to the first of the 183 days.

### A permanent place of abode

You have a permanent place of abode if you have a place where you usually live in New Zealand.

#### A place where you usually live in New Zealand

This is somewhere, such as a house, where you normally live in New Zealand even if you are not there all the time.

You do not need to own the place. The place does not need to be vacant while you're away. For example, you might own a house and rent it out when you are not there.

Put simply, it's somewhere you can call 'home' in New Zealand.

#### Ties to New Zealand

To have a permanent place of abode, you may need to consider what your ties are to New Zealand.

Some of the things to consider are:

*   how often you return to New Zealand
*   how long you spend here
*   your family and social connections
*   your economic interests, for example, investments or superannuation funds in New Zealand
*   your employment or business connections
*   whether you intend to return to live in New Zealand.

See 'Help for working out your tax residency status' on this page for more guidance.

### Seasonal workers or fishing crew from overseas

There are special rules if you come to work in New Zealand on a Recognised Seasonal Employer Limited Visa or a Fishing Crew Work Visa.

These rules mean you do not qualify as a tax resident after 183 days and are taxed as a non-resident as long as you do not establish a permanent place of abode.

[Working in New Zealand as a recognised seasonal employer (RSE) worker](/roles/non-residents/working-in-new-zealand-as-a-recognised-seasonal-employer-rse-worker)

[Overseas fishing crew working in New Zealand](/roles/non-residents/overseas-fishing-crew-working-in-new-zealand)

Knowing when you become a non-resident taxpayer
-----------------------------------------------

If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you'll become a non-resident taxpayer if you both:

*   do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand
*   are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period.

### Counting the 325 days

Also called the 325-day rule, you'll need to know how to count 'days absent' from New Zealand.

*   Parts of days you are in New Zealand (such as the day you leave) do not count as whole days towards the 325 days.
*   The 325 days do not need to follow each other.

If you meet this rule, your status as a non-resident taxpayer will be backdated to the first of the 325 days.

### Working overseas for the New Zealand government

You are still a New Zealand tax resident if you are sent overseas to work for the New Zealand government. It doesn't matter how long you're away for or whether you have a permanent place of abode here.

This does not apply to your spouse, partner or children who are leaving New Zealand with you. They need to work out their tax residency status based on their personal circumstances.

Tax rules for portfolio investment entities
===========================================

From 2007 portfolio investment entities can elect into tax rules under which they are not taxable on share gains in NZ and certain Australian companies.

##### Sections CB 4B, CP 1, CX 44C, CX 44D, DB 17(1) and (2), DB 43B, subpart HL, IE 1(2BB), KD 1(1)(e)(viii), KI 1, LB 2(2C), LC 1(1B) and (1C), LD 3(1B) and (1C), LD 8(1B) and (1C), LD 10, LD 11, ME 1(2)(k), MG 2(1), MJ 1(1), OB 1 and Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections 28B, 31B, 33(1), 36AB, 38(1B), 57B and 139AA(1)(ab) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; section 53(2) of the Companies Act 1993; sections 4 and 72B of the Public Trust Act 2001; sections 2, 5(4A) and 5(4B) of the Securities Act 1978; sections 2 and 42E of the Trustees Act 1956; sections 2 and 33B of the Trustee Companies Act 1967; and sections 2 and 12A of the Unit Trust Act 1960

From 1 October 2007, entities that meet the definition of a "portfolio investment entity" will be able to elect into new tax rules under which they will not be taxable on gains on shares in New Zealand and certain Australian companies. Portfolio investment entities will also generally pay tax on investment income based on the tax rates of their investors (capped at 33%), rather than at a flat rate. Income earned via a portfolio investment entity will not affect investors' entitlements to family assistance (under Working for Families) or their student loan repayment and child support obligations.

### Background

The new tax rules for portfolio investment entities have arisen from proposals in the Taxation of investment income discussion document (released in 2005) to alleviate a number of long-standing problems with the taxation of collective investment vehicles (CIVs).

The first problem the new rules address is the difference in tax treatment when people invest directly in New Zealand shares and when they invest in such shares via a New Zealand CIV. Someone who invests in New Zealand shares directly is taxed on dividends only because the investment is likely to be held on capital account. Gains of a capital nature are typically not taxable as New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax. However under the old rules, an equivalent investment via a CIV would typically have been taxed on dividends as well as any realised New Zealand share gains. This occurred because CIVs are generally in the business of trading in shares making any income from this business taxable. The new tax rules put investment in New Zealand (and certain Australian) shares through CIVs that elect to become portfolio investment entities on a similar tax footing to individuals investing directly in Australasian shares. Similarly, the new offshore tax rules for portfolio investment (with less than 10 percent interests) in offshore companies will result in greater consistency of treatment between investments in such companies through CIVs and directly. The new rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares are discussed separately in this _Tax Information Bulletin._

The new rules also address the problem of investors in collective investment vehicles having their investment income taxed at a higher rate than their marginal tax rate. For example, superannuation funds are taxed at 33% on their income, although a substantial number of investors in such funds may have a lower marginal tax rate (say, 19.5%). This has created a significant tax disincentive for lower income savers to use managed funds. Under the new rules, lower income savers investing in entities that elect to become portfolio investment entities will be taxed at their correct tax rate - 19.5%. The investment income of higher income savers will continue to be taxed at 33% to ensure that these investors continue to have an incentive to save via portfolio investment entities.

The new tax rules for portfolio investment entities are integral to the government's KiwiSaver initiative as they remove a number of tax disincentives to saving via managed funds.

The government has announced that certain remedial amendments will be included in a tax bill to be introduced in May this year. The commentary below relates to the portfolio investment entity tax rules enacted in December 2006.

### Key features

The new portfolio investment entity tax rules are contained principally in new subpart HL of the Income Tax Act 2004 but should be read in conjunction with the relevant definitions in section OB 1. Sections HL 1 and HL outline the scheme and purpose of the subpart. There are three main types of portfolio investment entity:

*   portfolio tax rate entities;
*   portfolio listed companies; and
*   portfolio defined benefit funds.

The portfolio tax rate entity is the main type of portfolio investment entity.

To become a portfolio investment entity, an entity must meet a number of eligibility criteria (contained in section HL 3). These include the requirements that:

*   the entity must be a company, superannuation fund or group investment fund (and not a life insurer) (section HL 3(7)));
*   the entity must be resident for tax purposes in New Zealand (section HL 3(8));
*   investors' interests in the entity must give investors the same rights to all types of investment proceeds (with the exception of Category B income) (section HL 3(9)); and
*   the entity must not have ceased to be a portfolio investment entity for a period of less than five years (section HL 3(10)).

An entity must also meet a number of other eligibility requirements (contained in sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10). The main requirements are:

*   the investor membership requirement, which generally requires a portfolio investor class of a portfolio investment entity to have at least 20 nonassociated persons as investors (section HL 6);
*   the investor interest size requirement, which generally requires an investor in a portfolio investor class to hold no more than a 0 percent interest in the class (section HL 9);
*   the investment type and income type requirements, which generally require a portfolio investment entity to have 90 percent or more of its investments by value in the form of land, financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements, and derive 90 percent or more of its income from such investments with that income being in the form of dividends, financial arrangement income, rent from land, proceeds from disposing of property and FIF income (sections HL 10(1) and (2)); and
*   the entity shareholding investment requirement, which requires a portfolio investment entity (and a portfolio investor class) to hold voting interests of less than 20 percent in any underlying companies invested into (section HL 10(3)).

(Note: There are a number of exemptions from the requirements contained in sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10.)

Portfolio tax rate entities must also make adjustments to investors' interests in the entity to reflect the effect of tax paid at investors' elected tax rates. This is called the "investor return adjustment requirement" and is contained in section HL 7.

There are rules that deal with breaches of the portfolio investment entity eligibility criteria. These criteria are contained in section HL 4.

The rules for electing and ceasing to be a portfolio investment entity and the consequences of each are contained in sections HL 11 to HL 14. An entity can elect to become a portfolio investment entity from 1 April 2007 by giving notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. An election is effective from 1 October 2007 at the earliest. On becoming a portfolio investment entity, section HL 12(3) deems a disposal and re-acquisition at market value of New Zealand and certain Australian shares held by the entity. Any tax liability relating to this event is payable equally over three years. An entity can cease to be a portfolio investment entity by giving notice to the Commissioner.

Sections HL 15 to 23 and HL 27 to 30 deal with the obligations and requirements (including calculation mechanisms) for entities that elect to become portfolio tax rate entities. Portfolio tax rate entities must allocate income to investors and calculate and pay tax on this income based on the tax rates elected by their investors.

The entity must elect a portfolio allocation period (the period over which income, expenses, losses and credits are allocated) and a portfolio calculation period (the period over which tax is calculated, generally involving one or more allocation periods) under section HL 15.

The tax liability for a portfolio tax rate entity for a portfolio calculation period is calculated under section HL 20. It is the sum of the liabilities calculated for each investor in the entity and for each class the investor has an interest in, for each allocation period.

Portfolio tax rate entities that choose a portfolio calculation period of a quarter must pay the amount of any portfolio entity tax liability within one month of the end of the portfolio calculation period, under section HL 21. These entities are not subject to the provisional tax rules. A portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 1 does not need to pay tax based on the tax rate of an exiting investor if, broadly, the tax liability of the entity associated with that investor in the period is equal to or greater than the value of the investor's interest remaining in the entity (defined as a "portfolio investor exit period"). The exiting investor must instead pay tax on that income at the end of the year.

Alternatively, portfolio tax rate entities can elect to pay provisional tax under section HL 22. These entities have a portfolio calculation period of a year. Any provisional tax paid is available as a credit against the entity's portfolio entity tax liability calculated at the end of the year under the mechanism in section HL 20.

Portfolio tax rate entities that choose a portfolio calculation period of a day must pay tax when investors exit the entity, under section HL 23. These entities are required to pay tax relating to exiting investors within one month of the end of the exit period. For investors who remain in the entity, the portfolio entity tax liability is payable within one month of the end of the tax year.

Investors in portfolio tax rate entities must elect a tax rate (called a portfolio investor rate) based on their prescribed investor rate. The prescribed investor rate for natural persons is either 19.5% or 33%. Investors in portfolio investment entities may elect a 19.5% rate only if their total income (other than portfolio investment entity investment income) in either of the previous two years is $38,000 or less. An investor must elect the 33% tax rate if their combined portfolio investment entity and non-portfolio investment entity income in both of the previous years is greater than $60,000. The prescribed investor rate for all other resident investors is 0%, unless a person is a resident trustee who elects a prescribed investor rate of 33%.

Investors in portfolio tax rate entities have portfolio investor allocated income or losses under section HL 4. Section CX 44D provides that the amount of any portfolio investor allocated income is treated as excluded income to natural person investors who elect a portfolio investor rate that is no lower than their prescribed investor rate. This means that investors do not need to include portfolio investor allocated income in their tax return, so that income allocated by portfolio tax rate entities does not affect entitlements to family assistance (under Working for Families) or student loan and child support repayment obligations.

Portfolio investor allocated income is not considered excluded income for zero-rated portfolio investors (and certain exiting investors in entities paying tax under section HL 21). This income must be included in the investor's tax return. Under section HL 25, these investors are allowed a deduction for the amount of any portfolio investor allocated losses under section DB 43B.

Portfolio investor allocated losses relating to non-zero rated investors under sections HL 21 and HL 23 are available as a rebate to the entity under section HL 26. The rebate is allowed under section KI 1.

Any tax credits received by a portfolio tax rate entity must first be used against the portfolio entity tax liability of the entity, under section HL 27. Any excess tax credits, other than foreign tax credits, are allowed as either a rebate to the entity under section KI 1 or to the investor, in the case of zero-rated portfolio investors. Foreign tax credits are not rebated and must be used in the income year in which they are derived.

Portfolio tax rate entities electing under section HL 22 to pay provisional tax must carry forward any losses that are not able to be utilised (such losses are not available as a rebate).

Sections HL 28 and HL 30 outline the rules for portfolio entity formation losses (which are losses generated in a period before an entity becomes a portfolio investment entity) and portfolio class land losses (which arise where a portfolio investor class of an entity owns predominantly land).

Section HL 31 outlines the rules and obligations for becoming a portfolio investor proxy. These entities, typically custodians and nominees, must perform the responsibilities under subpart HL (for example, the allocation of income, payment of tax, and filing of returns) as if they were a portfolio investment entity.

Under section CX 44C, gains on the disposal of shares in New Zealand-resident companies and Australian-resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange by portfolio investment entities are not taxed.

Returns-filing requirements for portfolio investment entities and other information requirements are provided in sections 28B, 31B, 36AB and 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Application date

An entity can apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to become a portfolio investment entity from 1 April 2007. The earliest date a portfolio investment entity can apply the new tax rules is 1 October 2007.

### Detailed analysis

### Subpart HL

The new portfolio investment entity tax rules are contained principally in new subpart HL of the Income Tax Act 2004. A number of changes to the bill as introduced were made at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage of the bill. This included the re-ordering and re-structuring of a number of provisions in new subpart HL.

#### New section HL 1 - intended effect

New section HL 1 sets out the intended effects of the new rules for portfolio tax rate entities which are portfolio investment entities, and investors in portfolio tax rate entities. The intended effect of the rules is that a portfolio tax rate entity uses funds supplied by investors to make investments of a specified nature. The entity has a tax liability relating to the income from these investments that is calculated using the tax rate elected by each investor (their "portfolio investor rate"). This resembles the liability that would arise if the investors had made the investments separately. The entity must distribute the income to investors, after deducting the appropriate tax liability. Investors in a portfolio tax rate entity that have elected a correct portfolio investor rate greater than zero have no tax liability on the income allocated to them by the entity. Importantly, the economic return that the investor receives, allowing for tax, would resemble the return from investing directly. The intention is that the income derived by the entity, and the tax thereon are, in economic substance, to be considered as income and tax of the investor.

#### New section HL 2 - scheme and purpose

New section HL sets out the scheme and purpose of the portfolio investment entity tax rules. It provides a roadmap to navigate through subpart HL.

#### New section HL 3 - eligibility requirements

New section HL 3 sets out the eligibility requirements to be a portfolio investment entity. It is important to note that a portfolio investment entity is defined in section OB 1 to mean: a portfolio tax rate entity, a portfolio listed company or a portfolio defined benefit fund. A portfolio listed company is defined in section OB 1 as a company that is listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand and which has become and is a portfolio investment entity. A portfolio defined benefit fund is also defined in section OB 1 as a defined benefit fund that has become, and is, a portfolio investment entity that does not allocate income to investors. A defined benefit fund is defined as a superannuation scheme, registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, that must comply with section 15(1)(a) of that Act.

A portfolio tax rate entity is a company, superannuation fund or group investment fund which has become, and is, a portfolio investment entity and is not a company listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand or a portfolio defined benefit fund. Such entities must allocate income to investors and calculate and pay tax on this income based on the tax rates elected by their investors. Portfolio listed companies and portfolio defined benefit funds, in contrast, do not allocate income to their investors. These entities pay tax at a flat 33% tax rate.

To be a portfolio investment entity generally, the entity must meet the form and business requirement, residence requirement and entity history requirement under sections HL 3(7), 3(8) and 3(10), respectively. The form and business requirement is that the entity must be a company, superannuation fund or group investment fund and not be a life insurer. The residence requirement is that the entity must be a resident for tax purposes in New Zealand (including under a double tax agreement). The entity history requirement is that the entity must not have ceased to be a portfolio investment entity for a period of less than five years, before the relevant election. This requirement is designed to prevent the portfolio investment entity rules from being used to gain unintended tax benefits.

An entity that elects to be a portfolio tax rate entity or a portfolio listed company must meet the income interest requirement under section HL 3(9). The income interest requirement is that each investor's interest ("portfolio investor interest") in the entity must give the same rights in relation to the proceeds from the investments of the entity as those of other investors. This is to prevent a portfolio tax rate entity streaming different types of income to investors in the entity depending on the individual tax status of the investor. An example of this would be providing tax-free Australasian capital gains to investors that have elected a portfolio investor rate of 33% while providing imputed dividends to investors with a 19.5% elected rate. There is an exception to the income interest requirement when income is Category B income (income derived by certain group investment funds).

In addition to the general eligibility criteria, portfolio investment entities must also meet the further eligibility requirements contained in sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10 which are discussed below.

#### New section HL 4 - failure to meet eligibility requirements

Under section HL 4, an entity would generally cease to be eligible as a portfolio investment entity if it fails to meet one or more of the eligibility requirements contained in section HL 3, at any time. A portfolio investment entity must comply with the general eligibility criteria in sections HL 3(7), 3(8) and 3(10) at all times during the year. In addition, portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio listed companies must comply with sections HL 7 and HL 8 respectively.

However, in the case of the further eligibility requirements contained in sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10, an entity can temporarily breach these requirements, if the breach is fixed within a specified timeframe and the breach is significant and is the result of an event or circumstance outside the control of the entity. The rules governing "temporary" breaches of the further eligibility criteria are found in section HL 4(2).

Under section HL 4(2)(b), a breach of the further eligibility requirements imposed by sections HL 6, HL 9 or HL 10 must be corrected by the end of the quarter following the end of the quarter in which the entity first failed to meet one of these requirements. This would allow an entity a maximum of six months to correct a failure to meet one of the relevant further eligibility criteria.

Section HL 4(2) also contains rules to accommodate breaches of sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10 when an entity is starting up as a portfolio tax rate entity and winding down. In both cases, an entity has a maximum period of 12 months before failure to meet one or more of the further eligibility criteria triggers cessation of portfolio investment entity status.

The requirement for the breach to be as a result of a circumstance or event outside the control of the entity is to ensure that these rules are not triggered as a result of a deliberate failure to meet the eligibility criteria under sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10. Examples of circumstances beyond the control of the entity are:

*   when an investor in an entity that is subject to the investor interest size requirement in section HL 9 temporarily holds a portfolio investor interest of more than 20 percent because of other investors exiting the entity;
*   when a "portfolio investor class" of an entity does not meet the investor membership requirement under section HL 6 because a number of investors have exited it; or
*   when an entity holds less than 90 percent of its assets in the types of financial asset investments outlined under section HL 10 as a result of a reduction in the value of the entity's financial asset investments compared with the other assets it holds.

The requirement for the breach to be "significant" is mainly to ensure that minor breaches resulting from human or other error do not trigger the breach rules (a breach resulting from human error is arguably within the control of the entity).

Portfolio investment entities should monitor compliance with the further eligibility criteria outlined in sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10 on a quarterly basis.

#### New section HL 5 - definition of a foreign investment vehicle

New section HL 5 outlines the definition of a foreign investment vehicle. This section outlines the types of foreign-resident entities that can invest in portfolio investment entities. In turn, the section outlines which foreign-resident entities a portfolio investment entity may invest in, without causing the portfolio investment entity to breach the various eligibility requirements under sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10.

A foreign investment vehicle is defined under section HL 5 as an entity that is not resident in New Zealand, is a company or superannuation scheme, and would meet a number of the further eligibility criteria to be a portfolio investment entity under sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10. In effect, a foreign investment vehicle is an entity that, if it were New Zealand tax-resident, would be eligible to be a portfolio investment entity. That is, it is a widely-held vehicle that holds portfolio investments in underlying companies.

Consequently, under section HL 6, a portfolio investment entity would meet the investor membership requirement if it has a foreign investment vehicle as an investor. Similarly, a foreign investment vehicle can hold up to 100 percent of a portfolio investment entity without breaching the investor interest size requirement in section HL 9. Under section HL 10, a portfolio investment entity can hold up to 100 percent of a foreign investment vehicle without breaching the entity shareholding investment requirement.

#### New section HL 6 - investor membership requirements

New section HL 6 contains the investor membership requirements for a portfolio investment entity and each portfolio investor class of the entity. Subsection (1) of this section contains the requirements for an entity that is not a company listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand.

##### Portfolio investor class

The further eligibility requirements in sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10 apply in the context of a portfolio investor class of a portfolio investment entity. A portfolio investment entity, other than a portfolio-listed company, can have multiple portfolio investor classes, such as a separate class for different investment options. However, for the entity to qualify as a portfolio investment entity, each portfolio investor class of the entity must meet the relevant further eligibility criteria in sections HL 6, HL 9 and HL 10. A portfolio investor class is defined in section OB 1 as one or more investors in an entity, where each investor has an entitlement to the proceeds from the investments of the entity, the investments are the same for all investors, and each investor's interest in the investments are in similar proportion (that is, they differ by less than 2.5 percent of the average value) to other investors.

Under section HL 6(1), an entity - or, if the entity has more than one portfolio investor class, each portfolio investor class of the entity - must have at least 0 persons as investors, treating all interests held by persons that are associated (as defined under section OD 8(3)) as one person. Under section HL 6(4) only persons holding an interest of 5 percent or more are counted as associates. This is to prevent portfolio investment entities from having to keep track of associated parties that hold small interests. An interest held by a portfolio investor proxy (as defined in section HL 31) is treated as an investment by one person.

##### Exceptions to the investor membership requirement (sections HL 6(1)(b) to (j), 6(3) and 6(4))

A portfolio investor class does not need to meet the investor membership requirement if the class has at least one investor that is a portfolio investment entity or is a foreign investment vehicle, an entity that is eligible to become a portfolio investment entity but does not elect to do so, or if it is a life insurance company. There are also exceptions to the investor membership requirement if the class has, as an investor, either the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the Accident Compensation Corporation (or Crown entity or subsidiary) or the Earthquake Commission.

Boutique portfolio investor classes can have fewer than 20 persons as investors in certain circumstances. To qualify, the entity holding the portfolio investor class must have at least one other portfolio investor class which meets the investor membership requirement No investor in the boutique class (other than the manager or trustee of the entity) can control the investment decisions of that class and the interests of investors in all boutique classes of the entity must total less than 10 percent of the total value of interests in the entity. This exception to the investor membership requirement is designed to ensure that umbrella funds offering investors boutique investment options alongside more mainstream products are not denied access to the new rules.

An entity electing to be a portfolio investment entity also does not need to meet the investor membership requirement if the entity, if treated as a unit trust, would meet one or more of paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition in section OB 1. The investor membership requirement would also not need to be met if the entity is a superannuation fund that is established under the proposal for restructuring of the National Provident Fund required by the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990 or a fund established by the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956.

##### Investor membership requirement for a listed company (section HL 6(2))

The investor membership requirement for an entity that is a company listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand is that the entity must not have more than one portfolio investor class. Such companies are, by definition, widely held as a result of the listing requirements in New Zealand. Therefore, no further investor membership requirements are required.

#### New section HL 7 - investor return adjustment requirements

When an entity elects to be a portfolio tax rate entity, the entity is required to make adjustments to reflect the effect of tax paid by the portfolio tax rate entity or any rebate that is available to the entity. The investor return adjustment requirement is designed to provide investors on marginal tax rates lower than 33% the benefit of these rates on their allocated income (portfolio investor allocated income) or loss (portfolio investor allocated loss).

An entity can choose between two methods for making the adjustment. The first is to adjust members' interests in the entity. These adjustments must be made within two months of the end of a quarter or the tax year, depending on the tax calculation period elected by the entity under section HL 15. In the case of portfolio tax rate entities that elect to pay provisional tax under section HL 22, the adjustment must be made within three months of the end of the tax year. Alternatively, the investor return adjustment could be made to the amount of any distribution paid to an investor. Portfolio tax rate entities have a choice of the method of the adjustment under sub-section (4).

The investor return adjustment requirement does not apply if an entity elects to become a portfolio listed company or a portfolio defined benefit fund. This is because, unlike portfolio tax rate entities, portfolio listed companies and portfolio defined benefit funds would not calculate their tax liability based on the tax rates elected by investors.

##### Changes to other Acts to give effect to the investor return adjustment requirement

As a consequence of the investor return adjustment requirement, amendments have been made to the following Acts to enable adjustments to be made without significant compliance and operational complications:

*   Companies Act 1993
*   Public Trust Act 2001
*   Securities Act 1978
*   Trustee Act 1956
*   Trustee Companies Act 1967
*   Unit Trusts Act 1960.

#### New section HL 8 - imputation credit distribution requirement

The imputation credit distribution requirement only applies to entities that elect to become portfolio listed companies. Portfolio listed companies will continue to pay tax as a company. As a result, under section HL 8, portfolio listed companies must maintain an imputation credit account. Any distributions made by these entities must carry imputation credits to the extent permitted by imputation credits available as determined by the directors of the entity.

##### Distributions from portfolio listed companies to shareholders (section CX 44D(3))

Fully imputed distributions to shareholders from a portfolio listed company are considered excluded income unless an investor specifically includes the distribution as income in their tax return (section CX 44D(3)(a)). If the investor elects to do so, the imputation credits would be able to be used to offset any tax liability on the distribution. Investors on a marginal tax rate lower than 33% may chose to treat the distribution as taxable income and use any excess imputation credits against other taxable income. Under section CX 44D(3)(b), the amount of any distributions that are not fully imputed are also considered excluded income to the shareholder. This is to ensure that income that has not been taxed at the portfolio listed company level (for example, capital gains from the sale of shares in a New Zealand company) can be distributed to investors without the investor paying tax on that income.

#### New section HL 9 - investor interest size requirement

New section HL 9 contains the investor interest size requirement for a portfolio investment entity. Under the investor interest size requirement, no single investor (or group of associated investors) in a portfolio investment entity or, where applicable, a portfolio investor class, can hold more than 20 percent of the underlying investments of the entity or class. As with the investor membership requirement, section HL 9(6) specifies that only persons holding portfolio investor interests of 5 percent or more are counted as associates for the purposes of determining whether the investor interest size requirement has been breached.

##### Exceptions to the investor interest size requirement (sections HL 9(2), 9(3), 9(4) and 9(6))

An investor in a portfolio investment entity can hold more than 20 percent of the entity or, if applicable, the portfolio investor class if the investor is a portfolio investment entity, a foreign investment vehicle or an entity that is eligible to become a portfolio investment entity but does not elect to be. There is no investor interest size requirement for an entity that is a life insurer, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the Accident Compensation Corporation (or Crown entity subsidiary) or the Earthquake Commission.

An entity electing to be a portfolio investment entity does not need to meet the investor interest size requirement provided the entity, if treated as a unit trust, would meet one or more of paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition. This safe harbour also applies to a superannuation fund that is established under the proposal for restructuring the National Provident Fund required by the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990 or a fund established by the Government Superannuation Fund Act 1956. The reason for this safe harbour is that these entities are themselves widely held.

##### Investor interest size requirement for portfolio listed companies (sections HL 9(3) and 9(5))

An investor in a portfolio listed company is generally not allowed to hold a portfolio investor interest of more than 20 percent. However, under section HL 9(5), an investor in a portfolio listed company is allowed to hold an interest of more than 20 percent, but no more than 40 percent, in the company if the investor held the interest in the entity beginning on 17 May 2006 and continued to hold the interest after 30 September 2007. This exception to the general investor interest size requirement deals with the problem of investors with large "legacy" investments in listed investment companies that elect to become portfolio listed companies.

#### New section HL 10 - investment type, income type and entity shareholding investment requirements

Under the investment type requirement in section HL 10(1), a portfolio investment entity must have 90 percent or more of its assets by value invested in deriving income from land, financial arrangements, excepted financial arrangements or a right or option relating to such property.

Similarly, under the income type requirement in section HL 10(2), 90 percent or more of the income derived by a portfolio investment entity must be income derived from an interest in land, financial arrangements, excepted financial arrangements or a right or option relating to such property. A further requirement is that the income must be passive in nature and consist of dividends, income taxed under the financial arrangement rules, rent from an interest in land, proceeds from the disposal of property listed in section HL 10(1), or foreign investment fund income.

Under the entity shareholding investment requirement in section HL 10(3), a portfolio investment entity must hold less than 20 percent ownership interests (denoted by voting interests) in companies (including unit trusts) that it invests into. The entity shareholding requirement applies on a portfolio investor class basis - the class shareholding investment requirement under section HL 10(5) - if a portfolio investment entity has more than one portfolio investor class. Taken together these rules are designed to ensure that the main purpose of a portfolio investment entity is portfolio investment.

##### Exceptions to the entity shareholding investment requirement (sections HL 10(3)(b), 10(4) and 10(5)(b))

An entity can hold more than a 0 percent interest in a company if the market value of all voting interests in companies of more than 0 percent comprise less than 10 percent of the total market value of the entity's investments. There is a similar exception to the class shareholding investment requirement under section HL 10(5). These exceptions are designed to provide portfolio investment entities with some investment flexibility and recognise that an entity can have as its main function portfolio investment even though it has a limited number of non-portfolio investments.

There are further exceptions to the entity shareholding requirement if the interest is in:

*   another portfolio investment entity;
*   an entity that could be a portfolio investment entity but does not elect in;
*   a foreign investment vehicle;
*   a life insurance company; or
*   a company that predominantly owns land (defined as a portfolio land company).

A portfolio investment entity can invest up to 100 percent in these entities.

#### New section HL 11 - becoming and ceasing to be a portfolio investment entity

An entity can elect to be a portfolio investment entity under section HL 11 by giving a notice in the prescribed form to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at any time after 1 April 2007. A notice of election is effective from the later of either:

*   1 October 2007 (the application date of the portfolio investment entity tax rules);
*   the date the entity is formed (in the case of a new entity);
*   the date nominated in the notice to the Commissioner; or
*   a date 30 days before the notice is received.

Similarly, an entity can cease to be a portfolio investment entity under section HL 11 by providing a notice in the prescribed form to the Commissioner. A cancellation is effective from the later of the date on which the entity became a portfolio investment entity, the date nominated in the notice, or the date the notice is received.

#### New section HL 12 - requirements on becoming a portfolio investment entity

An entity that makes an election under section HL 11 becomes a portfolio investment entity unless it cancels the election within 1 months of the date of election or fails to meet one or more of the general eligibility criteria in section HL 3 (other than breaches that can be fixed and are fixed within the conditions specified in section HL 4(2)).

If an entity with a non-standard income year chooses to become a portfolio tax rate entity and elects to pay tax under sections HL 21 or HL 23, then the entity has a transitional income year (under section 39 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). The income year starts on the date that the election to become a portfolio tax rate entity became effective and ends on the following 31 March.

All portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under sections HL 21 and HL 23 must have standard balance dates. That is, they must operate on a tax year basis. This is reiterated under section 38(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which prevents section HL 21 and HL 23 entities from electing a non-standard balance date. The standard balance date requirement does not apply to portfolio tax rate entities that elect to pay tax as provisional taxpayers under section HL 22, or to portfolio listed companies or portfolio defined benefit funds.

On becoming a portfolio investment entity, section HL 12(3) deems the entity to dispose and re-acquire any shares held in New Zealand and certain Australianresident listed companies (as defined under section CX 44C(1)(a) and (b)) at their market value on the day before the election is effective. The deemed disposition and re-acquisition does not apply in the case of an investment in a company that is a portfolio investment entity or an entity that will become a portfolio investment entity within six months. This is designed to prevent double taxation. The investee company would also be subject to a deemed disposal and re-acquisition of shares subject to the section CX 44C exclusion.

#### New section HL 13 - transitional tax rules

Any tax liability arising from the effect of the election on the length of the entity's income year under section HL 12 or the deemed disposal and re-acquisition under section HL 1 can be spread evenly between the year in which the entity became a portfolio investment entity and the following two years under section HL 13(2). For the purposes of any transitional tax liability, the provisional tax rules, tax penalties rules and use-of-money interest rules do not apply (section HL 13(1)).

#### New section HL 14 - requirements on ceasing to be a portfolio investment entity

An entity ceases to be a portfolio investment entity if it cancels the election to be a portfolio investment entity under section HL 11 or becomes ineligible to be a portfolio investment entity under section HL 4. The cessation of portfolio investment entity status is effective from the date on which the cancellation of portfolio investment entity status is effective or the first day after the end of the quarter in which the entity ceased to be a portfolio investment entity under section HL 4. For example, an entity that is no longer eligible to be a portfolio investment entity, through the operation of section HL 4, on 27 May 2007, would cease to be a portfolio investment entity on 1 July 2007 in accordance with section HL 14(2)(b).

Once an entity has ceased to be a portfolio investment entity the entity is treated as having disposed and reacquired of any shares in New Zealand and Australian-resident listed companies, as defined under section CX 44C(1)(a) and (b), at their market value. These shares would no longer be subject to the protection of section CX 44C(1) on gains from sale. Instead, the normal capital/revenue boundary would apply to any future sales.

The disposal and re-acquisition of shares is treated as being to and from another person at the market value of the shares on the date the entity ceased to be a portfolio investment entity (section HL 14(3)). This provision ensures that shares previously subject to the Australasian share exemption re-enter the tax base at their market value on the date the entity ceases to be a portfolio investment entity in accordance with section HL 14(2).

### Calculation and payment of tax for portfolio investment entities

The requirements to calculate and pay tax vary depending on the type of portfolio investment entity.

Portfolio tax rate entities would generally pay tax four times a year, under section HL 21. There are exceptions to this general rule in the case of portfolio tax rate entities that elect to pay tax when investors exit (under section HL 23) and in the case of portfolio tax rate entities that elect to remain provisional taxpayers (under section HL 22). Sections HL 15 to 23 and HL 27 to 30 deal with the calculation and payment of tax for portfolio tax rate entities. Portfolio listed companies and portfolio defined benefit funds continue to pay tax, broadly, under current rules.

#### New section HL 15 - the periods relevant to the calculation of tax for portfolio tax rate entities

A portfolio tax rate entity must first elect a portfolio calculation period and portfolio allocation period under section HL 15. This determines the periods over which income (and expenses, losses and tax credits) are allocated and tax is calculated.

The portfolio allocation period is the period over which a portfolio tax rate entity allocates its taxable income or loss, under section HL 19. The portfolio calculation period consists of one or more portfolio allocation periods and represents the period over which the entity must calculate its portfolio entity tax liability or rebate, under section HL 20, on taxable income or loss allocated to each portfolio allocation period under section HL 19. A portfolio tax rate entity therefore cannot elect a portfolio allocation period that is greater than the entity's portfolio calculation period.

An entity can choose different portfolio allocation periods and portfolio calculation periods, depending on the type of portfolio tax rate entity they elect to become. The default portfolio allocation period for a portfolio tax rate entity is a day. Alternatively, a portfolio tax rate entity may choose a portfolio allocation period of a month, quarter, or income year by giving notice to the Commissioner before the start of the relevant tax year or when the entity first chooses to become a portfolio tax rate entity.

The default portfolio calculation period for a portfolio tax rate entity is a quarter. A portfolio tax rate entity can choose a portfolio calculation period of a day or income year (for entities electing under section HL 22 to pay provisional tax) by giving notice to the Commissioner - again, before the start of a tax year or when the entity first chooses to become a portfolio tax rate entity.

##### Special rules for portfolio tax rate entities that elect to pay provisional tax (sections HL 15(2)(c) and 15(3)(c))

A portfolio tax rate entity that elects to pay provisional tax under section HL has a portfolio calculation period of an income year. Such an entity can, however, choose a portfolio allocation period of a day, a month a quarter or income year. A portfolio tax rate entity that elects to pay provisional tax under section HL must notify the Commissioner of their portfolio calculation period and portfolio allocation period when they make the election under section HL 22.

#### New section HL 16 - income not allocated, or allocated but not vested

New section HL 16 deals with income that is not able to be allocated to an investor by a portfolio tax rate entity and income that is able to be allocated to an investor but has not vested in the investor. Note: This section applies to portfolio tax rate entities only.

In the case of income that is not able to be allocated to an investor, the portfolio tax rate entity is treated as the investor for the purposes of calculating the entity's tax liability. This means that income relating to amounts such as reserve accounts or managers' holdings in portfolio tax rate entities would be taxed at 33%.

Some superannuation funds - for example, employerbased schemes that become portfolio tax rate entities may have members who have amounts contributed on their behalf that do not vest unless certain criteria are met. The intended effect of section HL 16(2) is that the tax rates of superannuation fund members should be used to tax income arising on unvested employer contributions, subject to the following conditions:

*   For the superannuation funds established before the bill was introduced on 17 May 2006, the vesting period has not been extended beyond the period in existence at that date.
*   Superannuation funds established after this bill's introduction must have vesting periods equal to or less than three years. For superannuation funds meeting this condition, the contributions made within the three-year period must vest in the employee within that period.

These conditions have been legislated to recognise the existence of established superannuation funds and vesting periods, and provide for new superannuation funds. The conditions associated with vesting periods have been designed to align with the intention of the portfolio investment entity rules that income will be taxed at the appropriate rate.

#### New section HL 17 - new investors treated as part of existing investor class

This section allows new members of a portfolio investor class of a portfolio tax rate entity to be treated as an existing member of that class. In the absence of this section the new investor may not be treated as being an investor in a portfolio investor class as they may temporarily hold interests in the underlying investments of the class that are different in proportion to those of other investors in the class. This difference may arise because the entity needs time to buy more of the underlying investments to make the investor's portfolio investor interests in the underlying investments similar in proportion to those of other investors in the class.

#### New section HL 18 - calculation of class net income or class net loss for portfolio tax rate entities

Section HL 18 outlines the formula for calculating the net income or loss for a portfolio investor class for each portfolio allocation period in a portfolio calculation period. It applies to a portfolio tax rate entity. A portfolio investor class has net income in a portfolio allocation period if the total amount of the entity's assessable income that is allocated to the class for the allocation period exceeds the total amount of the deductible expenditure that the entity allocates to the portfolio allocation period. A portfolio investor class has a net loss in an allocation period if total deductions for the class exceed assessable income for the class. It should be noted that under section EG 3, income and deductions of portfolio tax rate entities are allocated to the same periods as the entity allocates these amounts for the purpose of setting a unit price or, if the entity does not set a unit price, the amounts are allocated according to the entity's financial statements.

This calculation, along with the calculation under section HL 19, would be done at the end of a portfolio calculation period for each portfolio allocation period in the calculation period.

**Example 1**  
  
PIE A has assessable income of $20,000 and expenses of $3,000 on day 1. On day 2, PIE A has a loss of $6,000 and expenses of $1,000. PIE A has class net income of $17,000 on day 1 and class net loss of $7,000 on day 2 (assuming PIE A elects an allocation period of a day and has a single portfolio investor class).

#### New section HL 19 - calculation of class taxable income or class taxable loss for portfolio tax rate entities

Section HL 19 outlines the formula for calculating the class taxable income or loss for a portfolio investor class for each portfolio allocation period in a portfolio calculation period. A portfolio investor class has taxable income in a portfolio allocation period if the amount of any net income (calculated under section HL 18) exceeds the amount of any "other loss used". "Other loss used" is defined as the total of portfolio entity formation losses and any portfolio class land loss that has not been used in any previous portfolio allocation period to reduce net income.

Portfolio entity formation losses are essentially losses that have been generated prior to the entity becoming a portfolio tax rate entity that have been carried into the new rules. They are defined more fully in section HL 28.

A portfolio class land loss arises when a portfolio investor class has investments that are predominantly in the form of land or in companies that hold land (defined as portfolio land companies). Where this class has a net loss for a portfolio allocation period under section HL 18, this loss can be carried forward as a portfolio class land loss for offset against net income of the class in future portfolio allocation periods. Portfolio class land losses are defined under section HL 30.

The amount of portfolio entity formation loss and portfolio class land loss which can be used in a portfolio allocation period is limited to the amount of net income calculated under section HL 18 for the class and the period.

A portfolio investor class of a portfolio tax rate entity has a taxable loss if the class has a net loss (under section HL 18).

#### New section HL 20 - calculation of portfolio entity tax liability or amount of rebate

Section HL 20 outlines the formula for calculating the tax liability for a portfolio tax rate entity for a calculation period or, when there is a loss, for the calculation period, the amount of the loss that can be rebated under section KI 1.

The tax liability or amount of the rebate for a portfolio tax rate entity is the total calculated under section HL 0 for all investors that have been in the entity during the period and have elected a tax rate (defined as a "portfolio investor rate") of greater than zero percent. Therefore, any "zero-rated portfolio investors" (as defined in section OB 1) and certain investors with a portfolio exit period (also defined in section OB 1) are not included in the tax calculation under section HL 0. Income or loss allocated by a portfolio tax rate entity to zero-rated portfolio investors and investors with a portfolio exit period (in the case of portfolio tax rate entities that elect to pay tax under section HL 21) is taxable or deductible respectively, directly for these investors. This is discussed in further detail below.

The "portfolio entity tax liability", or the amount of the rebate, is the total of the amounts calculated under section HL 20(4):

*   for each investor with a portfolio investor rate of greater than zero;
*   for each portfolio investor class the investor has an interest in;
*   for each day in a portfolio allocation period; and
*   each portfolio allocation period in a portfolio calculation period.

Therefore, the portfolio entity tax liability or the amount that is to be rebated is the sum of the separate tax calculations relating to each investor for each day of the calculation period.

When a portfolio tax rate entity chooses a portfolio allocation period greater than a day - for example, a quarter - the portfolio entity tax liability (or rebate) for the allocation period is spread evenly across each day in the allocation period, for each investor.

Example illustrates how a portfolio investment entity uses section HL 0 to calculate tax.

To avoid complexity, the following examples describe portfolio investment entities that would not meet either or both of the investor membership requirement in section HL 6 and the investor interest size requirement in section HL 9.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Example 2 - portfolio entity tax liability**  <br>  <br>PIE A (from Example 1) has five investors, each holding 20 percent of the entity. Investors A, C and D elect a tax rate of 19.5%. Investors B and E have a tax rate of 33%.  <br>  <br>The portfolio entity tax liability is the sum of the tax liabilities for each individual investor for each portfolio allocation period in the relevant calculation period (assume PIE A's calculation period only encompasses day 1 and day 2). |     |     |
| Day 1 | Investors on 19.5% (3) | 33% (2) |
| 0.2\*($17,000)\*0.195 = $663 | 0.2\*($17,000)\*0.33 = $1,122 |
| 1   | 1   |
| Day 2 | 0.2\*(-$7,000)\*0.195 = -$273 | 0.2\*(-$7,000)\*0.33 = -$462 |
| 1   | 1   |
| Portfolio entity tax liability (or amount of rebate (if negative)):  <br>  <br>\[($663\*3 + $1,122\*2) + (-$273\*3 + -$462\*2)\] = $2,490 (portfolio entity tax liability) |     |     |

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Example 3 - rebate**  <br>  <br>PIE B has five investors, each holding 20 percent of the entity. Investors A, D, and E have a 33% tax rate and investors B and C elect a 19.5% tax rate (assume PIE B's calculation period only encompasses day 1 and day 2).  <br>  <br>PIE B has net income of $15,000 on day 1 and a net loss of $20,000 on day 2. Under section HL 19, PIE B has portfolio class taxable income of $15,000 on day 1 and a portfolio class taxable loss of $20,000 on day 2. Under section HL 20: |     |     |
| Day 1 | Investors on 19.5% (2) | 33% (3) |
| 0.2\*($15,000)\*0.195 = $585 | 0.2\*($15,000)\*0.33=$990 |
| 1   | 1   |
| Day 2 | 0.2\*(-$20,000)\*0.195 = -$780 | 0.2\*(-$20,000)\*0.33 = -$1,320 |
| 1   | 1   |
| Portfolio entity tax liability (or amount of rebate (if negative)): \[($585\*2 + $990\*3) + -$780\*2 + -$1,320\*3)\] = $4,140 - $5,520 = -$1,380). This is the amount that may be rebated under section KI 1. |     |     |

### Payment of tax by portfolio tax rate entities

Different types of portfolio tax rate entities have different rules for the payment of tax calculated under section HL 0 or the receipt of rebates.

#### New section HL 21 - portfolio tax rate entities that have a portfolio calculation period of a quarter

Section HL 1 outlines the rules for payment of tax by portfolio tax rate entities that have a portfolio calculation period of a quarter. These portfolio tax rate entities fall into the default category as a result of the portfolio calculation period of a quarter being the default option under section HL 15. It is anticipated that most entities in this category will have a portfolio allocation period of a day.

These entities would not be required to pay provisional tax under subpart MB of the Income Tax Act. Instead, they are required, after each portfolio calculation period, to pay an amount of tax equal to the portfolio entity tax liability calculated under section HL 0 for the portfolio calculation period. The payment must be made within one month of the end of the portfolio calculation period. Similarly, when the entity has an amount calculated under section HL 20, for a portfolio calculation period that is able to be rebated under section KI 1, this amount would be rebated after the entity has filed their return for the period. This means any losses or excess tax credits relating to the portfolio calculation period that are able to be refunded would be dealt with quarterly.

On payment of tax or on receipt of a rebate, the portfolio tax rate entity would need to adjust each investor's portfolio investor interest or make a distribution under section HL 7, to reflect the investor's share of the entity's portfolio entity tax liability (or rebate). For a section HL 21 portfolio tax rate entity, this would be within two months of the end of the relevant calculation period.

**Example 4**  
  
If PIE A (from Example 1) has a quarterly portfolio calculation period (and days 1 and 2 are the only allocation periods in the quarter), the portfolio entity tax liability of $2,490 (calculated in Example 2) would be payable within one month of the end of the quarter. Similarly, if PIE B (from Example 3) has a quarterly portfolio calculation period, it would be entitled to a rebate under section KI 1 after the end of the quarter.  
  
Under the investor return adjustment requirement in section HL 7, each investor in PIE A (and PIE B) would need to have their portfolio investor interest or any distribution adjusted for the tax paid (or rebate received). This would have to occur within two months of the end of the relevant quarter. Assuming PIE A elects to adjust each investor's interest, investors A, C and D in PIE A would have their portfolio investor interest reduced by $390 and investors B and E would have their interest reduced by $660.

##### Exiting investors "zero-rated"

Investors who exit a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 part-way through a portfolio calculation period would be "zero-rated" by the entity. That is, the portfolio investment entity would pay tax on the exiting investor's share of the income earned during the period at zero percent.

A portfolio investor exit period is defined in section OB 1, in the context of section HL 21, as a period that starts at the beginning of a portfolio calculation period and ends five days after the end of the portfolio calculation period. The five-day grace period after the end of a portfolio calculation period is to accommodate investors who leave a section HL 1 portfolio tax rate entity just after the end of a calculation period, but before the entity has calculated the portfolio entity tax liability for the calculation period.

An investor has a portfolio investor exit period if the amount of the portfolio entity tax liability for the investor (calculated under section HL 20 as if the investor did not have an exit period) would equal or exceed the value of the investor's interest at the end of the exit period. This means that for an investor to be zero-rated, the investor's share of the tax liability for a portfolio calculation period must exceed any residual interest in the entity (in all classes of the entity) after they have made a withdrawal. If no portfolio investor exit period arises, the normal section HL 0 tax liability calculation would apply to the investor at the end of the quarter.

**Example 5**  
  
PIE C has a portfolio calculation period of a quarter. Investor A reduces his interest in PIE C by $10,000 part-way through a portfolio calculation period. His residual interest in PIE C is $1,000. At the end of the portfolio calculation period, investor A's share of the portfolio entity tax liability for the portfolio calculation period is $1,250. Because investor A's share of the portfolio entity tax liability for the period is greater than his residual interest, there is a portfolio investor exit period. Consequently, PIE C can apply a zero percent tax rate for investor A for the purposes of section HL 20.

##### Cancellation of any residual portfolio investor interests (section HL 21(5))

Where an investor partially exits, a portfolio tax rate entity that makes payments of tax under section HL 21, and the level of the withdrawal is sufficient to trigger a portfolio investor exit period (and hence zero-rating), any residual portfolio investor interest in the entity must be cancelled and paid to Inland Revenue under subsection (5). This payment satisfies some of the investor's tax liability on income from the portfolio tax rate entity. While the investor will be required to include the amount of portfolio investor allocated income from the entity in relation to the portfolio investor exit period in their tax return, the amount of the investor's portfolio investor interest paid to the Commissioner under subsection (5) will be treated as a credit under section LD 11 against this tax liability.

A payment by the portfolio tax rate entity to the Commissioner under subsection (5) would also need to be made within one month of the end of the portfolio calculation period in which the portfolio investor exit period falls.

**Example 6**  
  
As investor A in PIE C in Example 5 has a residual interest, under section HL 21(5), PIE C would be required to cancel this residual interest and pay this amount within one month of the end of the portfolio calculation period in satisfaction of investor A's share of the portfolio entity tax liability. The $1,000 paid by PIE C would be available as a credit in the investor's tax return.

#### New section HL 22 - portfolio tax rate entities that elect to pay provisional tax

Section HL enables portfolio tax rate entities that choose a portfolio calculation period of a year to continue to be subject to the provisional tax rules under subpart MB.

The actual income tax liability for these entities would still be calculated under section HL 0 at the end of the year, which allows investors' tax rates to be taken into account when calculating the entity's portfolio entity tax liability. This effectively results in the entity applying a blended average tax rate for the year. The investor return adjustment requirement under section HL 7 applies and would need to occur within three months of the end of the year.

The provisional tax paid by the entity during the year would be allowed as a credit against the entity's portfolio entity tax liability. As the provisional tax rules would operate, the entity may be subject to the use-of-money interest rules if the amount of provisional tax paid is less than (or exceeds) the portfolio entity tax liability calculated at the end of the year.

##### No rebate for losses and excess tax credits arising during a portfolio calculation period (sections IE 1(2BB), HL 26 and HL 27)

Unlike section HL 21 portfolio tax rate entities, entities that elect to pay provisional tax under HL would not receive rebates for losses and excess credits arising in the portfolio calculation period. Instead, under section IE 1(2BB), any amounts calculated under section HL 20 that would otherwise be rebated under section KI 1, are carried forward.

###### No "zero-rating" of exiting investors

Portfolio tax rate entities that elect to pay tax under section HL 22, would not be able to apply a zero-percent tax rate to the income earned by investors that exit the fund during the year. These entities would pay tax on all the income the entities earned during the year. Therefore, to cover the tax liability relating to exiting investors, these entities are likely to ensure that an appropriate amount is withheld from investors when they exit.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Example 7**  <br>  <br>PIE D elects to pay provisional tax under section HL . PIE D has a portfolio calculation period of an income year and elects a portfolio allocation period of a month. It makes provisional tax estimations of $333 for each of the provisional tax payment dates 1 to 3.  <br>  <br>PIE D has two investors, investor A and investor B each holding 50 percent of PIE D. Investor A elects a tax rate of 19.5% and investor B elects a tax rate of 33%. Investor B exits PIE D completely, six months after the start of the tax year. On exit of investor B, the PIE pays investor B an amount, which includes assessable income of $1,500 (this is based on the PIE earning assessable income of $500 in each of the first six months). PIE D withholds tax of $495 on this amount. Investor C (with a tax rate of 33%) enters PIE D after investor B has exited. At the end of the year PIE D has taxable income of $6,000. Each investor's share of the portfolio entity tax liability is: |     |     |     |
| Investor A: | 0.5\*$6,000\*0.195 | \=  | $585 |
| Investor B: | 0.5\*$6,000\*(6/12)\*0.33 | \=  | $495 |
| Investor C: | 0.5\*$6,000\*(6/12)\*0.33 | \=  | $495 |
| (note: section HL 20 calculations have been simplified)  <br>  <br>The portfolio entity tax liability for PIE D for the year is $1,575. This amount is the entity's final tax liability. The provisional tax payments totalling $1,000 are available as a credit against this liability. PIE D would therefore have a residual income tax liability of $575. This residual liability would be payable at the entity's terminal tax date.  <br>  <br>PIE D must also carry out the investor return adjustment under section HL 7 within three months of the end of the income year for each investor still in the entity. |     |     |     |

#### New section HL 23 - portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax when investors leave

Section HL 23 applies to portfolio tax rate entities that elect a portfolio allocation period and portfolio calculation period of a day under section HL 15. To be a section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entity, an entity must give notice in a prescribed form to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at the time at which the entity selects its portfolio allocation and portfolio calculation periods under section HL 15.

Like entities that elect to pay tax under section HL 21, portfolio tax rate entities subject to section HL 23 would not be provisional taxpayers. However, unlike section HL 21 portfolio tax rate entities, these entities would pay tax (calculated under section HL 20) relating to all calculation periods in the tax year and for all investors remaining in the entity, within one month of the end of the tax year. Similarly, when the entity has an amount for a tax year under section HL 0 that is able to be rebated under section KI 1, this amount would be only rebated after the entity has filed its return for the year. The investor return adjustment under section HL 7 would also apply at the end of the tax year.

##### Tax payable on behalf of exiting investors (section HL 23(2))

Unlike a section HL 21 portfolio tax rate entity, investors who exit a portfolio tax rate entity that elects to pay tax under section HL 23 will not be zero-rated. Instead, the entity would need to pay the investor's share of the portfolio entity tax liability relating to a portfolio investor exit period to the Commissioner within one month from the end of the month in which the portfolio investor exit period ends. Therefore, investors who exit a section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entity during a tax year would not need to file a return for their portfolio investor allocated income for a portfolio investor exit period.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Example 8**  <br>  <br>PIE E elects to pay tax under section HL 23 by choosing a portfolio allocation period and portfolio calculation period of a day. PIE E has two investors: investor A (who holds 40 percent of PIE E) and investor B (who holds 60 percent of PIE E). Both investors elect a 33% tax rate. For simplicity, this example assumes only four portfolio allocation and portfolio calculation periods for the year. In portfolio allocation period 1, the entity has taxable income of $1,000, in period 2 a taxable loss of $500, in period 3, taxable income of $2,500 and in period 4, taxable income of $3,000.  <br>  <br>Investor A exits PIE E completely at the end of period 3 and is replaced by investor C (who elects a tax rate of 19.5%). PIE E would need to calculate investor A's share of the portfolio entity tax liability for portfolio calculation periods 1 to 3 (the investor's portfolio investor exit period) and deduct this amount from the payment that is made to investor A: |     |     |     |     |
| Period 1: | 0.4\*($1,000)\*0.33 | \=  | $132 |     |
| Period 2: | 0.4\*(-$500)\*0.33 | \=  | \-$66 |     |
| Period 3: | 0.4\*($2,500)\*0.33 | \=  | $330 |     |
| The amount that is deducted - $396, would need to be paid to the Commissioner within one month of the month in which investor A's portfolio investor exit period ends.  <br>  <br>For investors B and C, their share of the portfolio entity tax liability for the tax year, calculated below, would be payable within one month of the end of the tax year. |     |     |     |     |
|     | Investor B |     |     | Investor C |
| Period 1: | 0.6\*($1,000)\*0.33 | \=  | $198 | \-  |
| Period 2: | 0.6\*(-$500)\*0.33 | \=  | \-$99 | \-  |
| Period 3: | 0.6\*($2,500)\*0.33 | \=  | $495 | \-  |
| Period 4: | 0.6\*($3,000)\*0.33 | \=  | $594 | 0.4\*($3,000)\*0.195 |
|     |     |     |     | \=$234 |
| **Total:** |     |     | **$1,188** | **$234** |

#### Section HL 24 - portfolio investor allocated income and loss

Sections HL 24 and HL 25 deal with the treatment of income or loss allocated to investors by portfolio tax rate entities. This is defined as portfolio investor allocated income or loss.

##### Election of a tax rate

Investors in portfolio tax rate entities can elect a tax rate in accordance with the definition of the prescribed investor rate in section OB 1. The prescribed investor rate for an investor in a portfolio tax rate entity is:

*   0% in the case of an entity that is a charity (that is, an organisation or trust that derives exempt income under sections CW 34 and CW 35), a company, a superannuation fund, a trustee (other than a trustee that elects 33%), a portfolio investment entity, or a portfolio investor proxy (as defined in section OB 1). These investors are defined as "zero-rated portfolio investors";
*   19.5% in the case of a natural person who, in either of the previous two income years, had taxable income of $38,000 or less (not including portfolio investor allocated income) and a total amount of $60,000 or less in taxable income plus portfolio investor allocated income; and
*   33% in all other cases and for a trustee that elects this rate.

The rate elected by an investor is called the portfolio investor rate and is used by the portfolio tax rate entity to calculate the entity's tax relating to the investor and the period under section HL 0. A portfolio investor rate must be provided to a portfolio tax rate entity before the end of a portfolio calculation period. Under section 28B of the Tax Administration Act a person cannot provide a portfolio investor tax rate of 19.5% unless they provide their tax file number to the portfolio tax rate entity. If no portfolio investor rate is elected, the default rate of 33% applies.

An investor who exits a portfolio tax rate entity that makes payments of tax under section HL 21 has a portfolio investor rate of 0% if the investor has a portfolio investor exit period in the relevant calculation period.

##### Calculation of portfolio investor allocated income or loss (section HL 24(5))

Under section HL 24, the portfolio investor allocated income or loss for an investor is the total income or loss calculated under subsection (5) for that investor for each portfolio allocation period in a tax year the investor was present in the entity and each day of the portfolio allocation period, and each portfolio investor class to which the investor belongs. An investor's portfolio investor allocated income or loss mirrors the investor's share of the income on which the portfolio entity tax liability is calculated under section HL 20.

##### Excluded income in certain circumstances and not others (sections CP and, CX 44D)

Under section CP 1, the amount of any portfolio investor allocated income is treated as income of the investor in the year containing the relevant income-allocation periods. Section CX 44D provides that portfolio investor allocated income derived by an investor under section CP 1 is excluded income of the investor if:

*   the prescribed investor rate for the investor is more than 0%;
*   the investor has not chosen a portfolio investor rate that is less than the prescribed investor rate; and
*   the income is not allocated to a portfolio investor exit period, in the case of an exiting investor from a section HL 1 portfolio tax rate entity.

Under section CX 44D(2), any distribution from a portfolio tax rate entity to an investor is also treated as excluded income of the investor. In this context, a distribution would include an investor redeeming their units with the PIE. Excluded income does not need to be separately identified and returned.

As portfolio investor allocated income is excluded income for tax purposes, provided investors elect a portfolio investor rate that is no lower than their prescribed investor rate, the income does not affect entitlements to Working for Families' tax credits, or student loan repayment obligations or child support payment obligations.

##### Consequences if portfolio investor rate is lower than prescribed investor rate

If an investor elects a portfolio investor rate that is lower than the prescribed investor rate, then the portfolio investor allocated income is not considered as excluded income under section CX 44D(1)(b). Instead, the full amount of income becomes the investor's taxable income in the tax year in which it is allocated to the investor by the portfolio tax rate entity.

The taxpayer is allowed a credit under section LD 10 for any tax paid by the portfolio tax rate entity in relation to any portfolio investor allocated income that is no longer considered excluded income under section CX 44D.

However, even if portfolio investor allocated income is not considered excluded income as a result of section CX 44D(1)(b), the receipt of this income would not affect entitlements to family assistance (under Working for Families). This is because section KD 1 has been amended to exclude any amount of portfolio investor allocated income that is not considered excluded income as a result of section CX 44D(1)(b) from the calculation of net income for family assistance (under Working for Families) purposes.

#### Section Hl 25 - portfolio investor allocated loss for zero-rated portfolio investors and certain investors with portfolio investor exit periods

Section HL 25 outlines the treatment of portfolio investor allocated losses for investors that are zero-rated portfolio investors or those investors in section HL 1 portfolio tax rate entities that have a portfolio investor exit period. As a portfolio tax rate entity does not have a portfolio entity tax liability in relation to these investors, any portfolio investor allocated income is not considered excluded income under CX 44D. Therefore the investor must include this income in their tax return. Similarly, any portfolio investor allocated loss is allowed as a deduction to zero-rated portfolio investors and investors in section HL 1 portfolio tax rate entities with a portfolio investor exit period, under section DB 43B(1).

##### Reduction in amount of loss allowed as a deduction (section DB 43(2))

Section DB 43B(2) is designed to ensure that zero-rated portfolio investors in portfolio investment entities cannot claim tax deductions for losses that flow through to them from the portfolio investment entity if the investor has benefited from the portfolio investment entity using a formation loss against income earlier in the year.

#### Section Hl 26 - rebates to portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under sections Hl 21 and HL 23

Section HL 26 provides that section HL 1 and section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entities can get rebates under section KI 1 in certain circumstances. The rebates are allowed for investors with portfolio investor rates above zero percent and investors in section HL 21 portfolio tax rate entities that do not have a portfolio investor exit period. Instead of these investors receiving a benefit for any losses or excess credits directly, it is the portfolio tax rate entity that would receive a rebate, of an amount that is calculated under section HL 20 (although this is subject to section KI 1). The entity would then be responsible for allocating each investor's share of the rebate by adjusting each investor's portfolio investor interest (or alternatively making a distribution) under section HL 7.

##### Reduction in amount of rebate allowed (section KI 1(2))

Section KI 1, which allows the rebate, is designed to reduce any amount calculated under section HL 0 by any portfolio entity formation losses used in the portfolio calculation period to which the rebate relates. This provision is intended to ensure that rebates can only arise if the entity has incurred a net loss for the calculation period.

#### Section Hl 27 - credits received by portfolio tax rate entities

Section HL 7 outlines the ability of portfolio tax rate entities (and certain investors in portfolio tax rate entities) to use tax credits to reduce their portfolio entity tax liability, obtain a refund of income tax or attach the credit to distributions. Section HL 7 does not apply in the case of portfolio tax rate entities that have elected to pay tax under section HL 22. As in the case of losses, section HL portfolio tax rate entities would be subject to normal income tax rules in relation to the use of any tax credits.

##### Foreign tax credits (sections HL 27(7)(a) and HL 27(10)(a))

Under section HL 27, foreign tax credits (known as subpart LC credits) can only be used to reduce a portfolio tax rate entity's portfolio entity tax liability under section HL 0. Any excess credits cannot be rebated under section KI 1. These provisions are intended to ensure a tax treatment for a portfolio investment entity's foreign tax credits that is broadly similar to the tax treatment of foreign tax credits of direct investors - taking into account that many portfolio investment entities will be doing tax calculations daily.

##### Other tax credits (sections HL 27(7)(b), HL 27(8), HL 27(9) and HL 27(11))

Other tax credits (not under subpart LC - such as imputation credits) must first be used to reduce a portfolio tax rate entity's portfolio entity tax liability. However, any excess credits are available to be rebated under section KI 1 in the case of investors other than zero-rated portfolio investors and investors with exit periods in section HL 21 entities (see section HL 27(11)(b)).

#### New section HL 28 - portfolio entity formation losses

Section HL 8 outlines what a portfolio entity formation loss is and how these losses can be used. A portfolio entity formation loss is defined as any net loss arising from a period ending on or before an entity becomes a portfolio investment entity that can be carried forward and used to reduce a portfolio investment entity's taxable income. A portfolio entity formation loss may therefore comprise investment losses incurred by the entity before it became a portfolio investment entity, that could not be used, or losses arising under the transitional rules in section HL 12(3).

Unlike losses that arise during a portfolio calculation period, portfolio entity formation losses cannot be rebated under section KI 1. They must be used up over time against the taxable income of the entity. Portfolio entity formation losses can be carried forward to subsequent income years.

The intent of section HL 28(3) is to provide new formation losses to an entity when rebates, credits, or deductions have been claimed under sections DB 43B, HL 7 and KI 1.

#### New sections HL 29 and HL 30 - portfolio class land losses

Certain restrictions on the use of losses apply in the case of portfolio investor classes whose investments are predominantly in the form of land. This class is effectively defined as one where, at the end of a calculation period, the interests of the class that are held in land or portfolio land companies (defined as companies whose assets comprise more than 90 percent in land or other land companies) comprise more than 50 percent of the value of the investments of the class.

Under sections HL 29 and HL 30, any tax losses relating to investment classes of a portfolio tax rate entity that predominantly invest in land or land companies would not be rebated. Instead, these losses would form a portfolio class land loss, which could be carried forward and offset against taxable income from the relevant class in future portfolio calculation periods. Portfolio class land losses cannot be offset against taxable income from other non- "land" classes.

#### New section HL 31 - portfolio investor proxies

On the basis of investor information held (or other circumstances), certain entities (such as custodians and nominees) may be in a better position to apply the responsibilities outlined under subpart HL than the portfolio investment entities themselves. In such scenarios, an entity that is eligible to perform responsibilities under the portfolio entity tax rules that would ordinarily be performed by the portfolio investment entity, may do so by becoming a portfolio investor proxy and applying section HL 31.

Under section HL 31(1), an entity is eligible to be a portfolio investor proxy for an investor in a portfolio investment entity in relation to a portfolio allocation period if the following conditions are met:

*   The portfolio investment entity is not a portfolio listed company (section HL 31(1)(a)).
*   The entity holds a portfolio investor interest for an investor in the portfolio investment entity (section HL 31(1)(b)).
*   The entity gives the portfolio investment entity a notice that the entity is holding the portfolio investor interest as a portfolio investor proxy (section HL 31(1)(c)(i)), together with any other information the Commissioner may require the entity to provide to the portfolio investment entity (section HL 31(1)(c)(ii)).

Section HL 31(2) clarifies the role of the entity once it becomes a portfolio investor proxy. The role is to carry out the responsibilities (detailed in section HL 31(3)) of the portfolio investor proxy in relation to amounts allocated to it as holder of the portfolio investor interest on behalf of the investor for the portfolio allocation period. The responsibilities detailed in section HL 31(3) must be carried out as if:

*   the entity which becomes a portfolio investor proxy were a portfolio investment entity (section HL 31(2)(a));
*   the portfolio investor interest held by the entity were an interest of the investor in the income of the entity (section HL 31(2)(b)); and
*   the portfolio investor allocated income, portfolio investor allocated loss, and distributions received by the entity for the investor (from the portfolio investment entity) were income or loss of the entity and the investor is entitled to these through their portfolio investor interest (section HL 31(2)(c)(i) and (ii)).

The responsibilities of a portfolio investor proxy in relation to amounts allocated to it from the portfolio investment entity are contained in section HL 31(3). These responsibilities are to:

*   allocate, to the investor, portfolio investor allocated income and portfolio investor allocated losses for the portfolio allocation period (section HL 31(3)(a));
*   distribute, to the investor, distributions and credits for the portfolio allocation period (section HL 31(3)(b));
*   pay income tax on portfolio investor allocated income for the portfolio allocation period (section HL 31(3)(c));
*   adjust the portfolio investor interest of the investor, or distributions to the investor, to reflect the effect of the investor's portfolio investor rate on the amount of distributions and payments above (section HL 31(3)(d));
*   provide the Commissioner with returns relating to the allocation, distributions, credits, and payments referred to above (section HL 31(3)(e)(i)); and
*   provide the Commissioner with any other information required (section HL 31(3)(e)(ii)).

### Other provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004

#### New section CX 44C - exclusion for trading gains on australasian equities by portfolio investment entities

New section CX 44C provides the exclusion for portfolio investment entities on certain Australasian share-trading income.

Under section CX 44C, income derived by a portfolio investment entity from disposal of a share, where the share is in a New Zealand tax-resident company or by a company resident in Australia for tax purposes and listed on an approved index under the Australian Stock Exchange rules (explained more fully earlier in this bulletin), is excluded income of the portfolio investment entity.

As a consequential amendment, sections DB 17(1) and (2) have been amended to prevent portfolio investment entities from receiving a deduction for the cost of shares subject to section CX 44C, on disposal.

##### Dividends (section CB 4B)

Under section CB 4B, where a dividend is declared in respect of a share to which section CX 44C applies before the share is disposed of, but the dividend is paid after the disposal, the portfolio investment entity is considered to have derived the dividend as gross income. The amount of gross income is limited to the amount of any dividend that is not fully imputed for New Zealand tax purposes.

### Tax Administration Act 1994 provisions

#### New section 31B - information to be provided by portfolio tax rate entities to investors

Section 31B(1) and (2) outlines the requirement for a portfolio tax rate entity to provide information which the Commissioner considers relevant to zero-rated portfolio investors and investors with portfolio investor exit periods. This information will be needed by these investors to comply with their tax obligations for any income or loss allocated to them by a portfolio tax rate entity.

Section 31B(3) requires a portfolio tax rate entity to provide all other investors with information the Commissioner considers relevant for each income year by 30 June after the end of the income year.

Section 31B(4) requires a portfolio tax rate entity to give a notice to each investor in the entity, at least once each income year, requesting that the investor provide the entity with the investor's prescribed investor rate.

#### New section 36AB - portfolio investment entities to file returns electronically

Section 36AB requires the Commissioner to prescribe the electronic format in which a tax return must be provided by a portfolio tax rate entity or a portfolio investor proxy.

#### New section 57B - returns to be filed and annual reconciliation statements to be provided by portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies

Section 57B outlines the return filing requirements and payment obligations for portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies.

Portfolio tax rate entities or portfolio investor proxies that pay tax under section HL 21 must file a return in a prescribed form at the end of each calculation period.

The entity must also pay an amount equal to the portfolio entity tax liability to the Commissioner along with each return of income.

Portfolio tax rate entities or portfolio investor proxies that pay tax under section HL 23 must file a return in a prescribed form:

*   for investors with a portfolio investor exit period by the end of the month following the month in which the portfolio investor exit period ended;
*   for investors who hold portfolio investor interests at the end of the tax year by the end of the month following the end of the tax year.

Portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL must perform the responsibilities of a provisional taxpayer under the provisional tax rules.

All portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies must file an annual return in a prescribed form showing the income tax paid for the tax year and any other information the Commissioner considers necessary. The return must be filed by 30 June.

#### Consequential amendments

Consequential amendments have been made to:

*   section 139A(2)(a)(iii) to extend the late-filing penalties rules to returns filed under section 57B by portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies; and
*   section 139AA(2) to apply the non-electronic filing penalty to portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies that do not furnish returns in a prescribed electronic format.

Tax simplified for individual taxpayers
=======================================

**29 June 2018**

A new tax bill introduced to Parliament will mean automatic tax refunds for around 750,000 New Zealanders.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill will simplify tax obligations for individuals who only earn employment or investment income. It will remove the need for them to file a personal tax summary (PTS) to get a tax refund.

“Filing a PTS is currently the only way for individuals to get a refund, but around 750,000 people don’t follow this process. They are missing out on their money as a result. We want people to get their refunds automatically”, Mr Nash says.

“The only reason to file a PTS in the future will be if a taxpayer has additional information they need to provide. If this is not the case, Inland Revenue will automatically work out the amount of the refund or the tax to pay.

“The legislation also amends the Tax Administration Act to clarify how Inland Revenue can collect, use and disclose taxpayer information. Inland Revenue follows good rules around the use of information but the changes will improve efficiency and clarity.

“The changes will better focus the confidentiality rule to clearly protect taxpayer information. It will clearly set out any exceptions. It strikes the right balance between careful treatment of taxpayers’ confidential information and improved customer service,” Mr Nash says.

In other measures, the legislation:

*   introduces a ‘short process ruling’ where small businesses can more easily apply for a binding ruling from Inland Revenue on any tax matter;
*   provides the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with more flexibility to deal with minor anomalies in tax legislation;
*   allows over-65 year olds to join KiwiSaver as a provider of low cost managed funds. Employers would not be obliged to contribute for over-65s but may do so voluntarily
*   adds new KiwiSaver contribution rates of 6% and 10%
*   improves the ability of taxpayers to fix errors in tax returns; and
*   sets the annual tax rates for the 2018-19 tax year, which remain unchanged from previous tax years.

“This Bill represents a significant step in the modernisation and simplification of New Zealand’s tax system, supporting much of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation work,” Mr Nash says.

Tax status of community housing entities
========================================

2014 amendments confer tax-exempt status and donee organisation status on certain community housing providers.

#### _Sections CW 42B and LD (3)(1)(ab) of the Income Tax Act 2007; section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to confer tax-exempt status and donee organisation status on certain community housing providers that meet specified criteria (referred to as "community housing entities"). The amendments clarify the tax status of certain community housing entities that provide pathways to home-ownership for low-income households that cannot afford to buy a home on their own.

### Background

Previously, the tax-exempt status and donee organisation status of certain community housing providers who provided financial assistance to low-income households to purchase their own home was not always certain. This was because the charitable status of these entities was not clear. Charities law recognises the relief of poverty as a charitable purpose but entities that offer financial assistance to people to purchase a home tend to fall outside the charities criteria - the ability to purchase a house is an indication that a person is not "in poverty".

The Government believes that community housing providers should be able to offer a range of housing assistance options to their clients, for example, rental and home ownership. If an entity provides affordable home-ownership products aimed at low-income households, but in all other ways would be recognised as charitable in purpose, the Government believes that the provision of home ownership products alone should not disqualify that entity from being entitled to tax-exempt status or donee organisation status.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended a number of clarifications to ensure that the provisions were clear and achieved their purpose. These changes allow:

*   community housing entities to provide assistance to people who want to purchase an existing home, not just new homes;
*   profits to be distributed to a parent organisation or other entity provided it is also for charitable purposes;
*   income earned by a community housing entity from sources other than its housing activities, such as interest or investment income, to also be exempt; and
*   the income threshold to apply only at the time a community housing entity starts helping a household, not on an on-going basis.

The amendments should provide greater tax certainty for certain community housing providers, and help to promote home ownership for New Zealanders who would not otherwise be able to afford to buy a house on their own.

### Key features

*   Section CW 42B of the Income Tax Act 2007 confers an income tax exemption on certain community housing providers which meet specified criteria as listed in the section. This entity is referred to as "community housing entity".
*   Section LD (3)(1)(ab) of the Income Tax Act 2007 confers donee organisation status on a community housing entity, and ensures that donors who give monetary gifts of $5 or more to the entity qualify for tax relief on their donations.
*   Section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a regulation to be set describing who can be a client or beneficiary of a community housing entity.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 14 April 2014 to coincide with the beginning of the new registration regime for community housing providers under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992.

### Detailed analysis

#### _New income tax exemption_

Under section CW 42B of the Income Tax Act 2007, the income of a community housing entity will be exempt from income tax.

To be a "community housing entity", an organisation must:

*   be either a company or trust;
*   be involved predominantly in the provision of housing;
*   not be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual;
*   retain its profits, or distribute or apply its profits only to the following groups of people:
    *   community housing entities; or
    *   beneficiaries or clients of the entity; or
    *   tax charities; or
    *   persons to whom distributions would be in accordance with charitable purposes, and
*   ensure that no individual is able to exert control over the activities of the entity to direct or divert amounts from those activities to their own benefit or advantage;
*   be a registered community housing provider under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992.

The majority of these criteria are similar to those described in sections CW 42(5), (6), (7) and (8) of the Income Tax Act 2007. They ensure that only community housing entities that operate under a non-profit model are eligible for the proposed income tax exemption.

There are also rules about the beneficiaries or clients of community housing entities. Even if an entity meets all of the requirements set out above, it will not be a "community housing entity", and its income will not be exempt if:

*   less than 85 percent of its beneficiaries or clients are, at the time of first becoming beneficiaries or clients, described in regulations made under section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and
*   the quality and standard of the housing provided by the entity is not consistent across all the recipients of the housing assistance.

#### _Classes of recipients described in section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

Section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permits the Governor-General to make regulations specifying people, or classes of people who are counted as beneficiaries or clients of the entity.

The factors which may be used to specify these beneficiaries or clients are:

*   the person's geographic location in New Zealand;
*   the composition of the household a person lives in;
*   the income of the person or household relative to a maximum set by taking into account the lower quartile of household income based on household economic survey data published by Statistics New Zealand and adjusting the income maximum by an appropriate economic factor; geographic, household composition or otherwise; and
*   the person's assets.

The regulation will contain income and asset thresholds. This will help community housing entities to determine what proportion of the recipients of their assistance meet the requirements, and therefore if they have breached the 85 percent rule described above.

The 85 percent rule means that an entity can still be a "community housing entity" if up to 15 percent of its beneficiaries or clients breach the income and asset thresholds set out in the regulation.

The income and asset thresholds are to be applied at the point at which a client or beneficiary first registers for housing assistance with the community housing provider, and are not to be measured on an on-going basis. This means assessments to determine whether an entity breaches the income and asset threshold's 15 percent limit must also be done at the point of entry.

Although up to 15% of the beneficiaries or clients that a community housing entity takes on are allowed to breach the income and asset thresholds, there is a requirement that the provision of housing to these people must not be substantially different to the provision of housing to the rest of the entity's beneficiaries or clients. This rule ensures that the quality and standard of the homes provided by the entity is consistent across all of the recipients of the housing assistance and avoids the entity being used to provide expensive homes to people on moderate to high incomes.

These criteria ensure that the income tax exemption is aimed at community housing entities that are involved in providing housing products to people who are on low incomes and who could not otherwise afford to buy a home without Government assistance.

The Minister for Housing and the Minister of Revenue will be responsible for establishing a framework for determining who can be an eligible recipient of housing assistance for the purposes of the proposed exemption. This framework is currently being developed.

#### _Donations tax relief for donations to tax-exempt housing entities_

Under current tax law, donors who make cash donations of $5 or more to donee organisations are entitled to tax relief based on their donation. In the case of individuals, this relief is in the form of a tax credit; in the case of corporate or Māori authority donors, in the form of a tax deduction.

The amendment to section LD 3(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 confers donee organisation status on community housing entities.

Te mārama ki te pūnaha tāke a Aotearoa Understanding New Zealand's tax system
=============================================================================

New Zealand's government gets most of its revenue from taxes on:

*   individual income
*   business income
*   goods and services.

In New Zealand, taxes go towards funding programmes and services. You can see the amounts and types of taxes collected, as well as what the Government spent, by checking the financial statements the Treasury makes available.

[Revenue and expenditure (The Treasury)](https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/financial-management-and-advice/revenue-and-expenditure#:~:text=The%20three%20largest%20areas%20of,Education%3A%20%2415.3%20billion)

  

New Zealand has a tax system where you self-assess your tax position. This means you'll need to:

*   look at each type of income you earn and pay the right tax on them
*   file or approve a tax return at the end of the [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
    
*   see if you're eligible for any social policy programmes.

Income tax on individual income
-------------------------------

This is a tax on income you earn. Using set income ranges, different tax rates apply to each range of the total income you earn in a tax year.

*   Any income you earn in the lowest range is taxed at the lowest rate.
*   If you earn income in a higher range, the tax rate increases and applies only to the income you earn in that range.

[Tax rates for individuals](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/tax-rates-for-individuals)

[Income tax for individuals](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals)

Income tax on business income
-----------------------------

This is a tax on income businesses earn. You'll see that if you're self-employed or unincorporated, you'll be using the rates for individuals. Other business entities have different rates. You can work out which type of business suits your situation at the business.govt.nz website.

[Tax rates for businesses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/tax-rates-for-businesses)

[Business structure overview (business.govt.nz)](https://www.business.govt.nz/getting-started/choosing-the-right-business-structure/business-structure-overview/)
 

Goods and services tax (GST)
----------------------------

This is a tax on goods and services sold in New Zealand by registered suppliers. When you buy goods or services in New Zealand, you pay GST on most purchases. There are a few exceptions where you do not pay GST.

In any 12-month period, if you're in business and earn more than $60,000 in [turnover](/api/glossary/item?id={B7A7B2F3-9E68-4DDF-ACED-28BE96F1F811})
 from [taxable activities](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
, you'll need to register for GST. This means you'll charge your clients and customers GST, collect it and send it to us during the tax year.

[GST](/gst)

Paying the right tax on different types of income
-------------------------------------------------

It's good to check the lists of income types for both individuals and businesses. This way, you can make sure you're paying the right tax on each type of income you earn.

[Types of individual income](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/types-of-individual-income)

[Types of business income](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income)

  

Your tax residency status may affect what tax you'll pay on different types of income. Our section about international tax for individuals has lists of advice for different types of income, depending on whether you're a:

*   non-resident taxpayer
*   New Zealand tax resident.

You'll need to do this before you file or approve your end-of-year tax return.

[International tax for individuals](/international-tax/individuals)

  

If you've set up a formal company or you're doing business internationally, make sure you check out our international section for business.

[International tax for business](/international-tax/business)

Filing or approving your end-of-year tax return
-----------------------------------------------

Some of these types of income mean you'll be paying tax during the tax year. You'll still need to do a final check at the end of the tax year to see if you have:

*   a refund
*   tax to pay
*   no tax to pay.

[Filing or approving your end-of-year tax return](/situations/work-or-study-in-new-zealand/end-of-year-tax-return)

Social policy programmes
------------------------

You may be interested in the social policy programmes available. For example, New Zealand has a voluntary savings scheme to help set you up for retirement. Even if you're not yet eligible for this or other programmes like Working for Families or student loans, you may want to use them in the future.

Tax toolbox for tradies
=======================

Are you a self-employed tradie or running a construction business? Or maybe you're someone who helps a tradie keep on top of their books? We know you’re good on the tools. Take your tax as seriously as your trade by using our Tax Toolbox.

Show all

Record keeping - are you keeping good business records?

It’s important for you to keep accurate records. Records make it easier to:

*   work out your income and expenses
*   work out your GST if you’re GST registered
*   meet your employer obligations if you have staff
*   confirm your accounts.

Records must be in English or Māori and you need to keep them for at least 7 years.

[Record keeping](/managing-my-tax/record-keeping)

[Record keeping - checklist - IR1008](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir1000---ir1099/ir1008/ir1008-2019.pdf?modified=20200513034138)

Expenses - do you know what you can claim for?

Businesses, including self-employed contractors, get taxed on their income minus any business expenses and other claimable deductions. You will need to keep a record of your expenses and income (for example, invoices and receipts).

Watch this helpful video to get an idea of what tradie tools and other expenses can and can’t be claimed.

[Tax Time Tips (Bunnings)](https://trade.bunnings.co.nz/campaign/tax-time)

[Types of business expenses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses)

Income tax – are you telling us about all the income you earn and paying tax on it?  

Like all working New Zealanders, tradies need to pay tax on all income they earn. Keeping on top of your obligations is important. If you have outstanding returns or debt owing, cut the excuses and nail your income tax now.

Tip: You can make this easier by paying income tax on a cycle to suit your cashflow, rather than waiting until the end of the tax year.

Do you or your business own rental property? We can see if you’re under-declaring rental income. Make sure you declare it in your income tax returns.

#### Have any debt owing?

Don’t dig yourself a hole. Pay now before your debt gets out of control.

Tip: If paying off your debt in one go is too much, you can apply for an instalment arrangement which allows you to pay your debt off over time. An instalment arrangement also helps you avoid further late payment penalties.

#### Provisional tax

Provisional tax means paying your income tax in instalments, not in a lump sum at the end of the year.  We’ll ask you to pay provisional tax if last year's tax bill was more than $5,000.

[Provisional tax](/income-tax/provisional-tax)
 

GST – is your turnover $60,000 or more a year?

If you're self-employed or in business, once your turnover is $60,000 or more a year you need to register for GST, charge 15% GST on your sales and income, file GST returns and pay it to us. You can claim GST back on your purchases and expenses.

Tip: Make your life easier by working out your GST per dollar earned, then set this money aside in a dedicated bank account on a regular basis. Remember the GST filing frequency you’ve chosen and pay as you file. 

Have outstanding GST returns or debt? Don’t paint over the cracks, get your GST sorted now.

Employer obligations – employing tradies or staff?

If you’re running a construction business and employing people you need to make deductions from employees' pay and send the information to us.

Tip: Consider your payroll cycle and whether it needs to be weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Set aside payroll deductions every pay run so you have PAYE available.

#### Schedular payments

Schedular payments are payments made to independent contractors, with withholding tax deducted. If you're hiring independent contractors you need to deduct withholding tax and pay it to us on behalf of your contractor.

We want to give you a chance to put things right. Forgotten some income off your past tax returns, overinflated your expenses, or perhaps you remember an error you made in the past? It’s never too late to do the right thing - get in touch with us sooner rather than later. By making a voluntary disclosure, you may have penalties reduced by 100% and you’ll keep your good business reputation intact.

Tax Policy

Tax treaties
============

We advise the Government on international tax issues and are involved with the development and implementation of New Zealand's international tax legislation. This includes negotiating and bringing into force New Zealand's:

*   [double tax agreements](#dta)
     (DTAs) and protocols;[\[1\]](#fn1)
    
*   [tax information exchange agreements](#tiea)
     (TIEAs) and protocols;[\[1\]](#fn1)
    
*   [reciprocal arrangements](#reciprocal)
    ; and
*   [other agreements](#other)
    .

See [recent changes](/tax-treaties/recent-changes)
 for the latest updates made to tax treaties pages (last updated on **27 November 2023**).

Current negotiations
--------------------

Information about current negotiations and the progress of tax treaties towards entry into force are provided for each type of agreement. On rare occasions negotiations will not be shown where the other country has not given permission for the negotiations to be made public.

If you are interested in submitting comments on any negotiation in progress email your submission to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a2a3536333923742d3f38373b292e3f281a33283e743d352c2e743420)
.

National interest analysis and Select Committee consideration
-------------------------------------------------------------

Since 2002, DTAs, protocols and TIEAs have been subject to Parliamentary treaty examination (Parliament’s Standing Orders [397-400](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/parliamentary-rules/standing-orders-2017-by-chapter/chapter-7-NON-LEGISLATIVE-PROCEDURES/#_Toc490063195)
). This involves a Select Committee considering a national interest analysis. For treaties with regulatory impacts, the national interest analysis must cover all of the requirements normally considered in a [regulatory impact assessment](https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/regulation/impact-analysis-requirements-regulatory-proposals)
. The national interest analysis is published as part of the Select Committee report back to the House, and links to these reports are included on each country's tax treaty web page.

Double tax agreements
---------------------

New Zealand has a network of 41 DTAs in force with its main trading and investment partners. DTAs reduce tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment and assist tax administration. To find out more about DTAs see the [role of double tax agreements](/tax-treaties/role-double-tax-agreements)

Tax treatment of reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers
================================================================

2009 amendment provides an income tax exemption for reimbursement payments to volunteers and clarifies the tax treatment of honoraria.

_**Sections CO 1 and CW 62B of the Income Tax Act 2007**_

The Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to provide an exemption from income tax for reimbursement payments to volunteers. The rules also clarify the tax treatment of honoraria paid to volunteers.

### Background

Before this amendment it was unclear how reimbursement payments made to volunteers should be taxed, particularly if they were made as combined payments with honoraria.

### Key features

New section CO 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides a general rule treating amounts derived in undertaking voluntary activities as income of the person receiving them.

Section CO 1 is overridden by new section CW 62B, which provides that:

*   Reimbursement payments that are based on actual expenses incurred by volunteers in undertaking voluntary activities will be treated as exempt income to the volunteer.
*   If a paying organisation puts in place a process for making a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by a volunteer for whom reimbursement is payable, payments based on that estimate will also be treated as exempt income. This will provide flexibility, such as when it is not practical for organisations to reimburse their volunteers on the basis of actual costs incurred.
*   Organisations will still be able to make combined payments as long as they:
    *   clearly identify which portion of the payment is reimbursement;
    *   correctly withhold tax from the honorarium portion; and
    *   return the honorarium as a schedular payment in their employer monthly schedule.

The exempt income treatment includes reimbursements in non-cash form, such as petrol vouchers. It also includes reimbursement of transport costs incurred in getting to and from the place of volunteering, as well as those incurred in the course of volunteering.

Volunteers are defined as "people who freely undertake activity in New Zealand that has been chosen either by them or a group of which they are a member". The activity must provide a benefit to a community or another person. Although it is possible that the paying organisation could carry on a business for profit, there must be no purpose or intention of private pecuniary gain for the volunteer.

The term "honorarium" is defined for the purposes of both new section CW 62B and schedule 4, part B (Rates of tax for schedular payments).

The new tax treatment applies regardless of whether reimbursements are paid progressively through the year or in a lump sum.

### Application date

The exemption for reimbursements and rules for the treatment of mixed payments of honoraria and reimbursements apply retrospectively to all reimbursement payments made on or after 1 April 2009.

#### Example

Miriama is a voluntary regional coordinator for a national sports organisation, SportCo. Some travel to local centres, as well as attendance at tournaments is involved. Miriama uses her own car.

SportCo pays Miriama an honorarium of $50 per month for six months of the year.

SportCo estimates that Miriama travels an average of 250 kilometres per month in the course of her voluntary activities, including her travel to and from her home.

SportCo decides to reimburse Miriama’s travel expenses by paying her a travel allowance of 70 cents per kilometre.

The honorarium and travel allowance are paid together.

SportCo also gives Miriama meal vouchers to buy meals on the days that she has to attend tournaments.

Miriama receives a total payment of $225 in each of the six months of the year.

SportCo will deduct tax of $16.50 from the monthly payment of $225.

Tax treatment of transactions in emissions units
================================================

The legislation deals with the income tax treatment of transactions in emissions units outside the forestry sector. The amendments ensure that the tax treatment of emissions units is clear, that income and expenditure are recognised appropriately, and that unintended distortions do not arise.

_**Sections CB 36, CX 51B, DB 60, DB 61, EB 2, ED 1, ED 1B, EW 5, GC 1 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 2 and 11A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985**_

The legislation deals with the income tax treatment of transactions in emissions units outside the forestry sector. The amendments ensure that the tax treatment of emissions units is clear, that income and expenditure are recognised appropriately, and that unintended distortions do not arise.

Generally emissions units are treated as excepted financial arrangements which are revenue account property. Emissions units purchased will generally be deductible on acquisition, but added back at cost at year-end to the extent they are still on hand. Income from the receipt of emissions units from government is assessable on an accruals basis.

The amendments to the GST legislation ensure that emissions acquisitions and disposals of emissions units can take place across international electronic markets. The supply of emissions units is almost always zero-rated for GST purposes. Supplies made by businesses to government for the receipt of emissions units under the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) are now also zero rated.

These changes ensure that the tax treatment of transactions in emissions units is clear, and consistent with both the government’s objectives in introducing an emissions trading scheme and coherent tax policy.

### Background

The government introduced an emissions trading scheme in the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008. That Act inserts provisions into the Climate Change Response Act 2002, under which:

*   businesses in certain sectors will be required to surrender emission units based on their emissions; and
*   the government may allocate "free" emission units to businesses in certain sectors.

For more information on the emissions trading scheme see [https://www.mfe.govt.nz/node/21785](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/node/21785 "This link will open in a new window")
 .

Previously, the taxation treatment of transactions in emissions units was sometimes unclear, and inconsistent with the government’s climate change objectives or coherent tax policy.

Proposals for the tax treatment of transactions in emissions units were set out in the government discussion document [_Emissions Trading Tax Issues_](http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2007-09-24-emissions-trading-scheme-tax-issues/ "This link will open in a new window")
 released in September 2007.

Some amendments to the tax legislation were made by the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008. The Act amended tax legislation to:

*   provide for the income tax treatment of forestry businesses which participated in the emissions trading scheme; and
*   generally GST zero-rate transactions in emissions units.

An explanation of these amendments can be found in _Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 20, No. 9 (November 2008)._

The new rules follow on from the amendments above, and deal with the income tax treatment of businesses outside the forestry sector. They also make some further GST amendments.

In the interests of simplicity and coherency, the earlier income tax amendments have been rewritten and incorporated into the new rules.

### Key features

New provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 provide for the tax treatment of emissions trading units.

The amendments address transactions which arise under the emissions trading scheme, and other transactions in emissions units - such as the sale of emissions units by one business to another. Certain amendments also apply to "voluntary" emissions units - units which are not used in the emissions trading scheme.

Most costs of emissions trading will be tax deductible, and the government subsidy (the award of "free" emission units by government) of emissions costs will generally be taxable. The specific taxation treatment varies depending on the emissions type, of which there are four:

*   non-forestry - generally dealt with on an accruals basis;
*   post-1989 forestry - dealt with on a cash basis;
*   pre-1990 forestry where the land is held on capital account - outside the tax system; and
*   pre-1990 forestry where the land is held on revenue account - special rules apply.

There are special rules for the surrender of emission units to government.

The government subsidy is recognised on an accruals basis, by reference to the accruing costs or liability for which the subsidy is intended to compensate.

Generally emissions units are treated as excepted financial arrangements that are revenue account property. Emissions units are generally deductible upon acquisition, but added back at cost at year-end to the extent they are still on hand.

### Application date

The amendments to the Income Tax Act apply from 1 January 2009.

Amendments to the GST Act relating to Kyoto-compliant and other "official" emissions units apply from the date of Royal assent, being 6 October 2009. GST amendments for "unofficial" or voluntary units take effect from 1 April 2010.

### Detailed analysis

The underlying objective of the income tax amendments for the non-forestry sector is to generally treat transactions in emissions units as revenue account transactions. Emissions units are excepted financial arrangements, so are generally valued at cost with no annual revaluation and consequent gains and losses. Income and expenditure arising under the emissions trading scheme is recognised on an accruals basis, consistent with ordinary tax and accounting practice.

Except where otherwise indicated, the commentary below applies only to New Zealand units, Kyoto and other "official" units - defined in section YA 1 as "emissions units".

At the end of this section there is a comprehensive example of the income tax treatment of a non-forestry business.

#### Underlying basis of taxation

Emissions units are defined as trading stock in section EB 2, and as excepted financial arrangements in section EW 5. Section ED 1 contains new provisions which require businesses which hold emissions units received from more than one source (for example, units awards for carbon capture in a post-1989 forest, and units purchased on the open market) to be kept in separate "pools" for valuation purposes. This is to ensure that the correct tax treatment can be applied to each different type of unit when selling, surrendering, or valuing at the end of the year.

Certain "unofficial" units are also treated as revenue account property and excepted financial arrangements. These are emissions units which are issued by reference to greenhouse gases and which are verified to an internationally recognised standard. (See the definition in section YA 1 of "non-Kyoto greenhouse gas unit".)

#### Disposal of emissions units

New section CB 36 deals with the disposal, including by way of surrender, of emissions units. In general, an amount received on the disposal of an emissions unit is treated as income.

If the emissions unit is surrendered to meet an obligation relating to post-1989 forestry land or pre-1990 forestry land held on revenue account, the unit is treated as being sold for zero.

If the emissions unit is a post-1989 forest land emissions unit but is surrendered to meet a liability which does not relate to post-1989 forest land, or it is a unit granted by government outside the forestry context and which has not yet been brought into account for tax purposes, it is treated as being sold for market value.

Generally in other circumstances, surrender is treated as a sale for cost. This is because the business will have already received the deduction for the liability to surrender units on an accruals basis.

Separate provision has been made in section CX 51B for the disposal of emissions units awarded by the government in relation to pre-1990 forestry land which is not held on revenue account. Because the award of these units is to compensate for the fall in value of the land - a capital transaction - the disposal of these units gives rise to excluded income. The classification as excluded rather than exempt income is to ensure that there is no impediment to claiming interest deductions relating to this forestry land.

#### Deduction for emissions liabilities outside the forestry sector

There are no specific provisions providing deductions for emissions liabilities outside the forestry sector. This is because ordinary principles are sufficient to provide a deduction on an accruals basis. The year-end deduction for each business will be determined by:

*   calculating the business’s liability to surrender units under the emissions trading scheme which is attributable to the income year, in accordance with the methodology prescribed under the Climate Change Act (almost certainly the same calculation as will be made for financial reporting purposes);
*   to the extent that the business has purchased and still holds at the end of the income year any emissions units, the cost of those units (limited to the income year liability); and
*   to the extent the business holds fewer units than the income year liability, that shortfall multiplied by the market value of a New Zealand unit at the end of the income year (or, if a proposed price cap is implemented and applicable, the amount of the price cap).

Emissions units awarded without payment by the government are not netted off in this calculation - they are brought in as income separately under express statutory provisions.

The application of ordinary principles to post-1989 forestry land and pre-1990 forestry land held on revenue account is expressly denied by section DB 61. This is because forestry businesses obtain their deduction by way of the rule which states that emissions units surrendered for liabilities arising from this type of land are treated as being sold for zero.

#### Recognition of income when subsidy units are allocated by government (non-forestry)

Certain non-forestry businesses will be allocated units without payment under the emissions trading scheme. These are some of the businesses which face increased costs as a result of the introduction of the emissions trading scheme, either in the form of a new liability to surrender emissions units, or increased costs, such as higher electricity prices.

The principle behind these amendments is that income arises from the free allocation of these units, but that income should be recognised on an accruals basis. Income from the award of units is matched to the expenses for which the award compensates. The section is primarily required to deal with the fact that allocations of units will relate to an emissions year, which is a year ending 31 December, whereas many businesses do not have income years ending 31 December. Income recognition is triggered by assigning the units a market value - in the absence of a market value being assigned, the units will have a zero value.

Section ED 1B applies when emissions units have been allocated to the business by government, the emissions units do not relate to forestry, and the section has not previously valued the units at market value.

When first allocated, these units have a value of zero - see section ED 1(7B)(a).

If the emissions year to which the units relate has not started at the end of the income year, the emissions units continue to have a value of zero. If the emissions year finishes during or at the end of the income year, the emissions units have a value of the market value of those emissions units at the end of the income year.

If the emissions year has started at the end of the income year, but has not yet finished, section ED 1B applies to value some of the units received at market value, and the remainder at nil.

A simple pro-rating calculation is applied to determine the number of units which are to be given a market value.

The primary basis for the pro-rating calculation is by reference to the business’s emissions. So, if the business expects to have a total emissions liability of 1,000 units for the emissions year, and at the end of the income year emissions total 200 units, then 200/1000, or 20%, of whatever number of units have been allocated for the year are assigned a market value, with the remainder having a nil value. The remaining units will probably be assigned a market value at the end of the next income year, under the rule that all emissions units which relate to an emissions year which has finished are assigned a market value.

If the business cannot estimate its emissions liability for the emissions year or the accrued liability at the end of the income year, a pro-rating by reference to the number of days of the emission year which have elapsed in the income year can be used.

There are two important variations to the rules described above.

First, some businesses which receive subsidy emissions units will be facing indirect cost increases (such as a higher electricity price) rather than a direct liability to surrender emissions units. These businesses should use the relevant cost (such as expenditure on electricity), if they can determine it, in the pro-rating formula in place of emissions.

Secondly, some businesses might sell emissions units received before the end of the income year. The sale proceeds are brought into account under other provisions. This other income recognition is taken into account in the pro-rating formula - so if, in the scenario discussed above, the business had already sold 20% or more of its free allocation of units, no further units would be assigned a market value. If it had sold less than 20%, the difference between 20% and the number of units already sold would be assigned a market value.

#### Anti-avoidance rules

Because emissions units are trading stock, the anti-avoidance rule in section GC 1 applies. Transactions at less than market value are deemed to take place at market value. However, the surrender of emissions units is expressly excluded from section GC 1.

**Example: Income tax calculations for a non-forestry business**

On 1 January 2015, AB Co begins manufacturing product Z for export. Carbon dioxide is emitted as part of manufacturing product Z, and the provisions of the Climate Change Act require AB Co to surrender the commensurate number of emission units following the end of each emissions year.

The government issues an allocation plan under the provisions of the Climate Change Act under which businesses that make product Z for export are entitled to receive "free" emission units.

AB Co is issued 100 free units for the emissions year which runs from 1 January to 31 December 2015. AB Co’s expected emissions liability for the emissions year is 800 units. AB Co has a 30 June balance date. On 30 April 2015, AB Co buys a further 150 emissions units for $8 each. On 30 June 2015, emission units are trading at $10 each.

The following calculations are required for AB Co’s 2014-15 tax return.

Under existing law, AB Co will be entitled to a deduction on an emerging basis for its emissions obligations. AB Co produces the same amount of product Z every month in the same way, so management knows that emissions are exactly the same level every month. At the end of the 2014-15 income year, the proportion of the emissions liability to be recognised is 6/12 x 800 units = 400 units. The fraction 6/12 is simply the number of months in the 2015 emissions year which have elapsed at the end of the 2014-15 income year.

The 2014-15 income year deduction for the accrued liability to surrender 400 units will be calculated as follows:

*   150 units x $8 = $1,200. This is the portion of the liability matched to the 150 units which have been purchased, valued at the cost price of those units.
*   250 units x $10 = $2,500, which is the remaining portion of the liability, valued at the market value of those units at balance date. Any variance between the year-end market value and the eventual actual cost of the 250 units required will be brought to account in the following income year.

The 100 free units are not relevant to calculation of the deduction.

The total deduction for the liability accrued in 2014-15 to surrender 400 units is therefore $1,200 + $2,500 = $3,700.

The approach taken to recognition of the income from the 100 free units is similar. Income from the 100 allocated units will be recognised over the period to which the allocation applies, on a basis which matches the allocated units to the costs for which they are intended to compensate.

AB Co will therefore recognise as income the value of 400/800 x 100 units = 50 units at the end of its 2014-15 income year. The fraction 400/800 is the number of units of emissions actually emitted in the 2015 emissions year at the end of the 2014-15 income year, divided by the number of units of emissions expected for the entire 2015 emissions year. This is the same pro-rating formula used to determine the deduction above.

The balance date market value of the units is used to calculate the income, so this is 50 units x $10 = $500.

However, if the 100 units were sold immediately upon receipt for $8 each (and this might occur if the business does not have a direct emissions obligation, but rather is downstream from a business with emission obligations), then the sale proceeds of $800 would be income. The units sold would have no cost base.

The increase in the market value of the 150 emissions units held from $8 to $10 each is not brought into account.

#### GST amendments - background

As noted earlier, transactions in emissions units were generally zero-rated by amendments introduced in the Climate Change Act.

Technical amendments have been made to reflect the original policy intention of the provisions introduced in the Climate Change Act, particularly in relation to emissions units which are transferred by the government under schemes outside the Climate Change Act.

Amendments have also been made to extend zero-rating to emissions units which are not New Zealand units, Kyoto-compliant emissions units or approved overseas units (sometimes called "voluntary" or "unofficial" units).

A table showing the [GST treatments of different emissions units transactions](/internet/ird/technical-tax/legislation/2009/2009-34/2009-34-other-policy-matters/2009-34-op-emissions-units/leg-2009-34-op-table-summary-of-gst-treatments.html)
 can be viewed here.

#### GST treatment of Permanent Forest Sink Initiative transactions in units

The Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) is a government scheme under which landowners can establish permanent forest sinks on land that was not forested on 31 December 1989, and receive emissions units reflecting the amount of carbon sequestered in their forests. For more information, see www.maf.govt.nz/forestry/pfsi.

The zero-rating of the transfer of emissions units by the government under PFSI has been added to paragraph (s).

This change has the consequential effect of zero-rating the supply of services made by the forester in exchange for the emissions units (whether it is an actual supply or a deemed supply under section 5(6D)).

The change applies from the date of Royal assent, being 6 October 2009.

#### GST treatment of other transfers of emissions units by government

Section 11A(1)(v) was introduced by the Climate Change Act. It was intended to zero-rate transactions in emissions units in the private sector, and the sale of emissions units by the government. It was not intended to apply when the government transfers emissions units without payment. The section has been amended to make this clear. Accordingly, the transfer of emissions units by government under schemes such as the Project to Reduce Emissions (PRE) and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements (NGAs) revert to being standard-rated, although any subsequent transfers of these units by recipients will be zero-rated under paragraph (v).

The change applies from the date of Royal assent, being 6 October 2009.

#### Zero-rating of transfers of other types of emissions units

The provisions referred to above apply to transactions in New Zealand units, Kyoto-compliant units and approved overseas units.

New provisions also zero-rate certain other emissions units which do not fall within this description - sometimes called "grey market" or "voluntary" units.

The new provisions apply to units which are:

*   issued by reference to the sequestration, or avoidance of emission, of human-induced greenhouse gases; and
*   verified to an internationally recognised standard.

Examples of the type of units which will qualify for zero-rating under the new rules are Voluntary Carbon Standard units ([www.v-c-s.org](http://www.v-c-s.org/ "This link will open in a new window")
) and Gold Standard units ([www.cdmgoldstandard.org](http://www.cdmgoldstandard.org/ "This link will open in a new window")
).

The change applies from 1 April 2010.

Tax treatment of wooden scaffolding planks
==========================================

QB (2006) clarifies the income tax treatment of wooden planks used as working platforms on metal-framed scaffolding.

### Section DA 1(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2004

### Question

We have recently been asked to clarify the income tax treatment of wooden planks used in scaffolding, ie, planks used as working platforms on metal-framed scaffolding.

### Answer

The Commissioner considers that the wooden planks are part of the asset class "scaffolding" and, therefore, the planks must initially be depreciated at the same rate as the scaffolding framework which they are used with. However, as "scaffolding", as described in DEP 1 (Tax Depreciation Rate General Determination Number 1) is the depreciable property, any plank that is replaced because it is no longer useful in deriving assessable income, can be treated as a repair or maintenance (replacement) for income tax purposes. The cost of any replacement wooden planks used in conjunction with scaffolding can be claimed as a deduction in the year of purchase.

### Analysis

Tax Depreciation Determination DEP1 under the "Contractors, Builders and Quarrying" industry class sets estimated useful lives, diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates for scaffolding as follows:

|     | Estimated useful life | DV dep'n rate (%) | SL dep'n rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scaffolding (aluminium) | 8   | 22  | 15.5 |
| Scaffolding (other than aluminium) | 15.5 | 12  | 8   |

For the income years corresponding to the 2005-06 and subsequent tax years, in respect of scaffolding acquired on or after 1 April 2005, Tax Depreciation Determination DEP54 sets the rates for the above assets as follows:

|     | DV dep'n rate (%) | SL dep'n rate (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scaffolding (aluminium) | 25  | 17.5 |
| Scaffolding (other than aluminium) | 13  | 8.5 |

The Commissioner considers wooden planks, used with scaffolding framework, form an essential and integral part of the scaffolding.

There are a number of factors to take into account when considering whether or not an asset is a separate part of a complete asset. These factors consider physical separation, functional separation, completeness and the degree of permanence of the asset under consideration. These factors were considered in respect to "scaffolding", and it was concluded that scaffolding could not function without the planks.

On balance, the degree of physical separation, affixation, and the fact that the planks are readily relocatable tends to suggest that the planks could be separate items of depreciable property. However, the functionality and completeness of scaffolding combined with the degree of permanence leads to the conclusion that scaffolding includes both the framework and the planks. Accordingly, wooden planks used in this manner are not sufficient to be categorised functionally as a separate depreciable item.

It is expected that wooden scaffolding planks will have a shorter estimated useful life than the scaffolding framework. This may be due to a variety of factors, including regular replacement to meet health and safety requirements. As the wooden planks form part of the asset class "scaffolding", they must be depreciated at the rate for the scaffolding they are used in conjunction with. However, where the wooden planks are replaced the cost of replacement can be claimed as a deduction in the year of purchase.

### Other types of planks

The Commissioner recognises that wooden planks are used in the construction industry and in other industries for purposes other than as scaffolding and intends to issue a separate depreciation determination to reflect this. In this determination the planks are described as "Builders' planks (wooden)" to distinguish them from planks used in conjunction with scaffolding. The new depreciation rate will only be applicable where the taxpayer does not choose to claim a current year deduction for the purchases under the "low value asset" provisions of section EE 31 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the requirements of that section have been met.

21 February 2019 - Tax Working Group delivers Final Report
==========================================================

Press releases

Issue date: Thursday, 21 February 2019

Concerns about the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system have led to the Tax Working Group recommending the Government tax more income from capital gains.

Group Chair Sir Michael Cullen says our system has many strengths but there is a clear weakness caused by our inconsistent treatment of capital gains.

“New Zealanders earning just salary and wages are taxed on their full income but we have several situations where you can earn income from gains on assets and not be taxed at all.

“All members of the Group agree that more income from capital gains should be taxed from the sale of residential rental properties. The majority of us on the Group, by a margin of 8-3, support going further and broadening that approach to include all land and buildings, business assets, intangible property and shares.

“We have judged that the increase in compliance and efficiency costs is worth it if we can reduce the biases towards certain types of investments and improve the fairness, integrity and fiscal sustainability of the tax system.”

The Group recommends that a tax on capital gains would kick in when an asset is sold or changes hands and would be applied with no discounted tax rate and no allowance for inflation. Gains would be calculated from when any new law comes into force.

Three members prefer for this to apply only to residential rental property.

Sir Michael says the Group has presented the Government with choices and options rather than a rigid blueprint.

“The Government doesn’t necessarily need to make a straight call over whether or not to adopt the Group’s preferred model for taxing more capital gains. It could choose to apply it to only some types of assets or stagger the inclusion of different assets over time. It may decide to apply the deemed return method to property. All these options are open to the Government.”

The Tax Working Group estimates that broadly taxing more income from capital gains will raise roughly $8 billion over the first five years.

“If the Government chooses to proceed down this path, it then unlocks opportunities to reduce taxes in other areas so we have given them some options to consider,” says Sir Michael.

#### Lowering personal income tax

The Group has investigated a range of reductions in personal income tax. Its preferred approach is allowing New Zealanders to earn more at the lowest tax rate of 10.5%. This would reduce income inequality, benefit all full-time workers, and support those transitioning into work.

#### Encourage savings

The Group has identified a range of measures to encourage saving, targeting those at lower- and middle-income levels. These include refunding the Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) for KiwiSaver members earning less than $48,000 a year and cutting the KiwiSaver tax rates for low- and middle-income savers.

These reductions would mean that this group would pay less tax overall on their KiwiSaver, even if the income from capital gains on their accounts is taxed.

#### Supporting businesses

The Group sees the current approach to the taxation of business as largely sound and sees no case to reduce the tax rate or introduce a progressive scale for companies. However, it is recommending measures to help businesses to grow, be more productive and lower what they spend complying with our tax rules.

### Further recommendations

“Deliberations over extending the taxation of capital gains have taken up a considerable amount of time but our final report is about far more than that single issue,” says Sir Michael.

“The report has a strong focus on the environment and recommends better use of taxes to discourage activities that cause negative impacts. We have developed a framework for deciding when such taxes can be best applied.

“Transitioning to a more sustainable economy is a long-term project but we are recommending to Government that increasing the rate and scope of the Waste Disposal Levy; strengthening the Emissions Trading Scheme; and using congestion charging on our roads should be immediate priorities.”

### Enhancing the integrity and administration of the tax system

The Group has recommended a number of measures to safeguard the integrity of the tax system and improve its administration, which it thinks should be implemented regardless of whether a tax on more income from capital gains goes ahead.

*   Increased enforcement of closely-held companies as there appears to be a set of integrity issues around their tax affairs.
*   Inland Revenue’s crackdown on the hidden economy could be strengthened with the introduction of stricter reporting requirements.
*   A single Government debt collection agency should be established to achieve economies of scale and fairer outcomes for New Zealanders who owe money to the Government.
*   A taxpayer advocacy service should be established to help small taxpayers in dispute with Inland Revenue.
*   Regular reviews should be conducted of the charitable sector to ensure the tax concessions enjoyed by the businesses they run are being put towards the intended social outcomes.

“The Final Report represents the end of our work on the Tax Working Group but the national conversation we’ve all been having about tax will continue,” says Sir Michael.

“We encourage all New Zealanders to stay involved as the programme of tax reform is developed. Together, we can – and should – shape the future of tax.”

Tax Working Group open minded on how to future proof the tax system
===================================================================

**16 March 2018**

A national conversation is well underway on the future of tax and the Tax Working Group remains open minded about where it will lead.

Taxes on wealth, capital gains and unhealthy products have all been keenly debated since the call went out for submissions on March 1st.

Today, the Tax Working Group has released a Submissions Background Paper, which aims to provide more context to these issues and the many more that are up for discussion over the next six weeks.

The group's website (taxworkinggroup.govt.nz) has also been updated to include thought-provoking videos and a quick comment facility. Longer, more detailed submissions are also welcomed and can be sent to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#403335222d293333292f2e3300342138372f322b292e2727322f35306e272f36346e2e3a)
.

Group Chair Sir Michael Cullen says it’s time to turn that robust debate into actual submissions.

"It's heartening to hear New Zealanders have a lot to say about these issues as tax affects everyone.

"But anyone who wants to make a difference and have their views heard should go to the website and take part in the process."

\[embed width="480" height="270" class="leftAlone" thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Z10xAZPlRE/hqdefault.jpg?r"\]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z10xAZPlRE\[/embed\]

Sir Michael says it’s clear that a capital gains tax and land taxes will be among the most contentious issues.

"I want to take this opportunity to remind New Zealanders that the family home is completely out of the mix but that still leaves plenty of scope to review other ways such taxes might be applied. Inheritance taxes are off the table too.

"This is very much the discussion and consideration phase. No decisions have been made and there are no preconceived ideas about where this process will end up. Every idea will be examined on its merits.

"We're not being asked how to raise more revenue for the government but we are being asked how to maintain the current level in the face of some major future challenges such as an ageing population and new technologies."

The Tax Working Group is encouraging all New Zealanders to have their say on the future of tax.

Tax Working Group publishes interim report
==========================================

**20 September 2018**

The Tax Working Group is updating the public on its progress and thinking with the publication of its Interim Report today.

Chair Sir Michael Cullen says that the Group has conducted a wide-ranging review in order to assess the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. The Group has also brought a broad conception of wellbeing and living standards to its work – including a consideration of Te Ao Māori concepts and perspectives on the tax system.

Thousands of New Zealanders – including iwi, businesses, and unions – have engaged with the Group over the past months. “The thousands of public submissions have given us a clear indication of the key challenges and opportunities for the tax system,” says Sir Michael.

“We see clear opportunities to improve the balance of the system by introducing environmental taxes, while measures to increase tax compliance would increase the fairness of the system. We have also identified important issues regarding the treatment of capital income in the tax system.”

The highlights of the interim report include:

*   **The taxation of capital income.** The Group's work on capital income is not yet complete. The Interim Report sets out two potential options for extending capital income taxation: extending the tax net to include gains on assets that are not already taxed; and taxing deemed returns from certain assets (known as the risk-free rate of return method of taxation). Feedback on these options will inform the recommendations in the Group's Final Report in February 2019. The Group is not recommending the introduction of wealth taxes or land taxes.
*   **Environmental and ecological outcomes.** The Group sees significant scope for the tax system to sustain and enhance New Zealand's natural capital. Short-term opportunities include expanding the Waste Disposal Levy, strengthening the Emissions Trading Scheme, and advancing the use of congestion charging.
*   **Housing affordability.** The Group has found that the tax system is not the primary cause of unaffordable housing in New Zealand, but is likely to have exacerbated the house price cycle. The Group's forthcoming work will include consideration of the housing market impacts of the options for extending capital income taxation.
*   **GST.** The Group is not recommending a reduction in GST, or the introduction of new GST exceptions. Instead, the Group believes that other measures (such as transfers) will be more effective in supporting those on low incomes.
*   **Business taxation.** The Group is not recommending a reduction in the company rate or the introduction of a progressive company tax. The Group is still forming its views on the best ways to reduce compliance costs and enhance productivity.
*   **The administration of the tax system.** The Group has identified a number of opportunities to improve tax collection such as increasing penalties for non-compliance as well as recommending a single Crown debt collection agency to ensure all debtors are treated equally. A taxpayer advocate service is also recommended to assist small businesses in disputes with Inland Revenue.

Sir Michael says that extending the taxation of capital income will have a range of advantages and disadvantages. The Group is still weighing up these issues, and will come back with firm recommendations in its Final Report in February 2019.

“Extending the taxation of capital income will have many benefits,” says Sir Michael. “It will improve the fairness and integrity of the tax system; it will improve the sustainability of the revenue base; and it will level the playing field between different types of investments. Yet the options for extending capital income taxation can be complex, resulting in higher compliance and administration costs.

“We have made some good progress in setting out the main choices and options – but there is still a great deal of work to do before we provide our Final Report in February.”

The Group's Final Report will provide full recommendations on all of the issues examined by the Group, including the rates and thresholds for income tax.

“The Group will be mindful of the distributional impacts of any changes it recommends in its final report. It also recognises that some people may need time to transition to the new arrangements.

“It's also worth pointing out that any extension of capital income taxation would apply from a future date, and would not have a retrospective element.

“Everyone on the Group believes we have a unique opportunity to improve the tax system. We are all determined to deliver recommendations in February that will make a positive difference for New Zealanders,” says Sir Michael.

Taxation (Bright-Line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015
=========================================================

2015 Act introduces a 'bright-line' test requiring income tax to be paid on any gains from residential property that is disposed of within two years of acquisition.

_Sections CB 6A, CB 13, CB 14, CB 15B, CB 16A, CB 23B, DB 18A, DB 18AB, DB 29, FB 3A, FC 3, FC 4, FC 9, FO 10, FO 17, GB 52, GB 53, and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3 and 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

The Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill was introduced into Parliament on 24 August 2015. The bill received its first reading on 8 September 2015, the second reading on 3 November 2015 and the third reading on 12 November 2015. The resulting Act received Royal assent on 16 November 2015.

The Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Act 2015 introduces a new "bright-line" test that will require income tax to be paid on any gains from residential property that is disposed of within two years of acquisition, subject to some exceptions.

The new legislation amends the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Background

As part of Budget 2015, the Government announced its intention to introduce a new land sale rule to supplement the "intention test" in the land sale rules. Under those rules, gains from the sale of land are taxable when the land is bought with an intention or purpose of resale, and the taxpayer is required to return any gain as income. Because of the subjective nature of the intention test however, it can be difficult to enforce. To deal with this problem, the new legislation introduces a new easy-to-enforce bright-line test.

The bright-line test is the second of three stages of the Government's reform package to tighten the property investment rules announced as part of Budget 2015.

The first stage - new information requirements for land transfers and offshore persons - came into force on 1 October 2015, and information about the new rules was published in the November edition of the _Tax Information Bulletin_ (Vol 27, No 10, November 2015).

The third stage - a withholding tax for offshore persons selling New Zealand residential property - was introduced into Parliament on 16 November 2015 in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill, following consultation in August 2015.

### Key features

Gains from the disposal of residential land acquired and disposed of within two years will be taxable, subject to some exceptions.

The two year bright-line period generally starts at the point a person has title for the property transferred to them and ends at the time the person enters into a contract to sell the property. For sales "off the plan", the two-year period runs from the date the person enters into a contract to buy the property to the time when a person enters into a contract to sell the property.

The bright-line test applies only to residential land. Residential land includes land that has a dwelling on it, land where the owner has an arrangement to build a dwelling on it, and bare land that could have a dwelling erected on it under the relevant district plan. "Residential land" does not include business premises or farmland.

The bright-line test does not apply to a person's main home. A person can only have one main home. If a person has more than one home, their main home is the one with which the person has the greatest connection.

The main home exclusion is generally available to properties held in trust. There are additional requirements to ensure that people cannot use the main home exclusion for multiple properties through the use of trusts.

The bright-line test does not apply to property acquired through an inheritance. There is rollover relief for property transferred as a result of a relationship property agreement. This means that any potential tax liability will be deferred until a subsequent sale.

Taxpayers will be allowed deductions according to ordinary tax rules for property that is subject to the bright-line test.

Losses arising from the bright-line test will be ring-fenced so that they may only be used to offset taxable gains from other land sales.

There are specific anti-avoidance rules to counter companies and trusts being used to circumvent the bright-line test.

### Application dates

The bright-line test came into force on 1 October 2015.

The bright-line test will only apply to a person's disposal of land if the person acquires their "first interest" in the land on or after 1 October 2015. The date a person acquires their "first interest" is the same date as when they acquire land for the purposes of section CB 15B in the Income Tax Act 2007. As a result, guidance on section CB 15B can be used to help determine when a person's "first interest" in land was acquired.

When there is a standard acquisition of land, the date a person acquires their "first interest" will generally be the date of entry into an agreement to purchase the land. This means the bright-line test will only apply to the sale of land if the agreement for purchase of the land was entered into on or after 1 October 2015.

##### Example: Application date

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/5/d5f15bf7-98e8-446b-a5f9-43c89061d54d/feb-tib-example-dave.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214327&hash=D45A5CF0B40022F126506794C482D310)

The sale by Dave is not subject to the bright-line test. This is because Dave acquired his "first interest" in the land when he entered into an agreement to purchase the land on 2 June 2015. As this is before 1 October 2015, the bright-line test does not apply.

For non-standard sales of land, the date of "first interest" may be different for different circumstances. For example, for a gift, the date of "first interest" will usually be the date of registration of title.

The amendments for the non-active trust filing exception came into force on 16 November 2015.

The amendments for the definition of "land", and clarifying the treatment of land transferred under a resident's restricted amalgamation came into force on 1 October 2015.

### DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Two-year time period

_Section CB 6A of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Under the bright-line test any gain a person derives from disposing of residential land is treated as income of the person if the property is disposed of within two years of acquisition.

The start and end date for the purposes of this two-year period are specifically defined for the purposes of the bright-line test. Start and end dates for different transactions may differ depending on the nature of the transaction.

#### _Standard sales of land_

There are four steps in the land sale process of relevance to the bright-line test:

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/9/d9170655-1958-43c2-b952-dba780ed80cf/feb-tib-land-sale.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214333&hash=EADFE0F239815C70490564A275598E84)

For standard sales of land, the start date for the bright-line period is the date the transfer of the land is registered to the person under the Land Transfer Act 1952. The end date is the date that a person enters into an agreement to dispose of the land.

There are a number of situations when land is acquired and disposed of that do not follow the standard land sale process. For these situations, there are separate rules for when the bright-line period starts and ends.

#### _Start dates_

| Type of acquisition | Start date of bright-line test |
| --- | --- |
| Standard purchase of land | Registration |
| Sales when there is no registration of title | Latest date property acquired (according to ordinary rules) |
| Sales "off the plan" (as outlined in the section below) | Date of entry into a contract to purchase |
| Subdivided land | The original date of registration for the undivided land |
| Converting a lease with a perpetual right of renewal into freehold title | Date the lease with a perpetual right of renewal is acquired |

_Sale when there is no registration of title_

When there is registration of title, generally the start date for the bright-line is the date of registration. However, there are situations when there is no registration of title. In these circumstances, the start date for the bright-line test is the latest date the person acquired the land under ordinary rules.

For a sale of a contract to buy land, this will be the date that a person enters into a contract to purchase the property. This means that for a sale of a contract to buy, the bright-line period runs from the date that a person enters into a contract to purchase the land to the date that a person enters into a contract to sell the land.

_Earlier start dates than given under standard rules_

There are three specific scenarios where a person is entitled to an earlier start date than would be the case under the two rules outlined above. These are for:

*   sales "off the plan";
*   subdivided land; and
*   leases with a perpetual right of renewal converted into freehold title.

_Sales "off the plan"_

A sale "off the plan" for the bright-line test occurs when a person enters into a contract to acquire a parcel of land that is being developed or subdivided. At the time the person enters into the contract, the title for the land they are agreeing to purchase does not yet exist (as the land needs to be subdivided or developed before separate title can be issued). The person agrees to acquire registered title in the land once a separate title exists.

In this situation, the person may use an earlier start date than would be the case under the standard rule. The start date in this situation is the date the person enters into an agreement for the sale and purchase of the land.

##### Example: Sale "off the plan"

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/4/6/46cc10c2-606e-476c-8283-ea15b5ef086e/feb-tib-denise.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214322&hash=79887116D90BCA48A2E8A519915D5114)

Denise is not subject to the bright-line test as the start date for the bright-line is 1 July 2016 (the date she entered into a contract to purchase "off the plan") and the end date is 1 March 2019 (the date she entered into a contract to sell).

_Subdivided land_

The start date for the bright-line period when land is subdivided is the date the owner originally acquired the undivided land.

##### Example: Subdivision

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/9/c/9cca44db-874d-4da4-9988-a326e50ee0e9/feb-tib-bob.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214326&hash=B1FD8B7C27070370752A867A68F13A33)

The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2016 and the end date is 1 May 2022. As a result, Bob's sale of the second section to Carla is not covered by the bright-line test.

_Conversion of a lease with a perpetual right of renewal into freehold title_

When a person has a lease with a perpetual right of renewal which they then convert into freehold land, the start date for the bright-line period is the date the person is granted the lease. This is consistent with other tax provisions that treat a lease with a perpetual right of renewal similar to freehold estates.

##### Example: Lease with perpetual right of renewal

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/c/3/c30aee6b-e8fa-41d1-a4d4-ab6a1200250e/feb-tib-kelly.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214324&hash=6A31564A80FB37CC9D8E4552FA3BE323)

The start date for Kelly's bright-line period is 1 July 2016 (the date the lease with perpetual right of renewal is granted) and the end date is 1 April 2019 (the date she entered into agreement to sell the land).

Gains from Kelly's sale of the land are not taxable under the bright-line test.

**_End date for bright-line period_** 

For standard sales of land the end date for the bright-line period is the date a person enters into an agreement to dispose of the property.

There are several situations when land is disposed of but there is no agreement in place to dispose of the property. In these situations, the proposed end date for the bright-line period differs from the standard rule.

| Type of disposal | End date of bright-line period |
| --- | --- |
| Standard purchase of land | Date of entry into agreement for sale |
| Gift | Date of gift (generally registration of title) |
| Compulsory acquisition | Date of compulsory acquisition |
| Mortgagee sale | Date land disposed of by mortgagee |
| Other disposals where no contract to sell | Date of disposal according to ordinary rules |

_Gifts_

For gifts, the end date for the bright-line period is the date the person makes the gift of the residential land. This will be the date when the donor has done everything necessary in order to transfer the property and render the settlement binding.

For a gift of a registerable interest in land, this will mean the end date for the bright-line period is the date the interest is registered.

##### Example: Gift

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/c/ac899f4e-a1d2-471a-b706-1fb422d4a4e4/feb-tib-henrietta.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214323&hash=1BBDEC78CC1BB7D0804F67950B89455F)

The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2016 (the date Henrietta acquired registered title) and the end date is 1 February 2018 (the date Ingrid acquired registered title). Henrietta will be subject to the bright-line test for her gift of land.

Under ordinary tax rules, gifts of land are treated as if they are transferred at market value.

As a result, Henrietta will be deemed to have transferred the land to Ingrid at market value and the $50k gain will be taxable.

_Compulsory acquisition_

When the land is compulsorily acquired by the Crown, the end date of the bright-line period is the date that the land is compulsorily acquired. This will generally be 14 days after the proclamation that the land is to be acquired, is published in the _Gazette._[1](#1)

_Mortgagee sale_

When land is disposed of by a mortgagee exercising their right to dispose of the property, the end date for the bright-line period is the date when the land is disposed of by the mortgagee.

_Other sales_

If there is another type of disposal of land, the date of disposal is the date that the land is disposed of according to ordinary rules.

##### Example: Standard sale

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/d/2/d241c1e5-86a5-4f18-8caf-bf27b03ae6a3/feb-tib-amy-one.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214332&hash=863ECAC53C216E20B853F2D8D36A1165)

The bright-line period starts on 1 May 2016 (the date registered title is acquired) and ends on 1 December 2017 (the date of entry into agreement to sell the land).

Amy receives payment for the property in the 2018–19 income year. This means that Amy is required to return the income in her annual income tax return for the year.

##### Example: Cancelled contract

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/2/223e6c53-1595-4a19-ac96-00d2db359725/feb-tib-example-elizabeth.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214325&hash=2F914837F80FB41E6EDA4215EF499EB0)

The sale of the land from Elizabeth to Fred falls within the two-year period for the bright-line test. However, because the sale is cancelled, Elizabeth has not derived any income from the disposal of land and will not have any income tax liability.

The sale of the land from Elizabeth to Georgina is not subject to the bright-line test because the agreement for sale (1 July 2018) was not entered into within two years of Elizabeth obtaining registered title (1 May 2016).

##### Example: Standard lease (no perpetual right of renewal)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/6/7/6756a51e-87c8-4355-9336-02443dba2cd1/feb-tib-example-jo.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214333&hash=3F853D93DBA21AD8DACCCB76A232B50B)

The start date for the bright-line test is 1 March 2018 (the date of registration of title for purchase) and the end date is 1 April 2019 (the date she entered into agreement to sell the land). Jo's proceeds from the sale of the land are taxable under the bright-line test.

##### Example: Deed of nomination[2](#2)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/6/265d11f7-8ef8-4815-b0fc-ea2c19a3822f/feb-tib-example-andrew-one.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214326&hash=B55EA2845E3D3E3283765DB9F52A2825)

With a nomination there are two acquisitions and disposals of land.

Andrew acquired an interest in the land by entering into a contract to purchase on 1 January 2016 (the date he acquired the right to buy the land). When Andrew entered into a deed of nomination with Bart he transferred this interest (the right to buy the land) to Bart.

The start date for Andrew is the date he entered into the contract to purchase the land. This is because it is a sale where there is no registration. The start date is the latest date Andrew acquired an interest in the residential land. The latest date Andrew acquired an interest in the residential land is 1 January 2016 when he acquired his right to buy.

The end date for Andrew is 1 February 2016, being the date he entered into an agreement for the disposal of his interest in the land. The deed of nomination is an agreement for the disposal of the land.

As a result, Andrew is subject to the bright-line test and any gain he has made will be taxable.

Bart's acquisition and disposal of the land will not be covered by the bright-line test. This is because the start date was on 1 March 2016 (date of registration of title) and the end date was 1 January 2019 (the date he entered into agreement to sell).

### Residential land

_Sections CB 6A and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The bright-line test only applies if the land disposed of is residential land at the date of disposal.

"Residential land" is land that either:

*   has a dwelling on it;
*   the seller of the land is a party to an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling on it; or
*   is bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the rules in the relevant operative district plan.

However, even if one of these three criteria is met, land is not treated as "residential land" if it is used predominantly as business premises or is farmland (as discussed below).

#### _Dwelling_

The first criterion includes land that has a dwelling on it. The definition of "dwelling" is the same as that currently used in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. However, there are two adjustments to the definition of "dwelling" for the purposes of the bright-line test. The first adjustment includes serviced apartments within the definition of "residential land", while the second excludes all rest homes and retirement villages from the definition.

The second criterion means that the bright-line test covers land that does not have a dwelling on it at present but there is a plan or understanding to build a dwelling on it. For example, this criterion would apply when the owner of a commercial office has an arrangement to convert it into dwellings.

The third criterion means the bright-line test covers bare land that could be used for a dwelling. To determine whether a parcel of bare land meets this criterion, a person will need to look at the relevant rule in the operative district plan to see whether they are able to build a dwelling on it.

##### Example: Development [](#2)

Andrew buys an empty plot of land that is zoned for residential purposes. He plans to develop the plot by subdividing it into four lots and building houses on each of the lots.

Andrew sells lot 1 "off the plan" to Bob. One month later, Bob sells lot 1 to Carla.

Lot 1 would be "residential land" and Bob's sale would be subject to the bright-line test. This is because there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on the land, and because it is bare land that can have a dwelling erected on it under the relevant district plan.

#### _Business premises_

"Residential land" does not include land used predominantly as business premises.

"Business premises" has its ordinary meaning under the Income Tax Act 2007. This will generally require there to be a building on the land, and this building to be occupied by a person in the course of running their business.

The exemption does not require that the land be occupied by the owner as their business premises. As a result, properties rented out by the owner to other persons to use as their business premises are also covered by this exemption. However, the exemption would not apply when a property is rented out for residential purposes (such as a residential rental property).

##### Example: Bed and breakfast [](#2)

Mary owns a bed and breakfast. Mary provides meals to the residents, room service and cleans the rooms she lets out every day.

The land has a dwelling on it so meets the first criterion for residential land. However, the land would not be "residential land" as the land is used predominantly as the business premises for the bed and breakfast.

##### Example: Workers' quarters [](#2)

Steve owns land which contains a factory which is used to process food. The land also has workers' quarters on it, which Steve provides to his employees to use as residences.

The land is used predominantly as business premises and so is entitled to the business premises exception.

##### Example: Empty factory [](#2)

Velma purchases an empty factory which she plans to develop into an apartment building.

Before beginning construction, and within two years of her acquisition, Velma receives a good offer for the building and sells it to William.

Velma has an arrangement to put a dwelling on the land and so meets the first criterion for residential land. The land does not qualify for the business premises exemption as the factory is empty and not being used as business premises at the time of disposal. As a result, the land is "residential land" and subject to the bright-line test.

#### _Farmland_

"Residential land" does not include farmland.

"Farmland" means land that either:

*   is being worked on as part of a farming or agricultural business by the owner of the land; or
*   because of its area and nature, is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business.

Determining whether there is a farming or agricultural business on the land requires looking at the same factors that determine whether there is "a business" under general tax law. This requires looking at the nature of the activities carried on and the intention of the taxpayer in undertaking the activities.

Even if there is no farming business being run on the land, it can still be considered "farmland" if the land is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. Determining whether land is capable of being worked requires looking at the capability of the land at the time of the disposal. Land that requires significant investment or modification to be used as a farming business would therefore not qualify.

##### Example: **Land that because of its area is not capable of being used as farmland**  [](#2)

Marama purchases a lifestyle block with a house and a small area of farmland. A small number of sheep are kept on the land to keep the grass down.

The land is not "farmland" as the land is not being worked as a farming business nor is it capable of being worked as a farming business. It is a hobby farm rather than a genuine farming business.

If the area of farmland was larger and capable of being used for farming purposes, it would likely be "farmland".

##### Example: **Land that because of its nature is not capable of being used as farmland** [](#2)

Tina owns a 50 hectare plot of land. The land is covered in gorse.

The land is not "farmland" as it is not currently capable of being used for farming purposes.

##### Example: **Small plot of land that is farmland** [](#2)

Uri has a five hectare plot of land that is suitable for use as a rose farm.

This land is "farmland" as it is currently capable of being used for farming purposes.

### Main home

_Sections CB 16A and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The bright-line test does not apply to the disposal of a person's main home.

#### _Requirements for the "main home" exclusion_

To qualify for the "main home" exclusion the land must have been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owned the land, for a dwelling that was the main home of the person or a beneficiary of a trust that owned the property (subject to some limitations).

_Used predominantly as a person's main home_

To be used predominantly as a "main home", means that most of the area of the land must have been actually used for the home. The test is based on a person's actual use of the property and not the person's intended use of the property.

In some circumstances, a person will be required to determine the area of land used for their private residential purposes and the area of land used for other purposes. For example, when a single property has been used by the owner partly as a residential home and partly as a rental property, the relative areas will need to be determined. In many cases, a taxpayer will have determined the relative areas in working out the tax deductions (insurance and rates, for example) that can be claimed. The determination of the areas includes any land used for the relevant purposes (for example, a backyard or garage for the home).

The main home exclusion can only apply when the property is actually used as the main home. The exclusion can only apply in full or not at all; it does not apply on a proportionate basis. As a result, if a property is used less than 50 percent of the time as the main home of the person, the main home exclusion will not apply.

_Used for most of the time as their main home_

The land must have been used for most of the time that the person owns the land as their main home. This requires the property to have been used more than 50 percent of the time as their main home for the period the person owns the land. The land does not need to have been used without interruption as their main home. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while the owner is on holiday or before settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the time is less than the private residential use.

The owner must have resided in the property as their main home. The main home exclusion will not apply when only a family member and not the owner has used the property as their main home.

_More than one home_

A person can only have one main home. When a person has two houses that they reside in, the property that is their main home is determined according to which property the person has the greatest connection with. The "greatest connection" test operates only as a tie-breaker when a person has more than one home.

The greatest connection test determines, on an objective basis, which property is the person's main home. The test does not allow a person to elect their main home. Various factors may be relevant in determining which property the person has the greatest connection with, including:

*   the time the person occupies the dwelling;
*   where their immediate family (if any) live;
*   where their social ties are strongest;
*   the person's use of the dwelling;
*   the person's employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and
*   whether the person's personal property is in the dwelling.

These factors are similar to those used to determine if a person has a "permanent place of abode" under current tax law. Therefore, existing guidance on the "permanent place of abode" test could assist in determining which property the person has the greatest connection with.

_Using the "main home" exclusion for two properties_

Under limited circumstances, a person may use the main home exclusion for two properties sold at the same time.

An example is when a person lives in a home for less than one year as their main home, and moves into a new home while trying to sell the original home. The original home may satisfy the requirements to be the person's main home (as discussed above) for the period before moving into the main home. The new home may also satisfy the requirements to be the person's main home for the subsequent period.

The ownership overlap of the properties will not mean the original home fails to satisfy the requirements to be a main home for the previous period. If the two properties were sold at the same time, the owner would be able to use the main home exclusion for both properties (if they both satisfied the requirements to be a main home for the different periods).

##### Example: **Main home exception for multiple properties** [](#2)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/f/3feaee44-7059-41fc-8734-6ba1858ad7ef/feb-tib-example-amy-two.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214324&hash=D69A44EC915FC21D9CB01F9F556E4027)

The main home exclusion is available for both of Amy's properties. Property 1 was the main home for 9 out of the 11 months that Amy owned the property. Property 2 was the main home for the entire time Amy owned it.

_Different owners can have different main homes_

Co-owners of property can have different main homes. For example, a person living in one city may have a different main home from their spouse living in another city. The bright-line test will only apply to the extent the property is not the main home of an owner on disposal.

#### _Habitual sellers_

A person who habitually sells their main home cannot use the main home exclusion.

A person is considered a habitual seller if they either:

*   previously used the main home exclusion twice in the previous two years from the date the property is disposed of; or
*   have engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land.

If either of these apply, the main home exclusion is not available for this person.

Determining whether there is a regular pattern is a question of fact and degree. Examining transactions that occurred before the disposal of the property in question can help to establish whether the seller has a regular pattern of similar transactions.

#### _Main home and trusts_

The trustee of a trust can generally use the main home exclusion if they dispose of a property that is the main home of a beneficiary of the trust. To obtain the exception the land must be used predominantly as the beneficiary's main home for most of the time the trust owns the land.

A trust cannot use the main home exclusion when a principal settlor of the trust has another main home. This rule is to ensure that people cannot get the main home exclusion multiple times through the use of a trust.

_Who is a principal settlor?_

A principal settlor is the person who has provided the most value to the trust (by market value).

For the purposes of determining a principal settlor, all provisions of value are counted except for the provision of services at below market value. If there are multiple people who have provided the greatest equal value to the trust, they are all considered principal settlors.

In addition, a person is not a principal settlor if they have provided a "no-strings attached" gift to the trust. This means that for the purposes of determining who has provided the most value to the trust, provisions of value transferred by a person if the person is none of the following are disregarded:

*   a beneficiary;
*   a trustee;
*   a person with the power of appointment or removal of trustees;
*   a person with a contingent interest in the trust property, in the case that the trust fails; or
*   a decision-maker under the trust.

##### Example: **Holiday home** [](#2)

Lisa rents an apartment in Wellington, where she lives with her son. The apartment is close to her office from which she runs her consulting business fulltime. She is a member of a local tramping club and is on the Board of Trustees of her son's school in central Wellington.

She owns a house on Lake Taupo with views over the lake. She does not let the Lake Taupo property out when she is not using it. She spends four weeks with her son in this property over Christmas and New Year, and also uses the property for about five weekends during the ski season.

When Lisa sells the Lake Taupo property, she cannot use the main home exclusion because it is not the property with which she has the greatest connection.

##### Example: **Multiple dwellings** [](#2)

Bill buys an apartment block on a single title. He lives in one of the apartments as his main home and rents out the remaining six apartments. Bill sells the apartment block to a third party.

Bill cannot use the main home exclusion because the land (contained on the single title) was not used predominantly as his main home. The majority of the land was used as rental property.

##### Example: **Two properties** [](#2)

Mr and Mrs Brown and their children live in a house on a small lifestyle block in Oamaru. Mrs Brown works in Christchurch for three days a week, and works from the Oamaru house two days a week while her husband looks after the children fulltime. Mrs Brown buys an apartment in Christchurch city. She lives in that apartment while she works in Christchurch.

Taking into account the fact that the majority of Mrs Brown's time is spent at the Oamaru house, and her family is located at the Oamaru house, the main home exclusion will not apply in relation to Mrs Brown's Christchurch apartment as it is not the home with which she has the greatest connection.

##### Example: **Country store and house** [](#2)

Barbara buys a country store that has living quarters attached. She resides in the living quarters and runs a retail business from the front half of the property. She estimates that the retail business uses 45 percent of the property and claims expenses (insurance and rates) on that basis against the retail income. Barbara sells the property.

Barbara is not able to use the business premises exception as the land is not used predominantly for her retail business (45 percent).

However, Barbara can use the main home exclusion because she has used the property predominantly (55 percent) as her main home during the time she has owned the property. She uses her previous estimate for her expenses to prove her actual use of the property.

##### Example: **Non-resident** [](#2)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/b/ab89f676-48eb-4ae8-bdc5-0a4a27f92ac6/feb-tib-example-rena.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214335&hash=EB4F119E14A6FE292EC133D521F356F0)

Rena is entitled to the main home exclusion. This is because she has used the property as her main home for the majority of the time she has owned it.

##### Example: **Trusts - student flat** [](#2)

Dave has two properties, a family home which he lives in, and a student flat which his son lives in while studying. Dave settles the student flat on a trust and makes his son a discretionary beneficiary of the trust.

The trust cannot use the main home exclusion because the principal settlor of the trust (Dave) has another main home.

### Inheritance

_Sections CB 6A(3) and FC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

When a person dies, their property may be sold or transferred to a beneficiary, who may subsequently sell the property. These transfers and disposals will not be subject to tax under the bright-line test.

#### _How property is transferred through an inheritance_

When a taxpayer dies, an estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists. A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased's estate.

The executor or administrator is vested with legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased's property from the time of death to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased's estate administered properly during this period but do not have a legal or beneficial interest in the assets.

The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries.

Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Specific legacies are treated as taking effect from the date of transfer to take effect from the date of death, so income arising from the property is derived by the beneficiary from the date of death. A general or residuary legacy vests in a beneficiary at the time of distribution.

#### _Inheritance exception from bright-line test_

The bright-line test provides rollover relief for all transfers following a death and an exemption for any disposals by the executor or administrator or subsequent disposals by the beneficiaries.

The rollover relief is achieved by treating the transfers from the deceased person to the executor or administrator, and from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary, as a disposal and acquisition of the property, at the total cost of the land to the deceased person at the date of transfer (rather than at the land's market value). The effect is that no tax liabilities under the bright-line test arise under the transfers.

Disposals by a beneficiary, executor or administrator of residential land transferred to them on the death of a person are specifically excluded from the bright-line test. However, the disposals may still be subject to tax under the current land sale rules.

##### Example: **Inheritance** [](#2)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/e/5/e587f002-78cf-42c8-854c-0cda58bfa269/feb-tib-example-higgins.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214329&hash=24E8C901B68FD99F5E3D5423618520DB)

### Relationship property

_Section FB 3A of the Income Tax Act 2007_

When a relationship breaks down, property may be transferred between the spouses or partners. The property may then subsequently be sold. Transfers of property under a relationship property agreement are excluded from the bright-line test. However, any subsequent sale of the transferred property will be subject to the bright-line test.

#### _How property is transferred under a relationship property agreement_

During a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, the parties hold any property according to the conventional laws relating to property. As a result, the parties are free to deal with their property during the relationship without regard to the provisions of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976.

When a relationship breaks down, the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 may be invoked by a court order or an agreement between the parties. When the statutory regime is invoked, new property rights operate from the date of the court order or agreement. The property of the spouses or partners is reapportioned between them under principles from the statutory regime. Each item of property is divided into one of two statutory categories:

*   relationship property; or
*   separate property.

The fact that a particular item of property is placed within one of these two categories then produces a _prima facie_ result in the way it is treated as between the two spouses or partners. _Prima facie,_ all relationship property is divided in equal shares, while separate property is retained by the owner.

#### _Rollover for relationship property_

A transfer of property under a relationship property agreement will be entitled to the current rollover relief that applies to such transfers. This will mean that no tax liability under the bright-line test arises for the transfer of the property under the relationship property agreement. However, the person to whom the relationship property has been transferred may be liable under the bright-line test for any subsequent disposal of the property. This will occur if the person receiving the relationship property enters into an agreement to dispose of the property within two years of the original registration of title for the property.

##### Example: **Relationship property** [](#2)

### Rollover for land transferred under a resident's restricted amalgamation

_Sections FO 10 and FO 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Under the bright-line test there is rollover relief for amalgamations. This rollover relief extends the existing rollover relief for amalgamations to property that is revenue account property of an amalgamating company due to the application of the new bright-line test.

#### _Current amalgamation rules_

The amalgamation rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 contain a rollover provision for property transferred as a result of an amalgamation.[3](#3)

The rules provide that when property is held on revenue account by an amalgamating company solely due to the application of a 10-year rule in sections CB 9 to CB 11 and CB 14, the property is transferred to the amalgamated company at cost.

If the amalgamated company disposes of the property within 10 years of the original date of acquisition of the property by the amalgamating company, any gain from the sale is taxable.

#### _Extending current rules to bright-line test_

Under the bright-line rules this rollover relief is extended to property that is revenue account property of an amalgamating company due to the application of the bright-line test.

##### Example: **Land held on revenue account solely due to bright-line test** [](#2)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/e/e/ee786025-f4d2-4183-8a09-9947928fd9c2/feb-tib-aco.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214334&hash=71620A035B64CBA469584392600ADD9E)

On 1 May 2018 the property is transferred from A co. to B co. at cost ($500k). A co. does not have a tax liability from the transfer as there is no gain from the disposal.

On 1 June 2018, B co. is taxable on the $150k gain from the sale. This is because B co. disposed of the property within two years of the original date of acquisition of the property by A co. (1 May 2017).

### Deductions

For property that is liable for tax under the bright-line test, taxpayers will be able to deduct expenditure according to the ordinary tax rules.

#### _The cost of the property can be deducted_

A person who sells property that is subject to the bright-line test will be allowed a deduction for the cost of the property at the time of sale.

The cost of the property includes the amount that was paid to acquire the property (the initial acquisition price of the property). The cost of the property also includes any expenditure related to the acquisition. As a result, the costs of lawyers, valuers, surveyors and real estate agents are deductible. The incidental costs of disposing of the property are also deductible as part of the cost of the property. The cost of the property also includes any capital improvements to the property made after acquisition, such as renovations.

#### _When holding costs are deductible_

While a property is owned there will be periodic holding costs (of a non-capital nature) such as interest, insurance, rates and repairs, and maintenance expenses.

To be deductible as incurred, the holding costs must satisfy the normal deduction requirements. In other words, the holding costs are deductible to the extent they have a nexus with income and to the extent they are not private in nature (or otherwise subject to any of the general limitations on deductions).

A deduction will be considered to be of a private nature if it is exclusively related to living as an individual. This will be determined by the specific facts of any given situation. However, interest costs can automatically be deducted if the property is owned by a company (subject to some limitations).

For example, when the property is part of a business or profit-making undertaking or scheme, and there is no private use, it is likely that the nexus would be satisfied. Further, when the property is rented out there would likely be a nexus between the holding costs and the rental income. However, if a person purchases a bach for family use, but sells the bach within two years, the holding costs would not be deductible because of the private limitation.

### Ring-fencing losses

_Section DB 18A of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Losses from deductions that are claimable solely against bright-line income (bright-line deductions) are ring-fenced, so they can only be offset against gains on other land sales that are taxable under any of the land sale provisions.

The amount of bright-line deductions allowed in any income year is limited to the amount of bright-line income and net land income for that year. Net land income is the amount of net income for the year as if the person's only income was derived from the disposal of land under sections CB 6 to CB 14.

Any excess deductions not allocated to the income year will be treated as the cost of revenue account property and carried forward to the next income year. However, any excess deductions will not be able to be carried forward if the general continuity requirements for carrying forward tax losses are not satisfied.

##### Example: **Ring-fenced loss** [](#2)

In June 2017 Zac sells residential land that is taxable solely due to the bright-line test. Zac acquired the land for $600,000 and sold it for $540,000. For the 2017–18 income year, Zac also earned $80,000 in salary.

The $60,000 loss for the sale of residential land is ring-fenced so that it may only be used to offset income from other land sales. Zac cannot use the $60,000 loss to offset his income from salary and wages.

In August 2019 Zac sells land that he purchased with an intention of resale. Zac made a gain of $100,000 from the sale. Zac may offset his previous $60,000 loss against the $100,000 gain. As a result, Zac only has to pay tax on $40,000 of the gain in the 2019–20 income year.

### Losses from transfers to associated persons

_Section DB 18AB of the Income Tax Act 2007_

A person cannot recognise a loss arising from a transfer of property to an associated person if that loss is taxable solely due to the bright-line test.

However, to avoid genuine losses being denied permanently, the associate may increase the cost base of the land by the amount of the denied deduction.

##### Example: **Transfer to associate** [](#2)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/8/0/802ec467-cd3b-4874-972d-8cd5aa1cdb8d/feb-tib-example-steve.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214330&hash=097D7F26ECF12CADAA9531960AEFF3D8)

Steve's deductions are capped at $400k for the transfer on 1 January 2017. He cannot claim the $100k loss for the year.

When Tara sells the land on 1 June 2018, she can deduct $500k. This is made up of the $400k cost of acquisition as well as the $100k of denied deductions.

### Land-rich companies and trusts

_Sections GB 52, GB 53_

To address the risk of people using land-rich companies and trusts to circumvent the bright-line test, a specific anti-avoidance rule applies.

### _Land-rich companies_

The anti-avoidance rule for land-rich companies applies when all four of the following are met:

*   The company is land-rich - this means at least 50 percent of the value of the company is attributable to residential land.
*   50 percent of the shares in the company are disposed of within a 12-month period.
*   Some of the company's residential land was acquired within two years of the disposal of the shares.
*   The disposal of shares had a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test.

_Definition of "land-rich company"_

A "land-rich" company is one where at least 50 percent of the value of the company is attributable to residential land either directly or indirectly. This is intended to mirror similar provisions contained in international double tax agreements. Residential land can be attributable to a company either through the company owning the residential land in its own name or holding shares in another land-rich company.

_Deemed disposal_

When the requirements are met the land-rich company is treated as disposing of residential land that it acquired within two years of the share disposal to the shareholder at cost. The amount of residential land and the price are at the cost proportional to the shareholding of the relevant shareholder.

The shareholder is then treated as immediately disposing of the residential land back to the company at market value.

##### Example: **Land-rich company** [](#2)

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/1/e/1e0c7fd2-9bf5-487d-a3ea-046d5f95c374/feb-tib-example-steve-tara.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214328&hash=5A505220BE0E09388E2793B0C76121D9)

X co. will be treated as disposing of 50 percent of the residential land to Steve for $250k.

Steve will then be treated as disposing of the residential land back to the company for $300k.

As a result, Steve will have to pay income tax on the $50k gain from the deemed sale.

#### _Land-rich trusts_

Section GB 53 treats a trustee as having disposed of residential land at market value if all three of the following apply:

*   The trust is land-rich - this means that at least 50 percent of the value of the trust is attributable to residential land.
*   Any of the following changes are made:
    *   the trust deed changes; or
    *   a decision-maker under the trust deed changes; or
    *   an arrangement under the trust changes.
*   The change was made with a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test.

### OTHER REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS

### Non-active trust filing exception

_Section 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

An amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows non-active trusts (which are currently required to file nil income tax returns) to apply to be exempted from the obligation to file, thereby reducing compliance costs.

#### _Requirements for exception_

Trusts that are non-active will no longer be required to file annual income tax returns if:

*   throughout the tax year the trust is a non-active complying trust; and
*   the trustee of the trust has filed a declaration that the trust is non-active (and the trust has not become active since making the declaration).

A trust will be non-active if it has:

*   not derived or been deemed to have derived any income;
*   no deductions; and
*   not been a party to, or perpetuated or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust in the tax year, which give rise to income in any person's hands, or fringe benefits to any employee or to any former employee.

Certain minimal amounts of income or deductions can be ignored in determining whether a trust is non-active. This includes:

*   reasonable fees paid to professional trustees to administer the trust;
*   up to $200 of bank charges or other minimal administration costs;
*   up to $200 of interest earned on trust assets in a bank account during the tax year; and
*   insurance, rates, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust.

The amendment sets out the process by which a non-active trust may apply for exemption from filing income tax returns. This process entails completing a declaration - first, that the trust is a non-active trust and secondly, that a trustee of the trust will inform the Commissioner if it ceases to be so. The trustees of the trust are thereby placed under a statutory obligation to inform the Commissioner upon the cessation.

The Commissioner will retain the power to request the trustees of a trust to file a return of income even if it holds an exemption under the amended provision.

The amendment is based on a similar provision for non-active companies in section 43A of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Definition of "land"

_Section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

As a result of the rewrite of income tax legislation, there was an unintended change to the definition of "land". This change created uncertainty over whether it included an interest in land.

To resolve this, the definition of "estate" and "interest" in land have been replaced with a definition of estate and interest in land that clearly includes interests in land. The definition of land clearly included an interest in land before the rewrite of the definition.

In addition, the new definition clarifies that an interest in land includes the right to possession of land.

### Clarifying treatment of land transferred under a resident's restricted amalgamation

_Section FO 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The new Act clarifies the treatment of revenue account property transferred as a result of a resident's restricted amalgamation when, at the time of the amalgamation, it is unclear whether the amalgamated company holds the property on revenue or capital account.

#### _Current amalgamation rules_

When two companies merge under an amalgamation, the transfer of assets between the companies is generally exempt from tax. However, the transfer is not exempt from tax if the property leaves the tax base.

The amalgamation rules achieve this result by transferring property either at cost or at market value, depending on whether the amalgamating and amalgamated company hold the property on revenue or capital account. This is illustrated in Table 1.

**Table 1**

![](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/d/5d33f51a-8d05-4825-b914-d61df457aee3/feb-tib-table-one.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214328&hash=FF58C042978C7A301EA75295EE2090CF)

However, when the amalgamated company holds the property on revenue account, if it disposes of the property within 10 years, it is unclear for the amalgamating company whether it transfers the property at cost (and has no tax liability) or at market value (and has a tax liability).

#### _Deemed market value transfer_

The amendment applies so that property is deemed to be transferred at market value when:

*   the land is held on revenue account for the amalgamating company; and
*   the land is, or may be, revenue account property of the amalgamating company solely because of the 2-year bright-line test or a 10-year rule in any of sections CB 9 to CB 11, and CB 14.

When the two criteria above are met the property is deemed to be transferred at market value.

1Public Works Act 1981, section 26(3)

2The nomination in this example refers to a nomination under a "purchaser or nominee" clause in an agreement for sale and purchase for land. This example does not deal with nominees under section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007; these have a different tax treatment.

3That meets the criterion to be a "resident's restricted amalgamation" under section FO 3.

Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Act 2015
============================================================

2015 legislation covering KiwiSaver allows members to withdraw member tax credits when purchasing a new home, and corrects veteran income replacement payments.

The Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced on 1 December 2014. It received its first reading on 4 December 2014, its second reading on 24 March 2015 and its third reading on 26 March 2015. The new Act received Royal assent on 31 March 2015. It amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Income Tax Act 2007.

The new legislation allows eligible KiwiSaver members to withdraw their member tax credits when purchasing a new home, and corrects errors in the tax, social policy and KiwiSaver treatment of income replacement payments paid under the Veterans' Support Act 2014.

www.greenwoodroche.com Auckland Wellington Christchurch 6 October 2021 David Carrigan Deputy Commissioner Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department By email Taxation Law Drafting Review - Report and Recommendations I provided you in June with a copy of the report and recommendations that I prepared as a result of the taxation law drafting review exercise. You asked that I provide to you an overview of the report to accompany its public release (including in particular providing it to stakeholders who participated in the review process) and I do so in this letter. This review has been productive and the attached report is a summary of the feedback that has been obtained and of the recommendations which have resulted from that feedback. I am very grateful to those who participated in the review for their thoughtful contributions and effort. It should be emphasised that, because of the extent to which numerous stakeholders have contributed and have had often very specific individual views in relation to the matters to be considered, necessarily the report is a summary of the responses that have been received. The report would have become lengthy and complex if it incorporated all the comments from every individual participant, given the range of comments that have been received. The attached is a copy of the report sent in June to you and the other senior officials at the Inland Revenue Department who commissioned the report. Generally, it should be recognised that the overwhelming weight of commentary coming from those consulted has been that the aims of the process of rewriting the Income Tax Act remain valid and that generally the result of that process has been positive and successful in advancing those aims. It should perhaps be noted at this stage that, inevitably, the process of producing taxation legislation in New Zealand involves significant pressures on those drafting the legislation to deal with external demands, tight timeframes and a continuously-evolving policy framework. One should not ever forget the extent to which this pressure process necessarily impacts upon the ability of the drafting team to produce an ideal result. Equally, it has to be acknowledged that many of the comments from those consulted indicate that those stakeholders feel that further improvements could be made. Contact Graeme Smaill Phone 04 494 8519 Email graeme@greenwoodroche.com Reference 2444914-5 Wellington Level 13, 36 Customhouse Quay PO Box 25501, Wellington 6140 2 In any complex and iterative process such as drafting tax legislation there is always a need to seek continuous improvement and to focus on the skills development of those involved in producing the result, which should ideally be of the highest quality for both those producing it and for those using it. In relation to the recommendations, there are three broad areas that will be the focus of future efforts to achieve ongoing improvement: 1 the use of existing and identification of further specific drafting tools to deliver legislation that is fit for purpose and accessible for those who need to use it; and 2 achieving higher skills for all those involved in the drafting unit and a team that produces collaborative and consistent results; and 3 the development of legislation by a consultative process involving policy analysts within Inland Revenue and other government departments and external stakeholders aimed at improving the practical ability for the legislation to be understood and complied with. In any event, again, I want to acknowledge the contribution of those stakeholders, within Inland Revenue and externally, who have willingly spent time and effort contributing to this review. I have no doubt that the result of this review will be to advance the process of achieving continuous improvement in the quality of New Zealand’s tax legislation and the skills development for those involved at Inland Revenue in producing the legislation. Graeme Smaill Consultant 1 Report on results of taxation law drafting review and recommendations \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 This memorandum is sent to outline the results of and recommendations relating to the taxation law drafting review project undertaken during the period from June 2019 to November 2020. Attached to this memorandum is a schedule that summarises the recommendations and places them in categories of priority. Background to review 2 Policy & Strategy of Inland Revenue decided it was timely to undertake a review of the general approach adopted to taxation law drafting by the drafting unit that is part of Policy & Strategy. It has been about 30 years since the initial steps were commenced in relation to the project for rewriting the Income Tax Act 1976. The completion of that rewrite project has resulted in both the rewritten provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and many of the drafting principles adopted in relation to the drafting by the drafting unit of new legislation in the Income Tax Act 2007 and in other Inland Revenue Acts. 3 I was engaged as a consultant to assist Policy & Strategy in relation to this review project and to be the person primarily responsible for obtaining and collating contributions from various stakeholders. 4 The following stakeholders (or their representatives) external to Inland Revenue provided input: • Oliver Shaw • Corporate Taxpayer Group • Treasury • Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand • FEC Expert Adviser • Parliamentary Counsel Office, and • New Zealand Law Society 5 The following stakeholders from Inland Revenue provided input: • Paul Fulton • Gordon Witte • Keith Taylor • Sam Rowe • Scott Davidson • Carmel Peters • Office of the Chief Tax Counsel • Marie Pallot • Bary Hollow • Casey Plunket • Kieran Mecredy • Adrian Kelly • John Collins, and • Moira Thompson 2 6 Each of the stakeholders were interviewed and asked to comment and provide constructive input on the: • the continued fitness for purpose of the objectives sought to be achieved through the rewrite project and of the drafting principles that were recommended and/or adopted during that process; • the extent to which those objectives and principles (or other best practice approaches) have been and continue to be achieved in relation to the preparation of taxation legislation in New Zealand; and • the extent to which taxation legislation prepared in New Zealand is able readily to be understood by the intended audience. (In this context, they were asked if they wanted to comment on the extent to which it is felt necessary or desirable to use secondary material (including in particular policy papers produced by officials) as a guide to understanding). 7 They were also asked to: • provide some useful examples to illustrate their comments, where possible; • indicate whether there are specific areas of taxation legislation where they would recommend some post-enactment review and refinement in relation to the form of the current legislation; • suggest areas where they consider there is scope for beneficial change or improvement in the legislation preparation or presentation process; and • provide any other comments that they consider should be taken into account in the review exercise. Background to rewrite project and drafting principles adopted 8 The process for rewriting the Income Tax Act 1976 (and the resultant development of many of the legislative drafting guidelines that are applied by the drafting unit) stems from a series of discussion papers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as prepared by various committees of experts. 9 The 1991 report of the Valabh Committee called ‘Key Reforms to the Scheme of Tax Legislation’ suggested certain key features for the approach to reform, including in particular: • the division of the existing legislation into separate Acts; • the division of those Acts into parts and subparts; • the reorganisation of the legislation into a more logical and coherent scheme; • the consolidation of certain legislation; • the use of purpose clauses and extra-statutory references where appropriate; and • a commitment to modern drafting techniques and to plain language. 10 The 1993 second report of the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 included the following: Drafting should proceed on the basis of a commitment to use plain language. This is a commitment based on realism. It is recognised that no amount of elegant drafting 3 can reduce the complexity inherent in some proposals. However, even complex policy can be presented in a clear and user-friendly way. The legislation should always be drafted with users, and the different categories of users, in mind. Improved comprehensibility of tax legislation will result from adhering to the following: • plain words should be preferred A simple word of everyday use should be preferred to a flowery, stuffy or unusual word. Legalese and couplets should be avoided. However, a simple word should be preferred only if it is apt, precise and accurate. • short sections should be preferred A section must have a coherence of meaning and purpose capable of being described in a brief section heading. Long sections comprising many subsections are likely to lose their way and ramble on. A section or subsection may contain more than one sentence if there is sufficient closeness of meaning to make this useful. • short sentences should be preferred Sentences should not be unnecessarily long. The aim of the New South Wales Parliamentary Counsels Office of 30 words and 5 lines should be kept in mind but not regarded as a rule. Unnecessary paragraphing should be avoided. For example, short sentences of 20 to 30 words should not as a general rule be paragraphed. Unless in a particular case paragraphing produces an easier to use result, the technique should not be used and the material should be presented in 2 or more shorter sentences. . . . • graphic and other techniques including the use of examples should be used to assist communication Graphic material, diagrams, flow charts, logarithms, and user-friendly algebraic formulas should be used where they offer the best means of conveying or supplementing meaning. Examples can be included either as part of the text or in notes which are clearly not part of the text. Examples may direct the user to take a number of steps rather than just presenting one difficult to follow calculation. 11 The 1994 report called ‘Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department’ included the following: The subject matter of tax legislation is complex. Currently the legislation attempts to deal with the complexity and to provide certainty and precision through the detailed expression of policies in the variety of complex circumstances in which they operate. As a result the intent is often blurred in a torrent of convoluted language in sentences of an average length, measured by a 1992 study, of 135 words. Tax practitioners, Treasury and IRD agree that the legislation is difficult to read and understand. That must have a direct bearing on the difficulties and the cost of administering the legislation and the difficulties and the cost for taxpayers of complying with the legislation. 4 . . . Legislative drafting should provide for clearer expression of the purposes and intent of the legislation, and strive for greater simplification. If that drafting approach is adopted there should be less justification for attempting to provide in detail for every conceivable variety of circumstance. More understandable legislation will also produce substantial savings in administration costs and compliance costs and will, at the same time, enhance the voluntary compliance strategy. . . . There will always be difficulties in applying tax legislation in marginal cases, however it is drafted. In these borderline cases clear language and structures and clear statements of intent will facilitate understanding and resolution of the problem. What is even more important is that the legislation is easy to administer and comply with in the great mass of cases not near the borderline. There, the key is the clarity of the intent and of the style of drafting. 12 The 1994 report called ‘Rewriting the Income Tax Act’ included the following: Most New Zealand taxpayers seldom consult tax legislation. Instead, they gain a sufficient understanding of tax law from secondary sources, including Inland Revenue publications and guides published by private sector organisations. Regardless of how readable or user-friendly the rewritten Act becomes, taxpayers will usually find it easier to obtain elsewhere the tax-related information they need. Such taxpayers will still benefit, however, from the rewrite. A rewritten Act that better communicates the law will assist the producers of secondary sources to better explain the law’s application. The primary audience for the Act itself will comprise groups such as: • the courts; • lawyers and accountants (particularly tax specialists); • authors of secondary sources that explain the application of tax laws; • Members of Parliament; • tax policy analysts and people who want to make submissions on proposed legislation; • Inland Revenue staff. . . . Complexity and ambiguity directly affect all users of the Income Tax Act. Most users of the Act want to use the Act to determine the tax rules applying to a particular taxpayer’s situation. They will have in mind a taxpayer with specific characteristics (say, a resident company) that is contemplating or has engaged in a particular type of transaction (say, the purchase of a building). They will avoid incurring unnecessary costs if they can: 5 • quickly find the rules applicable to a taxpayer’s particular situation and they do not need to exert excessive effort to satisfy themselves that they have not overlooked any relevant rules; • readily (and correctly) understand the rules. Tax legislation will inevitably impose some costs on its users. The aim is to minimise these costs. There are at least three reasons why any modern tax act will always retain some element of complexity, thereby imposing costs on its users. • Many of the policy objectives embodied in tax legislation are themselves complex. For example, tax systems go to considerable lengths to give equitable treatment to taxpayers who face widely differing circumstances. • Many of the transactions and business organisations to which the law applies are themselves complex. Complex transactions and entities generally necessitate complex tax law. • Some taxpayers will go to considerable lengths to devise sophisticated arrangements to minimise their tax liabilities. Since the Government needs to protect the tax base against erosion, it must often implement complicated rules to counter such arrangements. The need to protect the tax base in an open, deregulated economy has resulted in New Zealand governments introducing a number of wide-ranging domestic and international tax reforms over the past decade. 13 The Explanatory Note to the Bill that became the Income Tax Act 2007 summarised as follows the progressive rewriting of the provisions in the Income Tax Act 1976. • The first stage of the rewrite project involved the reordering and renumbering of the Income Tax Act 1976. Core provisions were set out in Part B, like provisions were grouped, and an alpha-numeric numbering system was introduced. This stage was completed with the enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994. • The second stage was the enactment of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. This stage rewrote the core provisions in Part B to provide an overview of the scheme and purpose of the Act and to change the structure of the Act so that it operated on a gross basis for the determination of income and deductions. • The third stage involved the rewriting of Parts A to E and Y of the 1994 Act and also re-enacted Parts F to O and the schedules. The result was the Income Tax Act 2004. • This, fourth, stage completes the project by re-enacting Parts A to E, consolidating amendments made to those Parts since commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004, rewriting Parts F to O in the same style as Parts A to E, and re-enacting the schedules with necessary consequential amendments. 14 The principles that are currently applied to guide the drafting of new taxation legislation derive in significant part from the principles recommended for and sought to be applied in the rewrite project. 15 Against this background, the drafting unit is responsible for preparation of new legislation, involving the conversion into legislation of the policy proposals that are developed as a result of government decision-making and remedial matters. 6 16 However, it has to be recognised that the drafters within the drafting unit necessarily face various challenges in achieving a best practice result, including in particular: (a) the complexity and/or novelty and/or changing environment of the policy issues that are to be reflected in the legislation (for example, the increasing digitalisation of the economy allows non-residents to derive significant revenues from source countries without having a permanent establishment allowing source country taxation under tax treaties); and (b) the general timing pressures that often arise in relation to preparation of new legislation; and (c) the extent to which “last minute changes” or iterative policy development render it difficult to achieve an entirely coherent result in relation to the presentation of legislation. Conclusions: Appropriateness of rewrite principles and Income Tax Act structure 17 Generally, stakeholders indicated that they thought that the rewrite of the Income Tax Act had been a great success and much better than the predecessor or the situation in other countries. There were only isolated exceptions. 18 Some stakeholders commented that Part B and the core provisions in particular were of great help to assist users of the Act. 19 A number of stakeholders commented that the splitting of regimes, particularly to fit the Part C, D and E construct, created continuing problems – • in the preparation of new legislation; and • with readers gaining a full understanding of where relevant rule were located and how they fitted together. 20 There was general recognition that the splitting of regimes necessitated considerable effort being put into “sign-posting”. 21 The goal of plain language was generally viewed as appropriate and deserving of continuing focus. 22 However, some stakeholders commented that the plain language approach – • did not always lead to a clear result and could be a superficial presentational matter; • is inevitably idealistic; and • is much easier to achieve when rewriting an existing regime rather than when doing amendments and/or drafting under time pressures. 23 Recommendation: It is recommended that the rewrite principles and current Income Tax Act structure (including the alpha-numeric numbering) continue to be adhered to. Conclusions: Drafting style and quality in practice 24 Some stakeholders (both external and internal) expressed the view that haste in the legislative process had an adverse effect on quality, including comments that: 7 • often the time taken to develop the policy compresses the drafting time; • drafting is often left to the end of the process, with drafters; • working under real time pressure; and • late developments always create significant problems and time pressures lead to imperfect legislation. 25 Recommendation: It is recommended that to the extent not already being done: • efforts are made to avoid unreasonable compression of/unreasonable expectations for the time taken for drafting; and • input be sought from the drafting unit members on options for improvement. 26 Many stakeholders (both external and internal) commented on the need to present legislation in a way that conveys the general messages initially and avoids those messages becoming obscured by detail, including comments that: • technical accuracy is not enough – the legislation must communicate the general messages in a clear way; • there is a need for more user-friendly drafting, concentrating on the major issues/concepts that the average reader who needs to use the legislation can follow; • even tax specialists say they simply cannot understand some of the legislation; • there is a major need to avoid detail in the legislation getting ahead of/obscuring communication of the key principles; • the legislation should say upfront what is meant, to give readers a quick feel for what is meant (examples being sections EX 1 and El 1 and EL 2); • the drafting style is sometimes problematic – seems to involve setting out at the outset every possible qualifying or relevant point of detail, before getting to the basic rule; • it is often hard for people without background to understand the law; • people in the tax industry are finding it harder and harder to read the legislation; • some drafters try to simplify and aid readers and some do not try; • PAD people need to face up to criticism of the drafting coming from TICAL and others; sometimes there seems to be “issue capture” of legislation i.e. excess focus on a factual scenario rather than on underlying concepts; • the 80:20 rule is very important – leave the 20% cases to the back end and signpost them; and • there should be more focus on the needs of the reader. 27 Recommendation: It is recommended that: • members of the drafting unit are encouraged to place a high emphasis when drafting on communicating clearly and simply the key concepts/principles; • members of the drafting unit are advised of the extent of feedback from stakeholders that much more consistent effort needs to be made to improve readability; • consideration be given to peer review and external consultancy use to assess readability of new legislation (either as a standard approach or periodically); and • drafting unit members should undertake regular training on plain English communication techniques. 28 See further recommendations below on peer review and external consultancy use. 29 Conversely, some stakeholders noted that there were pressures that inevitably inhibited readability, including comments that: 8 • sometimes simple language is not helpful if the area is inherently complex; • there is an inevitable conflict between the need for communication to readers and the need for precision; • users commonly apply pressure to add detail; • the quality of drafting generally is good and often matters are complex and hard to distill; and • final legislation is a distillation of principles and operationalising the legislation will often mean use of secondary materials is inevitable; 30 A number of stakeholders (internal and external) commented on the relationships between external and internal stakeholders and drafters and noted apparent drafter rigidity, including comments that: • there seems to be a disconnect between IRD policy advisers and the IRD drafters; • IRD policy advisers say that the drafters are not open to suggestions/cannot be given directions on drafting points/concerns; • in some cases, there was consultation on draft legislation and negative submissions but the policy advisers said that they could not get the drafter(s) to change the wording; • policy advisers say that the drafter(s) simply refuses to change the legislation because “legally, it is correct”; • some policy advisers are too junior to exercise the necessary amount of judgement and control; • it is a wrong attitude for a drafter simply to refuse to change things; • policy people giving drafting instructions met resistance and the drafter(s) would get very “locked in” to the particular drafting approach they wished to follow; and • drafters get too fixated on style. 31 Recommendation: It is recommended that: • a constructive approach to stakeholder feedback should be encouraged by management generally in discussions with drafters; • in the case where there were a series of consistent comments concerning the apparent rigidity of one particular member of the drafting unit, there should be management discussions with that person to give them the opportunity to develop and modify their approach to dealing with internal and external stakeholders; and • generally, drafters should be encouraged to regard policy analysts as a key audience for the legislative product and a source of valuable subject matter tax expertise. 32 A number of stakeholders (internal and external) commented on the inconsistency of drafting style between drafters, including comments that: • different drafters have very different approaches; • drafters should ideally cross-fertilise ideas amongst themselves but that does not seem to happen; • there is insufficient management of the drafting team, with no real checking of quality, stylistic consistency or coherence; • possibly a “chief drafter” could aid consistency; • drafting instructions have to be tailored to the different drafters and it is hard for young analysts to know that; • some drafters are happy to use formulae and some are not and there is similar inconsistency in the use of visual aids e.g. diagrams; and • there is a need for and apparent lack of peer review exercises for drafters. 9 33 Recommendation: Efforts to improve drafting consistency should be advanced, including in particular: • consideration given to appointing one of the drafting unit as a chief drafter, or recruiting in future a chief drafter, possibly one for each of the three major revenue acts; and • consideration given to peer review protocols (again, see further below); and • continued and extended focus on the Inland Revenue Act Conventions (IRAC) manual (see further below). 34 Some stakeholders commented on the adverse impact of or need for use of drafting tools to compensate for scattering provisions from regimes through various parts of the ITA, including: • splitting of regimes can be dealt with by adequate sign-posting; and • ordering carefully and describing relationships helps the presentation but each case does tend to have its own challenges. 35 Recommendation: To the extent not already mandated: • it should be mandatory, in the case of any new regime with provisions split between different parts of an act, for a “road map” to be provided to list and identify where all parts of the regime can be found; and • a standard format for “road mapping/sign-posting” should be settled on. 36 Some stakeholders commented on the use of formulae in legislation, including: • sometimes formulae used are too complex and incorporate too many steps in one formula, inhibiting readers’ understanding whether the legislation does or does not apply in their case; but • the use of formulae and tables can help add clarity. 37 Recommendation: An exercise be undertaken to consider those provisions where formulae have been criticised for complexity, to identify and fix on some protocols for formulae to avoid complexity. 38 Some stakeholders commented on the use of “purpose” provisions, including: • purpose provisions can be problematic; and • some feel purpose provisions still have a use but they may need periodically to be updated. 39 Recommendation: There should continue to be caution in attempting to use purpose provisions, to avoid conveying inaccuracy and oversimplification. 40 Some stakeholders commented on the use of communication aids to assist readers, including: • having examples embedded is very useful; • drafters should look for opportunities to do innovative things to help readers (e.g. the reference to the OECD rules in the hybrid risk management rules); • generally, IRD policy is that brackets are not to be used (except for cross-references) but PCO use them to use them to signal hierarchy and the latter seems sensible; and 10 • flowcharts can aid communication. 41 Recommendation: Members of the drafting unit should be encouraged to: • creatively use visual aids to communication; and • to the extent not already done, workshop techniques and recommended approaches to use of visual aids, with a view to achieving consistency. 42 A number of stakeholders commented on the use of defined terms, including comment that: • use of a number of very similar defined terms causes confusion and inhibits readability; • lists of defined terms are hard to produce and maintain; and • any defined term should signal the concept. 43 Recommendation: Members of the drafting unit should be encouraged to avoid having multiple defined terms that are too similar and generally aim for defined terms that clearly signal the underlying concept. 44 Recommendation: Consideration should be given to seeking feedback from major external stakeholder groups in relation to the extent to which they see continued utility in the lists of defined terms or alternatively, say, anticipate hyperlinks making the lists obsolete. 45 Some stakeholders commented on the potential benefits of using a plain language consultancy review service or other method for guidance, including: • an external provider (Write Limited) undertakes plain language reviews of the PCO legislation and the feedback is valuable even if not always feasible to adopt; • in other legislative drafting situations, a sense review by a language expert occurs (although Sharon tends to do that for the IRD drafting); and • possibly, artificial intelligence tools might be available to perform this task. 46 Recommendation: Consideration be given to identifying and engaging an external expert on plain language and/or artificial intelligence tools to review, either as a matter of standard course or periodically, draft legislation in order: • to provide advice to drafters; and • to identify issues that consistently arise, either in relation to drafting generally or in relation to particular drafter. 47 Some stakeholders commented on the use of colons to mean “or”, including: • use of punctuation instead of “or” is not user-friendly; • the use of a colon to mean “or” is unnecessarily obscure; • there is continual confusion with the use of colons meaning “or” and that approach does not seem to involve “plain language”; but • the opening words of a list can explain this. 48 Recommendation: A review be undertaken of all usages in the Income Tax Act of list ending in colons, to identify and correct any where there is insufficient communication by the opening words of the operation of the list. 11 48.1 Recommendation: Subject to prior consultation with members of the drafting unit and consideration of consistency with PCO guidelines, a decision should be made whether or not to continue using “colons” to mean “or” or “and/or” in future legislation. 49 Some stakeholders commented on the benefits of involving drafters in policy development, including: • drafters might need to be more involved in policy development, to aid their understanding of the purpose; • the drafters are more likely to aware of practical realities if they are exposed to private sector participants; • a drafter alone cannot think of all the factual possibilities; and • the drafters do not report back to policy people on where policy matters are covered in the draft legislation and this should be a standard requirement. 50 Recommendation: To the extent reasonably possible, drafters should have some significant involvement during or be given fully-adequate explanation from the expert analysts concerning the policy development process. 51 Recommendation: As a standard practice, drafters should report back to policy advisers on where specific policy matters are dealt with in the draft legislation. 52 Some stakeholders queried what KPIs drafters were subject to. 53 Recommendation: Consideration be given to incorporating into drafters’ KPIs/performance reviews/career discussions: • matters arising from this review that indicate need for further skill development; and • regular monitoring of achievement/improvement in relation to those matters. 54 PCO raised questions concerning the extent to which the drafting unit maximises benefits from its relationship with PCO, including comments that: • PCO is continually working on better precedents for standardisation of drafting. While the IRD is involved, the drafters at the IRD do not appear to be engaged in that process; and • PCO does not think that the IRD drafters generally comply with PCO style guidelines. 55 Recommendation: These issues be discussed within the drafting unit and then be discussed with PCO, with a view to agreeing on ways to improve collaboration and extend IRD benefits from use of PCO resources. 56 It was noted that there is a need for more succession planning in the drafting unit, especially as the work volume seems to be increasing. 57 Recommendation: To the extent not already in place, a strategy be devised for succession management in the drafting unit. 58 Comments came from internal stakeholders concerning the Inland Revenue Acts Conventions (IRAC) manual including: 12 • more efforts need to go into IRAC development; and • it is still important to focus on plain language principles and IRAC is helpful for training purposes. 59 Recommendation: Continued, systematic efforts should be made to develop and maintain the IRAC manual, for training and quality control purposes. 60 Conversely, a number of stakeholders had praise for the drafting quality and/or recognised the pressure on drafters, including comments that: • drafters generally do a good job under pressure; • policy u-turns make it very difficult for drafters; • there is a difficult “trade-off” between simplicity and precision; • it is harder to achieve clear presentation in circumstances where existing legislation is being amended; and • generally the drafters produce an okay result. 61 Recommendation: Members of the drafting unit should be told of the positive feedback from various stakeholders. Conclusions: Priority areas for rewriting or post-implementation review 62 Many stakeholders (especially internal stakeholders) referred to the Tax Administration Act (TAA) as a priority area. 63 Specific TAA areas mentioned as requiring work were: • the remissions and refunds aspects; • the objections and challenges aspects; • the provisional tax rules; and • the use of money interest rules. 64 Recommendation: Work on modernising the TAA continue as a priority area as part of the revision Bill programme. 65 Many stakeholders referred to the Goods and Services Tax Act (GSTA) as having lost its simple and clear structure and requiring a rewrite. 66 Some stakeholders have commented that the GSTA needs to revert to having a clear focus on its core provisions/essential linkage with section 8. 67 Other specific areas of the GSTA cited by stakeholders as requiring remedial work on clarity included: • the GST rules for retirement villages and commercial dwellings; • the definition of “financial services; • the change of use rules; • the apportionment rules; and • the input tax credit rules. 68 Recommendation: To the extent not already done, renumbering and rewriting the GSTA be made a priority area for future work as part of the next revision Bill programme. 13 69 A number of stakeholders expressed concern about the complexity and extent of the mixed use asset rules and the resultant obscuring of the rules that apply to the most common scenarios e.g. the average natural person bach owner will find them hard to work through. 70 A number of stakeholders expressed concern about the thin capitalisation rules and, in particular, the extent to which disparate fact scenarios (inbound and outbound), where the rules have a different rationale, are combined. 71 A number of stakeholders commented that the CFC and FIF rules have changed over time and important rules (e.g. comparative value method for FIFs) are “buried” under far less important rules. 72 Some stakeholders commented that the residential land loss/deduction ring fencing rules were either: • initially proposed to be misplaced – should have been proposed to be in Part E rather than proposed to be in Part D; or • adopted a different conceptual approach to the tax loss component rules. 73 Some stakeholders commented that the trust rules were hard to work through (unless the reader had a lot of background on them). 74 Stakeholders generally favoured post-implementation reviews and some cited especially checking of the: • R&D rules; and • BEPS rules. 75 Isolated stakeholder comments concerned: • the FBT rules; • the hybrid rules; • the “burial” in Part B of the significance of the residence and source rules; • the land sale taxing rules; • the complex ASC formula in the dividend rules; • the financial arrangement rules (including in particular the use of IFRS); and • Part M generally. 76 Recommendation: Consideration should be given to each of the matters referred to in the preceding paragraphs 69 to 75 as areas to be listed for post-implementation review and/or rewriting. Conclusions: Other specific suggested ways for achieving improved results 77 A number of stakeholders commented on the need for and apparent lack of peer review exercises for the drafters, including comment that: • peer review was a normal and standard requirement for written work in many private sector environments; • generally, peer review would increase quality and consistency; • PCO has a peer review requirement with monitoring methodology to ensure an extremely high compliance level and “soft skills” training on co-operative behaviour; and • it is especially important for junior drafters. 14 78 Recommendation: There should be work undertaken to develop peer review protocols for the drafting unit, including consultation with PCO on how best to implement peer review and make effective, co-operative participation in peer review a KPI for members of the drafting unit. 79 Some (internal) stakeholders considered that the drafters needed to: • become more “team-like”; • cross-fertilise ideas more; • work jointly on drafting; and/or • avoid working in isolation and never leaving their office/cubicle. 80 Recommendation: An exercise be undertaken (possibly in conjunction with development of peer review protocols) of identifying training/skills development modules that can increase the extent of: • co-operation within the drafting unit; and • acceptance of training and guidance on the need for ways to enhance co-operative working in teams. 81 A specific suggestion also concerned establishment of the equivalent of the Rewrite Advisory Panel for a non-partisan and a co-operative means of quality control/post-implementation review. 82 Recommendation: Consideration should be given to this suggestion. Other matters raised by stakeholders: Legislative process issues and general approach to use of legislation 83 A number of internal and external stakeholders expressed concern about the increasing complexity and/or length of tax legislation, including comments that: • the scale and complexity seems always to be increasing (eg. foreign hybrids); • complexity can mean the need for changes to draft legislation is only slowly realised or realised too late; • the drive to eliminate administrative discretion leads to complexity (eg. purchase price allocation rules, arm’s length loan interest rate rules); • the complexity induced by concern about leaving matters to be dealt with administratively means the basic rules are obscured by layers of detail (eg. purchase price allocation rules); • the legislation becomes overly complex and hard to understand if it aims to cover all possible fact scenarios, rather than focussing on the major likely fact scenarios; • avoidance concerns often lead to drafting that raises all possibilities at the outset of the presentation of the legislation, rather than starting with a general rule and leaving remoter possibilities for later parts or for application of the generally anti-tax avoidance provisions; • the tapering down of the IRD investigation function capacity places more emphasis on the detail to be included in legislation; • the ease of and acceptance of the need for a lot of remedial changes means that there is less pressure to ensure initial correctness; • the ITA is now incredibly lengthy and far too prescriptive in dealing with minor peripheral issues; 15 • OCTC must take responsibility for requiring more and more detail in legislation to eliminate areas for discretion; and • the rest of IRD should provide more support for leaving detail to be dealt with in determinations and regulations. 84 Conversely, some stakeholders commented that the volume of legislation was necessary in certain respects, including comments that: • it is better to have a high volume of legislation to allow necessary remedial changes to be made quickly; • users and/or submissions commonly apply pressure to add more detail to clarify how specific factual situations are dealt with; and • the move to eliminate discretions reflected criticism of discretions. 85 Recommendation: Policy advisers, OCTC and drafters should be/be made aware of the adverse consequences (on readability, risk of legislative error and increased risk of non- compliance due to misunderstanding) of: • requiring the legislation to be extremely detailed and prescriptive; and • obscuring major principles. 86 A number of stakeholders commented adversely on the extent to which amendments to bills occur late in the FEC process, in particular by extensive SOPs, including comments that: • major changes at the end of the FEC process are not desirable; • a major change made too late in the process eliminates the chance for submissions to respond; • ad-hoc changes sought by one taxpayer at a late stage may adversely affect other taxpayers who do not then have the opportunity to make submissions; • the FEC and its advisor are increasingly facing SOPs introducing a whole new regime at the last minute; • there used to be a presumption against frequent use of SOPs; and • lengthy SOPs indicate there is a process problem and leave users without access to an explanation of the rationale. 87 Conversely, some (internal) stakeholders commented that: • a lot of last-minute changes reflect last minute criticism; and • drafters do not like extensive SOPs but there is often political pressure to make late changes. 88 Recommendation: The criticisms of and inherent costs of introducing major changes late in the legislative process by SOP be noted and taken into account, with a view to trying to reduce the extent of such changes. 89 Some stakeholders made other comments on the FEC process, including comments that: • FEC is heavily influenced by IRD officials, who effectively become the FEC secretariat; and • the advice of IRD officials to the FEC should be impartial. 90 Recommendation: These concerns should be noted. 16 91 A number of stakeholders (external and internal) commented on the speed of the process and/or the ambitiousness of the work programme, including comments that: • 90% of the time seems to be spent on policy development with only a rushed 10% on the actual legislation; • the timeframes are too tight; • politicians drive urgency, especially after an election; • the work programme is ambitious and there are only a limited number of stakeholders to comment on numerous discussion documents; • PCO develops legislation more systematically and predictably; • the time taken to develop policy compresses the drafting time; • ideally, the policy team could try to slow the process down but it was difficult to push back on Ministers; • drafting is often left to the end of the process, leaving drafters with limited time and scope; • remedials may not always be matters requiring urgency; • systemic timing issues leave drafters working under real pressure; and • the speed of the process adversely affects quality. 92 Recommendation: Consideration should be given to whether there are further steps that could be taken to manage better the process of scheduling drafting, including: • systems to stagger the flow of instructions; and • assessment of the relationship between the time scheduled for policy development and the time scheduled for drafting. 93 One stakeholder commented that policy instructions from non-lawyers and/or those with limited understanding of the legislative structure mean drafters have to provide their own guidance. 94 Recommendation: Care should be taken to ensure that those giving ITA drafting instructions have had adequate training in the ITA structure. 95 Some stakeholders recommended more post-implementation review and/or commented that it seemed to be rare or inconsistent. 96 Recommendation: Post-implementation review should be considered as a standard matter for major change developed and implemented quickly. 97 Some external stakeholders referred to the Roberts case as indicating an unsatisfactory approach being taken by the IRD. 98 Recommendation: These concerns should be noted. 99 Isolated comments were made by stakeholders that: • the commentary often does not match the wording in the Bill; • incorporating terms from other legislation can be problematic if the other legislation has a different policy purpose; • deeming provisions can be problematic and result in incorporation of inconsistent concepts; and • more IRD training on technical issues and the structure of the ITA seems advisable. 17 100 Recommendation: Those responsible for preparing commentaries should be made aware of the concern expressed on whether the commentary matches the wording in the Bill. 101 Recommendation: The drafting unit members should be made aware of (and possibly the IRAC should reflect) the concerns expressed about: • using terms from other legislation; or • deeming provisions. 102 Recommendation: Those responsible for IRD training exercises be made aware of the comment made on that issue. Other matters raised by stakeholders: Consultation and exposure drafts/early stage consultation drafts 103 There was universal support from stakeholders for utilising consultation as a means of improving the quality of draft legislation but a range of comments were made concerning: • past experiences; • best practise going forward; and • practicalities. 104 There was commonly support for draft legislation to be released in the form of exposure drafts or similar, including comments that: • producing draft legislation only at a late stage can means there is little time for any effective consultation; • this allows more time to correct errors and improve drafting; • it would be ideal to establish a protocol that a certain percentage of new legislation has to go through an exposure draft stage or similar early stage consultation and/or make it mandatory for major new or complex initiatives; • under the GTPP, it is just as appropriate to seek comments on drafting as on policy; • seeking comments on drafting only at the FEC stage can waste Parliamentary time that should be focussed on policy matters; • releasing early drafts is very effective, especially in technical areas; • any concerns about the Attorney-General’s protocol about waiver of Crown privilege can be (and is commonly in other departments) easily dealt with by general counsel sign off; • more effort in facilitating private sector input will reduce risk of errors; and • getting input into the form of the drafting only when the Bill is introduced is too late in the process. 105 However, some comment from stakeholders raised cautions about early and/or extensive consultation, including comments that: • consultation at a time when the policy is not sufficiently settled can lead to problems of perceived inconsistency or time-wasting; and • consulting on multiple drafts while the policy is still evolving can erode stakeholder resources and goodwill. 106 Some stakeholders raised concern about: • lack of time allowed for consultation; and • the need to allow for significant amounts of time if consultation is to be successful. 18 107 Some stakeholders commented on the extent of inconsistency in relation to the process of seeking consultation. 108 A number of stakeholders (mainly external) commented adversely on the extent to which changes were made late in the process without consultation. 109 A number of stakeholders, external and internal, commented on the advisability of involving the drafters in the process of consultation with external stakeholders, generally favourably, including comments that: • it is better to involve drafters at the consultation phase; • it allows legislation to be developed iteratively; and • it does mean drafters give away some of their “power”. 110 Isolated comments were made that: • getting input from multiple sources is the best way to flush out factual issues that need to be covered; • rapid changes to legislation to deal with recent court judgments seem to bypass the need for the GTPP; • three organisations tend to dominate the consultation space and there is a need to be careful about self-serving submissions; • the volume of legislation is pushing the boundaries of seeking “free advice” from those consulted; • consultation can involve use of language that a drafter does not want to use, leading to subsequent confusion or concern about inconsistency; and • there is an increasing need to consult early and/or extensively with the IRD systems experts, due to the significance of service delivery implications. 111 Recommendation: Continued effort be made to maximise the use of early stage (pre-Bill) consultation with relevant parties as a means of trying to improve the quality of policy development and final legislation. 112 Recommendation: Efforts should be made: • to produce exposure drafts of legislation wherever reasonably possible; and • to address and deal with any perceived impediments to release of exposure drafts. Other matters raised by stakeholders: Location of drafting team 113 The vast majority of internal stakeholders and some external stakeholders considered that locating the drafting unit at the IRD rather than PCO was advantageous, including comments that: • tax law complexity requires specialist drafters; • close proximity of the drafters and the policy advisers speeds up the process and eases communications; • drafters are more likely to understand the policy and consistency issues; • the quality of IRD drafting is generally high and PCO quality is no better than comparable; and • PCO resource pressures could lead to “log jams”. 114 However, some external and the occasional internal stakeholders considered that a move back to PCO drafting needed to be considered, including comments that: 19 • it might allow drafters more power to impose a more measured and independent approach to advancing legislation; • there is a broader range of drafting talent at PCO; • there is a constitutional rationale or advantage for the independence of PCO from departments; • PCO drafters may be more flexible and open to points raised by policy advisers; • there could be significant advantages in relation to training, back-up resources and secondments; and • it might well be inevitable anyway. 115 Recommendation: No consideration be given to any shifting of taxation law drafting back to PCO but efforts be made to obtain more benefit from PCO training and resources (including precedent drafting rules). Other comments 116 It should be recognised that many of the stakeholders made comments which could be regarded as relatively subjective, superficial and reflective of the most recent experiences that those commentators had had in relation to the process of drafting legislation. However, that was probably inevitable given the diverse range of and nature of the interview process with stakeholders. 117 Some stakeholders were clearly keen for and would appreciate some feedback on the manner in which their contributions had been dealt with. Although I certainly was assiduous in terms of thanking all the stakeholders for their input into the process, I think it would be appropriate to consider some more formal way of acknowledging their contributions and indicating to them the manner in which their contributions have been taken into account in terms of a process seeking to improve the quality of draft legislation in the future. 118 Recommendation: A formal method be considered (possibly tailored to individual stakeholders) for thanking stakeholders and indicating to them the manner in which their contributions have been taken into account. (I am happy to assist in that development and communication.)

Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008
========================================

2008 legislation introduces new tax rules for limited partnerships and updates existing income tax rules relating to general partnerships.

_Sections CB 27B, CB 35, CU 3 to CU 10, CU 11(2), CU 17, CU 19(6)(c), CW 55B, CX 62, DV 20, DO 11B, DU 1 to DU 7, DU 8(2), EW 58(2), EX 13, EZ 37(10), GB29(2)(b), GB 50, HD 20, HD 20B, subpart HG, HR 1, HZ 3, HZ 4, RE 30, YA1, YB 16(1B), YB 17(1B), YD 4(17B) of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 22(4)(c) and 42 of the Tax Administration Act 1994; section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_

Recently enacted legislation introduced new tax rules for limited partnerships and updated and clarified the existing income tax rules relating to general partnerships.

The changes were part of the Limited Partnerships Bill, introduced in August 2007, which also introduced new regulatory rules for limited partnerships that were intended to make it easier for New Zealand firms to have access to investment capital. That was achieved through the introduction of a new limited partnership vehicle that allows partners to participate in a partnership while limiting their liability in particular circumstances.

The resulting Limited Partnerships Act 2008 and Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008 received Royal assent on 13 March 2008. The latter amended the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

This article describes the resulting tax changes. Unless otherwise stated, section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, where the main changes occurred.

### Background

The primary objective of the new limited partnerships rules is to facilitate sustainable growth in New Zealand's investment capital sectors such as venture capital. Given that New Zealand is disadvantaged by size and distance, it was particularly important for New Zealand to adopt a limited partnership structure that was consistent with international norms and provided a legal and tax structure that is recognised and accepted by investors.

New Zealand previously had a statutory form of limited partnership called the "special partnership", as described in Part 2 of the Partnership Act 1908. However, because the legislation was outdated, it did not have all the features preferred by foreign venture capital investors, and the local venture capital industry had been unable to make use of the existing special partnership rules. These rules have now been replaced by the Limited Partnerships Act 2008.

The associated tax changes are contained in the Taxation (Limited Partnerships) Act 2008.

### Key features

*   A new definition of "partnership" clarifies which partnership arrangements are covered by the new rules.
*   Income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are allowed to flow through to individual partners. These items will generally be allocated to the partners in proportion to each partner's share in the partnership's income. Partners are also able to deduct partnership expenditure incurred by the partnership before they became a member, subject to the other deductibility tests in the Act.
*   Transactions between partners within partnerships that are not at market value and that undermine the partnership income tax rules need to be at market value for tax purposes, a requirement designed to protect the tax base.
*   Partners are required to account for tax on exiting the partnership only if the amount of the disposal proceeds derived from the partnership interest exceeds the total net tax book value of their share of partnership property by more than $50,000. However, if this threshold is exceeded, exiting partners will not have to account for tax on things such as trading stock in certain circumstances. When exiting partners account for tax on their share, incoming partners and the partnership must take on a cost basis in the partnership's assets and liabilities that is equal to the deemed disposal under the disposal provisions. When exiting partners account for tax on livestock, incoming partners may deduct the value of the adjustment on a straight-line basis over five years. Partners in a partnership of five or fewer partners may elect to be treated as owning an undivided interest in the property and income of the partnership instead of following the partnership interest disposal rules.
*   The new rules clarify when dissolution of a partnership occurs for tax purposes and the tax consequences of dissolution.
*   Tax loss limitation rules for limited partners ensure that the losses claimed reflect the level of their economic loss. Limited partners' excess tax losses are also available for carry-forward to future income years. Furthermore, an anti-avoidance rule has been introduced to prevent artificially high basis around the year-end being used to increase any loss flow-through.
*   General partners of a limited partnership are treated as an agent of an absentee limited partner.
*   A simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership will not generally result in the triggering of income tax provisions to the partners. Special partnerships that still exist are not required to comply with the loss limitation rules.
*   Two options are available for the calculation of a limited partner's opening basis amount for existing partnership interests.
*   The rules also clarify how the income tax source rules apply to partnership income.
*   The record-keeping and filing obligations of partnerships have been clarified.

### Application date

For general partnerships, the amendments apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2008. For limited partnerships, the new rules apply to limited partners from 1 April 2008.

### Detailed analysis

#### Definition of partnership

A new definition of "partnership" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 specifies the partnership arrangements that are covered by the new rules. The Act previously contained no general definition of "partnership". Under the new definition a partnership is a group of two or more persons who have, between themselves, the relationship described in section 4(1) of the Partnership Act 1908. The Income Tax Act 2007 definition of "partnership" includes a joint venture and co-owners of property if the joint venturers or co-owners all choose to be treated as a partnership for income tax purposes. A limited partnership is also included in the new partnership definition.

#### Limited partnerships

A new definition of "limited partnership" has been inserted into section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. A limited partnership is one that is registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. It must have at least one general partner and one limited partner. A general partner is responsible for the management of the partnership, while a limited partner is not responsible for management.

"Limited partnership" includes an "overseas limited partnership", as defined in section 4 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Under that definition, it is a partnership formed or incorporated outside New Zealand that has at least one general partner who is liable for the debts and liabilities of the partnership and at least one limited partner who is not. Such a partnership does not have separate legal entity status.

The new definition of limited partnership excludes a "listed limited partnership", which is an entity or group of persons that is listed on a recognised exchange and is either a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 or an overseas limited partnership.

The limited partnership definition also excludes a "foreign corporate limited partnership", which is an overseas limited partnership that is treated as a separate legal entity under the laws (other than taxation laws) in the jurisdiction where it was established.

The liability of general and limited partners is set out in Part 2 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. The liability of limited partners is limited by the extent to which they contribute to the management of the partnership. Limited partners' activities are limited to "safe harbour activities" and must not extend to the day-to-day management of the partnership.

A limited partnership is a separate legal entity under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. However, under the Income Tax Act 2007 a limited partnership is not treated as a "company" and instead is treated as a partnership. As a result, income and expenses will flow through the limited partnership to the partners. Therefore the limited partnership itself will not be taxed; instead, partners will be taxed individually.

#### Transparency of partnerships

Section HG 2 codifies the principle that partnerships are transparent for income tax purposes. For the purposes of calculating partners' obligations and liabilities, they are treated as carrying on activities and having the status, intention and purpose of the partnership. Partnerships are treated as not carrying on these activities or having such an intention or purpose. This does not necessarily mean that the activities, status or intention of a partnership are attributed to partners in relation to their non-partnership activities. For example, a partner of a land-dealing partnership is not treated as having the status or intention of the partnership in relation to land that he or she owns in a capacity other than that of a partner.

Partners are also treated as holding property in proportion to their partnership share, being parties to an arrangement, and doing or being entitled to a thing, through their capacity as partner. Partners will be treated as doing, having, or being party to these things, and partnerships will not. In the absence of a partnership agreement, these items will be apportioned to partners under the Partnership Act 1908 or whichever law determines their right to a share in the partnership income.

There are limited situations, however, where partnerships are not treated as being transparent for tax purposes. This is recognised in section HG 2(1), which outlines the principle that partnerships are transparent "...unless the context requires otherwise". An example of a situation where it is clear from the statutory context that a partnership should not be viewed as transparent is in relation to resident withholding tax (RWT) exemption certificates. Section RE 30 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 32J of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that it is the partnership rather than the partners that holds an RWT exemption certificate.

Amendments have been made to income and deduction provisions, and in particular to sections CB 35, CW 55B, CX 62 and DV 20, that reflect the changes made by section HG 2.

#### Flow-through of income, expenses and other items

Section HG 2(2) provides that income, tax credits, rebates, gains, expenditure or loss of the partnership will be allocated in proportion to each partner's share in the partnership's income or, in the absence of a partnership agreement, in accordance with the relevant law.

The proportionate approach prevents streaming of these items to specific partners, by requiring them to be allocated to the partners in the same proportion as their respective shares in the partnership's income. It will also provide certainty in the allocation of these items for income tax purposes, and ensure that they cannot be streamed to take advantage of the different tax circumstances of the partners.

The proportionate approach does not, however, prevent a partner from having different proportions of shares in different types of partnership property. This is clear from the definition of "partnership share" in section YA 1, which defines "partnership share" as the partner's share in each different type of partnership property. This allows, for example, a partner's share in the income to be different from the partner's share in the assets for income tax purposes.

Under section HG 2(3) expenditure apportioned to new partners who were not partners when the expenditure was originally incurred will generally be deductible, subject to the other tests of deductibility in the Income Tax Act. This marks a departure from the previous law as new partners were previously not entitled to claim expenditure incurred through the original partnership because they did not generally meet the "incurred test". The deduction will be allocated to either the exiting or the incoming partner. It will not be available to both.

#### Transactions between partners and partnerships

New section GB 50 provides that transactions between partners under an arrangement will be treated as being at market value for income tax purposes if a purpose or effect of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of the new partnership rules in subpart HG. This is designed to protect the tax base.

Transactions that do not occur at market value, such as goods provided at a discount, are likely to have an impact on limited partners' partnership basis, with excess value given to a partnership being treated as a capital contribution, and excess value received from a partnership being treated as a distribution.

#### Entry and exit of partners and changes to partnership interest

#### _General_

Under the transparent approach for partnerships provided in section HG 2, partners are treated as holding the partnership property directly, carrying on the activities of the partnership and having the status and intention of the partnership. Therefore when partners exit the partnership by disposing of their partnership interest they would, without specific provision otherwise, be treated as disposing of their share of the underlying partnership property and bearing any tax consequences associated with the disposal. This could result in significant compliance costs for partners and partnerships.

Therefore sections HG 5 to HG 9 remove the requirement for the exiting partner to account for tax when the tax adjustment that would otherwise be required is below certain thresholds. When these provisions apply, the new partner (the "entering partner") is treated as acquiring the partnership interests for the same cost that the exiting partner had acquired them. In other words, the entering partner receives the same cost basis as the exiting partner - thereby ensuring that the tax consequences associated with the exit are delayed rather than extinguished. In these situations, therefore, the entering partner can effectively bear the tax obligations of the exiting partner and may adjust the purchase price of the partnership interest accordingly.

Partners in "small partnerships" (defined in section YA 1 as those partnerships with five or fewer partners that are not limited partnerships) can elect out of sections HG 5 to HG 9 by furnishing a return of income that ignores these sections. In this situation the partners will be treated as owning an undivided interest in the property and income of the partnership.

#### _$50,000 threshold - section HG 5_

Under section HG 5 a partner is required to account for tax on exiting the partnership only if the amount of the disposal proceeds derived from the partnership interest exceeds the total net tax book value of the partner's share of the partnership property (less any liabilities under generally accepted accounting practice) by more than $50,000. When interests in the same partnership have been sold within a 12-month period, all sales are taken into account for the purposes of the threshold. The following simple example illustrates the operation of section HG 5.

  

In May 2009 Paul and John establish a two-person partnership. The business of the partnership is to buy shares in New Zealand-resident listed companies with the purpose and intention of making a profit on resale. They each contribute $50,000 to the partnership and, therefore, each have a partnership share of 50 percent. The partnership uses the $100,000 to purchase 10,000 shares in A Co for $10 per share. The partnership and the partners have a standard balance date.

In March 2010 the market value of the partnership's shares in A Co has risen to $150,000 ($15 per share). In the same month John sells his entire 50 percent partnership interest to Janet for $67,500. (Even though the shares have a market value of $75,000 Janet negotiates a discounted purchase price to compensate for additional tax liabilities that she may face.).

**Application of new tax rules for the 2009-10 income year**

Section HG 2(1)(a) treats John as carrying on the share trading business of the partnership. Section HG 2(1)(b) treats him as holding 50 percent of the A Co shares directly. Section HG 2(1)(d) treats him as doing a thing that the partnership does. John is therefore treated as purchasing 50 percent of the underlying shares in A Co and disposing of these shares when he sells his entire partnership interest to Janet in March 2010. Therefore, without section HG 5, the profit of $17,500 ($67,500 minus $50,000) would be taxable to John.

The partners and the partnership decide not to elect out of section HG 5. Section HG 5 applies in this case as the taxable profit for which John would otherwise be liable is less than $50,000. (That is, under section HG 5(1) the "disposal payment" ($67,500) plus any "previous payments" ($0) minus the "gross tax value" ($50,000) minus "liabilities' ($0) minus $50,000 is less than zero.) This means that John is not taxable on the $67,500 disposal payment (section HG 5(3)) and does not have a deduction for the $50,000 spent on the shares in A Co (section HG 5(4)).

Section HG 5(6) treats Janet (the entering partner) as having acquired the original partnership interests. In other words, for the purposes of calculating future tax liabilities, Janet's cost basis for the shares in A Co is $50,000.

#### _Sections HG 6 - HG 9_

Even if the $50,000 threshold in section HG 5 is exceeded, however, an exiting partner does not have to account for tax, in certain circumstances, on:

*   _Trading stock - section HG 6  
    _Exiting partners do not have to perform a revenue account adjustment for trading stock if the total annual turnover of the partnership is $3 million or less.  
    
*   _Depreciable tangible property - section HG 7_  
    Exiting partners do not have to account for depreciation recovery or loss on their share of any depreciable tangible asset of the partnership if the historical cost of the asset is $200,000 or less.  
    
*   _Financial arrangements - section HG 8_  
    Exiting partners are not required to perform a base price adjustment for their interest in a financial arrangement if:  
    
    *   the partnership is not itself in the business of deriving income from financial arrangements; and
    *   the financial arrangement has been entered into as a necessary and incidental purpose of the business.  
        For example, exiting partners are not generally required to perform a base price adjustment in respect of their interest in a loan that provides capital for a partnership's business.
    
      
    
*   _Certain financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements - section HG 8_  
    Exiting partners do not have to account for tax on financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements described in section EW 5(10). These are interest-free loans made in New Zealand currency that are repayable on demand.  
    
*   _Short-term sale and purchase agreements - section HG 9_br> Section HG 9 applies when exiting partners dispose of some or all of their partnership interests in a short-term sale and purchase agreement. The consideration that the exiting partner receives is excluded income. In addition, both the entering and exiting partners are denied any deduction for this. In the exiting partner's case, this is because for income tax liability purposes the entering partner is treated as having originally acquired the property or services contained in the agreement.

#### _Livestock - sections HG 10, CB 27B, DO 11B_

Section HG 10 applies when a partner exits the partnership and the partnership property consists of livestock that is not valued using the herd scheme or one of the cost price, replacement price or market value methods described in section EC 25. In these circumstances the entering partner is treated as if they had originally purchased and held the livestock - not the exiting partner. This is designed to reduce compliance costs for partnerships as the partnership will not be required to maintain different cost bases for different partners.

If the exiting partner has accounted for tax on the livestock, the entering partner can choose to deduct the amount of that adjustment on a straight-line basis over a five-year period under section DO 11B. Similarly, if an exiting partner has a loss on disposal for livestock, the incoming partner must account for income on a straight-line basis over a five-year period under section CB 27B.

However, the partnership and the partners can opt out of the five-year spreading method under section HG 10(3) by furnishing a joint return of income that ignores the section.

#### _When an exiting partner accounts for tax on exit_

When exiting partners account for tax in respect of their share of the partnership assets and liabilities, the partnership and the incoming partner must take on a cost base in the partnership's assets and liabilities. The cost base must be equal to the amount the exiting partner was deemed to have disposed of them for under the disposal provisions.

In these situations incoming partners will generally acquire their partnership interest at market value. This means that, generally, they will take on a market value cost base in partnership assets and liabilities. An exception is livestock, which is discussed above.

#### _Introduction of a new partner_

The introduction of a new partner into a partnership does not trigger a tax event for the existing partners. This is because the addition of a new partner would not result in a "disposal" of partnership property for an existing partner under section YA 1.

#### Dissolution of a partnership

The new tax rules clarify when dissolution of a partnership will occur for tax purposes, and the tax consequences of dissolution. Previously, the legislation was silent as to the tax consequences of partnership dissolution. New section HG 4 deems the partnership to have disposed of all its assets at market value for tax purposes on dissolution. A partnership is not automatically treated as dissolving for tax purposes when there is a change in partners or a smaller change in partnership interests, but there is a deemed sale and reacquisition by all partners at market value when the partnership finally dissolves through the agreement of partners, or through operation of law by which fewer than two parties remain, or by an order of the court.

The Minister of Revenue has announced a proposal that would provide an exception to the general rule that triggers a tax event for partners upon dissolution of a partnership. According to the announcement, the exception would apply to dissolutions of two-person partnerships where the partners are married, or in a relationship in the nature of marriage, and the dissolution is caused by the death of one of the partners. When this occurs the surviving spouse will often inherit the deceased spouse's partnership share under the deceased spouse's will. Under the current law any tax consequences associated with the inherited share are delayed until the surviving spouse sells the assets. In these circumstances it is proposed to delay the triggering of a tax event in respect of the surviving spouse's original partnership share until the assets are actually sold. This measure is designed to reduce compliance costs for surviving spouses. The announcement states that the measure will apply from the start of the 2008-09 income year.

#### Limitation of limited partner's tax losses

New section HG 11 ensures that limited partners' tax losses are restricted if the amount of the loss exceeds the tax book value of their investment (the partner's basis). This is to ensure that limited partners can offset tax losses only to the extent they reflect their economic losses. This provision applies only to limited partners because general partners have unlimited liability and therefore full exposure to the risk of loss.

#### _Basis calculation_

A limited partner's adjusted investment in a partnership is referred to as the "partner's basis". In calculating their basis, limited partners will take into account the sum of their:

*   investment contributions
*   share of the partnership debt guaranteed (or indemnities provided) by the partner
*   share of the net limited partnership income previously recognised
*   share of the capital gains previously realised
*   any previous equity injections

Less their:

*   share of the partnership debt guarantees (or indemnities) retired or extinguished by the partner
*   share of the net limited partnership loss previously deducted
*   share of the capital losses previously realised
*   any previous distributions.

If their basis is reduced to nil and they are denied a deduction for a tax loss for an income year under section HG 11, the deduction is carried forward to the next income year under section HG 12. The deduction becomes available when additional basis becomes available, such as when a partner contributes more capital to the partnership (putting more capital at risk) or the partnership earns income.

The following simple example explains how these rules work.

  

On 1 April 2009 Limited Partnership X is established. Limited Partnership X has two partners - Eve and Sam - who each make an investment of $10,000. They share equally in the net income and loss of the partnership.

Partnership X borrows $1 million from the bank at an annual interest rate of 10%. The annual interest cost of $100,000 is deductible under the Income Tax Act 2007. On 1 June 2009 the partners each receive a distribution from the partnership of $5,000. The partnership derives $20,000 of gross income for the 2009-10 income year.

**Application of tax rules to Eve for the 2009-10 income year**

Eve has a partnership share in the income of Limited Partnership X of 50 percent. Therefore, under section HG 2(2), she has gross income of $10,000 (50% of $20,000) and an allowable deduction of $50,000 (50% of $100,000) from the partnership.

However, section HG 11(2) denies her a deduction to the extent that the amount exceeds her basis in the partnership. For the 2009-10 income year she has basis in the partnership of $15,000 - calculated under section HG 11(3) as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| *   Investments | $10,000  <br>Minus |
| *   Distributions | $5,000  <br>Plus |
| *   Income | $10,000  <br>Minus |
| *   Deductions taken in previous years | $0  <br>Minus |
| *   Disallowed amounts | $0  |

  

This means that the deduction she is allowed for the 2009-10 income year from her investment in Limited Partnership X is $15,000. Under section HG 12(2) she carries forward the $35,000 deduction she is denied to the next income year. She will need to apply section HG 11 again in the next income year to determine how much of the deduction is allowed in that year.

#### _Anti-avoidance rule_

To prevent the artificial creation of a high basis around the end of the year when loss flow-through is taken into account, a limited partner's basis is reduced by the amount the basis is increased if:

*   the limited partner's basis is increased within 60 days before the end of the income year, and
*   the limited partner's basis is subsequently reduced within 60 days after the end of the income year.

#### General partner liable if limited partner an absentee

New section HD 20B ensures that the general partner of a limited partnership is treated as an agent of an absentee limited partner for income derived from a partnership business carried on in New Zealand. It is anticipated that limited partnerships will be widely held and similar to a company; therefore it would be impractical to impose this liability on all the partners. General partners in a limited partnership are usually responsible for management of the limited partnership and are also liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. General partners are therefore treated as agents of an absentee limited partner for income derived from a partnership business carried on in New Zealand.

#### Transitional issues

Part 2 of the Partnership Act 1908, which relates to special partnerships, has been replaced by the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Under section HZ 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 special partnerships will continue to exist until their expiry. Partners of special partnerships are not required to comply with the loss limitation rules for this remaining period.

Under the previous rules, the cessation of a special partnership and the creation of a limited partnership would generally have crystallised a tax event. However, under the new rules, a simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership will not generally have income tax consequences for the partners if the business and ownership of the partnership remains the same.

New Zealand-resident partners of special partnerships that make the transition into the new limited partnership rules can determine their initial basis by either:

*   the market value of their interest in the limited partnership, or
*   calculating their basis as if the rules were in effect the entire time the partner has held the partnership interest.

#### Associated persons rules

Section YB 16 treats a partnership and a partner in the partnership as associated persons. The section has been amended to provide an exception in the case of a limited partner. Limited partners and their respective limited partnership will be associated persons only if the limited partners have a partnership share of 25 percent or more in the limited partnership.

Section YB 17 also treats a partnership and a person associated with a partner as associated persons. The section has been similarly amended so that a limited partnership and a person associated with a limited partner will be associated persons only if the limited partner has a partnership share of 25 percent or more.

#### Source rules

Section YD 4 has been amended to provide that income is treated as being sourced in New Zealand if, treating all the partners of a New Zealand partnership as resident in New Zealand, the income is sourced in New Zealand under a provision in that section. A "New Zealand partnership" is defined in section YA 1 as a partnership that is a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008, or has 50percent or more of its capital held by New Zealand residents, or has its centre of management in New Zealand.

#### Repealed provisions

A number of provisions that provided that partnerships were transparent for specific income tax purposes have been repealed because the general transparent approach in new section HG 2 made them redundant. The repealed provisions are sections CU11(2), CU 19(6)(c), DU 8(2), EW 58(2), EX 13 and EZ 37(10). Section HR 1, which related to partnerships and joint ventures, has been repealed as a consequence of the enactment of the new partnership rules in subpart HG. The parts of former section HR 1 that related to persons other than partners who derive income jointly or have deductions jointly have been relocated to new section HG 1.

#### Record-keeping and filing requirements

Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to clarify that it is the partnership, rather than each partner in the partnership, that must maintain records, in accordance with the usual practice.

Tax legislation often refers to a "person's" obligation to fulfil record-keeping requirements. A partnership is a "person" within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1999 (being an unincorporated body of persons), as is a partner. It can be inferred from this that all partners, as well as the partnership, must maintain separate (yet identical) records. In practice, the partnership typically keeps one set of records relating to all the partners and all the firm's activities. The new legislation brings the law into alignment with current practice.

Section 42 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to clarify the return filing obligations of partnerships and partners.

#### Goods and Services Act 1985

The interpretation section of the Goods and Services Act 1985 has been amended to clarify that a limited partnership will be treated as a company for GST purposes.

Taxation (new due date for new and increased assessments) commencement order 2018
=================================================================================

The Taxation (New Due Date for New and Increased Assessments) Commencement Order 2018 came into force on the 14th of May 2018. This commencement order sets the date that section 142AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 comes into force for goods and services tax as the 18th of June 2018.

The _Taxation (New Due Date for New and Increased Assessments) Commencement Order 2018_ came into force on the 14th of May 2018.  This commencement order sets the date that section 142AB of the _Tax Administration Act 1994_ comes into force for goods and services tax as the 18th of June 2018.

This new section standardises the due dates for default assessments which are issued by the Commissioner in the absence of a return.

### Application date

Section 142AB will come into force for goods and services tax on 18 June 2018.

### Background

Section 142A of the _Tax Administration Act 1994_ sets different due dates for payment of an Electronic Default Assessment (EDA) and Non-electronic Default Assessment (NDA). There are also different treatments for any tax payable from a subsequent amendment to that default assessment. Section 142AB modifies that rule to align the due date for payment of tax for default assessments, whether these are made manually or electronically.

The amended rules will only apply when the default assessment relates to a tax type that has been migrated to Inland Revenue’s new START technology system, and when incremental penalties do not apply to the particular tax type. Consequently, the commencement order only brings section 142AB into force for goods and services tax, which is the only tax type which currently meets those criteria.

### The previous treatment

Section 142A sets different due dates for payment of an EDA and NDA.

For an EDA:

*   The amount payable from the default assessment is due on the original due date for the tax type and period. This means that if the EDA is made after the original due date, as is always the case for GST, late payment penalties will be immediately applied, back-dated to the original due date.
*   When the EDA is amended, a new due date will be set that is at least 30 days following the notice advising the taxpayer of the new amount to pay. Therefore, any late payment penalties applied to the EDA will be reversed, and the taxpayer will not be penalised further unless they do not pay any amount due by the new due date.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Horribear Ltd the maker of zombie teddy bears is due to file its GST return for the period ending 31 March 2017 on 28 April 2017. Because of an increasing demand for the new Demon Teddy range, Horribear forgets to file the return in its attempts to produce more Demon bears.<br><br>Because the return is unfiled, the Inland Revenue computer system automatically applies an EDA of $1,000 on 14 May 2017. The due date for the EDA is 28 April 2017, so immediately retrospective penalties are applied on the amount of the EDA, with effect from the day after the original due date.<br><br>Horribear then files the return on 30 May 2017, and the information from that return is used to replace the EDA with a new assessment of $1,500 to pay.<br><br>The taxpayer is given at least 30 days – until 30 June 2017, to pay the $1,500 assessment. There are no back-dated penalties unless they do not pay by the new due date. |     |

For an NDA:

*   The amount payable from the default assessment is due at least 30 days from the notice of assessment.
*   If the assessment is subsequently amended, then the taxpayer is only given a new due date for any amount payable that is greater than the amount previously payable from the NDA. This new due date will also be at least 30 days after the notice advising the taxpayer of the additional tax to pay.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Dream Liner Ltd, a manufacturer of scented industrial bin liners, is due to file its GST return for the period ending 31 March 2017 on 28 April 2017.<br><br>An Inland Revenue investigator decides to make a Commissioner’s assessment of $1,000 on 14 May 2017 due to Dream Liner not having filed a number of returns, including this one. Dream Liner is given a due date to pay the $1,000 on 15 June 2017.<br><br>The taxpayer then files its return, and the information from the return is accepted as an amendment to the NDA on 30 June 2017, with the resulting assessment being $1,500 to pay.<br><br>The $1,000 from the NDA is still due as of 15 June 2017, and the taxpayer is given a new due date of 30 July 2017 to pay the additional $500 of the increased assessment. |     |

### The new treatment

Section 142AB will apply to set a new due date for certain assessments. Section 142AB will not apply to assessments made in the absence of a return and to which section 106(1) applies. Section 106 deals with the issue of default assessments, both electronic and non-electronic.

Section 142A applies to tax types that proposed section 142AB does not apply to. It also applies to assessments other than EDAs made in the absence of a return and to which section 106(2) applies, which relates to EDAs only. Section 142AB removes this distinction entirely so that no new due date is set for any default assessment, manual or automatic.

In addition, proposed section 142AB does not set a new due date for an increased assessment from a default assessment. This will mean that any subsequent amendments to a default assessment will be due at the original due date. This change reflects the fact that no return was originally filed and removes a benefit to those who do not file compared with those who do file returns and pay tax on time.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Using the facts in the Dream Liner Ltd example above, Dream Liner is due to file its GST return for the period ending 31 March 2019 on 28 April 2019.<br><br>An Inland Revenue investigator decides to make a Commissioner’s assessment of $1,000 on 14 May 2019 due to Dream Liner not having filed a number of returns. Although section 142AB applies to this situation it will not apply to give this default assessment a new due date and the tax will be due on the original due date of 28 April 2019.<br><br>The taxpayer then files its return, and the information from the return is accepted as an amendment to the NDA on 30 June 2019, with the resulting assessment being $1,500 to pay.<br><br>Again, section 142AB will not apply as the reassessment relates to the reassessment of a default assessment and thus the $1,500 from the reassessment is still due on the original due date for the tax, 28 April 2019. |     |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| Carrying on from the Horribear Ltd example above, in the 2019 year Horribear has a GST review performed by Inland Revenue on its GST return for the period ended 31 March 2019.<br><br>Inland Revenue discovers that Horribear has understated its GST output tax for the period by $500. The investigator issues a reassessment for the period to reflect the increase in GST payable.<br><br>Section 142AB will apply to the reassessment as it is not a reassessment of a default assessment and therefore a new due date can be set for the payment of the extra GST. The due date for the tax is set for at least 30 days after the reassessment. |     |

Taxation of business environmental expenditure
==============================================

New rules for business environmental expenditure enacted in June 2005 ensure all business operating costs are considered when calculating taxable income.

##### Sections 14, 54, 55, 56, 57, 163 and 203 of the Income Tax Act 2004

New rules for business environmental expenditure were enacted on 21 June 2005 to ensure that all business operating costs, including those for dealing with environmental concerns, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate.

A number of remedial changes have been made to clarify the new business environmental tax rules and ensure that the original legislation has its intended effect.

### Treatment of by-products

The definition of "deductible environmental expenditure" allows a tax deduction for dealing with by-products on cessation of business. However, taxpayers may deal with by-products before cessation. The words "incurred in the cessation of a business" have been removed from item 7, Part B of Schedule 6B, to ensure that expenditure incurred before the cessation of business on the treatment of by-products is deductible and that there is no distortion between the treatment of by-products before and after cessation of business.

### ERA transfers

The business environmental rules contain an Environmental Restoration Account (ERA) mechanism that allows business taxpayers, through making a deposit, to set aside a portion of their tax payments to pay for future site restoration and monitoring expenditure.

To ensure that ERA deposits follow the associated restoration liability, taxpayers are allowed to make transfers from their ERAs in a number of circumstances - for example, on the sale of a site. However, a number of the new ERA provisions were unclear on the treatment of transfers.

Section EK 20, which allows the nominated company for a consolidated group to make ERA payments and applications for refunds on behalf of the consolidated group now also makes specific reference to ERA transfers.

Section EK 6 (interest on payments to ERA) has been amended so that interest is payable on an amount that is treated as a payment under sections EK 15, EK 16 and EK 19. Amendments have also been made to treat an amount as a payment under section EK 16 (transfer on death, bankruptcy or liquidation).

The section EK 16 reference to funds being transferred to the Ministry for the Environment has also been removed as subsequent work indicates that it is now unlikely that a restoration liability would be transferred to the New Zealand government (for example, where there is an orphan site).

### ERA refunds

It was initially proposed that taxpayers would be able to make only one ERA deposit or refund per year. However, in order to increase flexibility, this was subsequently altered. A change has therefore been made to remove the words "or after earlier payment or request for refund" from section CX 43B as this was a reference to the limitation on multiple payments and refunds.

A change has also been made to clarify that there are two types of refunds permitted under section EK 1 - those requested by the taxpayer and those made by Inland Revenue when a taxpayer's ERA exceeds the maximum balance. In calculating the latter, the amount of the refund will be the difference between the actual and permitted balance. The amendments also remove the reference to any amount of refund requested by the taxpayer in subsection EK 12(8).

### Removal of the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste

The previous environmental tax rules applied solely to dealing with "industrial" waste. There was no definition of this term, resulting in uncertainty about when tax deductions were available for environmental expenditure. The new rules no longer make this distinction and also retrospectively remove the word "industrial" for any income year for which a taxpayer took a position on the definition of industrial waste before the introduction of the new rules. An amendment has been made to section DJ 10 in the Income Tax Act 1994 to allow a taxpayer who initially qualifies to have the word "industrial" removed to apply this same treatment for subsequent income years up until the time that the new environmental tax rules apply.

### Application dates

These amendments apply to expenditure incurred in an income year beginning on or after 10 June 2005. The change to section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 applies for income years subsequent to 1994-95 if a taxpayer has taken a tax position on the meaning of "industrial waste" before 16 November 2004.

[Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009](/new-legislation/act-articles/2009-34/taxation "Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009")

Taxation of life insurance business
===================================

2009 legislation introduces rules to deal with the taxation of life insurance business in connection with term life insurance and savings-related life policies.

**_Sections CR 1, CR 2, CW 59C, CX 55, DR 1 to DR 4, subpart EY, sections EZ 53 to EZ 63, IA 8, subpart IT, sections LA 8B, LE 2B, sections OC 2B, OC 20, OP 7(3), OP 17, OP 30(2), OP 33B, OP 44, OP 74 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_**

Significant changes have been made to the taxation of life insurance business. The changes update the rules to ensure that term insurance business is taxed on actual profits, as other businesses are taxed, and extend the tax benefits of the PIE rules to people who save through life products. The new rules tax life insurance business like other New Zealand companies but require separate calculations to reflect two bases of taxable income:

*   a shareholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of shareholders); and
*   a policyholder base (representing income derived for the benefit of policyholders).

Income and deductions will be recognised using ordinary tax principles, with the addition of special rules to deal with the unique timing and allocation issues inherent with life insurance products, particularly in respect of participating life policies.

Life insurer income will therefore be allocated between income earned on behalf of shareholders (the shareholder base) and income earned on behalf of policyholders (the policyholder base).

The shareholder base comprises the following items: risk profits, fees, share of participating profits, investment income on shareholder funds, and other income accruing to the life company, less allowable deductions. It will be taxed at the company rate, and be generally subject to ordinary rules for companies, including those for losses, continuity based on shareholding and memorandum account balances.

The policyholder base comprises investment income (less expenses) from policyholder funds, including the policyholders’ share of net investment income from participating policies (allocated to policyholders in reflection of their contractual entitlements). Excess deductions and surplus imputation credits converted to deductions are carried forward for deduction in next year’s policyholder base with no requirement to meet a continuity of ownership test.

The portfolio investment entity (PIE) exclusion for realised New Zealand and listed Australian equity gains has also been extended to policyholders in all life insurance savings products, which will then be taxed at the company rate of 30%. Life insurers can elect to attribute income in investment-linked products to each policyholder at their portfolio investment rate (19.5% or 30%).

The new rules also provide a transition period and rules for life insurance policies sold before the application date of the new rules.

### Background

The new rules solve several problems that existed with the taxation of life insurance business in connection with term life insurance and savings-related life policies.

##### _Taxing income from term **life insu**rance business_

Life insurance companies are companies that carry on a life insurance business and are registered under the Life Insurance Act 1908 to write life insurance policies.

Until the 1980s, the products most frequently offered by life insurance companies were the traditional whole of life and endowment products.[1](#01)
Since the enactment of the previous life insurance rules, term life insurance business has increased from being less than 10 percent of total industry premiums to now over 50 percent. Term life insurance is a pure risk product that pays out only on death (within the term of the policy). Term insurance policies do not contain a savings component in the premium which means they have more in common with general insurance (such as motor vehicle or home and contents insurance) than traditional savings-related policies.

The main problem with the previous rules is that calculation of taxable income was based on a formula that was not designed with term insurance products in mind. This formula has little connection with the profit earned from term insurance. The tax result under the previous rules is illustrated in Example 1.

##### Example 1: The problem with taxing term risk life policies under the previous rules

|     | Financial accounting | Under the previous rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Premiums | 100 |     |
| Claims ( = Expected claims) | (45) | 0   |
| Investment income | 10  | 10  |
| Expenses | (40) | (40) |
| Premium loading (20% claims) |     | 9   |
| Accounting profit/tax (loss) | 25  | (21) |

As shown in the example, if the life insurer has a loss ratio (claims ÷ premiums) of 45 percent, a $25 accounting profit translates into a $21 tax loss. In effect, life insurers were not being taxed on the profit they make on term life risk business, generating losses that may have reduced overall tax paid.

##### _Savings_

Under the previous rules, individuals who saved through life insurance products faced a higher tax burden than other savers who invested directly or through managed funds that become PIEs. This effect served to distort consumer decisions about the type of saving vehicle used and placed life insurance polices at a competitive disadvantage.

##### _Other_

There were a number of other issues, such as measuring continuity and use of conduit rules, caused by the imperfect measurement of ownership that did not recognise the policyholder base as an "owner." This is because the life insurer was taxed on all its income, policyholder and shareholder together. This meant that concessions that were aimed at non-resident shareholders of a company, such as the tax relief under the conduit rules, were also provided to the resident policyholders.

### Key features

Under the new rules, the shareholder base consists of:

*   profits from the risk component of premiums less risk claims net of reinsurance;
*   net investment income from shareholder funds;
*   shareholder share of participating policy profits;
*   fees from investment management and other services;
*   income from annuities;
*   income determined under ordinary principles from any other sources;
*   less risk expenses and any other allowable deductions; and
*   plus/less changes in risk reserves.

Ordinary provisions apply to shareholder base losses carried forward or subject to grouping, and to imputation credit and other remaining memorandum account balances carried forward.

The policyholder base consists of:

*   net investment income from policyholder funds; and
*   policyholder share of investment income (less expenses) from participating policies.

The shareholder base is taxed at the prevailing company rate. The policyholder base is ordinarily taxed at 30%, although life insurers may elect to attribute investment income from investment-linked products to each policyholder at their portfolio investment rate.

Any policyholder base loss is carried forward to the next income year. Excess imputation credits on the policyholder base income are grossed-up and applied as a loss against the policyholder base in the subsequent income year. In both cases there are no continuity requirements.

Sections EY 17, 18, 21, 22, 28 and 29 contain detailed rules on the allocation of income and expenditure or loss from profit-participation policies between the shareholder base and policyholder base.

In situations when the operation of new rules, particularly in subpart EY, gives rise to income or expenditure that would not be recognised by ordinary taxation principles, new sections CR 1, CR 2, DR 1, DR 2 and DR 4 ensure that the calculation of income and expenditure is consistent with the core principles of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application date

The new rules apply from 1 July 2010. This date applies to the changes to the taxation of life insurance business and the application of the PIE taxation rules to all policyholder savings policies. The five-year grandparenting period also starts from that date.

To provide some flexibility, life insurers have the option to apply the new rules from the beginning of their income year if that year includes 1 July 2010.

When the application date bisects an insurer’s tax year, the insurer is required to complete a separate calculation for the period before the specified date and another for the period after.

### Detailed analysis

The analysis of the new life insurance rules is in two parts. The first part deals with the operation of the new rules after the application date. The second part deals with the transitional rules and the effect of the grandparenting provisions.

#### Part I: The new rules

##### _Scheme and operation of the new rules_

The taxation base for life insurance business consists of the following elements:

*   Shareholder base income, less allowable deductions, under the new life rules
*   Other income (including general insurance) less allowable deductions
*   Schedular policyholder base income, under the new life rules
*   Life fund PIE income, less allowable deductions, attributed to each policyholder at their portfolio investment rate.

The recognition of income and expenditure under the Income Tax Act 2007 relies in the first instance on amounts that result from using generally accepted accounting practices. These amounts are then modified according to ordinary income tax principles to determine whether an asset is held on revenue account by the life insurer and whether any expenditure incurred is deductible. These amounts are then allocated under subpart EY to the two tax bases using formulas that are consistent with actuarial principles.

Section EY 1 sets out the core operation of the rules in subpart EY and provides for the taxation of life insurers on two separate bases. Sections EY 2 and EY 3 describe the general apportionment of income and deductions between the two bases. Section LA 8B provides some general rules for tax credits relating to the two bases. Parts L and O include tax credit rules and memorandum account rules specific to the two bases.

Section EY 1(3) prevents double counting of income or expenditure between the shareholder base and the policyholder base.

##### _The shareholder base_

_**Sections CR 2, CX 55, DR 1 to DR 4, subpart EY and section YA 1**_

The shareholder base comprises the following:

**_Risk income:_** The life risk components of life insurance products (excluding participating policies and annuities) will be taxed on the basis of their profits; being the difference between premiums less claims and expenses, including adjustments for certain reinsurance treaties. Reinsurance risk premiums paid and risk reinsurance claims received will be netted against such premiums and claims respectively, provided the reinsurance contracts were offered or entered into in New Zealand. Net risk income is adjusted for prescribed reserves (sections EY 23 to EY 27).

**_Fees:_** Fees and commissions from investment management or managing life insurance policies are treated as taxable income, whether explicitly charged or implicitly included in premium income (to the extent that the fees are not already included as risk income). Expenses incurred in deriving fee income are deductible.

**_Share of participating profits:_** The net return from participating policies is shared between shareholders and policyholders. Because of the complicated nature of these products, the allocation method is discussed under the heading "Participating policies".

**_Investment income:_** Amounts derived from investment income (less expenses) by the life insurer that has not already been included in the policyholder base becomes shareholder investment income. Sections EY 46 and EY 47 dealing with disposal of property have been repealed. One consequence is that the deeming of income arising from the disposal of property (other than financial arrangements) of the life insurance business has been removed. This means that whether a disposal of property by the life insurer is on revenue or capital account will have to be considered for particular taxpayers or circumstances under ordinary tax principles as amended by statutory provisions. The taxation of gains from the realisation of Australasian equities will be similarly treated.

**_Income earned from annuities:_** Net annuity income will continue to be determined using the old rules. Annuity premiums and claims are excluded from the shareholder base and annuity income is taxed using the formula in section EY 31(2). The terms of the formula are defined in sections EZ 53 to EZ 60. A positive amount is shareholder base income and a negative amount is a shareholder base allowable deduction. Net investment income arising from annuity is taxed in the shareholder base at 30%.

**_Deductions:_** The following deductions are allowed:

*   Deductions will be generally allowed for expenditure or loss incurred for the cost of revenue account property in section DB 23. These deductions may have to be apportioned between the shareholder or policyholder base.
*   Deferred acquisition costs, which are expenses connected with the sale of life policies – for example, commissions, will continue to be deductible under ordinary principles.
*   Section DR 4 allows a deduction for the amount of expenditure or loss of a claim paid under a life insurance policy, or as an outstanding claims reserving amount under section EY 24.
*   Deductions are also available for "premium payback amounts". Therefore, when an amount of life risk component premium is refunded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant life insurance policy (or the discretion of the life insurer) that amount is deductible. The deduction is limited to premium payback amounts made at the end of the contracted policy term when those premiums have been previously returned as income under section EY 19(1) – subject to any transitional adjustments.

**_Other income and expenses:_** Other income and expenses determined under ordinary tax concepts are included.

##### _Shareholder adjustment for reserves relating to non-participating policies – excluding annuities_

_**Sections EY 23 to EY 27 and section YA 1**_

To reflect the unusual cashflows connected with certain life products, for example, premiums received upfront with large claim payments occurring later, life insurers use reserving methods to match revenue and expense recognition and to smooth profits.

New section EY 23 sets out the tax effects these reserves have on income and deductions relating to non-participating life products that are term insurance or savings products (that is, excluding profit-participation policies and annuities). Positive amounts are included as shareholder base income, while negative amounts constitute a deduction to the shareholder base. In other words, the movement in a reserve during the income year is; income if the reserve has decreased in value, a deduction if the reserve has increased in value.

Amounts calculated for the reserves must be actuarially determined for each class of policy. The rules relate to the calculation of reserves relating to premium income recognition, outstanding claims reserves, and capital guarantee reserves.

##### _Premium income recognition - the unearned premium reserve and premium smoothing reserve sections - sections EY 25 and EY 26_ 

For non-participating policies other than annuities, life insurers have the option of recognising premium income on an unearned premium reserve (UPR) basis or using a premium smoothing reserve (PSR) basis. The default option is the UPR. The choice of reserving method, once applied to a class of policies, is irrevocable - section EY 23(5) - except when the PSR can no longer be used, in which case the insurer reverts to the UPR method.

The PSR can only be used for:

*   products which have premiums that are level (or substantially level for more than one year); or
*   products which could result in a material mismatch in any one year between the incidence of life risk components and the timing of the premium payable, and the period is one or more years.

Life insurance policies may be grouped together under the PSR if the policies have the following in common:

*   substantially the same contractual terms and conditions, other than the duration of the life insurance contracts; and
*   substantially the same assumptions for pricing their life risk.

**_Unearned premium reserve:_** The UPR, calculated at the end of the current year under section EY 26, is based on the amount of premiums received in the current year (or an earlier year) net of related New Zealand-sourced reinsurance premiums paid that relate to unexpired life risk components and relevant costs.

**_Premium smoothing reserve:_** The PSR in section EY 25 is designed to spread the recognition of premium income and tax over the duration of the level-term premium and single premium term policies. The PSR premium income should be calculated net of related New Zealand-sourced reinsurance premiums. The intent of the PSR is illustrated in diagram 1.

##### Diagram 1: Premium smoothing reserve

![Diagram 1 showing premium smoothing reserve](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/a/2aa96200417ff2068e8bff41caddaf4b/diagram1-page49-thumbnail.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203150&hash=60F3E3A196184DAAEFD4809BCB7098B0)

[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/9/e/9e569500417ff3e78e94ff41caddaf4b/diagram1-page49-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203150&hash=DB06AD33740E59BC475F81EA34B2E42D "This link will open a new window.")

The line in Diagram 1 representing the 'expected life risk proportion", defined in section EY 25(6), represents the amount that would be the annual renewable term equivalent of the level term policy.

The "expected life risk proportion" could be determined using profit margins in a similar manner to a margin on services release of profits, or by reference to the probability of death in the year compared with the probability of death over the PSR period.

##### _The outstanding claims reserve (OCR) – section EY 24_

The OCR is a reserve held by an insurance company to provide for the future liability of claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to the insurance company or not yet been settled.

The new rules provide that life insurers are able to claim a deduction for movements in the OCR on life insurance policies, similar to the tax treatment to general insurers who sell general insurance policies.

One aspect of allowing the deduction is that the future claims (that is, claims recognised in the current accounting period that will be paid out in a future period) are discounted to their present value. The legislation (section YA 1) uses the term "present value (gross)" and means a present value calculation using the risk-free rate of return as the discount rate, gross of tax. If the whole discount period is less than a year the face value of the claim is used.

An appropriate risk margin is added to the estimated and actual values of life risk claims incurred and reported. However, where the amount of the claim is already known the appropriate risk margin would be zero.

##### _**The capital guarantee reserve – section EY 27**_

The capital guarantee reserve (CGR) applies to non-participating policies, excluding annuities, that have guarantees of capital invested or guarantees of minimum returns on capital invested. The reserve is the amount provided by the shareholder to top up the policyholder’s future claim under the guarantee.

If a policy has a guaranteed minimum return, the reserve will typically be drawn upon to "top up" the amount credited to policyholders in time of poor investment performance. In times of good investment performance, a portion of the investment return will typically be added to the reserve to support future crediting rates. The legislation provides that movements in the reserve result in shareholder base income if there is an increase in the reserve and a shareholder base allowable deduction if there is a decrease in the reserve. These adjustments are reflected in the policyholder base, whereby any amount of shareholder income becomes a deduction in the policyholder base and any amount of shareholder deduction is income in the policyholder base.

Shareholder injections to support the capital guarantee, while rare, will have a revenue character for the shareholder base. Such guarantees when paid by the shareholder may have a capital character for individual policyholders and are therefore not subject to tax in the policyholder base. To be consistent, the loss that caused the depletion of capital is not deductible in the policyholder base.

Movements in the CGR representing shareholder payments for products guaranteeing a minimum return (investment guarantee) that is in excess of zero percent on capital invested are properly treated as revenue amounts in both the shareholder base and policyholder base.

##### _The policyholder base_

_**Sections CR 1, CX 55, DB 23, DR 1, EY 1, EY 2, EY 4, and EY 15 to EY 18 and section YA 1**_

The policyholder base will consist of investment income earned on behalf of policyholders, less expenses. The amount of investment income allocated to policyholders from the total life insurer investment income is calculated under section EY 15 for non-participating policies (including annuities), less allowable deductions under section EY 16, and under section EY 17 for participating policies (discussed under the heading "Participating policies"), less allowable deductions under section EY 18.

Consistent with the operation of the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules, changes to section CX 55 allow life insurers to exclude realised equity gains from New Zealand and listed Australian companies from tax on the policy holder base. The exclusion applies to the extent the amount is determined to be policyholder base income. A life insurer can also elect to register its fund of investment-linked products as a Life Fund PIE and attribute income to each policyholder at their portfolio investment rate; otherwise the income is taxed at 30%.

The policyholder base can carry forward unused tax deductions and these will not be subject to any continuity of shareholding rules. This is because the policyholder base is a proxy tax for each individual policyholder - thus changes of membership are not relevant. Surplus imputation credits can also be converted to deductions for the following income year. Policyholder net taxable investment income cannot be offset with losses or credits from the shareholder base, except in the case of transitional losses, which is discussed later in Part II of this item.

##### _Non participating policies including annuities_

_**Sections EY 2 to EY 4, EY 15, EY 16, EY 19, EY 20 and section YA 1**_

Section EY 15 prescribes the methods for determining what income is included in the policyholder base and provides bases of apportionment where investment income could be included in both the policyholder and shareholder bases. Section EY 16 contains mirror provisions for deductions to the policyholder base.

As a compliance simplification measure, when the life insurer has actuarially determined that the life risk is one percent or less of the premium or life reinsurance claim, it can choose to treat that amount as not relating to the life risk component, thereby including the entire premium effectively as the deposit of principal in respect of a policy (section EY 15(5)).

##### _Allocation of investment income under the new rules_

Investment income, and expenses and credits, have to be allocated to either the shareholder base or policyholder base, depending on whose benefit the investment income is derived. The new rules prescribe default methods of allocation, but allow the life insurer to use a different basis of apportionment if it is "actuarially determined" and is more equitable and reasonable. It is anticipated that many life insurers would apportion in a manner consistent with financial reporting where relevant.

The life insurer’s income from its life insurance business must be allocated to either the shareholder base or policyholder base. The allocation depends on whose benefit the income is derived. Section EY 1(2) provides that section EY 2 uses the taxable income in a life insurer’s policyholder base income and the life insurer’s policyholder base allowable deductions, to calculate its schedular policyholder base income. A life insurer’s schedular income derived by its life fund PIE is excluded from the schedular policyholder base income, along with deductions from that income.

Expenses allocated to life fund PIEs are recognised by section EY 2(6). These expenses are apportioned to the policyholder base, but excluded from schedular policyholder base income.

Section EY 4(1) provides a default basis of allocation for tax credits received. These amounts must be apportioned between the policyholder and shareholder bases in the same proportion as the policyholder base income. The same apportionment rules apply to shareholder base income. The section is intended to ensure imputation credits are allocated on actual policyholder base and shareholder base earnings.

The new rules also allow the life insurer to use a different basis of apportionment if it is "actuarially determined" and is more equitable and reasonable than the default basis.

##### _Participating policies_

_**Sections EY 17, EY 18, EY 21, EY 22, EY 28, EY 29 and YA 1**_

Specific rules deal with the treatment of income and expenditure arising from "profit participation policy" (as defined in section YA 1) business. A typical profit participation policy involves a group of members (policyholders) who pool their money together, generate income, self-insure (possibly with some outside reinsurance) and periodically formally increase their vested entitlement to the pool, usually by way of bonus allocations. Expenses associated with running the pool are met from within the pool.

"Profit participation policy" as defined:

1.  means a class of life insurance policy having
    1.  a segregated or identifiable asset base; and
    2.  policyholders who are entitled to a share of profits that is distributed to, or vested in, the policyholders from the asset base, and the policies provide for the entitlement; and
    3.  a fixed formula, expressed in terms of a proportion of a policyholder’s share of profits from the asset base, that calculates a transfer to the benefit of the life insurer’s shareholders from the profits of the asset base, and that fixed formula is consistently applied:
2.  includes a class of life insurance policy that substantially meets the requirements of paragraph (a) and that has a guarantee by the life insurer that capital invested will be returned or that a minimum return on capital will be paid, if-
    1.  the life insurer has irrevocably chosen that the class be treated as a profit participation policy; and
    2.  the Commissioner receives a notice of the election before the start of the first income year to which it relates.

Paragraph (a) (iii) refers to what is commonly referred to as the "gate". The definition implies that shareholders obtain a positive profit from distributions. It therefore does not include life insurance policies such as investment-linked products, where the shareholder obtains no proportion of the policyholder’s share of profits from the asset base.

The basis for taxing participating policies comprises the following:

*   Investment income _less_ expenditure plus other profit

The new rules are designed to apportion net investment income between policyholders and shareholders in a way that recognises that part of the investment income is connected with policy liabilities (regarded as belonging to the policyholders) and part is connected with the existing surpluses (regarded as a source of future bonuses). Policyholders should, however, not be taxed on any other sources of gains when they are derived by policyholders trading among themselves. Therefore, any "Other Profit" is included in the shareholder base.

Premiums for traditional participating business are not treated as income under the new rules as these are, in substance, principal amounts invested. Similarly, claims paid under these products are not deductible. Premiums or life reinsurance claims that are incidental or minor, and included under the policyholder base under section EY 15(5), are not subject to tax under the shareholder base.

##### _Treatment of income from disposal of investment shares - shareholder base_

If income includes gains from realised Australasian equity the taxation of these gains, to the extent that they are allocated to the shareholder base, will be determined by ordinary tax principles.

##### _Deductions and credits_

The policyholder base (section EY 18) and shareholder base (section EY 22) have allowable deductions for profit participation polices equal to what they would have had under the income allocation formulas if:

*   the life insurer is treated as having no assets other than the asset base; and
*   item asset base gross income is treated as being the annual total deduction for the policies’ asset base.

Imputation and other credits will be apportioned between the shareholder and policyholder bases using the same ratio.

##### _Taxation of participating policies sold before 30 June 2009 – separate rules_

For policies sold before 30 June 2009, the date the bill was reported back to Parliament by the Finance and Expenditure Committee, life insurers are taxed using a simplified formula:

*   Investment income _less_ Expenditure

This change was made at the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee as a means of simplifying the application of the rules to existing participating policies (including policies sold after 30 June 2009) as a result of conversion rights (for example, whole of life policies converting to endowment policies). The more complex formula which takes into account Other Profit for policies sold on and after 1 July 2009 is intended to protect against any potential manipulation of taxable income associated with future participating life contracts.

##### _Actuarial advice and guidance, "actuarially determined" and "best estimate assumptions"_

_**Sections EY 6 and YA 1**_

Some of the calculations and apportionment of amounts required by subpart EY, particularly in connection with reserves, uses actuarial determinations and judgement. The term "actuarially determined" is defined in section YA 1.

A new definition of "best estimate assumptions" has also been inserted to provide that these judgements are consistent with professional actuarial judgement and that the assumptions underlying these judgements are not deliberately overstated or understated.

Section EY 6 allows Inland Revenue to seek the advice of the Financial Markets Authority or any other actuary on matters that are required to be actuarially determined under the new rules.

There is no requirement for sign-off from actuaries under the new rules. However, all working papers, methodologies and related documentation may be asked for by the Commissioner under the general powers already contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994.

##### _Reinsurance_

_**Sections CW 59C, DR 3, EY 5(8) and EY 12**_

The definition of "life insurance" includes reinsurance (section EY 14(3)) unless the context requires otherwise. Therefore, all the new rules dealing with life insurance generally also apply to life reinsurance.

There are, however, specific references to life reinsurance when calculating deductions under the shareholder base from insurance premiums and claims, in calculating reserving amounts, and under the policyholder base for profit participation. Section EY 12 defines "life reinsurance" as a contract of insurance between a life insurer and another person (person C) under which the life insurer is secured, fully or partially, against a risk by person C.

The term does not include a contract that:

*   secures against financial risk unless, in the contract, it is incidental to securing against life risk; or
*   is, or is part of, a tax avoidance arrangement.

The words "fully" and "partially" describe the extent to which the life insurer is secured against life risk; they do not describe the term for which the reinsurance is provided.

Sections EY 12(2) and (3) describe the meaning of "full reinsurance" and "partial reinsurance". Such reinsurance is limited to those contracts where the life insurer offered or was offered or entered into the life reinsurance policy or policies in New Zealand. If a life reinsurance policy is not offered or entered into in New Zealand, a deduction for the policy’s life reinsurance premiums is denied under section DR 3 and the policy’s life reinsurance claims are treated as exempt income under section CW 59C .

This means that all references to the relevant life reinsurance amounts in any of the calculations in the Act exclude the policies that are not offered or entered into in New Zealand.

There are two further express exclusions from the definition of "life reinsurance" that are also relevant when calculating taxable income under the new rules:

*   general insurance, such as trauma insurance or non-life insurance policy riders such as total permanent disability benefits.
*   financial arrangements – to ensure practical consistency with the definition of "life insurance policy" (which means a policy which states the terms under which life insurance is covered).

These exclusions are required to ensure elements of a contract that do not themselves qualify as life reinsurance are excluded from the definition. However, Inland Revenue considers that reinsurance of events related to life insurance (for example, policy lapse) are not excluded. Accordingly, reinsurance of lapses of policies and discontinuance profit (or loss), which are connected to life insurance, are also "life reinsurance".

Table 1 shows the effect of reinsurance transactions on a life insurer’s taxable income.

#### Table 1: Effect of reinsurance on taxable income

| Transactions | Gross income |
| --- | --- |
| Reinsurance commissions of $500,000 received under a contract of reinsurance. The total amount relates to the risk components of the claims paid. | +$500,000 |
| Life insurance premium paid under a contract of reinsurance of $1,500,000. | –$1,500,000 |
| $600,000 received under a profit sharing arrangement in relation to a contract of reinsurance. | +$600,000 |
| $300,000 recovered as a refund of premiums paid under a contract of reinsurance. | +$300,000 |

##### _Life financial reinsurance_

Some types of reinsurance in substance focus more on capital management than on risk transfer, and section EY 12(5) excludes such arrangements from the definition of "life reinsurance". It does so by defining them as "life financial reinsurance".

Premiums for a reinsurance contract that is "life financial reinsurance" are non-deductible to the life insurer, and the investment income is brought to tax by the life insurer under the financial arrangement rules.

The life financial reinsurance rules look to the substance of an arrangement - in particular, whether the arrangement is a financing arrangement rather than reinsurance. Reinsurance - for example, should involve the transfer of insurance risk from the ceding insurer to the assuming insurer. A transfer of insurance risk may have taken place under a contract of reinsurance when it is reasonably possible that the assuming insurer may realise a loss from the contract; or be exposed to a range of potentially adverse outcomes under the contract.

##### _Non-residents - reinsurance_

Section EY 48 provides that the Income Tax Act 2007 applies to life insurance business carried on by a non-resident in connection with life insurance policies that are offered or entered into in New Zealand and life reinsurance policies that relate exclusively to those life insurance policies.

##### _Transfers of life insurance business_

Ordinary tax rules apply for transfers of life insurance business. However, section EY 5(4) prescribes that where a life insurer (the **transferor**) transfers life insurance business to another life insurer (the **transferee**), the transferor does a part-year calculation for each class of policy in the transferred business. The transferee also does a part-year calculation for the transferred policies.

The transferee’s relevant opening part-year reserve amounts under sections EY 23 to EY 27 equal the transferor’s relevant closing part-year reserve amounts. The transferee’s relevant opening part-year reserve amounts are adjusted by adding life reinsurance value to the transferee’s opening, and subtracting from the transferor’s closing. The part-year calculations do not create any part-year tax obligations.

#### Part II: Transition

##### _Grandparenting of term life products_

_**Sections EY 30 and EZ 53 to EZ 60 and section YA 1**_

_Overview of the transitional rules for term life products_

Section EY 30 ensures that only existing policies contracted under the previous tax rules are grandparented and subject to transitional rules for a period of up to five years. The application of the previous life rules are therefore preserved for term policies sold before the start of the new life insurance rules. The start date for the transitional rules (the grandparenting start date) will, for most life insurers, be 1 July 2010, unless the insurer elects an earlier date.

The five-year transition period is directed at annual renewable term policies (also known as yearly renewable term, or age-related term policies).

If the policy is a single premium, level premium or guaranteed premium, it can be grandparented for the life of the policy or for the period for which the premium is guaranteed. These periods can be longer than five years.

Life insurers can elect out of transitional rules at any time - see section EY 30(6).

Life insurance contracts that materially change in nature - for example, when the level of life insurance cover provided is increased, are considered to be new contracts. New contracts should not enjoy the benefits of the previous rules over the grandparenting period.

##### _Early grandparenting start date allowed_

If a life insurer elects to apply the new rules from the beginning of its income year - which includes 1 July 2010, it can also make a further election that grandparenting will apply to policies entered into before the beginning of the same income year. If it does not make this election, grandparenting will apply to policies entered into before 1 July 2010.

##### _Application of the grandparenting rules_

Life insurers can elect that the grandparenting rules apply to:

*   a product when it is "issued" (that is, the life insurer accepts the risk on the life of the individual); or
*   when the policy is applied for and a deposit is received in respect of the application.

In either case, the event must have occurred before the grandparenting start-date.

A "deposit" has its ordinary commercial meaning as being a payment in advance to support a commercial transaction. For example, a debit authority by itself would not meet the statutory tests in section EY 30(2).

If an application is made and the deposit is received before the grandparenting start-date and the policy is ultimately not accepted, it would not be subject to grandparenting in any case.

Eligibility for grandparenting applies on a policy by policy basis. The calculation of the adjustment and the opt-out is done on a class of policy basis.

##### _Special grandparenting rules for certain types of policies_

Special grandparenting rules apply to the class of policies listed below:

*   _**Single premium policies:**_ The previous taxation rules will effectively apply for the life of the policy. Section EY 30(5)(a) applies to policies where one premium is only ever payable for the life policy.
*   **_Level premium and guaranteed level premium policies_**_:_ The previous taxation rules will effectively apply for the longer of five years or the period for which the premium is guaranteed. Section EY 30(5)(b) applies to policies where the premium cannot be changed over the period  
    \- for example, $500 for each year over 15 years, or if the premium does not in fact change over the period.  
    Section EY 30(5) recognises the fact that although level term policies may, in some instances allow premiums to be changed at the insurer’s discretion, commercial constraints mean that the insurer does not increase the premium payable.
*   **_Group life master policies_**: Group life master policies are defined in section YA 1 as "a life insurance policy with multiple individuals’ life insurance cover grouped under it, if the group of individuals is identified in the policy and the general public are excluded". The previous taxation rules will apply to lives insured under these policies. Employer-sponsored policies and credit-card repayment insurance are excluded and have their own separate rules.
*   **_Employer sponsored group policy_**_:_ The previous life insurance rules will effectively apply to lives insured under employer-sponsored group life policies. Section EY 30(4)(d) requires that there is no savings element in the policy and that the substantive and material terms of the policy do not change on or after the grandparenting start-day. The guarantee period applies only to rates that are guaranteed at the time of application of the proposed life tax rules for a maximum of five years from the application date. Officials are continuing discussions with life insurers about the practical effect of these rules.
*   **_Credit card repayment insurance_**_:_ The previous life insurance rules will effectively apply to credit card repayment insurance (CCRI) policies that are master policies. The life cover for each life insured does not need to be in place before the grandparenting start-day. As the amount of cover provided by a CCRI policy fluctuates on a regular basis and, by month to month, the amount of cover could increase by a substantial percentage. The insurer has no control over these credit limit increases. Given the nature of CCRI policies, the 10 percent cover increase requirement to these policies is not applied. All CCRI policies therefore have grandparenting for five years from the application date.
*   **_Life reinsurance_**_:_ Life reinsurance is included in the definition of "group life master policy" in section EY 30(14). The effect of this provision is to look-through the reinsurance treaty for transition purposes so that the terms applying to the individual reinsured policy, as set out in the treaty, should determine the extent of transition rules applying for that policy. Section EZ 62 provides a special transition rule for life financial reinsurance contracts that are entered into before the date the life insurer applies the new rules for the first time. The maximum transition period for life financial reinsurance is the shorter period of the life of the contract or five years.

Table 2 summarises the operation of the grandparenting rules.

[**Table 2: Operation of grandparenting rules.**](/internet/ird/technical-tax/legislation/2009/2009-34/2009-34-taxation-act-2009/2009-34-life-insurance/leg-2009-34-table2-grandparenting-rules.html)

##### _When grandparenting ceases to apply_

Life policies sold before the grandparenting date will cease to be covered by the grandparenting rules if the policy is altered or modified in such a way that it is effectively a new policy. If the transitional rules cease to apply to a grandparented life policy, the new rules will have effect to that policy from the first day of the income year in which alteration or modification occurred.

There are, however, several situations when an event that creates a change or alteration will not result in the life policy being subject to the new rules:

*   **_Reinstated policies_**_:_ It is not uncommon for policies to lapse or be cancelled as a result of policyholders missing premium instalments. Under section EY 30(1)(a), policies entered into before the grandparenting application date but reinstated after that date continue to be subject to the transitional rules, provided that the reinstatements are made within 90 days of lapsing and that the insurer does not treat the reinstated policy as a new policy. The reinstated policy should have the same terms as the lapsed policy.
*   **_Replacement policy when the life insurer is sold_**_:_ A life policy that replaces an existing policy as a result of a life insurer being sold, or the life insurer selling its rights and obligations under the old policy, is treated as being issued at the same time as the old policy. The replacement policy is therefore subject to the transitional rules provided it has substantially the same term as the old policy – EY 30(1)(b).
*   **_Certain increases in life cover_**_:_ Grandparenting is not affected in situations when the amount of insured cover does not increase by an amount up to the greater of an annual CPI adjustment or 10 percent of the previous year’s amount – as described in section EY 30(2)(c). The date for considering if this threshold has been breached is determined by choosing the "cover review period". The "cover review period" starts on the first day of the life insurer’s income year, for a class of policies unless it has chosen an alternative date during the income year. The alternative date, once chosen, is irrevocable. If the insured cover is breached under this rule, the class of policies is subject to full taxation under the new rules from the beginning of the income year in which the breach occurs, irrespective of the day of the actual breach.

##### _Calculation of transition adjustment for grandparented life polices_

Grandparented policies are taxed under the new rules but are allowed a deduction equal to the amount calculated under the expected death strain formula (life) in accordance with sections EZ 53 to EZ 60 (which relate to the transitional adjustment for expected death strain) for the income year.

##### _Tax losses carried into the new rules_

_**Sections EZ 61, IT 1 and IT 2**_

Under the old rules, a life insurer may have losses carried forward from either or both the life office base and policyholder base. The new rules provide that the only life office base loss is carried forward into the new tax rules as it better reflects the income of the entire life insurance business.

For life insurers with a 30 June balance date, or for taxpayers with other balance dates that elect to enter into the new rules on the first day of the income year that includes 1 July 2010, the new rules allow the existing life office base loss at the end of their income year ending 30 June 2009 to be available for carry-forward and allocated as a shareholder base loss. The loss can be offset with the life insurer’s income (including, by way of election, policyholder base income subject to limitations as discussed below) and group company losses, subject to ordinary continuity and grouping rules.

Section EZ 61 effectively provides, on an annual basis, that the life office base loss carried forward is first applied against shareholder base income and any excess, up to the value of any base concession amount not yet used, can be elected to be deducted against any policyholder base income. The base concession amount is determined under section EZ 61 on entry into the new rules, and is the lower of the life office base loss carried forward and the policyholder base loss cancelled under section IT 1. The base concession amount is used up by election to be a policyholder base deduction amount.

Example 2, illustrates the use of tax losses under the previous rules that are carried into the new rules under section EZ 61.

##### _Deemed sale_

_**Section EZ 63**_

The previous life insurance rules provided that investment income in the life office base was calculated under ordinary rules, with some gains and losses being accounted for as taxable income when realised. Under the policyholder base, the reserve calculations had the effect of recognising changes in the value of investments on an unrealised basis. The effect of these rules had the potential to create timing differences when recognising income between the two bases. 

To remove this difference, the new rules provide that investments taken into account in determining policyholder reserves for the policyholder base calculation under section EY 2 are treated as having been sold and reacquired at market value on entry into the new rules.

For investments in a PIE, that is not a "listed PIE" (as defined), the deemed disposal rule does not apply - section EZ 63(3).

##### _Transitional year and end of transitional adjustments_

_**Section EY 5**_

If a life insurer has a balance date other than 30 June and has not elected an early adoption of the new rules, the life insurer does part-year tax calculations for the income year bisected by 1 July 2010. The addition of the two calculations forms the assessment of tax for that income year.

#### [Example 2: Carry-forward of losses into the new rules](/internet/ird/technical-tax/legislation/2009/2009-34/2009-34-taxation-act-2009/2009-34-life-insurance/leg-2009-34-eg2-carry-forward-losses.html)

The following [example](/internet/ird/technical-tax/legislation/2009/2009-34/2009-34-taxation-act-2009/2009-34-life-insurance/leg-2009-34-eg2-carry-forward-losses.html)
 illustrates a typical tax calculation of a life insurer with a balance date of 30 June for the first income year under the new life rules. The life insurer has a range of products such as non-participating policies including annuities and capital guaranteed investment policies, participating policies, annuities, international shares, Australasian shares, PIE investments and a life fund PIE.

This illustration is intended to assist life insurers to interpret the new life rules and meet their compliance obligations by providing a suggested format for reconciliation of taxable income to the life insurer’s statutory accounts. It does not take into account all possible fact patterns and situations that could arise for a life insurer or reinsurer.

1 A frequently used way of describing life products is whether they are participating or non-participating policies. A participating policy (also known as a "with profit policy") is a policy entitled to participate in distributions of profit - as most of life and endowment policies are. Conversely, a non-participating policy (also known as "without-profit policy") does not participate in distributions of profit, examples being term life insurance and most unit-linked policies.

Taxation of outbound dividends
==============================

2009 changes to the taxation of dividends paid to non-residents, affecting the supplementary dividend regime and the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules.

_**Subpart IV and sections LP 1, LP 2, LP 7 to LP 10, RF 9, RF 11B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007**_

New rules have been introduced for dividends paid by New Zealand companies to non-resident shareholders.

### Background

Various changes have been made to the rules concerning the taxation of dividends paid to non-residents. These changes affect the supplementary dividend regime and the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules.

Tax treaties signed with Australia, Singapore and the United States in 2008 and 2009 provided the catalyst for these domestic law changes. The new treaties reduce the rate of New Zealand tax that can be imposed on non-portfolio dividends paid to non-residents from 15% to either 5% or zero, depending on the size of the shareholder's stake in the company paying the dividend, and certain other criteria. There is no zero rate under the Singapore treaty.

### Key features

The supplementary dividend rules in subpart LP have been amended. From 1 February 2010, credits will no longer be available for supplementary dividends paid to non-residents in respect of non-portfolio interests in New Zealand companies, nor if the rate of tax applicable to the dividend is less than 15%.

Effective from the same date, a zero rate of NRWT has been introduced for non-portfolio dividends paid to non-residents, and for other outbound dividends for which the applicable rate of tax would otherwise be less than 15%. This zero rate applies to the extent the dividends are imputed.

From 1 April 2011, credits under subpart LP will cease to be available for distributions to supplementary dividend holding companies. Provisions supporting the supplementary dividend holding company regime are fully repealed for the 2013-14 and later income years.

### Application dates

Various application dates are relevant to these changes. These are outlined above and discussed in more detail below.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Changes to the supplementary dividend rules_

The rules concerning credits for supplementary dividends are set out in subpart LP. Section LP 2 provides that, when a resident company pays a dividend and a related supplementary dividend to either a non-resident or a supplementary dividend holding company, it qualifies for a tax credit calculated under the formula in subsection (2).

##### _Distributions to non-residents_

Section LP 2(1)(a) deals with distributions to non-residents. It has been amended so that a credit is only available for a dividend and related supplementary dividend paid by a company to a non-resident if the non-resident has less than a 10% direct voting interest in the company and the rate of tax applicable to the dividend is 15% or more. This change applies from 1 February 2010.

The requirement in section LP 2(1)(a)(ii) that the rate of tax payable on the dividend must be at least 15% will ensure that credits under this subpart are also unavailable for dividends and related supplementary dividends paid to non-resident portfolio investors if a lower rate of tax applies. For example, under Article 10(4) of the new double tax agreement with Australia, dividends paid on portfolio interests held by a Contracting State, political subdivision or local authority will be exempt from source taxation.

##### _Distributions to supplementary dividend holding companies_

Section LP 2(1)(b) deals with distributions to supplementary dividend holding companies. It has been repealed, along with subpart IV, sections LP 1(2), LP 2(4) to (6) and sections LP 7 to LP 10, which make further provision for such holding companies. Consequential amendments have been made to sections LP 2(2) and YA 1.

The repeal of section LP 2(1)(b) applies from 1 April 2011, as do the related repeals of sections LP 1(2), LP 2(5) and (6), and the amendments to sections LP 2(2) and YA 1. It will therefore be possible to continue to claim credits for dividends and supplementary dividends paid to holding companies for a limited period after these credits cease to be available for distributions to non-residents.

This delayed application allows time for distributions to be paid up through a chain of holding companies and on to non-resident investors. It is intended to deal with the possibility that a lower-tier holding company has already received a dividend and a supplementary dividend before 1 February 2010 without having made a corresponding distribution by that date. Delaying the repeal of section LP 2(1)(b) and related provisions ensures that a higher-tier holding company can continue to receive supplementary dividends and correspondingly adjusted imputation credits, and therefore have a tax liability against which to claim a credit under subpart LP when making a distribution to a portfolio investor.

Note that, under section YA 1, a supplementary dividend holding company must have an ongoing purpose of enabling the payment of a supplementary dividend to a non-resident. Supplementary dividends will not be payable to non-residents for non-portfolio holdings after 1 February 2010. Accordingly, we would not expect supplementary dividend holding companies to be maintained beyond 1 February 2010, except when it is necessary to enable payment of supplementary dividends to non-resident portfolio investors. Holding company structures typically involve non-portfolio interests.

Other provisions relating to supplementary dividend holding companies will be left in place until they are no longer required. Accordingly, the repeal of subpart IV, section LP 2(4), and sections LP 7 to LP 10, and the related amendment to section YA 1, do not apply until the 2013-14 income year.

##### _Remedial amendment to section LP 8(2)_

The formula in section LP 8(2) has been amended, with effect for the 2008-09 and later income years (up to repeal). This corrects an unintended change made when the Income Tax Act 2007 replaced its predecessor.

The formula in section LP 8(2) specifies how the taxable income of a holding company is to be determined. Before its amendment, the section specified a lower amount of taxable income - and therefore liability to tax - than was needed to allow the holding company to use in full the credit it became entitled to when it paid a supplementary dividend. Under the Income Tax Act 2004, the missing income was brought into account by section LE 3(8), which provided that a supplementary dividend received by the holding company was not exempt income under section CW 10.

Section LE 3(6) of the Income Tax Act 2004 specified the amount of a dividend that was to be treated as exempt income (if any), while section LE 3(8) provided that the supplementary dividend was not exempt income. The Income Tax Act 2007 takes a different approach, with section LP 8(2) simply prescribing the amount of taxable income a holding company derives. It is therefore appropriate to correct the formula in section LP 8(2), rather than resurrect section LE 3(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004.

#### _Changes to the NRWT rules_

NRWT is imposed under subpart RF. New section RF 11B has been introduced, with a consequential amendment to section RF 9. These changes apply from 1 February 2010.

The effect of these amendments is to apply a zero rate of NRWT to dividends paid by a company to a non-resident that either has a direct voting interest in the company of 10% or more or (section RF 11B aside) would be subject to tax on the dividend at a rate below 15%. The zero rate applies to the extent the dividend is imputed, with this to be determined under section RF 9.

New section RF 11B is the corollary to the amendments to section LP 2 discussed above. If a dividend paid to a non-resident is outside the scope of section LP 2(1)(a) (as amended), either because it relates to a direct voting interest of 10% or more, or because it is taxed at a rate below 15%, then, to the extent the dividend is imputed, it becomes eligible for a zero rate of NRWT under subpart RF.

Taxation of share-lending transactions
======================================

2006 amendments give greater consistency to the treatment of share-lending transactions with that of other commercial transactions such as finance leases.

### Sections CD 9, CD 10B, CD 10C, CD 43, CH 1, CX 44B, DB 12B, DB 12C, DB 40, EA 1, ED 1, ED 2, EW 5, EW 52B, GC 14F, GC 14S, GD 1, LB 2, LD 3, LD 8, LD 9, ME 4, ME 5, ME 6B, ME 11, ME 12, MG 4, MG 5, MG 14, MG 15, NF 1, NF 2, NF 2A, NF 2B, NF 2D, NF 3, NF 4, NF 8B, OD 8, Schedule 14 and a number of definitions in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections 30B and 30C of the Tax Administration Act 1994

The tax treatment of share-lending transactions has been clarified and reformed by:

*   introducing specific share-lending rules to allow the taxation of "qualifying" share-lending transactions on the basis of economic substance; and
*   strengthening the tax rules to ensure that nonqualifying share-lending transactions do not give rise to an unintended fiscal cost.

These changes give greater consistency to the tax treatment of share-lending transactions with the treatment of other commercial transactions such as finance leases and hire-purchase agreements. The amendments also give taxpayers more certainty about how these transactions are taxed. Finally, the changes protect the tax base by preventing taxpayers from using sharelending transactions to effectively transfer the receipt of imputation credits to gain a tax advantage.

### Background

Share-lending involves the lending of shares to another party for a fee and allows brokers to transact in securities in which they have a shortfall. Share-lending also provides a relatively risk-free way for larger holders of shares, such as banks, insurance companies and funds managers, to increase their overall portfolio returns. Internationally, share-lending represents a substantial part of the daily settlement value in many transaction systems and can play an important role in facilitating market liquidity.

Historically, New Zealand has not had an onshore share-lending market, at least in part because of the tax treatment of these transactions. New Zealand, unlike many other jurisdictions, did not have special tax rules for share-lending. For New Zealand tax purposes, these transactions were taxed on the basis of legal form (a sale of shares) rather than economic substance (a loan), meaning that entering into a share-lending transaction was a taxable event.

The previous New Zealand tax treatment of share-lending transactions was out of line with international trends. It was inconsistent with the treatment of other commercial transactions and the economic and accounting treatment of share-lending transactions. There were also base maintenance concerns, with evidence that share-lending transactions were being used to effectively transfer the receipt of imputation credits and take advantage of the absence of specific tax rules in this area in New Zealand.

The changes to the tax treatment of share-lending were set out in the government discussion document, Taxing securities lending transactions: substance over form, released in November 2004.

### Key features

The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 introduce share-lending rules to tax "qualifying" share-lending transactions on the basis of economic substance rather than legal form. They also strengthen the imputation rules to ensure that non-qualifying share-lending transactions do not give rise to a fiscal cost.

![This diagram shows the proportion of scope of the share-lending rules.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/6/565f0d804ba377479ba0bf9ef8e4b077/tib-vol18-5-share-lend-arrange.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214536&hash=844E76EDB0527822ABE06BCA9D0E23C3)

The new rules revolve around the definition of a returning share transfer.

A returning share transfer is an arrangement:

*   when a share (the original share) is transferred from a share supplier to a share user;
*   when the original share is listed on an official list of a recognised exchange;
*   where it is conditionally or unconditionally agreed that the share user (or associate) will pay a replacement payment to the share supplier (or associate) if a dividend is payable on the original share; and
*   where it is conditionally or unconditionally agreed that the original share or an identical share may be transferred from the share user to the share supplier (or associate); and
*   that is not a warrant or instalment receipt.

Returning share transfers which meet a number of criteria (known as share-lending arrangements) will be taxed on the basis of their economic substance rather than legal form. This means that they will not be treated as a taxable disposal.

A "share-lending arrangement" is defined as a returning share transfer entered into on or after 1 July 2006 where:

*   the agreed term of the transaction is one year or less;
*   the terms are ordinary commercial conditions which are consistent with those that would apply between parties negotiating at arm's-length;
*   the amount of resident withholding tax required under section NF 2(1)(g), if any, is paid;
*   the share user disposes of an original share or an identical share to the share supplier during the agreed term of the arrangement, or within a further period allowed by the Commissioner; and
*   the share user issues a credit transfer notice in relation to the dividend paid on the original share or establishes and maintains an imputation credit account (ICA) if a dividend is payable on the original share.

An identical share is a share that confers the same rights and imposes the same obligations on the holder as the original share.

A share supplier is a person described as such in the definition of a returning share transfer, from whom the share user acquires an original share under a returning share transfer.

A share user is a person described as such in the definition of a returning share transfer, who acquires an original share under a returning share transfer.

For the purposes of the share-lending rules, the definition of "associated person" is contained in section OD 8(3).

#### Treatment of returning share transfers which are not share-lending arrangements

The second key part of the share-lending rules is the introduction of new imputation rules. The share-lending rules are designed to ensure that imputation credits remain with the economic owner of the shares. However, because the rules only apply to qualifying transactions, taxpayers could structure transactions outside the qualification criteria in order to gain a tax advantage. Therefore amendments to the imputation rules have been made to bolster the share-lending rules.

The rules governing the treatment of returning share transfers are designed to complement existing antiavoidance provisions. They apply when a share user (or associate) receives imputation credits attached to a dividend as part of a returning share transfer that is not a tax benefit obtained will be cancelled by a debit to the ICA account of the share user. The share user is not allowed a credit of tax for the imputation credit. In addition, a transfer of shares under a returning share transfer which is not a share-lending arrangement will still be treated as a disposal for tax purposes.

### Application date

The share-lending amendments apply from 1 July 2006.

#### Detailed analysis

A number of changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2004.

#### Structure of the new rules

One of the aims of the share-lending rules is to tax these transactions like loans. To achieve this, a number of existing provisions have been "switched off" as illustrated in the following diagrams.

![Diagram showing the relationship between share supplier, share user and 3rd party purchaser.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/a/6/a63dd4804ba377479badbf9ef8e4b077/tib-vol18-5-borrow-share-to-3rd-party.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214535&hash=22D3629CD3585477C4A99515A1F1F0D9)  
![Diagram showing the relationship between share supplier and share user.](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/f/8/f87ef5804ba377479bbabf9ef8e4b077/tib-vol18-5-borrow-share-back-supplier.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214537&hash=395C730F5AC7190A14CED42F6179E061)

Under new section CX 44B, any share-lending collateral derived by a person under a share-lending arrangement will be excluded income. This covers any consideration received by the share supplier on lending the shares or by the share user on returning the original or an identical share.

Share-lending collateral is defined as an amount (or an adjustment to an amount) that is related to the market value of the original share under a share-lending arrangement and is paid to a person by a share user (or associate) to secure the transfer of the original share or by a share supplier (or associate) for the re-transfer of the original or an identical share. It does not include any amount of replacement payment. What is market value should be determined using normal commercial practice.

**Example 1**  
  
The Kiwi Unit Trust (KiwiTrust) holds a number of Greenstone Limited shares in its portfolio. These were purchased at a cost of $2 per share and are listed on the New Zealand stock exchange. On 1 July 2006, KiwiTrust lends 1,000 Greenstone Limited shares to NZ Broker Limited on normal commercial terms.  
  
NZ Broker Limited agrees to pay a cash lending fee and a compensation payment (or replacement payment) to KiwiTrust if any dividend is payable on Greenstone Limited shares over the term of the lending arrangement. As part of agreeing to make the compensation payment, NZ Broker Limited agrees to either transfer imputation credits or pay any resident withholding tax required. Legal title in the Greenstone Limited shares is transferred to NZ Broker Limited and it is agreed that identical Greenstone Limited shares will be transferred back to KiwiTrust in 30 days' time. KiwiTrust maintains an imputation credit account.  
  
The above transaction meets the definition of a returning share transfer and a share-lending arrangement.  
  
At the time of entering into the lending agreement, the market price for Greenstone Limited shares was $5 and NZ Broker Limited transferred $5,000 to KiwiTrust as collateral for borrowing the shares.  
  
The $5,000 payment meets the definition of sharelending collateral as it is based on the market value of the shares lent and was paid by NZ Broker Limited to secure the transfer of the Greenstone Limited shares under the lending arrangement. Under section CX 44B, the $5,000 received from NZ Broker Limited will be excluded income for KiwiTrust.

**Example 2**  
  
KiwiTrust lends a further 1,000 Greenstone Limited shares to NZ Broker Limited. At the time of entering into the lending agreement, the market price for Greenstone Limited shares was $5 and the broker transfers Weka Company Limited shares with an equivalent value to KiwiTrust as collateral for borrowing the Greenstone Limited shares.  
  
The Weka Company Limited shares meet the definition of share-lending collateral. Under section CX 44B, the value of the Weka Company Limited shares received from NZ Broker Limited will be excluded income for KiwiTrust.

If no collateral is paid for borrowing a share, then there will be no amount treated as income on the lending or returning of shares under a share-lending arrangement. This is because a share-lending arrangement is an excepted financial arrangement (refer to section EW 5(11B)). The lowest price clause which would otherwise apply to tax the market value of the borrowed share does not apply to shares under a share-lending arrangement. The same is true for sections GD 1 (Sale or other disposition of trading stock for inadequate consideration) and ED 2 (Transfers of certain excepted financial arrangements within wholly-owned groups), which can operate to tax a deemed market value and which do not apply to share-lending arrangements.

A question arises as to the impact of share-lending on the general tax status of an investor's shareholding. Under the disposal and dealing in property sections (sections CB 3 and 4), an amount is income if the property was acquired for the purpose of disposal. If property is acquired for more than one purpose, income will only be taxable if the purpose of resale was the dominant purpose, as determined at the time of acquisition. For these sections, each item of personal property must be looked at separately (each individual share transaction) and not on a global basis. Therefore, the fact that certain shares have been lent should not impact on the taxable status of other shares in the same portfolio. Determining whether a person is carrying on a business of share-trading is a more difficult analysis and will depend on the facts of the particular situation. This could include other transactions within the person's share portfolio.

#### Treatment of borrowed shares

As a share-lending transaction is legally a disposal of shares, tax adjustments would normally result through the operation of the revenue account property rules. A number of adjustments have therefore been made to these rules to treat a share-lending transaction as a loan.

##### Lending the shares

Section CH 1 has been amended to ensure that entering into a share-lending arrangement does not result in a tax adjustment from a change in the value of excepted financial arrangements "on hand". When a share supplier enters into a share-lending arrangement the lending of the shares (a disposal) would normally result in a reduction in the closing value of excepted financial arrangements and a net tax deduction for the cost of the shares.

This has been countered by allowing the share supplier to include in the closing value of excepted financial arrangements the value of a share-lending right.

A share-lending right is defined to mean a conditional or unconditional right to acquire an original share or an identical share under a share-lending arrangement. Section ED 1 provides that a share-lending right is valued at the cost of the original share. This ensures that there is no movement in the value of revenue account property.

Section DB 40 has been similarly amended to include the value of a share-lending right in the opening value of excepted financial arrangements and section EA 1 has been amended to include a share-lending right in the transactions covered by the revenue account property matching rules.

**Example 3**  
  
KiwiTrust enters into a share-lending arrangement on 15 March 2007 to lend 5,000 NZ Fern Limited shares to NZ Broker Limited for one month. The shares cost $2.00 each and have a current market price of $4.00 per share. KiwiTrust has a 31 March balance date.  
  
Because the lending transaction is a legal disposal, the value of the NZ Fern Limited shares ($10,000) will no longer be included in the closing value of excepted financial arrangements at 31 March 2007. However, as KiwiTrust has a right to acquire NZ Fern Limited shares, KiwiTrust will include the closing value of a share-lending right in income. Section ED 1 provides that the share-lending right is valued at the cost of the original shares ($10,000). This ensures that there is no movement in the closing value of excepted financial arrangements which would otherwise result in a tax adjustment.  
  
The share-lending right is also included in the opening value of excepted financial arrangements for the 2007-08 income year, with KiwiTrust able to take a deduction for the value of the share-lending right at 31 March 2007, being $10,000.

##### Borrowing the shares

The share user is not allowed a tax deduction for the cost of acquiring the borrowed share as new section DB 12B prohibits a tax deduction for any amount of collateral paid in exchange for the share. This is consistent with the fact that the share user will not be taxed when they return the shares. New section DB 12B overrides the general permission for a tax deduction and sections DB 17 to DB 19.

**Example 4**  
  
As part of entering the share-lending arrangement with KiwiTrust, NZ Broker Limited transfers $20,000 cash to KiwiTrust as collateral for borrowing the shares. No tax deduction is permitted for this amount as section DB 12B prohibits a tax deduction for any amount of collateral paid in exchange for the borrowed shares. This overrides any tax deduction that would generally be permitted.  
  
This would also be the position if no collateral was provided. The borrowed shares have no cost so no tax deduction would be available. This is because the transaction is an excepted financial arrangement. The lowest price clause which would otherwise apply a market value to the shares does not apply. Similarly, no deemed purchase price arises under sections GD 1 or ED 2, as these do not apply to share-lending arrangements.

**Example 5**  
  
Instead of transferring cash to KiwiTrust, NZ Broker Limited transfers $20,000 of Weka Company Limited shares to KiwiTrust as collateral for borrowing the shares. No tax deduction is permitted for this amount as section DB 12B prohibits a tax deduction for any amount of collateral paid in exchange for the borrowed shares.

##### Returning the shares

If the share user purchases an identical share to return to the share supplier, a tax deduction will be available under the ordinary provisions.

**Example 6**  
  
On 15 April 2007, NZ Broker Limited purchases NZ Fern Limited shares on the share market at $3.80 per share to return to KiwiTrust.  
  
As the shares will produce excluded income when they are returned, they will qualify as revenue account property. Therefore, a tax deduction should be available under section DB 17 for the cost of the shares ($19,000 in total).

##### Reacquiring the shares

The share-lending right disappears once a share supplier has received either the original share or an identical share. No tax deduction is allowed for any amount of collateral paid in exchange for the returning share (new section DB 12B). However, as excepted financial arrangements, the original share or identical share will be automatically included in the opening and closing value of revenue account property. Under section ED 1 they will be valued at the cost of the original share immediately before the share supplier entered the share-lending arrangement. This ensures that there is no movement in the value of revenue account property.

**Example 7**  
  
On 15 April 2007, KiwiTrust receives 5,000 NZ Fern Limited shares back from NZ Broker Limited. The current market price for the shares is $3.80. KiwiTrust returns the collateral of $20,000 less the agreed lending fee.  
  
As KiwiTrust no longer has a right to receive NZ Fern Limited shares, the share-lending right ceases to exist. KiwiTrust is not allowed a tax deduction for the net amount of collateral returned to NZ Broker Limited (section DB 12B).  
  
The NZ Fern Limited shares will be included in the closing value of excepted financial arrangements. Under section ED 1 they will be valued at the cost of the original share immediately before the share supplier entered the share-lending arrangement ($10,000). This ensures that there is no movement in the value of revenue account property.  
  
The lending fee will be income under ordinary rules for KiwiTrust.

New section EW 52B has been inserted to ensure that any movement in the value of shares over the term of a share-lending arrangement is not "picked up" under the financial arrangement rules.

It should also be noted that the values used for revenue account property for tax purposes may differ from those adopted for accounting purposes.

#### Treatment of distributions

##### Income and deductions

If a distribution is paid on the original share during the term of the share-lending arrangement, the share supplier must receive a "replacement payment" from the share user. The aim of the replacement payment is to place the share supplier in the same position (as far as possible) as if they had received the actual distribution. The entity which issued the shares and any third-party purchaser of the shares should not be affected by the tax treatment of the share-lending arrangement.

A replacement payment is a payment economically equivalent to a dividend or part of a dividend for an original share. It is increased by the value of any imputation credits attached to the dividend. The new share-lending rules do not specify the level of cash payment to be made as a replacement payment. However, if a share user chooses to make a $100 cash replacement payment in respect of a $100 underlying dividend (rather than $67 plus the $33 of imputation credits) the level of resident withholding tax that may be payable will reflect the higher cash payment.

Under new section CD 43 the amount of any replacement payment derived is income of the recipient. A person who pays a replacement payment is allowed a tax deduction under new section DB 12C for the amount of expenditure incurred as a replacement payment under a share-lending arrangement. The deduction includes the amount of any imputation credits attached to the replacement payment under new sections ME 6B or NF 8B.

Share users who pay a replacement payment are required to provide a statement to share suppliers similar to a dividend statement. The requirements for the statement are set out in new section 30B of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

**Example 8**  
  
During the term of the share-lending agreement entered into by KiwiTrust, a dividend of 10 cents per share is paid on the NZ Fern Limited shares. The dividend is fully imputed. NZ Broker Limited makes a compensation payment of $500 to KiwiTrust. Imputation credits of $246.27 are deemed to be attached as a result of resident withholding tax paid by NZ Broker Limited (as they do not attach the underlying imputation credits). The total value of the replacement payment is $746.27. Under section CD 43, this is income to KiwiTrust who is able to use the imputation credits in the normal way.  
  
NZ Broker Limited is allowed a tax deduction for the total cost of the replacement payment ($746.27). NZ Broker Limited must also provide KiwiTrust with a statement setting out details of the replacement payment including imputation credits under section NF 8B.

The definition of "pay" for a replacement payment (and share-lending collateral) has been amended to include distribution, crediting or dealing with on the recipient's behalf. The definition of payment has been similarly amended. Therefore, when payments are netted together - for example, through being credited against another amount - the share-lending rules will apply to the gross payments.

##### Imputation credits

The share-lending rules aim to keep any imputation credits with the economic owner of the share, being the share supplier. This is achieved by transferring imputation credits to the share supplier and denying the share user a credit of tax under section LB 2.

A share user is required to maintain an ICA in order to attach imputation credits to replacement payments where a dividend is paid on the original share over the term of the lending transaction. This is unless they issue a credit transfer notice.

The share user can fund replacement payment imputation credits either out of imputation credits received on the underlying dividend (new section ME 6B), or when they have not received sufficient imputation credits, by paying resident withholding tax (new section NF 8B).

Imputation credits can also be transferred using the voluntary tax credit transfer system (without the need to maintain an ICA). This is based on the Australian system whereby relevant imputation credits are derived by the share supplier if the share user and share supplier notify Inland Revenue of the share-lending arrangement.

A credit transfer notice is a notice issued under section 30C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. New section 30C allows a share user to issue a credit transfer notice under a share-lending arrangement when a dividend is paid on an original share. Such a notice can be issued by the share user only when they have received the underlying dividend.

A credit transfer notice must:

*   be in a form approved by the Commissioner;
*   show the amount of imputation credits attached to the dividend;
*   state that the imputation credit is to be transferred to the share supplier;
*   attach a copy of the shareholder dividend statement for the dividend; and
*   be given to the share supplier and the Commissioner when the dividend is paid or as soon as possible thereafter.

Any imputation credit transferred under a credit transfer notice is excluded from the taxable income of a share user (new section CD 10B). Instead, the amount of the imputation credit is income of the share supplier. This overrides the general rule in section CD 9 (Tax credits linked to dividends). A taxpayer who is issued with a credit transfer notice is also entitled to a credit of tax equal to the amount of the imputation credit shown in the notice.

**Example 9**  
  
KiwiTrust lends Koru Corporation shares to a resident share user (borrower). During the period of the lending arrangement, a $100 fully imputed dividend is paid on the shares. At the time of payment, the shares are still held by the share user. The share user makes a cash replacement payment of $100 to KiwiTrust and elects to transfer the $49.25 of imputation credits using a credit transfer notice.  
  
The imputation credits are excluded from the share user's taxable income (section CD 10B). Instead, the $49.25 of imputation credits is income of KiwiTrust. KiwiTrust is also entitled to a credit of tax equal to the amount of the imputation credit shown in the notice.

**Example 10**  
  
KiwiTrust lends Koru Corporation shares to a nonresident share user (borrower). During the period of the lending arrangement, a $100 fully imputed dividend is paid on the shares. At the time of payment, the shares are still held by the share user. The share user receives an ordinary dividend of $100, supplementary dividend of $17.64 and imputation credits of $31.61. The share user makes a cash replacement payment of $117.64 to KiwiTrust and elects to transfer the $31.61 of imputation credits using a credit transfer notice.  
  
The $31.61 of imputation credits is income of the KiwiTrust. KiwiTrust is also entitled to a credit of tax equal to the amount of the imputation credit shown in the notice.

##### Imputation credit account

A number of amendments have been made to the imputation rules to reflect the fact that the share-lending rules keep any tax credits with the economic owner of the share, being the share supplier.

Imputation credits received by a share supplier on a replacement payment are subject to the same treatment as normal imputation credits. An amendment has therefore been made to section ME 4 to allow imputation credits attached to a replacement payment (either from being passed on under new section ME 6B or from the share user paying resident withholding tax under new section NF 8B) to be entered into a share supplier's ICA. A credit will also arise if a person has been issued with a credit transfer notice transferring imputation credits.

For imputation credits arising under new sections ME 6B or NF 8B, the credit arises on the date that the replacement payment is paid. For credits transferred using a credit transfer notice, the credit arises on the date that the credit transfer notice is issued.

There are also new debit imputation entries. Under section ME 5, a debit must now be recorded in a share user's ICA if they have attached imputation credits to a replacement payment under new section ME 6B, transferred imputation credits using a credit transfer notice or received imputation credits on shares borrowed under a returning share transfer that is not a share-lending arrangement.

Debits arising from to a credit transfer notice or as a result of the returning share transfer anti-avoidance rules (discussed below), arise on the date that the relevant dividend is paid. Debits arising under new section ME 6B, arise on the date that the replacement payment is paid.

The changes for individual ICAs are replicated in the consolidated ICA rules.

**Example 11**  
  
KiwiTrust lends 1,000 Black Limited shares to NZ Broker Limited. A $100 fully imputed dividend is paid on the shares, held at that time by NZ Broker Limited.  
  
NZ Broker Limited makes a cash contribution payment of $100 to KiwiTrust and attaches $49.25 of imputation credits to the replacement payment under section ME 6B. It records a credit in its ICA for $49.25, being the imputation credits attached to the dividend received. A corresponding debit for $49.25 will be recorded, on the date that the replacement payment is paid, for the imputation credits attached to the replacement payment. NZ Broker Limited does not receive a credit of tax for the imputation credits as they are a share user under a returning share transfer (section LB 2(1B)). Instead, NZ Broker Limited claims a tax deduction for the replacement payment, including the imputation credits (section DB 12C).  
  
KiwiTrust will record a credit in its ICA on the day that the replacement payment is paid for $49.25, being the imputation credits attached to the replacement payment. The replacement payment, including the imputation credits, is income to KiwiTrust under section CD 43. Under section LB 2, as the imputation credit is included in KiwiTrust's assessable income, a credit of tax is allowed for imputation credits attached to the replacement payment.

**Example 12**  
  
KiwiTrust also lends 1,000 Rimu Corporation shares to NZ Broker Limited. During the period of the lending arrangement, a $100 fully imputed dividend is paid on the shares. At the time of payment, the shares are no longer held by NZ Broker Limited as they have been sold to a third party. NZ Broker Limited makes a cash contribution payment of $100 to KiwiTrust. As NZ Broker Limited did not receive the underlying dividend, it cannot transfer imputation credits under section ME 6B or use a credit transfer notice. Instead, NZ Broker Limited is required to pay resident withholding tax of $49.25 as calculated under section NF 2(1). This resident withholding tax converts to imputation credits of $49.25 under section NF 8B.  
  
NZ Broker Limited claims a tax deduction for the replacement payment, including the imputation credits (section DB 12C).  
  
KiwiTrust will record a credit in its ICA for $49.25 on the day that the replacement payment is paid, being the imputation credits attached to the replacement payment under section NF 8B. The replacement payment, including the imputation credits, is income to KiwiTrust under section CD 43. Under section LB 2(1), as the imputation credit is included in KiwiTrust's assessable income, a credit of tax is allowed for the $49.25 of imputation credits attached to the replacement payment. No credit of tax is available for the resident withholding tax as section LD 3 does not apply to replacement payments.

##### Dividend withholding payment credits

To a lesser extent, the share-lending rules also provide for the transfer of dividend withholding payment (DWP) credits to a share supplier under a share-lending arrangement.

Under the share-lending rules, DWP credits are only able to be transferred using a credit transfer notice. This operates in the same way as for imputation credits, with the requirements set out in new section 30C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the purposes of the credit transfer notice, a DWP credit is an imputation credit.

The amount of any DWP credit shown in a credit transfer notice issued to a share supplier is a credit under section MG 4 to the share supplier's DWP account. The credit arises on the date that the credit transfer notice is issued.

Under section MG 5, the amount of any DWP credit shown in a credit transfer notice issued by a share user is a debit to the share user's DWP account. The debit arises on the date that the related dividend is paid.

Any DWP credit transferred under a credit transfer notice is excluded from the taxable income of a share user (new section CD 10B). Instead, the amount of the DWP credit is income of the share supplier. Section LD 8 has been amended so that a taxpayer who receives a DWP credit transfer notice is entitled to a credit of tax rather than the taxpayer who issues the notice. Section LD 9 has also been amended to allow the Commissioner to refund DWP credits to the share supplier.

If a share user does not use a credit transfer notice, any DWP credits will convert to imputation credits in the hands of the share supplier. This occurs because a share user is required to pay resident withholding tax under new section NF 2(1)(g). The resident withholding tax liability is 33% of the replacement payment less any imputation credits attached to the payment or DWP credits transferred using a credit transfer notice. This means that for a dividend with DWP credits attached (which have not been transferred using a credit transfer notice), a share user will be required to pay resident withholding tax. Under new section NF 8B, this resident withholding tax is treated as an imputation credit attached to the replacement payment.

The above entries are replicated for DWP accounts of consolidated groups in section MG 14 for credits and section MG 15 for debits.

**Example 13**  
  
KiwiTrust lends 1,000 Tui Limited shares to NZ Broker Limited. During the period of the lending arrangement, a $100 dividend with $49.25 of DWP credits attached is paid to NZ Broker Limited. NZ Broker Limited makes a cash contribution payment of $100 to KiwiTrust and elects to transfer the $49.25 of DWP credits using a credit transfer notice.  
  
The DWP credits are excluded from NZ Broker Limited's taxable income (section CD 10B). Instead, the DWP credits are income of KiwiTrust.  
  
NZ Broker Limited records a credit in its DWP account for $49.25, being the DWP credits attached to the dividend received. A corresponding debit for $49.25 is also recorded, on the date that the dividend is paid, for the DWP credits transferred in the credit transfer notice. NZ Broker Limited does not receive a credit of tax for the $49.25 of DWP credits (section LD 8(1B)).  
  
NZ Broker Limited records dividend income of $100 and a deduction for the replacement payment of $100.  
  
KiwiTrust records a credit in its DWP account for $49.25, being the credits transferred in the credit transfer notice. This is recorded on the day that the credit transfer notice is issued. KiwiTrust is also entitled to a credit of tax equal to the amount of the DWP credits shown in the credit transfer notice (section LD 8(1C)). KiwiTrust records taxable income of $149.25 and a tax credit of $49.25.

**Example 14**  
  
KiwiTrust also lends 1,000 Matai Limited shares to NZ Broker Limited. During the period of the lending arrangement, a $100 dividend with $49.25 of DWP credits attached is paid on the shares. At the time of payment, the shares are no longer held by NZ Broker Limited as they have been sold to a third party.  
  
NZ Broker Limited makes a cash contribution payment of $100 to KiwiTrust. As NZ Broker Limited did not receive the underlying dividend, it cannot transfer DWP credits using a credit transfer notice. Instead, NZ Broker Limited is required to pay resident withholding tax of $49.25 as calculated under section NF 2. This resident withholding tax converts to imputation credits of $49.25 under section NF 8B.  
  
NZ Broker Limited claims a tax deduction for the replacement payment of $149.25 (section DB 12C).  
  
KiwiTrust records a credit in its ICA for $49.25, being the imputation credits attached to the replacement payment under section NF 8B. This is recorded on the day that the replacement payment is paid. The replacement payment, including the imputation credits, is income of $149.25 to KiwiTrust under section CD 43. Under section LB 2, as the imputation credits are included in KiwiTrust's assessable income, a credit of tax is allowed for the imputation credits attached to the replacement payment. No credit of tax is available for the resident withholding tax as section LD 3 does not apply to replacement payments.

##### Share-lending withholding tax

The share-lending rules allow imputation and DWP credits to be transferred from a share user to a share supplier to put the share supplier in the same situation as if they had continued to hold the original share. However, a direct transfer is only possible where the share user receives the underlying dividend with the imputation or DWP credits attached. Where the shares have been on-sold to a third party it is not possible to transfer imputation or DWP credits. Therefore, the share-lending rules include a withholding tax obligation to fund imputation or DWP credits. This is set out in the definition of a share-lending arrangement, which requires a share user to pay the amount of tax required by new section NF 2(1)(g).

To reduce compliance and administration costs, the withholding tax obligation operates as part of the resident withholding tax (RWT) rules. The RWT rules have been amended to apply to replacement payments made under share-lending arrangements. Section NF 1 has been amended so that resident withholding income now includes a replacement payment. Section NF 4(4) has been amended so that people required to make RWT deductions in respect of replacement payments must pay all such deductions to the Commissioner on a monthly basis, no later than the 20th of the following month.

A new formula has been inserted into section NF 2 to calculate the amount of RWT payable on share-lending arrangements. The formula effectively requires RWT to be paid for any amount of replacement payment not fully imputed by credits from the underlying dividend (either through attachment to the replacement payment or credit transfer notice).

The amount of RWT payable is calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a × b/(1 - a) - c - d - e |     |     |
| a   | \=  | the rate of RWT specified in schedule 14, clause 2. |
| b   | \=  | the amount of the replacement payment (net of imputation credits). |
| c   | \=  | the amount of imputation credits attached to the replacement payment under section ME 6B. |
| d   | \=  | the amount of imputation credits shown in any related credit transfer notice. |
| e   | \=  | the amount of dividend withholding payment credits shown in any related credit transfer notice. |

The rate of RWT is 33%. This is set out in Schedule 14, clause 2 which now applies to replacement payments. Amendments have been made to sections NF 2A, NF 2B and NF 2D so that a person cannot use another rate of RWT.

Share-lending RWT is a final tax. It does not give rise to a credit of tax for the share supplier (amendment to section LD 3). Instead, it will give rise to an imputation credit attached to the replacement payment (new section NF 8B).

Finally, as a share user is required to pay any RWT in order for a share-lending transaction to be a qualifying arrangement, section NF 3(2) has been amended so that agents and trustees are not required to make RWT deductions on receipt of payments which are replacement payments under a share-lending arrangement.

**Example 15**  
  
KiwiTrust lends 1,000 Pipi Corporation shares to NZ Broker Limited. During the period of the lending arrangement, a $100 dividend with no imputation credits attached is paid to NZ Broker Limited. NZ Broker Limited makes a cash replacement payment of $67 to KiwiTrust. As NZ Broker Limited did not receive any imputation credits it is required to pay RWT of $33 as calculated under section NF 2:  
  
0.33 × 67/(1 - 0.33) - 0 - 0 - 0 = $33  
  
The RWT converts to imputation credits of $33 under section NF 8B.  
  
NZ Broker Limited returns the dividend received and claims a tax deduction for the replacement payment, including the $33 of imputation credits (section DB 12C).  
  
KiwiTrust records a credit in its ICA for $33, being the imputation credits attached to the replacement payment under section NF 8B. This is recorded on the day that the replacement payment is paid. The replacement payment, including the imputation credits, is income to KiwiTrust under section CD 43. Under section LB 2, a credit of tax is allowed for the imputation credit included in KiwiTrust's assessable income. No credit of tax is available for the RWT as section LD 3 does not apply to replacement payments.  
  
If a cash replacement payment of $100 was made, NZ Broker Limited would be required to pay RWT of $49.25.  
  
0.33 × 100/(1 - 0.33) - 0 - 0 - 0 = $49.25  
  
The RWT converts to imputation credits of $49.25 under section NF 8B.  
  
NZ Broker Limited would return the dividend received and claim a tax deduction for the replacement payment, including the $49.25 of imputation credits (section DB 12C).  
  
KiwiTrust records a credit in its ICA for $49.25, being the credits attached to the replacement payment under section NF 8B. This is recorded on the day that the replacement payment is paid. The replacement payment, including the imputation credits, would be income to KiwiTrust under section CD 43. Under section LB 2, a credit of tax would be allowed for the imputation credits included in KiwiTrust's assessable income. No credit of tax would be available for the RWT as section LD 3 does not apply to replacement payments.

#### Impact of not qualifying

##### Ceasing to qualify

Taxpayers are required to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a share-lending arrangement at the start of the transaction.

If an arrangement fails to qualify at some point during its term (for example, because an identical share is no longer available) then it fails to qualify from the start of the transaction and the normal tax rules must be applied.

Taxpayers entering share-lending transactions are subject to the normal self-assessment rules. Therefore, if a taxpayer mistakenly treats a transaction as qualifying for the share-lending rules when they should not have done so, then they will need to restate the tax treatment of the transaction. Use-of-money interest and penalties could apply depending on the particular circumstances that gave rise to an incorrect treatment being adopted.

**Example 16**  
  
A share supplier enters into a lending agreement to lend Paua Limited ordinary shares. Over the period of the lending arrangement, Paua Limited merges with Kea Corporation. The share user (borrower) returns shares in the merged entity at the end of the lending arrangement.  
  
This would not qualify as a share-lending arrangement as the original or identical shares are not returned to the share supplier.  
  
Similarly, if Paua Limited preference shares or bonds were returned, the arrangement would not qualify as a share-lending arrangement.

##### Returning securities transfers which are not sharelending arrangements

The share-lending rules are designed to ensure that imputation credits remain with the economic owner of the shares. For returning share transfers which are not share-lending arrangements, this is achieved through an additional imputation debit. Under section ME 5(1)(ac), a debit will arise for the amount of any imputation credit attached to a dividend that is paid to the person as a share user or associate in a returning share transfer that is not a share-lending arrangement.

**Example 17**  
  
Overseas Pension Fund lends some of its listed New Zealand shares to NZ Investment Limited in exchange for a cash payment. The term of the agreement is three years. NZ Investment Limited agrees to make compensation payments equivalent to 85% of any dividends paid on the underlying shares. Over the term of the arrangement fully imputed dividends are paid on the underlying shares.  
  
The arrangement is a returning share transfer but is not a share-lending arrangement as it has a term longer than one year. As NZ Investment Limited is the legal owner of the shares, it receives the dividends including the imputation credits. However, under section ME 5(1), a debit arises in NZ Investment Limited's ICA for the value of these imputation credits on the day that the dividend is paid. This is because NZ Investment Limited is a share user who has received imputation credits paid to NZ Investment as a share user in a returning share transfer that is not a share-lending arrangement.

Because the above imputation debit only applies to transactions which meet the definition of a returning share transfer, taxpayers could structure transactions outside the qualification criteria. Therefore, a new specific anti-avoidance provision has been included as part of the rules. New section GC 14G applies where a person enters into an arrangement that has an effect of avoiding a requirement of the returning share transfer definition so as to defeat the intention and application of the Income Tax Act. Where this is the case, the Commissioner may treat the arrangement as a returning share transfer and a person affected by the arrangement as a share user or share supplier.

Taxation (Parental Tax Credit) Act 2014
=======================================

Key features and analysis of the Taxation (Parental Tax Credit) Act 2014.

_Sections MD 1, MD 2, MD 11 to MD 13 and MD 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

As part of a package of financial support for families with newborns, Budget 2014 increased the amount of the parental tax credit to $220 per week and extended the payment period to 10 weeks. The abatement formula was also changed to better target the parental tax credit so that it is abated against each dollar of family income earned, above the annual threshold, over the entire year.

### Key features

*   The maximum amount of the parental tax credit has been increased from $150 a week to $220 a week, for babies born on or after 1 April 2015.
*   The payment period for the parental tax credit has been extended from eight weeks to 10 weeks.
*   The _effective_ rate at which the parental tax credit is abated will increase to 21.25 cents for each additional dollar of family income over the annual threshold (currently $36,350). This better targets the parental tax credit payments to lower and middle income families.

### Application date

These changes apply to parental tax credit payments made in respect of babies born on or after 1 April 2015.

### Detailed analysis

#### **Increase in amount and payment period**

The parental tax credit is a special payment made as part of the Working for Families (WFF) scheme, on the birth of a newborn baby. To be eligible for the parental tax credit, families must not be entitled to income-tested benefits, certain pensions or a student allowance. Families who receive paid parental leave (PPL) payments cannot claim the parental tax credit as well.

Section MD 12 increases the maximum amount of the parental tax credit from $1,200 to $2,200 for each dependent child born on or after 1 April 2015.

Section MD 11 increases the period for which the parental tax credit is payable (the "parental entitlement period"), from the first eight weeks (56 days) following the birth of the child, to the first 10 weeks (70 days) following birth.

The maximum amount of the parental tax credit payment is reduced, on a pro-rata basis, for the number of days within the parental entitlement period for which the family does not satisfy the qualifying criteria.

The parental tax credit can be paid out in two ways:

*   As a lump sum payment, included within the end-of-year assessment for WFF tax credits.
*   In weekly or fortnightly instalments. Section MD 11(6) has been amended, so that instalment payments are now paid over the 10 weeks following the date on which the application for the parental tax credit is made.

#### Changes to the parental tax credit abatement formula

A family's WFF tax credits for a year are apportioned into various "entitlement periods". An entitlement period is an unbroken period within a tax year in which the following criteria are met:

*   The applicant is the principal caregiver.
*   As principal caregiver, the person must meet the qualifying criteria on each day of the entitlement period.
*   There is no change in the principal caregiver's marital, civil union or de-facto relationship status.
*   The child/children remain "dependent".
*   The composition of the family's WFF tax credits does not change.

The birth of a newborn, which brings an entitlement to the parental tax credit, will always create a separate entitlement period during the year.

#### Abatement rules

The parental tax credit, the family tax credit and the in-work tax credit are currently abated at 21.25 cents in the dollar for every dollar by which the person's family scheme income exceeds the abatement threshold (currently $36,350).

The abatement calculation starts by determining the "credit abatement amount" for the full year. This credit abatement amount is then apportioned into the relevant tax credit entitlement periods within the year.

The WFF tax credit amounts for each entitlement period are reduced, in turn, by the amount of the family credit abatement apportioned to that entitlement period; the family tax credit is abated first, then the in-work tax credit and finally the parental tax credit.

Under the previous rules, the parental tax credit was abated against income arising during the 8-week parental entitlement period only. New section MD 2(3) introduces a new abatement formula for the parental tax credit, so that the credit abatement amount that is applied to the parental tax credit is calculated over the full year's income.

The new formula operates by "scaling up" the amount of the credit abatement in respect of the parental tax credit. It does this by taking the credit abatement amount for the entitlement period (the "period abatement amount") and subtracting the amount of the credit used to abate the family tax credit and the in-work tax credit for that entitlement period ("amounts used"). The resulting credit amount is then multiplied by 365 and divided by the number of days in the parental entitlement period that fall within the abatement period.

Example 1: Parental tax credit abatement formula

Nikki and Danny have one child aged 4 and a new baby born on 1 April 2015. Danny works as an electrician earning $95,000.

Their family tax credit entitlement is $8,173, their in-work tax credit entitlement is $3,120 and they are also eligible for a parental tax credit of $2,200, before abatement, for the year to 31 March 2016.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Family scheme income | $95,000 |
| Less abatement threshold | ($36,350) |
| Abatement rate | \*21.25% |
| Full year abatement | $12,463.13 |

_**Parental entitlement period = 2 April 2015 - 10 June 2015 (70 days/10 weeks)**_

Family credit abatement for entitlement period

\= $12,463.13 x 70 ÷ 365  
\= $2,390.19

_Family tax credit_

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ($8,173 x 70 ÷ 365) = | $1,567.42 |
| _Less_ abatement | ($2,390.19) |

_In-work tax credit_

|     |     |

| ($3,120 x 10 ÷ 52) = | $600.00 |
| _Less_ remaining abatement | ($822.77) |
|     | –$222.77 |

Before the parental tax credit amount is abated, the remaining credit abatement is scaled up, using the new formula at section MD 2(3):

Scaled up credit abatement for parental tax credit  
\= (period abatement amount \- amount used) x (365 ÷ entitlement days)  
\= ($2,390.19 \- $1,567.42 \- $600.00) x (365 ÷ 70)  
**\= $1,161.59**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| PTC amount | $2,200.00 |
| _Less_ scaled up remaining credit abatement | ($1,161.59) |
| **PTC payable** | **$1,038.41** |

Taxation Review Authority clarifies the meaning of “stop” in s EC20
===================================================================

The TRA concluded that the use of the phrase “stops deriving income from the sale of specified livestock” in s EC 20 of Income Tax Act 2007 is to be read as requiring a permanent stop.

Case

TRA 004/18 and TRA 005/18 \[2019\] NZTRA 2

Legal terms

Stop, Specified livestock

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007, s EC 20

### Summary

The Tax Review Authority ("the TRA") concluded that the use of the phrase "stops deriving income from the sale of specified livestock" in s EC 20 of Income Tax Act 2007 ("the ITA") is to be read as requiring a permanent stop. A "stop" for one income year is not sufficient to be able to use the livestock valuation provisions in s EC 20.

### Impact

This decision clarifies the position that a taxpayer must stop deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock permanently to use the process for valuing herd livestock in s EC 20 of the ITA.

### Facts

The taxpayers are trusts that operated in a partnership. The trustees were "Mr and Mrs Smith" and their accountant, "Mr Brown". The taxpayers owned a herd of dairy cows which they milked on the "XY Trust No 2" farm. They also owned 4 hectares of land on which they raised jersey bull calves. The dairy herd was sold on 1 June 2012 and the jersey calves in September and October 2012 (i.e. in the 2013 tax year) and as at 1 November 2012, the taxpayers did not own any specified livestock. Mr and Mrs Smith personally purchased 18 jersey bull calves on 11 December 2012, which were kept on the 4 hectares of land owned by the taxpayers.

On 29 November 2012 the accountants for the taxpayers wrote to the Commissioner advising that the partnership had ceased farming and that they elected to use the 2012 National Average Market Values ("NAMVs") under s EC 20 of the ITA to calculate their 2013 livestock income.

In the 2014 and 2015 tax years, the taxpayers purchased further jersey bull calves, keeping and raising them on their 4 hectare property.

It was accepted that between 1 November 2012 and 31 May 2013, the taxpayers (the trusts) did not own any livestock so had stopped deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock in the 2013 tax year (only). It was also accepted that that the taxpayers derived income from the disposal of specified livestock in the income years subsequent to the 2013 tax year.

On 5 September 2013, the taxpayers filed their 2013 income tax returns using the 2012 NAMVs. The 2013 NAMVs were lower than the 2012 NAMVs and the effect of using the 2012 NAMVs was a deduction for opening stock of $1,160,612 rather than $993,490 if the 2013 NAMVs were used.

The challenge concerned the ability for the taxpayers to use the 2012 NAMVs to value their livestock in the 2013 tax year under section EC 20 of the ITA.

### Decision

A person is allowed a deduction for the property on hand at the start of an income year under s DB 49 of the ITA and the value of the property at the end of income year is income under s CH 1. Subpart EC of the ITA sets out the valuation of livestock that is deducted under s DB 49 and is the relevant subpart to this challenge. The usual rule, under s EC 2, is that opening value of stock is the closing value from the previous year.

The herd scheme is a valuation method that values each type of livestock on the basis of the NAMVs. The scheme treats livestock as a capital asset, despite its similarity to trading stock. The taxpayers used the herd scheme valuation method.

Section EC 16 of the ITA provides the method for valuing livestock under the herd scheme. It modifies the effect of s EC 2 so that rather than the opening value of the stock in a given year being the same as the closing value from previous year, the opening value equates to the closing value in the same year. The effect of this is that, under the herd scheme, any movements in herd values over the year are not subject to income tax and no deductions arise.

However, the situation changes again if s EC 20 applies. In that case, there is no revaluation of the opening value under s EC 16(3) (revaluating it to the closing value for the same year). Instead, if s EC 20 applies, the opening value of the livestock is the closing value from the previous year.

The taxpayers submitted that the interpretation of s EC 20 was a matter of first principles and the purpose of the provision was to enable farmers to obtain certainty as to their income tax requirements.

The Commissioner submitted that whilst the dictionary definition of "stop" indicates that deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock has come to an end or been discontinued, there remains an ambiguity as to whether the disposal of livestock has come to an end in a single year or permanently. Having regard to the immediate and general legislative context, the social, commercial or other objectives of the enactment and the legislative history, parliamentary debates, and reports, the Commissioner submitted that a taxpayer must stop deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock permanently in order to satisfy the requirements of s EC 20.

The TRA adopted the comprehensive analysis of the legislative history of s EC 20 provided by the Commissioner, including extrinsic material (such as Officials Issues Papers) and set this out.

The TRA did not accept that the meaning of the section was plain on its face, and agreed with the Commissioner that the meaning of "stops" was not clear whether it meant comes to an end in a single year or permanently. Where the plain and ordinary meaning of the text is not clear, it is necessary to determine the meaning most consistent with the context and purpose of the provision. It is apparent from a review of the legislative history and extrinsic material that the purpose of s EC 20 was "to help remove delays on windup" for farmers who "cease farming" and allow them to use the previous year's herd values in their accounts, rather than being "forced to wait until the market values are released for that year before commencing wind up".

There was no change in meaning with the introduction of the word "stops" instead of "ceases" in s EC 20 in the Income Tax Act 2004 and that the section does not include the word "permanently" is not determinative. In the TRA's view, the context and purpose of s EC 20 clearly supports the interpretation that the farming activity is to be stopped permanently.

Contrary to the taxpayers' submission that a farmer could not predict whether the NAMVs would advantage or disadvantage the famer, the TRA agreed that the issue was identified as a problem in the extrinsic material and, here, the taxpayers "had a fair idea" what the 2013 NAMVs were likely to be. The position taken by the taxpayers was tantamount to "cherry picking" which NAMVs to apply and was completely in contradiction to the measures taken by Parliament to eradicate "flexibility of the rules being inappropriately used".

The TRA was satisfied that s EC 20 is to be read as meaning that for the section to apply, the taxpayer must stop deriving income from the disposal of specified livestock permanently. Here, as the taxpayers did not permanently stop deriving income from the disposal of livestock, they were not able to use the 2012 NAMVs under s EC 20. The TRA dismissed the challenge and upheld the Commissioner's assessments using the 2013 NAMVs.

Taxation Review Authority confirms amounts received not loan repayments, but deemed dividends
=============================================================================================

During the 2010 to 2014 tax years (disputed period), the disputant was a shareholder of or was associated with a shareholder of “GPBL”, “STL” and “KMRL” (together referred to as “the Companies”).

Case

TRA 15/17 \[2018\] NZTRA 9

Legal terms

Wages, Dividends, Income under ordinary concepts

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007  
Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

During the 2010 to 2014 tax years (disputed period), the disputant was a shareholder of or was associated with a shareholder of "GPBL", "STL" and "KMRL" (together referred to as "the Companies"). The disputant received various payments from the Companies during the disputed period and had personal expenditure paid on her behalf by STL and KMRL. The disputant filed nil returns for each of the tax years in the disputed period. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") reassessed the disputant in respect of the amounts received from the Companies as wages and dividends or alternatively as income under ordinary concepts.

### Impact

The decision applies established principles and confirms that transfers of value from a company to a person is caused by a shareholding if there is no other reasonable explanation for the payment to be made.

### Facts

_GPBL_

The disputant's husband, Mr Smith, was the sole director and shareholder of GPBL during the disputed period. GPBL was placed in receivership in June 2013 and ceased trading.

GPBL's bank statements and bank statements for the disputant's joint account held with Mr Smith (Joint Account) showed regular and recurrent transfers from GPBL to the Joint Account during the disputed period annotated as "Repay MLS \[Joint account bank number\]", "MLS loan \[Joint account bank number\]" or similar.

The Commissioner assessed 50% of these amounts as taxable to the disputant as dividends or, alternatively, income under ordinary concepts.

_STL_

STL was incorporated in October 2006. The disputant and Mr Smith were appointed directors on incorporation. The disputant resigned in May 2011. The disputant was also the sole shareholder until April 2009 when all the shares in STL were transferred to GPBL. STL was placed into liquidation in July 2013.

STL's bank statements showed STL paid the disputant's and Mr Smith's personal expenses. The Commissioner assessed half of these amounts as income to the disputant for being in the nature of dividends, or alternatively as income under ordinary concepts.

STL's bank statements and the disputant's bank statements showed regular (approximately weekly) amounts of $300, $400, $500, $600 or $750 being paid by STL into one of the disputant's personal bank accounts. These amounts were annotated in the disputant's personal bank account as "Disputant STL wages" or similar wording. These amounts were assessed as income to the disputant for being in the nature of wages.

Further amounts transferred from STL into the disputant's personal bank accounts during disputed period were assessed to the disputant as dividends or, alternatively, as income under ordinary concepts.

_KMRL_

KMRL was incorporated in May 2011 with Mr Smith as sole director. The disputant and Mr Smith each held a third of the shares with the remaining third held by a company also owned by them. KMRL was removed from the Companies Register in October 2012.

Bank statements for one of the disputant's personal bank accounts showed regular (approximately weekly) deposits of $500 annotated as "KWA market wages". These amounts were assessed as income to the disputant for being in the nature of wages.

Bank statements for KMRL showed the disputant's and Mr Smith's personal expenses being paid from the company's bank account. The Commissioner assessed half of these amounts as income to the disputant for being in the nature of dividends, or alternatively income under ordinary concepts.

### Decision

_Wages_

The Tax Review Authority ("the TRA") found the amounts paid to the disputant annotated as 'wages' in the bank statements was assessable income to the disputant. The coding of the payments in the bank statements as 'wages' was consistent with the payments' regularity. The disputant also said in her evidence she did do some minor work for the companies.

At the hearing, the disputant argued the amounts recorded in bank statements as "wages" had been wrongly coded as a consequence of an anomaly in the payroll software used. However, the TRA found the explanation difficult to reconcile with the fact that the disputant received amounts coded as "drawings" on the same day that she received amounts coded as "wages".

In an interview in 2015 and in a document dated 2016 the disputant stated that the amounts described as wages were coded in the Profit & Loss Statement to reflect hours spent working in the business (STL) in order to show whoever purchased the business, the amount of time that Mr Smith and the disputant had invested. That way, it was said that their accountant could reconcile the time the disputant spent on the business(es). The TRA did not find it convincing that an accountant would advise or otherwise allow a company to code amounts that were capital repayments as wages in its accounts.

_Dividends_

The disputant argued that the amounts paid to her or on her behalf were returns of capital amounts she had lent to the Companies prior to the disputed period. However, the disputant was unable to produce documentary evidence to prove that the amounts she received from the Companies were repayments of loan advances. Documents which could have been expected included loan agreements, minutes or resolutions, journal entries or ledgers kept by either the Companies or the disputant.

The TRA was satisfied in terms of the requirements of s CD 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007, that the transfers in value from the Companies to the disputant were made because of a shareholding in each of the Companies and noted that the disputant had either been a direct shareholder or associated with a shareholder of each of the Companies during the disputed period. The TRA considered that once the disputant's explanation for the nature of the payments had been discounted, there was no reason for the Companies to have made transfers of value other than because of the relevant shareholdings in the Companies.

_Income under ordinary concepts_

The TRA also agreed that the amounts in dispute constituted income under ordinary concepts. The amounts received by the disputant involved a regular flow of funds that had "come in" to the disputant or had been paid on her behalf. The amounts were used to meet the disputant's day to day living expenses and she had no other income to rely on during the disputed period.

_Shortfall penalties_

The TRA held the disputant had been grossly careless in taking nil tax positions in the disputed period and was liable for shortfall penalties under s 141C of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Taxation Review Authority confirms the Commissioner’s ability to attribute income to a non-party in a transaction
=================================================================================================================

2017 case note – CIR's ability to attribute income to a non-party in a transaction confirmed - issue exclusion, onus and standard of proof, allocation of income.

Case

A v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZTRA 08

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 89A, 138G, Income Tax Act 2007 ss BD 3, CA 1, (CB 6, CB 7)

### Summary

The disputant taxpayer had benefited from international money transfers, foreign currency purchases and domestic transfers and card expenditure which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") considered had been conducted on the disputant's behalf through trusts and companies wholly owned and operated by the disputant's friend. The Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") largely confirmed the Commissioner's assessments but found that certain isolated transactions had an insufficient link with the disputant and accordingly disallowed those amounts.

### Impact

This is a useful decision which confirms that income amounts can be attributable to a non-party to a particular transaction pursuant to s BD 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA"), where there is a genuine case for suggesting that the amounts have been dealt with on the person's behalf or in his or her interest.

The Authority's finding is particularly helpful in determining that in attribution cases the onus and standard of proof remains unaffected and the Commissioner has no duty to undertake particular enquiries on behalf of the taxpayer. This is so even when the documents relating to the transaction underpinning the assessment are not in the taxpayer's immediate possession but held by the parties directly involved in the transaction.

The decision otherwise applies the standard principles regarding what constitutes income under ordinary concepts.

### Facts

The disputant is a New Zealand citizen and tax resident, who during the disputed period (the 2005 to 2011 income years) spent considerable time in Australia where his family has lived permanently since 2001. He was bankrupted in both 1993 and 2003. The disputant filed nil income tax returns following the issue of default assessments. He did not return any income in Australia in the disputed period.

It was common ground that the disputant was involved in property trading and land development as a consultant during the disputed period. He primarily provided his consultancy services in connection with the business dealings of his father and two childhood friends "Mr Green" and "Mr Jones" ("his associates"). The Commissioner assessed deposits and expenditure of trusts and other entities of his associates as income to the disputant because she considered he received them in exchange for consultancy services provided. Other deposits from unknown sources into the disputant's personal bank account and the bank account of a related trust "the K Discretionary Trust" have also been assessed as income to the disputant.

Some of the disputed amounts were not received directly by the disputant but were amounts paid into bank accounts held in the names of the disputant's family members, payments to third parties, or expenditure via an eftpos card for expenses which were clearly of a personal nature.

### Decision

_**Process issues**_

**Alternative taxing theory**

The Authority found that the primary basis for the Commissioner's assessment had always been income under ordinary concepts. 

The Authority rejected the disputant's contention that the approach taken by the Commissioner was not clear until after the issue of the adjudication report, discovery and the receipt of the investigator's brief of evidence. Both the primary ground (income under ordinary concepts) and the alternative ground (income pursuant to ss CB 6 and CB 7 of the ITA) had been clearly set out in the Commissioner's Notice of Response. The Authority therefore found that any issues which the disputant wished to raise relating to the Commissioner's basis of assessment could have been included in the disputant's Statement of Position ("SOP").

Furthermore, the Authority found that even if the issue did not arise until after the adjudication report was issued, the requirements of s 138G(2)(b) would not be met, as any issues with the assessments could have been satisfactorily addressed in the _de novo_ hearing before the Authority. Therefore the Authority concluded that the disputant would not suffer any manifest injustice if the issue was not raised.

**Provision of information**

The Authority noted that the disputant had been provided with a breakdown of the assessed amounts and source documents for Mr Green's entities prior to the issue of his SOP. The Authority determined that it was reasonable for the Commissioner to assume the disputant could source for himself his own personal bank statements (which he knew the Commissioner had copies of) as well as his family members' bank statements and the statements of the K Discretionary Trust.

The Authority found that, even if it could be argued that the disputant did not know of documents held by the Commissioner or was not able to raise this process issue at the time he issued his SOP, the disputant would not suffer manifest injustice if the issue is not raised.

The Authority went on to hold that the Commissioner did not have a duty to undertake particular enquiries effectively on behalf of the disputant. Neither was there any basis for holding the Commissioner to a higher standard to assist a disputant in attribution cases. Accordingly, it was determined that the requirements of s 138G(2)(b) were not met and the disputant's application was dismissed.

_**Substantive issues - Income under ordinary concepts**_

The Authority noted that the character of income under ordinary concepts required consideration of a number of factors, including regularity of payments and the recipient's reliance on them to meet living expenses. The Authority quoted from _Dunn v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ ((1979) 1 NZTC 61,245 (SC)) and noted that amounts can be income derived by a person in spite of him or her not being the immediate recipient of the money or money's worth, if the income has been dealt with on the person's behalf or in his or her interest.

**Credibility issues**

The disputant claimed that some of the amounts attributed as income to him were either loans to him from his father, repayments of loans from his father to Mr Green or loans from Mr Green to the disputant. He did not produce any supporting documents in evidence. The Authority was clear in finding that the disputant was not a credible witness and considered the disputant's description of his various business activities vague and unconvincing. Accordingly, the disputant's explanations that the amounts were loans were not accepted.

**Findings for the Commissioner**

The Authority found that the disputant had failed to discharge the onus in respect of the vast majority of the amounts assessed. Many amounts had also been conceded by the disputant during the final stage of the hearing.

The disputant's travel in and out of New Zealand coincided with the foreign currency purchases and the use of an eftpos card connected with Mr Green's entities. The disputant's acceptance and concession that he had used the card both for business and personal expenditure and estimate that 50% of the amounts assessed might be attributable to him, was not sufficient to discharge the onus.

International transfers from Mr Green's entities to the disputant's family members were also found to be income attributable to the disputant. The disputant had not called any family members, or Mr Green, to give evidence. International transfers from Mr Green's entities to third parties in Australia were also attributed as income to the disputant.

The majority of the amounts which had been transferred to the disputant's personal bank accounts and the bank account of the K Discretionary Trust were also held to be income to the disputant.

**Findings for the taxpayer**

The Authority found that one deposit for AUD $519,351.45 from X Marine Services into the disputant's Australian bank account was not assessable as income to the disputant. The disputant's evidence was that this amount was the sale proceeds from the disposal of his father's boat. The Authority found that the amount, being a one off substantial payment which could reasonably be inferred to be from the sale of a boat, did not have the quality of income under ordinary concepts. On the same basis, two deposits totalling $66,300 from the same entity into the K Discretionary Trust were also found not assessable.

Two further transactions of $10,020 and $12,020 from Mr Green's entities to an entity in Phuket were also found not to be income attributable to the disputant because the Authority considered that there was insufficient basis for their inclusion in the assessment (not being transfers to Australia, where the disputant lived with his family).

The Authority upheld the remainder of the Commissioner's assessments which totalled $7,024,988.76 (The total amount still disputed going into the final stage of the hearing, including the amounts which the Authority found not assessable as income to the disputant.).

Taxation Review Authority considers ‘taxable activity’ and entitlement to input tax deductions
==============================================================================================

The disputant challenged GST assessments for the "disputed periods" that had disallowed input tax deductions claimed by the disputant during these periods.

Case

TRA 06/18 \[2019\] NZTRA 4

Legal terms

GST, Input tax, Input tax deductions, Taxable activity

Legislative References

Goods and Services Act 1985

### Summary

The disputant challenged GST assessments for the periods ending 31 January 2017, 31 March 2017, 31 May 2017 and 31 July 2017 (“the disputed periods”) that had disallowed input tax deductions claimed by the disputant during these periods. Additionally, the Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”) considered whether or not the disputant was engaged in a taxable activity.

### Impact

The decision was an orthodox application of the law to the facts and may assist with future cases where a taxpayer is conducting intermittent activity that it claims constitutes a taxable activity.

### Facts

The managing director (“MD”) of the disputant purchased a vehicle for $13,200 in his own name as the trustee of a foundation. Funds for the purchase of that vehicle were provided by his father. The MD proceeded to refurbish the vehicle. The purpose of this refurbishment, as told to the TRA, was to include features specific to the disputant’s business venture and also included accommodation for several people.

Following incorporation of the disputant the MD registered for GST on a payments basis. A GST return was filed by the disputant claiming an input tax deduction for the vehicle in the amount of $38,362.87. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) queried this claim and the return was withdrawn. The disputant then asked to be changed to an invoice basis for GST. This request was denied.

The disputant later filed a return including purchases and expenses of $50,079.38 which included an invoice of $50,000 for the sale of the vehicle to the disputant by the MD’s father. The input tax deduction that resulted from this was not paid by the Commissioner.

### Decision

The TRA noted that it is a requirement of ss 20(2) and 24 of the Goods and Services Act 1985 (“the Act”), that a valid tax invoice be held before an input tax deduction can be made. Judge Sinclair found there was no evidence before her that the MD’s father had ever owned the vehicle. Therefore, there was no valid tax invoice.

Additionally, pursuant to s 20(3)(b)(i) of the Act an input tax deduction can only be made for a person on a payments basis to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period. The invoice was never paid by the disputant.

The TRA noted that even if the MD’s father could be established to be the supplier of the vehicle and the transaction otherwise satisfied ss 3A(1), 8 and 20 of the Act the input tax deduction would be nil as the vehicle was a second-hand good and the parties to the transaction are associated parties in terms of s 2A(1)(i) of the Act. Judge Sinclair found that as the parties were associated the input tax deduction was limited under s 3(a)(3)(i) of the Act as no tax had been included in the original cost of the goods to the supplier.

Section 20(3C) only allows for an input tax deduction to the extent that the vehicle had been used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Judge Sinclair held that the disputant failed to make clear what taxable supplies the vehicle had been used to make.

To claim an input tax deduction the disputant must also have been carrying on a taxable activity under s 6(1) of the Act. It is not sufficient to have an intention to carry on a taxable activity. The supply of goods must also be for consideration. The disputant failed to provide corroborative documentary evidence of supplies for the majority of invoices during the disputed periods.

The onus is on the disputant to show that the disputant was carrying on a “taxable activity” in accordance with s 6 of the Act. It is not appropriate to take an open-ended view as to when a taxable activity commenced. Accordingly, Judge Sinclair was not satisfied on the evidence that the disputant had been engaged in a taxable activity.

Taxation Review Authority considers whether it has the power to approve publication of a taxpayer’s affairs on application by the taxpayer
==========================================================================================================================================

The Taxation Review Authority had to consider whether allowing a journalist to attend the hearing of a taxpayer’s dispute was permissible given the privacy restrictions on that jurisdiction.

Case

TRA 06/18 \[2019\] NZTRA 1

Legal terms

Publication, Journalist, Taxpayer privacy, Privacy

Legislative References

Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994  
Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("the TRA") had to consider whether allowing a journalist to attend the hearing of a taxpayer's dispute was permissible given the privacy restrictions on that jurisdiction. Additionally, the TRA had to consider whether anything in the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 ("the Act") or the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 ("the Regulations") allowed the TRA the power to grant approval to publish information provided to the director of the disputant during the course of the TRA proceedings.

### Impact

This decision confirms that challenges heard in the TRA are to be conducted in private and that the reporting of decisions of the TRA is to be restricted to maintain the confidentiality of disputants and their tax affairs.

### Facts

The disputant company wished to publish an expose of the activities of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") in relation to his company's challenge and made an interlocutory application to:

1.  Publish (digitally and in print) all information its director had received during the course of the TRA proceedings.
2.  Have an employee/contractor of the company (other than the director) at the hearing to assist with information gathering to ensure the accuracy of any resulting publication (including blogs).

The disputant submitted that the s16(4) of the Act, did not preclude the publication of TRA trial matters if the disputant chooses to do so. In the absence of an express prohibition, and in the interests of transparency he argued that limitations should not be placed on the taxpayer's rights. 

The disputant advised that the application was lodged specifically to prevent future 'grey areas' or disputes arising, and to prevent the company being denied natural justice.  

A right of reply to any publication that the disputant proposed to make was offered to the Commissioner. This offer was not accepted and the Commissioner opposed the application.  The broad grounds of her opposition were that the orders sought by the disputant were inconsistent with the scheme of the Act, and the Regulations.

### Decision

The Authority dismissed the application.

Judge Sinclair concluded that the requirement in s 16(4) of the Act that a TRA proceeding, "shall not be open to the public" was mandatory.

Additionally, she found that the restrictions reg 36 of the Regulations placed on reporting on matters brought before the TRA meant that the Commissioner would not be able to respond to any material published by the disputant.  She also acknowledged it was likely s 81 of the Act would likely constrain the Commissioner's ability to respond.

In her Honour's view, the Legislature clearly intended that challenge proceedings before the TRA should be conducted in private and that reporting of decisions was restricted to maintain the confidentiality of the disputants and their tax affairs.

She noted that these restrictions do not apply in the High Court. Having elected to issue the claim in the TRA the disputant is bound by the privacy restrictions of that jurisdiction and therefore the application to have a journalist present was denied.

Judge Sinclair found that she did not have the power under reg 36 of the Regulations (or otherwise) to approve unrestricted publication as sought by the disputant. Additionally, the ability to make such an order would run contrary to the confidential nature of the jurisdiction. Accordingly, the application for an order approving restricted publication was also denied.

Taxation Review Authority considers whether the repayment of a loan can generate an input tax deduction
=======================================================================================================

The disputant challenged his self-assessment of GST for the two-month taxable period ending 30 September 2007

Case

TRA 08/18 \[2019\] NZTRA 3

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007  
Tax Administration Act 1994  
Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The disputant challenged his self-assessment of GST for the two-month taxable period ending 30 September 2007 (“disputed period”). He sought to claim additional input tax deductions for taxable supplies acquired during the development of two properties (“10 and 19”). This expenditure included a payment he made to a finance company (“XYL”).

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) viewed the payment to XYL as fulfilment of the disputant’s obligation under a loan agreement with XYL; the payment was not charged with GST and accordingly could not generate an input tax deduction. No tax invoices were available to support the claim.

The Tax Review Authority (“the Authority”) found in favour of the Commissioner.

### Impact

The judgment was an orthodox application of the law to the facts, it confirms that repayment of a loan is not consideration for a supply.

### Facts

In November 2006, the disputant purchased two properties with financial assistance from XYL. A mortgage with XYL was signed and settled in December 2006 and registered over the properties in January 2007. The purchase of the properties was returned in the period the payment was made, being the period ending 31 January 2007.

On 5 June 2007, the disputant sold 19 to unrelated third parties and the sale was settled on 6 August 2007. The disputant did not file a GST return during the applicable taxable period, 30 September 2007.

On 11 March 2016, the Commissioner received a GST return for the disputed period which included the sale of the property and expenditure on supplies of $28,000.00 (being five percent of the sale price of the property). The sales returned, and expenses claimed included GST at the rate of 12.5 percent (the then applicable rate). On 31 March 2016, based on the GST return filed, the Commissioner issued a return acknowledgement for $59,111.11 that was required to be paid, along with penalties and interest.

_XYL Schedule_

During the discovery proceedings, the disputant provided a schedule of expenses relating to the development of the properties. It appeared to show that the supplies were acquired by the disputant and the consideration for the supplies was financed by way of his loan with XYL.

### Issues

The Judge identified three issues to be determined in the proceeding (at \[3\]):

1.  Whether the requirement for the disputant to provide tax invoices should be waived.
2.  Whether the disputant is entitled to additional input tax deductions.
3.  Whether penalties and interest should be remitted in whole or in part.

### Decision

On the first issue, the Authority noted that the investigator had carefully analysed the schedule of expenses disclosed during the discovery process and had told the Authority that had this information been disclosed during the dispute process, a further $63,093.24 of expenses would have been allowed. Her Honour found that in the circumstances, there were proper grounds for the Commissioner to exercise her discretion and that a waiver of the requirement for tax invoices was appropriate (at \[24\]).

On the second issue, the Authority found the repayment of a loan to XYL could not generate an input tax deduction (at \[30\]). The Authority rejected the submission that the disputant only paid for supplies on the repayment of the loan and was entitled to claim input tax deductions on that payment. Instead the Authority found that the supplies were paid for by the disputant as amounts were drawn down on the loan (as recorded in the XYL schedule) (at \[28\]).

The Authority did not agree that anything exceptional existed in the funding arrangement which changed the nature of the parties GST obligations (at \[30\]) and “importantly, repayment of a loan is not consideration for a supply and the payment made by the disputant was not subject to GST input tax” (at \[30\]).

On the third issue, the Authority had no jurisdiction (pursuant to ss 120I and 138L (2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”)) to consider penalties and interest (at \[33\]). The Authority did set out the appropriate course of action for the disputant to take. (The appropriate course of action for a taxpayer who disagrees with the imposition of interest and/or penalties is to apply for remission under s 183A (Remission of Late Payment Penalty for Reasonable Cause) and/or s 183D (Remission of Late Payment Penalty and Interest under Part 7, consistent with collection of highest net revenue over time). Alternatively, a taxpayer can apply for financial relief under the hardship procedure contained in the TAA.)

The Authority increased the disputant’s input tax deductions for the disputed period to $93,437.30; amended the Commissioner’s assessment accordingly and otherwise dismissed the disputant’s claim (at \[34\]).

Taxation Review Authority declines company’s application to hear late claim
===========================================================================

2017 case note - taxpayer's application to make a late claim TRA dismissed – exceptional circumstances, late filing of claim, late challenge.

Case

TRA 001/17 \[2017\] NZTRA 06

Legislative References

Section 138D Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

A taxpayer’s application to make a late claim in the Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) was dismissed as no exceptional circumstances applied to its situation.

### Impact

This case follows the stages of identification, evaluation and discretion as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fuji Xerox NZ Limited_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,470 (_“Fuji-Xerox”_) when considering s 138D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). The case is a reminder of the procedural steps required to file a challenge and the limited ability to extend the time for filing a challenge.

### Facts

The disputant filed a notice of claim with the Authority, 10 working days after the last day of the two month response period. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) did not file an opposition and agreed to abide the decision of the Authority.

The Authority issued a minute setting out s 138D of the TAA and directed the director of the disputant to file an affidavit addressing the event or circumstance beyond its control which provided a reasonable justification for not commencing its challenge within the requisite period.

The director filed an affidavit, however this dealt with events after the response period had ended.

The Authority was not satisfied and directed a further affidavit be filed and for the disputant to file any submissions if it wished. The Authority also extended an opportunity to the disputant for a hearing before her. Finally, the Authority recommended the disputant obtain legal advice (and noted that the case manager had done so twice previously).

The disputant filed a further affidavit but did not wish to file submissions or have a hearing. The application was therefore considered on the papers.

### Decision

The Authority set out the three stages a hearing authority should consider as described by the Court of Appeal in _Fuji-Xerox_. The stages identified by the Court were identification, evaluation and discretion.

First, the hearing authority must identify the events or circumstances relied on by the disputant. Only circumstances beyond the control of the disputant can be relied on. Acts or omissions of agents are not exceptional circumstances unless it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent which could not have been anticipated and the effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct.

Having identified the circumstances outside s 138D of the TAA, the hearing authority needs to evaluate whether they have provided reasonable justification for the disputant not having commenced the challenge within the response period.

The final step is the hearing authority deciding whether to exercise its residual discretion to grant leave to bring a late challenge.

The Authority then examined the circumstances relied upon by the taxpayer. In the first affidavit, the director alleged the disputant’s notice of claim was unique in the sense that it involved a large number of documents which needed to be attached to the claim as “evidential data”.

The second affidavit stated the disputant had received its invoices back from the Commissioner around the first week of April 2017. The returned documents were photocopies which were said to be illegible. He then embarked on the “insurmountable task of making extra copies of the tax invoices when the Commissioner already had most copies which were bar coded and encrypted.” The disputant provided boxes containing copies of the invoices along with its claim.

The Authority noted that in the notice of claim, the disputant challenged the decision of the Commissioner not to allow input deductions across a number of GST periods. One of the issues arising from the adjudication report and mentioned in the notice of claim was the alleged failure of the disputant to provide valid tax invoices to the Commissioner.

The Authority commented that this is an unfortunate situation but it was unclear why the director felt it necessary to file copies of the invoices along with the notice of claim as this is not a requirement under the Regulations (Regulation 8, Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998).

The Authority observed that the Commissioner had provided written advice to the disputant as to the steps required to file a challenge and the disputant was clearly on notice as to the time period and filing requirements and this was admitted in the director’s first affidavit.

The Authority, having found the events were clearly not beyond the disputant’s control and did not amount to exceptional circumstances under s 138D of the TAA, declined the application. The taxpayer will therefore be unable to challenge the Commissioner’s assessments before a hearing authority.

Taxation Review Authority determines allowable expenditure on rental properties and treatment of trust income and expenses
==========================================================================================================================

2017 case note - disputant's ability to claim interest expenditure on funds borrowed to purchase properties for commercial rental - deductions, shortfall penalties.

Case

TRA Case 09/16, \[2017\] NZTRA 04

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This case concerned the disputant’s ability to claim interest expenditure on funds borrowed to purchase properties for commercial rental in the 2013 and 2014 income years (“years in dispute”). The disputant is a chartered accountant and operates a consultancy business from his residential address. The disputant’s rental and consultancy income went into his various revolving credit accounts. Business and personal expenditure were paid by the disputant from personal credits cards and from funds in the revolving credit accounts.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) raised default assessments for the years in dispute, which were challenged by the disputant in the Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”). As the disputant was unable to discharge his onus in showing how the Commissioner’s assessments were wrong, the Authority, in finding for the Commissioner, made revised assessments disallowing certain losses.

### Impact

This decision confirms, as per _Buckley v Young Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485 (CA) at 498, that the onus of proof rests on the taxpayer to show that the Commissioner’s assessments are wrong and by how much they are wrong. The ability to accrue, carry forward and apply tax losses falls within the broad definition of a “tax shortfall” pursuant to s 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”), being a tax benefit, credit or advantage of any type or description whatever benefiting the taxpayer or another person. There is no provision enabling a trust to either pass on losses or for a beneficiary to claim any kind of deduction for expenses incurred by that trust.

### Facts

Three rental properties purchased by the disputant were identified by the Commissioner and were the subject of her investigation. The first property was purchased by the disputant in 2002 (“the White Road property”) in the name of the MF Trust of which the disputant and his brother are trustees and the disputant and his daughter are beneficiaries. In September 2003 the disputant and his then partner purchased a rental property (“the Green Road property”). In August 2004, the disputant and his partner purchased another rental property (“the Brown Avenue property”). The total cost of the properties was $2,082,000. Funding for the properties was largely obtained by loan and credit facilities from XY Bank.

The disputant claimed the interest on the borrowings for the Green Road property for only a small part of the 2013 income year. The disputant claimed interest in respect of the Brown Avenue and White Road property for both tax years in dispute.

### Decision

The Authority found for the Commissioner on all points. Pursuant to s 138P of the TAA, the Authority made revised income tax assessments for the years in dispute (including shortfall penalties for gross carelessness). The Authority’s findings on each of the listed issues above are addressed in summary below.

#### Issue 1: Interest deductions

The Authority found that based on the disputant’s 2007 to 2011 tax returns he had an annual cash deficit of over $50,000 and was satisfied that some of the bank borrowings were used to fund personal living expenses. In the absence of sufficient evidence, the Authority found that the disputant had not discharged his onus of showing that the bank interest claimed as a deduction in each year was paid on capital utilised in earning assessable income in those periods.

#### Issue 2: White Road Property

The disputant contended that as he returned the rental income from this property as his own income, deductions in relation to the property should be allowed. In support of this proposition, the disputant gave evidence that the insurance invoices and rates assessments were in his and his brother’s names, as trustees of the MF Trust, and paid by the disputant using his credit cards. However, the Authority noted that the balances on the credit cards were then paid from the MF Trust’s bank account. The Authority was not satisfied that these accounts were paid by the disputant.

The Authority was also not satisfied for the purposes of s DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) that the disputant derived the rental income other than as a beneficiary of the MF Trust (ss HC 5, HC 6 and HC 7of the ITA). Accordingly, the Authority found it appropriate to amend the default assessments removing the deductions allowed in the default assessments for bank interest, insurance and rates relating to this property.

#### Issue 3: Depreciation

The disputant claimed depreciation for furniture and fittings, motor vehicles, carpet, stove, waste master and computers for the years in dispute. The Authority noted that there was no separate schedule detailing the individual items and/or other documents evidencing that these items were purchased for the rental properties and not for the disputant’s own residence. The Authority accepted the Commissioner’s reduced allowances for depreciation for each of the years in dispute.

#### Issue 4: Shortfall Penalties

The disputant contended that no tax shortfall arose because once his accumulated losses were taken into account, he had no taxable income in either of the years in dispute. The question before the Authority was whether the tax position taken by the disputant, in not filing tax returns by the due date, “overstate\[d\] _a tax benefit, credit or advantage of any type or description whatever_ by or benefitting…the disputant or another person. (Italics added).” (TRA Case 09/16 at \[66\])

On this point, the Authority concluded that the ability to accrue and carry forward tax losses thereby reducing the amount of tax payable on income earned in subsequent years is plainly a tax advantage to any taxpayer. The Authority was therefore satisfied that the disputant had taken a tax position that resulted in a tax shortfall in each of the years in dispute.

Taking into account the disputant’s accountancy background, experience as a consultant advising business clients and his failure to file returns by the due date after repeated requests to do so, the Authority found that his conduct was a deliberate breach of his tax obligations. The Authority found that the Commissioner had properly imposed shortfall penalties for gross carelessness for the tax years in dispute reduced by 50% for previous behaviour.

#### Issue 5: Amended Assessments

The Authority concluded that the Commissioner did the best she could in assessing the disputant’s taxable income when she prepared the default assessments based on the limited information she had at the time. However, the Authority held that as a consequence of the further information ascertained during the course of the proceeding as to the ownership of the White Road property, it was appropriate to adjust the assessments to remove deductions previously allowed in relation to that property. The Authority subsequently made revised assessments for the years in dispute pursuant to s 138P of the TAA.

This decision is subject to an appeal filed in the High Court.

Taxation Review Authority finds no taxable activity and upholds the Commissioner's GST reassessments and deregistration
=======================================================================================================================

2016 case note – TRA finds no taxable activity and upholds the Commissioner's GST reassessments and deregistration.

Case

TRA 007/15\[2016\] NZTRA 09

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: ss 6 and 52; Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This is a decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") upholding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") reassessments of the disputants' Goods and Services Tax ("GST") returns. The input tax credit claimed by the disputants was disallowed and the disputants' GST registration was cancelled from the dates that the disputants originally registered on the basis that the disputants did not have a taxable activity.

### Impact

This decision reaffirms that a taxable activity is necessary for a person to be registered for GST and entitled to claim input tax deductions. It also reaffirms the decision in _Case 7/2012_ (2012) 25 NZTC 1-019 that commencement work is not sufficient and does not create, or amount to, a taxable activity.

### Facts

The first disputant is an individual ("Mr S"). The second disputant is a company of which Mr S is the sole shareholder and director ("the Company"). The disputants filed GST returns claiming input tax deductions. The Commissioner took the position that the disputants were not engaged in any taxable activity in any of the relevant GST periods and reassessed the disputants' GST registration from the date of registration. The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties on each of the disputants for not taking reasonable care.

The disputants each challenge the Commissioner's reassessments and contend that they met the requirements to be registered for GST and are entitled to receive the GST refunds claimed. They also challenge the imposition of the shortfall penalties.

_Mr S_

On 27 January 2011 Mr S registered for GST with effect from 14 January 2011 for an activity described on the registration form as being "vineyard and farming". He stated on the form that his turnover in the previous 12 months was more than $60,000 and that he expected his turnover in the next 12 months would be greater than $60,000.

Mr S told the TRA that when he initially applied for registration he was proposing to develop two vineyards. The project was to be financed from various sources including overseas funders and from the repayment of a loan for $600,000.

Mr S claimed a GST refund of $1,267.17 for the period ended 31 August 2012. He wrote on the GST return "Purchasing grapes vineyard and winery". Mr S claimed a further refund of $17,795.80 in the period ended 30 September 2012. On the return for this period Mr S wrote "Start up of vineyard".

The Commissioner commenced an audit into Mr S's GST affairs in October 2012. In October 2012 Mr S advised that he had set up a company that would "handle most of my GST".

On 2 November 2012 Mr S requested his September 2012 GST return be amended to remove two tractors he had claimed costing $74,000 and $44,000 respectively. He advised that when the company was up and running he would purchase them through that entity.

In the period between June 2011 and January 2013 Mr S entered into around 40 agreements for the sale and purchase of wineries, vineyards and farms. The agreements were all conditional on finance being obtained. Either no deposit was payable or it was not payable until finance was arranged. None of these agreements settled.

In February 2013 The Commissioner wrote to Mr S advising that his GST registration would be cancelled with effect from the date of registrations and she disallowed all input claims made.

_The Company_

The Company was incorporated on 11 September 2012. On 11 October 2012, the Company registered for GST with effect from 1 October 2012. The business activity was described on the form as being "grow grapes/wine marketing". Mr S completed the form and stated that the Company's turnover in the previous 12 months was more than $60,000 and that its expected turnover in the next 12 months would exceed $60,000.

On 8 November 2012 Mr S provided the Commissioner with a copy of a business proposal for the Company. The proposal prepared by Mr S was for the purchase of established New Zealand vineyards. It was intended that the Company would be a parent company that would borrow the money and invest in various vineyards. These vineyards would be individually operated by separate entities to be wholly owned by the parent company. The proposal listed particular properties which it intended to purchase and sought a loan of $62 million.

On 20 November 2012 Mr S filed a GST return for the period ended 31 October 2012 on behalf of the Company. Purchases totalled $237,740.09 and an input tax deduction of $27,429.01 was claimed. The inputs included invoices for two motorbikes ($19,000) and a tractor ($186,875). The balance of inputs claimed related to private items and expenses previously claimed by Mr S in his individual GST return. Payment was never made on the farm machinery and the transactions were subsequently reversed.

Upon completion of the audit the Commissioner cancelled the GST registration of the Company with effect from the date of registration and disallowed all input tax deductions.

### Decision

The TRA found that there was no evidence that either Mr S or the Company had the financial resources to commence the stated business activities.

The TRA noted that Mr S told the TRA during the hearing that finance was principally to be provided by offshore funders. He said that his project had run into a problem because of a substantial shift in the exchange rate between New Zealand and the United States which meant an extra $22 million was required to finance the project. However, upon the evidence before it, the TRA did not put any particular weight on that oral evidence.

The TRA found that Mr S did not have sufficient funds to complete the purchases which he claimed in his August and September 2012 returns. Likewise, the Company was not able to complete the purchase of the motorbikes and tractor and the transaction was eventually cancelled by the supplier.

The TRA also noted that Mr S had told the TRA that he intended that the farm machinery would be leased out while the vineyard project was being developed. However, there was no evidence of any contracts having been entered into or any business proposal relating to the alleged activity.

The TRA agreed with the Commissioner's submissions that at best, the steps taken by each disputant could be described as preparatory steps towards the commencement of a taxable activity.

The TRA reaffirmed that commencement work is not sufficient and does not create or amount to a taxable activity. There still must be an activity to which those steps attach (The TRA referred to _Case 7/2012_ (2012) 25 NZTC 1-019). In this case, there was no activity which either disputant was carrying on continuously or regularly and which involved or was intended to involve the making of supplies to other persons for a consideration. Instead, Mr S and the Company had a rudimentary proposal for an ambitious development which they did not advance to any extent.

For these reasons, the TRA was not satisfied that the disputants were engaged in any taxable activity during the time that they were registered for GST. The TRA ruled that the Commissioner was correct to cancel their GST registrations and reassess their GST returns to disallow the input tax deductions claimed.

The TRA stated that the requirements for GST registration are not complicated. Furthermore, Mr S claimed to be experienced in GST matters. The TRA was satisfied that a taxpayer of ordinary skill and prudence would have recognised that there was no taxable activity and would have foreseen a reasonable probability or likelihood of a tax shortfall as a consequence of registering for GST in such circumstances and proceeding to claim input tax deduction. As such, the TRA did not consider that Mr S and/or the Company took reasonable care in taking their respective tax positions. On this basis, the disputants are liable for shortfall penalties of not taking reasonable care.

Taxation Review Authority finds sale of business took place at value stated by taxpayer and sets aside Commissioner’s reassessments

TRA 014/14 \[2016\] NZTRA 15

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("the TRA") has found that the sale of a business by the sole trader disputant to his company was in 2002 for the amount stated by the taxpayer. The taxpayer was reassessed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) on the basis the credits to his current account were deemed dividends and shortfall penalties were also imposed. The reassessments and shortfall penalties were set aside.

### Facts

In February 2002 the disputant sold the accountancy practice, which he operated as a sole trader, to his company ("the Company"). The Commissioner asserted that the amount paid for the practice was $425,000, as recorded in the Company’s 2002 financial statements. The Commissioner reassessed the disputant's income tax liability for the 2007 and 2008 tax years on the basis that certain credits made to his shareholder account with the Company were deemed dividends. The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties for failing to take reasonable care.

In this proceeding the disputant challenged these reassessments and the imposition of the shortfall penalties. He said that the purchase price was $2,000,000, and that instead of bringing the full amount of the goodwill into the Company's accounts in the 2002 year, he brought in $425,000. He contended that the credits in dispute (being $565,214 in the 2007 year and $725,000 in the 2008 year) were part of that purchase price, not dividends, and that the reassessments are statute barred in any event.

The goodwill payment of $425,000 was written off in the 2003 year. No further amounts were brought in and written off in the 2004, 2005 and 2006 years. In the Company’s financial statements for the 2007 year (“the First 2007 Statements”) the disputant brought in $850,000 (taking the goodwill to $1,275,000) and wrote off another $425,000. The disputant subsequently produced two further sets of financial statements for the 2007 year (the Second and Third 2007 Statements) and amended the financial statements for the 2006 year ("the 2006 Amended Statements"). In the 2006 Amended Statements the goodwill figure was increased to $2,000,000. The Third 2007 Statements were consistent with the 2006 Amended Statements.

In or about September 2007 the disputant’s family trust ("the Trust") purchased a beach property, funded by a $1,300,000 loan obtained by the Company from its bank. The loan was secured by a mortgage over properties owned by the Trust. Guarantees were provided by the disputant and the trustees of the Trust and another family trust. The funds were transferred to the disputant by way of repayment of the disputant's current account and then on-lent to the Trust.

The loan and repayment of the disputant's current account were recorded in the Company's financial statements for the 2008 year, filed with Inland Revenue on or about 5 September 2008.

Eventually all the mortgaged properties were sold by mortgagee sale. The loan was repaid but the equity in the properties was lost. The fee base of the accountancy practice was sold to another entity and the Company went into liquidation in 2013.

### Decision

Counsel agreed that this case turned on whether the disputant could meet the onus of proof on him of showing on the balance of probabilities that in 2002 he sold his accountancy practice to his Company for $2,000,000.

_Inconsistencies/Credibility_

The TRA observed that there were a number of inconsistencies in the explanations and documents supplied during the course of the investigation.

The TRA noted that, in many instances, the explanations initially given had been corrected and/or expanded upon in later correspondence and in the statement of position filed on behalf of the disputant. The TRA also observed that during much of the later period that this dispute was on-going, the disputant was dealing with an acrimonious marriage breakup, mortgagee sales of his family's assets and restructuring of his accountancy practice.

The TRA did not agree with the Commissioner’s submission that the disputant gave inconsistent and contradictory arguments in his evidence before the TRA. The TRA found that even though the disputant did not have a clear recollection of events and dates and was confused by questions in cross-examination, he was a credible and reliable witness.

Finally, the TRA did not accept the Commissioner's submission that it was not credible that a chartered accountant would have acted in the manner in which the disputant says he did. The TRA noted that the proceeding was not a negligence claim and the disputant’s conduct and performance of his professional duties were not matters for determination, although noting the disputant readily accepted that aspects of his accountancy work involving his own affairs were "sloppy".

_2002 Financial Statements and Journal Entries_

The disputant explained that it was his intention to bring the goodwill into the financial statements progressively and to then write it off. The $425,000 goodwill sum was written off in the 2003 tax year.

A page taken from the Company's computer generated journal for the 2002 year was produced. On the page there were debit and credit entries for $425,000 and for $1,575,000. The disputant gave evidence that he did not bring the $1,575,000 into the 2002 financial statements and that there were entries on the next page of the journal reversing out this amount. He explained that he had made these entries as a record of the goodwill which had still to be brought into the Company's accounts in later years.

The disputant’s previous lawyer had advised the Commissioner that entries reversing the entries relating to the $1,575,000 were made in 2008. The TRA found that this was not correct, finding that the accounting software used by the Company did not permit adjustments to the accounts years later and accepted the disputant’s evidence that the journal entries were made in 2002.

_Valuation_

The disputant valued the goodwill of the company at $2,000,000, fixing the value of the fee base at $1,400,000 and the in-house software at $600,000, but he did not obtain an independent valuation. A valuation prepared for the disputant by an independent chartered accountant for the purposes of the dispute process valued the fee base at $1,040,000 and, at the hearing, the expert witness for the Commissioner, Mr H, considered a valuation of goodwill of $425,000 would be acceptable. The TRA noted that she was not required to determine the correct value in this case but it was quite evident that the disputant’s valuation substantially overstated the goodwill value of the business.

_2006-2008 Financial Statements and 2008 Review_

The TRA accepted that the disputant chose to amend the financial statements for the 2007 year and to bring in all the goodwill in order to comply with the requirements of a practice review by the accountants' professional body in May 2008. The TRA did not agree with the Commissioner’s contention that the disputant amended the opening balance for the 2007 year in order to gain a tax advantage by funding the purchase of the beach property through the Company.

In the TRA’s view this contention overlooked that the disputant had already brought in further goodwill of $850,000 in the First 2007 Statements, taking the goodwill to $1,275,000. This action was consistent with an earlier sale at $2,000,000. The disputant then proceeded to write off the sum of $425,000 which, again, was consistent with the earlier write off in 2003 (and, in the TRA’s view, was not consistent with wanting to achieve the tax advantage alleged by the Commissioner).

The TRA stated that there was no evidence that the disputant had any intention of purchasing a beach property in the period in which the TRA found that the First 2007 Statements were prepared. The TRA observed that if there was such an intention, it begs the question as to why the disputant did not bring the amount of $2,000,000 into the financial statements at that time.

_Sale & Purchase Agreement_

The disputant gave evidence that he had located a copy of the agreement for the sale and purchase. The disputant provided the agreement for sale and purchase to the Commissioner with his statement of position dated 4 October 2013 and explained the circumstances in which the document had been located. The Commissioner’s Statement of Position identified a number of irregularities in the agreement. The Commissioner argued that the agreement was a fabrication which "the disputant had produced only recently".

The standard form sale and purchase agreement used was the second edition ADLS/REINZ form produced in July 1995. The TRA considered that it is unlikely that in 2012/2013 the disputant would have used the 1995 second edition of the ADLS/REINZ form, noting that the third edition came into force in or around March 2005. After carefully considering all of the evidence, the TRA accepted the disputant’s evidence that the agreement for sale and purchase was prepared and signed in 2002.

_Conclusion_

Taking into account the factual findings and the evidence overall, the TRA was satisfied that the disputant entered into an agreement with the Company in 2002 to sell his accountancy practice to the Company for the sum of $2,000,000.00. The full amount of this goodwill payment was brought into the financial statements of the Company in the 2006 Amended Statements. Accordingly, the TRA found that the disputed credits were part of the purchase price and were not dividends.

Having reached this view, the Commissioner’s reassessments for the 2007 and 2008 years were not correct and were set aside accordingly.

Taxation Review Authority grants an extension of time for service of Points of Objection Notice
===============================================================================================

2012 case note - Points of Objection Notices, exceptional circumstances, extension of time.

Case

TRA 27/08, 28/08 & 53/08; \[2012\] NZTRA 06

Legislative References

Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998, regulations 21(1), 23(a) and 25(1)

### Summary

This Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") decision was concerned with whether extensions of time for service should be granted for Points of Objection Notices issued by a tax agent on behalf of three taxpayers. The Points of Objection Notices were received by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue outside the statutory time period prescribed by regulation 21(1) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 ("TRA Regulations"). The TRA granted an extension of time for service to two of the taxpayers and declined the application of the third taxpayer.

### Facts

The three taxpayers involved in this proceeding had sought cases stated to the TRA under the old objection procedure. In each of these cases the taxpayers failed to serve timely Points of Objection Notices upon the Director of Litigation Management. The taxpayers had also failed to seek an extension of time from the TRA to file their Points of Objection Notices. The Commissioner took this failure as a preliminary point and asked the TRA to dismiss the objections.

On 28 April 2011 an interim ruling _Case 9/2011_ (2011) 25 NZTC 1-009 (TRA) was delivered by the TRA, on the issue of whether the three objectors should be granted an extension of time to file Point of Objection Notices on the grounds that "exceptional circumstances" under the TRA Regulations, regulation 25(2) existed.

In the interim ruling, the TRA found:

1.  The Points of Objection Notices were not served in time, as the time for serving a Points of Objection Notice ran from the date the taxpayer gave notice that it wanted a case stated and not from receipt of Points of Objection Notices from the Commissioner.
2.  The Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 did not require the Points of Objection Notices to be supplied by the Commissioner to the taxpayer.
3.  While the Commissioner provided an incorrect date for service, this did not affect the outcome as the Points of Objection Notice was still supplied out of time.

In the interim ruling, Judge Barber reviewed the law addressing what constituted exceptional circumstances. While he accepted (at \[64\]) that it is regulation 23 of the TRA Regulations that must be complied with, he considered that the incorrect address on Inland Revenue's Points of Objection Notice form and advice as to the time period for filing the form may amount to exceptional circumstances.

The TRA directed that the hearing be reconvened as more evidence was required.

### Decision

The TRA found as follows.

#### _Taxpayer 1_

The last day for Inland Revenue to receive the Points of Objection Notice was on 23 July 2008. The Points of Objection Notice was posted to the address on Inland Revenue's form supplied to the tax agent on 11 July 2008, but it was put by counsel for Inland Revenue that it was only received on 28 July 2008. Judge Barber stated that he had no reason to disbelieve the tax agent's evidence, and found that in the ordinary course of mail the Points of Objection Notice for taxpayer 1 must have been received by Inland Revenue well within time.

#### _Taxpayer 2_

The last day for Inland Revenue to receive the Points of Objection Notice seems to have been 16 July 2008. The tax agent stated that he posted the Points of Objection Notice on 15 July 2008, but it was only received by Inland Revenue on 18 July 2008. Judge Barber commented that in his experience of the ordinary course of New Zealand mail: "it is a little surprising that the Points of Objection Notice seems to have not been received by \[Inland Revenue\] on 16 July 2008". Judge Barber also considered that the arrangements for receipt of Points of Objection Notices by Inland Revenue were rather unsatisfactory and stated that he could not be sure that the Points of Objection Notice was not received until 18 July 2008.

#### _Taxpayer 3_

Judge Barber found that the Points of Objection Notice was posted well after the due date and that there seemed to be no meritorious explanation for the tax agent having got into that position.

Judge Barber noted his concern that the Points of Objection Notice forms supplied by Inland Revenue did not comply with the physical street address requirements in regulation 23 of the TRA Regulations. Judge Barber considered that if the Points of Objection Form had the correct physical address, then the tax agent may have arranged for personal service or couriering to that address. Further, Judge Barber considered that the tax agent could not have anticipated the confusion in arrangements for receipt of service of the Points of Objection Notices at Inland Revenue and that the tax agent appears to have complied with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct regarding the Points of Objections Notices for taxpayers 1 and 2.

Judge Barber held:

*   It may be stretching the point to find that there was an event or circumstance beyond the control of the particular disputant which reasonably justifies not filing the Points of Objection Notice in time; but that event of circumstances was to leave matters to the tax agent JGR and I have covered the reasons for his predicament. \[45\]

The TRA granted the necessary extensions sought by taxpayer 1 and 2, but declined the application for taxpayer 3.
