These programmes use income as one of the key ways of identifying those people in genuine need. How income is defined is crucial to the proper targeting of these social assistance programmes. This officials’ issues paper focuses on three social assistance programmes: Working for Families tax credits, student allowances and the community services card. The entitlements to these three programmes are based on the definition of “taxable income” in the Income Tax Act 2007. 1.2 Maintaining the integrity of these programmes is important for New Zealand to continue to have an effectively targeted social assistance system for those in genuine need. People should not receive different levels of assistance according to how they structure their affairs or the manner in which they receive income to live on – this is inequitable and inconsistent with social assistance objectives. Providing undue social assistance also costs money which must be found through taxes and government borrowing or reduced expenditure elsewhere. 1.3 As part of Budget 2010, as a first step to addressing integrity concerns regarding social assistance programmes, the Government excluded investment losses such as rental losses for the purpose of determining Working for Families (WFF) tax credit entitlements. 1.4 The Government also announced that it would reform the definition of “family scheme income” used for determining entitlements to WFF tax credits, student allowances and the community services card. 1.5 The purpose of this reform is to improve the integrity of social assistance programmes by, for example, countering arrangements that have the effect of inflating entitlements beyond what people’s true economic circumstances justify. This undermines public confidence in the social assistance system, which has a strong focus on equity and fairness. As part of the move to greater integrity, different types of economic income that have previously not been counted as family income, such as fringe benefits, would be included. 1.6 Any changes need to be properly targeted – changes should not include for social assistance purposes economic income that is not reasonably available to meet family needs. Moreover, any changes need to consider the compliance costs of extending the definition of income for this purpose. 1.7 The purpose of this paper is to broaden the definition of income used for these social assistance programmes. This would counter people structuring their affairs to inflate their social assistance and address gaps in the current definition of income. 2 1.8 The proposal in this paper is to include in the definition of “family scheme income” amounts involving: • trustee income; • fringe benefits; • passive income of children; • unlocked PIE income; • income of non-resident spouses; • exempt income; • main income equalisation scheme deposits; and • periodic payments. 1.9 The paper also proposes replacing the current definition of “parental income” for student allowance purposes with an expanded definition of “family scheme income”. 1.10 The expanded definition of income would also apply to people with dependent children who apply for the community services card. 1.11 The Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education have been consulted during the development of this issues paper. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS The definition of “family scheme income” would include: 1. Trustee income. This would include the net income from trading and investment activities of a trust (excluding beneficiary income) and the net income of a company controlled by the trust. The trustee income would be attributed to the individuals who are the settlors – as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 – of the trust. 2. Attributable fringe benefits. This would typically include fringe benefits that are substitutable for cash or household expenditure. Only attributable fringe benefits within the meaning of the fringe benefit tax rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 would be included in family scheme income. This would apply only to shareholder/employees who control the company for which they work. 3. Income of children. This would include passive income such as interest, dividends and beneficiary income directly received by dependent children above a threshold of $1,000 per annum per child. 3 4. Unlocked PIEs. This would include income from portfolio investment entities (PIEs) that are not sufficiently locked in, such as cash PIEs and listed PIEs. PIEs will be treated as sufficiently locked in if they are registered superannuation schemes, such as KiwiSaver schemes. 5. Income of non-resident spouses. This would include the worldwide income of a non-resident spouse. 6. Exempt income. Income that is exempt from income tax and that is in the nature of salary or wages, including salaries received by employees of international organisations such as the United Nations or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), would be included. Bonus bond prizes and similar payments from “save and win” bank accounts could be included as a part of this reform. 7. Main income equalisation scheme deposits. This would include deposits to a person’s main income equalisation scheme account. 1 Subsequent refunds (excluding interest) from main income equalisation accounts would not be counted for family scheme income purposes. 8. Periodic payments. This would include any periodic cash payments used by the person for income-related purposes. Working for Families The amended definition of “family scheme income” for WFF will apply from 1 April 2011. Student allowances The amended definition of “family scheme income” would be used to determine parental income for the purposes of student allowances. The new definition could apply to all new applications for student allowances from 1 January 2012. Community services card The amended definition of “family scheme income” would be used to determine income for WFF recipients who apply for the community services card. The new definition will apply to all new applications for the community services card from 1 April 2011. 1 See sections EH 3 to EH 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4 Submissions 1.12 Officials invite submissions on the proposed legislative solutions to include certain types of income for social assistance purposes. 2 Submissions should be addressed to: Social assistance integrity C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Social assistance integrity” in the subject line. 1.13 Electronic submissions are encouraged as this increases the efficiency of the analysis process. 1.14 The closing date for submissions is 24 September 2010. 1.15 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.16 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 2 Note that the Government is aware of a number of other issues relating to social assistance integrity. Although these issues are not included as a part of this reform, such issues can be the subject of future reforms. 5 CHAPTER 2 The issue of integrity 2.1 The New Zealand public values the social assistance programmes funded and delivered by the Government but requires that those programmes are accountable and that assistance is distributed fairly, reflecting genuine need. In short, the public requires integrity in these programmes. A social assistance programme has integrity if people receive the same level of assistance regardless of how they structure or receive their income. Integrity is compromised when not all of a family’s income is counted for social assistance purposes. This could be a result of the structures (for example, companies or trusts) used to conduct a person’s business or investment affairs or simply because certain types of income (for example, fringe benefits) are not included in the family’s income. Therefore, they may receive more government assistance than they otherwise would. The Tax Working Group specifically mentioned this issue in its recommendations. 3 2.2 The definition of income is therefore important in terms of meeting the policy objective of targeting assistance to those families in genuine need of government financial assistance. Policy framework 2.3 There are a number of possible conceptual approaches that could be taken to determine a household’s entitlement to social assistance. These approaches include: a cashflow approach based on a household’s ability to pay for day- to-day expenses, using the income tax definition of “taxable income”, and taxable income with adjustments. Cashflow approach 2.4 One approach is to adopt a cash concept of income for social assistance purposes, similar to that used in the Social Security Act 1964. Eligibility would be based on the proportion of a family’s economic income that is actually received and spent on day-to-day living needs. In this sense, it is a family’s cash receipts that are important. Even if a family takes measures to prevent it receiving cash, that income would still be included. Cashflows would include, for example, business drawings and any distributions from trusts. 2.5 However, adopting a cash concept of income for WFF purposes would introduce an entirely new concept of income and involve significant administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Much of the information required to measure cash receipts is not currently collected by Inland Revenue. It would also impose additional compliance costs on the recipients of WFF tax credits. Moreover, the cashflow approach is likely to be an inadequate measure when substantial business or investment income is involved. 3 See A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future: Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, January 2010 <http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf >. 6 Taxable income approach 2.6 This approach would involve using taxable income calculated under the Income Tax Act 2007 for determining social assistance entitlements. The definition of “taxable income” includes salary and wage income, business profits, dividends, beneficiary income and other benefit income (such as New Zealand superannuation). It does not include certain distributions from a trust or fringe benefits. 2.7 Taxable income is aimed at reflecting “ability to pay” for income tax purposes. But a more comprehensive definition of income may be thought desirable to ensure social assistance is more effectively targeted to low and middle income families. If entitlements were based on day-to-day living needs, taxable income would be a reliable proxy for those families that rely solely on a salary or wages. However, for families receiving other types of income, using the definition of “taxable income” may not fully reflect their available financial resources. Adjusted taxable income approach 2.8 In principle, under this approach entitlement to social assistance would be based on the proportion of a family’s economic income that is readily available for spending on day-to-day living needs. In practice, eligibility is based on the taxable income of the parents. This assumes that taxable income is a reliable proxy for economic income. 2.9 In some circumstances, such as when the majority of a family’s income is received as salary or wages, taxable income is a reasonable approximation of the economic income of the family, that is the total income available for day- to-day spending and to support family members. However in some instances it is not, notably when: • Income is not taxed in the hands of the family, rather it is taxed elsewhere. Two relevant examples are distributions from trusts and fringe benefits. The income of a trust may be taxed as trustee income and then distributed to families tax-free and not included as family income. The employer pays fringe benefit tax on behalf of the fringe benefits received by employees. • Income is explicitly exempt from taxation. For example, a salary from certain international organisations, such as the United Nations. 2.10 Therefore, adjustments need to be made to taxable income when it differs from the concept of the family’s economic income available for day-to-day living needs. This is the current approach to defining income for WFF tax credits purposes. However, the purpose of this reform is to improve social assistance integrity in relation to WFF tax credits, student allowances and the community services card. This can be achieved by legislating adjustments to taxable income to more closely reflect the income available to the family. 7 Current definition of income Working for Families tax credits 2.11 For WFF tax credit purposes, the definition of “taxable income” in the Income Tax Act 2007 is used as the basis for calculating family scheme income. 2.12 The adjustments that are currently made to taxable income include: • adding back certain income exempt from tax, such as child support, maintenance payments received and certain overseas pensions (maintenance or child support payments made by liable parents are deducted); • counting distributions of employer contributions from superannuation schemes while the employee is still working for the employer; • attributing any undistributed profits of a close company to shareholders; 4 • excluding any losses from qualifying companies; and • excluding any business losses and losses carried forward from previous years. 2.13 This concept of adjusted taxable income is defined as “family scheme income”. 5 2.14 As part of Budget 2010, losses from investments, including rental properties, will be also be excluded from 1 April 2011. 2.15 These adjustments are designed to convert taxable income (used to determine the amount of income tax a person pays) into a closer approximation of the income available to the family for daily living expenses. A more comprehensive explanation of the current family scheme income definition is contained in Appendix 1. Student allowances 2.16 The parental income test for student allowance purposes is based on the parent’s taxable income for income tax purposes. 6 If the parent is a non- resident for tax purposes, the test includes foreign-sourced income if that income is taxed overseas. The income test for students and their partners is administered along the lines of the Social Security Act 1964 definition of “income”. 4 The definition of “close company” is in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 5 Subpart MB of the Income Tax Act 2007. 6 Taxable income is the net income for the tax year after deducting any losses carried forward. 8 Community services card 2.17 Entitlement to the community services card for a person with one or more dependent children is based on the same definition of “family scheme income” used for WFF purposes. Any changes to family scheme income for WFF purposes in the context of this review would automatically flow through to community services card entitlement for this group. 2.18 For other groups, apart from superannuitants, entitlement is based on the Social Security Act 1964 definition of “income”. The income test for superannuitants is based on taxable income with adjustments made for overseas pensions and private pensions and annuities. 9 CHAPTER 3 Definition of “family scheme income” for Working for Families: proposed reforms 3.1 The gaps in the definition of “family scheme income” and the arrangements that raise social assistance integrity concerns and the proposed legislative solutions to include certain types of income as family scheme income for WFF purposes are discussed in detail below. The amended definition of “family scheme income” would apply to all applicants for WFF tax credits from 1 April 2011. 3.2 Any changes to family scheme income used for WFF purposes would also have an impact on determining entitlements to community service cards for persons with dependent children. Furthermore, this paper proposes that for student allowance purposes the current parental income test be replaced with the family scheme income definition. Trustee income The issue 3.3 Currently, the income of a trust can be taxed as trustee income at a final rate of 33% and the trust can later distribute this income to beneficiaries of the trust tax-free. While beneficiary income is taxable at the beneficiaries’ level, and therefore included for WFF purposes, the distributed trustee income is not included in the taxable income of beneficiaries. 3.4 The main integrity concerns involve a closely held family trust situation when the parents are settlors of the trust and can receive tax-free distributions from the trust. Although the distributed trustee income is used to meet the family’s living expenses, this income is not included for WFF purposes. The income of a trust can be earned directly by the trust carrying on a business or receiving investment income. A trust can also own a company that carries on a business. Business income 3.5 The common structure of a trust that owns a company running a business can have the effect of increasing WFF entitlements. The company’s net income is subject to company tax and then paid as a dividend to the trust, where it is retained and taxed as trustee income. Tax-free distributions from the trust subsequently made to beneficiaries are not included for WFF purposes. Therefore, the family receives the benefit of the business income although this is not reflected in their taxable income. For WFF purposes, a family’s entitlement would be based on the salary or wages received from the company and any beneficiary income received from the trust. 10 3.6 Another feature of the trust-owned company situation could involve a family member working for the company drawing a nominal salary. This structure inflates their WFF entitlements by reducing their taxable income while increasing the company’s net income, which is not currently attributed to them but which ultimately benefits them. Example 7 Peter and his spouse have two dependent children. Peter is the sole income earner in his family and earns $40,000 per annum working for Family Company. Peter is also a sole director of Family Company. Family Company is wholly owned by Family Trust. Peter is both the settlor and a trustee of Family Trust. Peter’s family are discretionary beneficiaries of Family Trust. The taxable income of Family Company is $200,000, on which it pays $60,000 tax. Family Trust receives a $140,000 imputed dividend from Family Company. Family Trust then distributes $120,000 (which has already been taxed as trustee income) to the family. The family receives $152,790 ($32,790 salary after tax + $120,000 distribution from Family Trust) excluding WFF tax credits, but the distribution from Family Trust is not counted for WFF tax credit calculation purposes. As a result, the family receives around $10,091 WFF tax credits per year. If the business income of Family Company were included in the family’s income, they would not be entitled to any WFF tax credits. This arrangement is illustrated in the following diagram: Family Trust NB: the trust does not distribute  any beneficiary income Family Company $200K taxable income  $140K  dividend $40K  salary INLAND   REVENUE $7,210 tax $6K tax  $60K tax $10,091 WFF  benefits $120K of  tax‐free  distribution  Beneficiaries of Family Trust Settlor 7 Note that the example takes into account WFF tax credit entitlements only. The WFF tax credit entitlements are calculated on the assumption that all children are under 13 years old and the figures are rounded. The tax rates and the WFF tax credit entitlements are based on the rates before 1 October 2010. 11 3.7 Interposing a trust between the closely held company and individuals circumvents the current rules for attributing retained income of a closely held company to its shareholders for WFF purposes. If a trust is inserted between the family members and the company, the attribution rules in section MB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 do not apply to the income of the company. 3.8 Similarly, if the family business is owned and operated directly by a trust rather than by individuals or by a company, the trading income of the trust which is taxed as trustee income is not included for WFF purposes. Investment income 3.9 Investment income, such as interest earned by a trust, that is taxed as trustee income and then distributed tax-free to beneficiaries is also currently not included for WFF purposes. Proposed solution 3.10 Trustee income, whether distributed to beneficiaries or retained by the trust, is available to meet day-to-day living expenses in the case of many family trusts. Therefore, trustee income in such closely held situations – including the net income of a company controlled by a family trust – should be included in a person’s family scheme income. 3.11 Attributing trustee income to individuals for WFF purposes is consistent with the current rule for attributing income from closely held companies. The attribution of trustee income should be limited to closely held situations because these are where the main integrity concerns arise. 3.12 For the purpose of determining the family scheme income of a person for an income year, if the person is a settlor of a trust, the following income would be included: 1. the trustee income (net income less income distributed as beneficiary income) of the trust in the income year; and 2. the net income of a company controlled by the trust would be included in the trustee income that is attributed under 1. 3.13 Accordingly, the trustee income of a trust, including the net income of a company controlled by the trust, would be attributed to the individuals who are the settlors of the trust. 3.14 The policy objective is to attribute trustee income to the individual(s) who directly or indirectly determine the application of the income or body of the trust. This individual is most likely to be the settlor of the trust. 12 Definition of “settlor” 3.15 The definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would be used for the purposes of this attribution rule. The term “settlor” has a wide meaning and is defined broadly as a person who transfers value to a trust. The definition of settlor is further extended by the provisions of section HC 28, the most significant of which are: • when a company makes a settlement, any shareholder with an interest of 10 percent of more in that company is treated as a settlor in relation to that settlement as well as the company itself; • when a trustee of a trust (the first trust) settles another trust (the second trust), the settlor of the second trust is treated as including any person who is a settlor of the first trust; and • when a person has any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust which enables the person to require the trustee to treat them (or a nominee) as a beneficiary of the trust, the person is treated as a settlor of that trust. 3.16 The definition of settlor is used extensively in the Income Tax Act 2007 and its wide meaning is consistent with the settlor-based focus of the trust taxation rules in that Act. 3.17 The definition of settlor, in conjunction with the nominee look-through rule in section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007, does not include professional advisors acting on behalf of clients and other persons such as friends and family members who simply allow their name to be listed as the settlor on a trust deed. The main focus of the definition is on persons who provide the trust property. It is therefore the client of the professional advisor, or the person the friend or family member is acting for, who would be treated as the settlor. 3.18 Because the focus of the proposed attribution rule is on closely held situations, charitable trusts would be excluded from the attribution rule. A charitable trust under the Income Tax Act 2007 is required to be registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005 and is therefore subject to the regulatory requirements of that Act. Similarly, any settlements for the benefit of local authorities should be excluded. 3.19 Registered superannuation schemes that are trusts should also be excluded from the proposed rule. This is because they primarily provide retirement benefits and accordingly their income is not available to meet current family living expenses. Unit trusts also would not be subject to this rule because they are treated as companies under the Income Tax Act 2007. 13 3.20 An exclusion could also be made for trusts where neither the settlor nor any member of the settlor’s family can be beneficiary without a Court order. Definition of “controlled company” 3.21 A company controlled by a trust (a “controlled company”) would be defined as a company in which the trustees and their associates hold 50 percent or more of the voting interests or market value interests (if there is a market value circumstance). 3.22 The amount of net income of a controlled company that is included in trustee income would be calculated according to the proportion of voting interests in the company held by the trust using the formula below: (trust’s voting interests/total voting interests) x company’s net income Other aspects of attribution rule 3.23 The attribution of a company’s net income would be restricted to controlled companies only. For example, if a trust is a shareholder in a widely held company, only the dividends from that company will be included in trustee income. Also, any dividend paid by a controlled company to a trust would not be included in trustee income to prevent double counting. 3.24 The proposed attribution rule is, in substance, similar to the current rule for attributing the retained income of a controlled company to the individual shareholders for WFF purposes. Both rules would target what are similarly closely held situations. Also, in Australia, an attribution approach is used to attribute income from closely held companies and trusts to individuals to determine their Income Support payments. 8 3.25 It should be noted that regular distributions from trusts would be separately included as family scheme income under the periodic payments rules described in paragraphs 3.87 to 3.94. However, the rules will ensure that the same income is not counted twice. 8 Income Support payments in Australia are equivalent to welfare payments paid under the Social Security Act 1964 in New Zealand. 14 Example of how the attribution rule would work in practice Following the previous example of Peter’s family situation, Peter is the settlor of Family Trust. Family Company is wholly owned by Family Trust. Family Company’s taxable income is $200,000 and it pays an imputed dividend of $140,000 to Family Trust. For WFF purposes, Family Company’s taxable income of $200,000 is attributed to Family Trust. The dividend of $140,000 paid to Family Trust is disregarded for WFF purposes to avoid double counting. Family Trust distributes $10,000 beneficiary income to Peter’s spouse. Consequently, under the proposal, trustee income of $190,000 is included in family scheme income. Peter also receives a salary of $40,000 from Family Company. This salary has been already deducted from Family Company’s taxable income. Therefore, Peter’s $40,000 salary is included separately in family scheme income. Peter’s family scheme income is $240,000 in total. Peter’s family would not be entitled to any WFF tax credits. This is illustrated in the following diagram: Family Trust Family Company $200K taxable income  $140K dividend  (disregarded) $40K  salary INLAND   REVENUE $7,210 tax $6K tax  $60K tax Attribute  $200K The family scheme income  of $240K.  (40K  salary +     190K trustee income + 10K  beneficiary income).   Beneficiaries of Family Trust Settlor Attribute  $190K $10K  beneficiary  income  15 Multiple settlors 3.26 In some situations, more than one immediate family may be involved in a closely held trust situation. For example, there may be several individuals who are settlors of a trust and have families of their own. In these situations, attributing all of the trustee income to each individual may not be justified since not all trustee income is available to meet each family’s living expenses. 3.27 For this reason, trustee income would be attributed to multiple settlors of a trust on a proportionate basis using the formula below: trustee income for an income year number of settlors of the trust 3.28 This approach precludes the compliance costs associated with having to track and value the settlements of each settlor. Alternative approach 3.29 An alternative approach would be to count only distributions of trustee income made by closely held trusts, rather than attributing all trustee income to settlors. The distributions to the beneficiaries would be included in their family scheme income. If this approach is adopted, the definition of distribution would be widely defined to include soft loans 9 and the purchase of assets from the family such as the family home and other personal assets. 3.30 However, a distribution approach could be partially circumvented by people only receiving large lump sum distributions once every few years. Although they may not qualify for WFF in the year of distribution, they could qualify in between years, while living off the lump sum distribution. This could be addressed by a rule allowing the Commissioner to look back two years and add back any lump sum distributions from the trust. 3.31 Applying the attribution rule in closely held situations is preferred at this stage because the attribution approach more accurately takes into account resources available to meet a family’s living expenses. In contrast, the alternative distribution approach captures only income actually received by the family and not income that is available to meet the family’s living expenses but is retained in the trust. Furthermore, the attribution approach avoids the problem of families recharacterising distributions of trustee income as, for example, soft loans. An additional disadvantage of the distribution approach is that it could capture distributions of capital, in particular, from a testamentary trust. 9 Related party loans where the interest or repayment is regularly deferred or written off. 16 Submission points • Are there any concerns with the proposed solution for attributing trustee income to the settlors of the trust? • Should the distribution approach be adopted instead? Fringe benefits received by employees The issue 3.32 Fringe benefits are currently not included in the definition of income for social assistance purposes because they are taxed to the employer rather than included in the employee’s taxable income. 3.33 Typically, fringe benefits are non-cash items of value provided to an employee in exchange for past, current or future employment. This includes a wide range of benefits from subsidised meals to motor vehicles. Not all fringe benefits are subject to fringe benefit tax (for example, some fringe benefits provided to an employee of a charitable organisation and those received and enjoyed on the employer’s premises are excluded). 3.34 In principle all fringe benefits, whether they are subject to fringe benefit tax or not, should be counted as family scheme income if they are easily substitutable for cash or household expenditure, such as the use of a motor vehicle. 3.35 However, including all fringe benefits provided to employees would impose high compliance costs on employers and employees when applying for WFF tax credits. The value of any benefits provided would need to be attributed to each individual employee applying for WFF tax credits. That information would then have to be provided to Inland Revenue by either the employer or employee. Such an attribution of all benefits is currently not required to comply with the fringe benefits rules because of the complexity, particularly with respect to shared or low-value benefits. Proposed solution What fringe benefits should be included in family scheme income? 3.36 To mitigate some of these compliance costs, only those benefits which are attributable to individual employees for the purposes of the fringe benefit tax rules could be included as family scheme income. Attributable benefits are significant benefits, many of which are easily substitutable for cash. 17 3.37 The advantage of including only attributable fringe benefits is that this exercise already occurs as part of existing compliance with the fringe benefit tax rules. The information should be readily available to the employer to provide to the employee and/or Inland Revenue for the purposes of calculating WFF entitlements. 3.38 Under the fringe benefit tax rules, the following benefits are attributed to employees: • motor vehicles; • low-interest employee loans; • subsidised transport (when the employer is in the business of transporting the public); • contributions to sickness, accident or death funds (and funeral trusts); • payments to insurance schemes; • employer contributions to superannuation schemes as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 (this excludes superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006); and • undefined benefits above a threshold of $2,000 per employee per annum. 3.39 Fringe benefits consisting of the provision of the private use of a motor vehicle and employee loans are attributed in all cases. The attribution of the above other benefits is required by employers if the benefit has a value to the employee of $1,000 or more in a year (except for undefined benefits which has a threshold of $2,000). 10 Employers have the option of attributing benefits below these thresholds. 3.40 Therefore benefits would only be included for WFF purposes if the employer attributes a benefit to an employee for the purposes of the fringe benefit tax rules in sections RD 47 to RD 49 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3.41 Employers would be required to provide information on attributable fringe benefits to employees for inclusion in their application for WFF tax credits. 3.42 However, attributing fringe benefits may not always provide a consistent and equitable treatment of income for WFF purposes. Employees may receive a fringe benefit that is incidental to their work. In such situations, the value of the benefit for WFF income purposes may be greater than the economic value to the employee. 11 10 Sections RD 47, 48 and 49 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 11 The calculation of the value of a motor vehicle as a fringe benefit does include some discount to reflect the lower economic value to the employee. However, this discount is a benchmark only and therefore may over- or under- estimate the actual value to the employee. See Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform, Wellington, 1982, Chapter 6, Appendix A (McCaw Committee). 18 3.43 As mentioned, not all benefits are subject to fringe benefit tax (for example, benefits which are enjoyed on the employer’s premises). This means even using attributable fringe benefits provided to all employees would create some inequity between employees. 3.44 This may occur if, for example, an employee is granted private use of a motor vehicle that is of greater value than they would themselves pay or that they seldom use for a private purpose. In this situation the value of the vehicle attributed to the employee is not an accurate reflection of their actual income. 3.45 On the other hand, a work-related vehicle can be used for transport to and from work without being classified as for private use and giving rise to a fringe benefit whereas a non-related work vehicle would give rise to a fringe benefit in such circumstances. 12 This creates an inequity due to the nature of the motor vehicle provided and the conditions of its use. 3.46 An example of how the value and availability of an employee’s motor vehicle could affect their WFF tax credit entitlements is provided below. Example Joe is employed as a regional sales manager. Joe is married and has three children under 13 years of age. Joe’s partner does not work or earn any income. Joe receives a salary of $70,000 and is provided a motor vehicle (cost price of $60,000 including GST) which is available at all times for private use. Under the current definition of income, Joe’s situation is as follows: Cash salary $70,000 WFF income $70,000 WFF tax credits $7,427 ($143 per week) If Joe’s attributed fringe benefits were affected by this proposal, his situation becomes: Cash salary $70,000 Attributed income from fringe benefit $17,909 (motor vehicle) WFF income $87,909 WFF tax credits $3,846 ($74 per week) Under the proposal in this paper, Joe’s entitlement to WFF tax credits decreases by $3,581 for the year. However, if the motor vehicle is a work-related vehicle and travel to and from work is necessary for, and a condition of, Joe’s employment, then travel from home to work is not treated as private use. The number of days the vehicle is available for private use would be reduced from 90 days for the quarter to 25 days. In this case, Joe’s WFF tax credits would only decrease to $6,432 ($123 per week). 12 See section CX 38 of the Income Tax Act 2007 on the meaning of a work-related vehicle. 19 Who should this proposal apply to? 3.47 Including attributable fringe benefits received by all employees may create inequity. There is a concern with the private use of motor vehicles, as illustrated in the example above. The valuation for other attributable fringe benefits is usually the market value of the goods and services provided or the actual contributions made. When a market value is readily available then the benefit to the employee is clear. There is the additional issue that not all benefits are subject to fringe benefit tax and therefore they may not be included as family scheme income. 3.48 It may therefore be more appropriate to include attributable fringe benefits as family scheme income only to the extent that the employee can clearly influence the nature of the fringe benefits they receive as part of their employment. 3.49 Under this approach, attributed fringe benefits would be included as family scheme income if the employee is also a shareholder. Although this would not capture the true income of employees in the wider sense, shareholders of closely held companies would no longer be able to reduce their income for WFF purposes by receiving fringe benefits. 3.50 It is, therefore, proposed that attribution of fringe benefits should apply only when the person applying for WFF is an employee of a company in which, together with associates, they hold 50 percent or more of the voting interests (or market value interests if a market value circumstance exists). 3.51 The reason for limiting the rule to closely held company situations is because a major shareholder is able to arrange for a substantial proportion of their remuneration to be paid as fringe benefits instead of wages. Usually, employees who do not have a controlling interest in the company have less influence over the composition of their remuneration. 3.52 Note that the attribution rule for trustee income in closely held company situations proposed in paragraphs 3.10 to 3.28 does not result in fringe benefits being included as WFF income. This is because the company obtains a deduction for expenditure on fringe benefits. A deduction reduces the net income attributed to family scheme income so the value of fringe benefits is not included. Therefore a separate rule for fringe benefits is required. What should be the value? 3.53 The value of the fringe benefit that should be included for WFF tax credit purposes is the tax-inclusive value of the benefit. This ensures that fringe benefits are included on a before-tax basis for WFF tax credit purposes. This is consistent with the treatment of salary and wages. Under the fringe benefit rules an employer calculates the tax payable on the value of attributed benefits and for WFF tax credit purposes this amount should be added to the value of the attributed benefits to give a tax-inclusive (gross) amount. 20 Salary sacrifice arrangements 3.54 Employees who enter into salary sacrifice arrangements with employers also have control over the make-up of their total remuneration package. Salary sacrifice is an arrangement whereby an employee is given an explicit choice of a cash salary or a reduced cash salary plus a benefit. A typical example would be when an employee can choose between a cash salary plus a motor vehicle or a higher cash salary. 3.55 In such instances the employee can make an explicit choice between the fringe benefit and cash as they are substitutes. Such arrangements are similar to remuneration received by a shareholder/employee and should therefore also be taken into account in family scheme income. However, there are wider issues relating to the tax treatment of salary sacrifice that need to be addressed such as the ability to receive fringe benefits that are not subject to fringe benefit tax. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the implications of salary sacrifice for WFF tax credit purposes as part of a wider review of salary sacrifice arrangements. Submission points • Should only attributable fringe benefits of shareholder/employees be included in family scheme income? • Should the fringe benefit tax rules that define and value attributable fringe benefits be used in determining family scheme income? • Will shareholder/employees be able to estimate the tax-inclusive value of attributable fringe benefits? Income of children The issue 3.56 Given that WFF tax credits are provided for the support of a family with dependent children, there is an argument that the children’s income should be included in family scheme income for WFF purposes. Currently, any income earned directly by children is not counted for WFF tax credit purposes. 13 Although the parents are responsible for meeting the day-to-day household expenses, some arrangements involving children can have an effect of lowering the income of parents to increase their WFF entitlements. Parents may allocate income directly to their children through family trusts and companies or place their investments directly under their children’s names. 14 This income can then be used to meet the family’s day-to-day expenses. 13 This consistent with the definition of “income for benefit purposes” under the Social Security Act 1964. 14 Some of these arrangements may be subject to anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. 21 Proposed solution 3.57 Not all income of children should be included as there are circumstances when reasonable earnings by children are not available for the family’s living expenses. The main concern is when there is a risk of parental income being disguised as the income of children. This income should be included in family scheme income. Wages 3.58 In general, wages of dependent children should not be included in family scheme income of parents. Wages earned by children are generally not used to meet a family’s day-to-day expenses. Also some protections are already in place in this area. If a child is under 16 years, they are required to be in full- time education by law, and their wages from occasional part-time work are limited by this requirement. If a child is 16 years or over and they earn significant wages, they would be treated as financially independent and their parents would not qualify for WFF tax credits. “Financially independent” is defined as being in full-time employment. 15 3.59 There is more scope for excessive wages to be paid to dependent children from a family entity (for example, a closely held company or trust). Parents could allocate income to their children circumventing the proposed rule for closely held company or trust situations. 3.60 However, including wages received by children in closely held situations only would raise equity issues. Children working for a family business would be treated differently from children working for any other business. Furthermore, anti-avoidance provisions could deter excessive wages or benefits being provided to children employed by a family business. 16 Passive income 3.61 Passive income, such as interest and dividends received by dependent children, should be included in family scheme income. Some protection is needed to address parents placing investments directly in the children’s name or arranging for children to receive distributions from family trusts and companies. If this income were derived directly by the parents, it would be counted for WFF purposes. 3.62 However, small amounts of passive income earned by the large majority of children are unlikely to be put towards the family’s living expenses. There would be relatively significant compliance costs for parents to declare small amounts of children’s passive income. Therefore only passive income above a threshold should be included as WFF income. The intention is to exclude modest amounts of income – for example, from children’s savings accounts. 15 See the definition of “financially independent” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 16 Sections GB 23, GB 24 and GB 44 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 22 3.63 The proposed rule for passive income received by children would have the following features: • Passive income received by a child would be included as family scheme income. The definition of “passive income” would be based on the definitions used in the former section LC 1 (relating to the low- income rebate) and section RE 2 (relating to resident passive income) in the Income Tax Act 2007. This definition of passive income would include interest, dividends, royalties, rents, a taxable Māori Authority distribution other than a retirement scheme contribution and a replacement payment under a share-lending arrangement. • Beneficiary income received by a child would also be included as family scheme income. However, the exclusions in the minor beneficiary rule (for example, for certain testamentary trusts) should also apply for this proposed rule for children’s income. 17 • A threshold of $1,000 would apply per child each year. This is currently the threshold that also applies in the minor beneficiary rule in the Income Tax Act 2007. 3.64 The rules for including children’s income in family scheme income would therefore be based on established principles in the Income Tax Act 2007. The minor beneficiary rule was introduced to prevent parents diverting income to children to avoid the top personal income tax rate and, instead, have such income taxed at the trustee rate. The rationale for including certain income of children in family scheme income is similar. Submission points • Are there any concerns with the proposed solution to include only passive income and beneficiary income of children? • Is the threshold of $1,000 per child for passive income and beneficiary income appropriate? Unlocked portfolio investment entities (PIEs) The issue 3.65 Income from portfolio investment entities (PIEs) is currently not counted for WFF purposes. This exemption is appropriate for PIEs that are mainly intended to provide retirement benefits and cannot be easily accessed. However, the exemption is not appropriate for unlocked PIE investments which are readily available to meet a family’s living expenses. Unlocked PIEs are where the funds are not sufficiently locked-in until a person’s retirement. Examples include cash PIEs, which are akin to on-call bank accounts, PIEs that are unregistered superannuation schemes and listed PIEs. 17 See section HC 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 23 Proposed solution 3.66 Income from unlocked PIEs would be included for WFF purposes. This income is analogous to direct income from investments such as interest earned on bank accounts that is currently included for WFF purposes. Specifically, attributed PIE income, as defined in the income tax legislation, earned from unlocked PIEs would be included in family scheme income. 3.67 Unlocked PIEs would be defined as all PIEs except superannuation schemes that are registered with the Government Actuary. Registered superannuation schemes must be established primarily for the purpose of retirement benefits. Therefore, if a scheme can be readily accessed to meet day-to-day expenses (for example, cash PIEs and listed PIEs), it should not be eligible to be registered with the Government Actuary. Submission points • Are there any concerns with the proposal to include income from unlocked PIEs in family scheme income? • Is a superannuation scheme’s registration with the Government Actuary an appropriate test for not including PIE income in the proposed family scheme income? Income of non-resident spouses 18 The issue 3.68 Eligibility for WFF tax credits is based on household income. In most circumstances, the carers of the children are resident in New Zealand and their combined New Zealand and overseas income is taken into account. 3.69 However, when one spouse resides overseas and the other spouse lives in New Zealand with the children – often receiving taxpayer-funded benefits such as education – the offshore income of the non-resident spouse may not be included in family scheme income. This is despite the offshore income being available and often used to support the children resident in New Zealand. Not including the non-resident spouse’s worldwide income increases the family’s entitlement to WFF tax credits. 3.70 Note that if the parents of the children are separated, any maintenance payments made by the non-resident parent to the resident parent are already included as WFF income. 19 18 For the purpose of this paper, a non-resident spouse means a person who is married to or in a civil union or de facto relationship with a person claiming WFF tax credits. 19 Under section CW 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, maintenance payments are referred to as a payment in the nature of maintenance out of money belonging to a person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner, or former spouse, former civil union partner or former de facto partner. 24 Proposed solution 3.71 Given that WFF is provided on the basis of household income, the worldwide income of both spouses should be included in family scheme income. Under this approach, the non-resident spouse’s offshore income would be included. This would ensure equitable treatment with families where both spouses live in New Zealand. Counting the worldwide income of both spouses also better reflects the economic income of these families. 3.72 Under this approach, the non-resident spouse would be required to provide evidence of their income from overseas. 3.73 An alternative approach would be to include only the remittances from the non-resident spouse in family scheme income. Remittances would include contributions towards a child’s education, mortgage payments and other household expenses. Identifying and measuring remittances may present some compliance and administrative challenges. 3.74 Furthermore, this approach takes into account only income received by the resident spouse and does not reflect the income actually available to the family. It is also less equitable relative to the treatment of resident families. 3.75 On balance, the worldwide income approach should be relatively simple to administer especially if proof of income is able to be obtained. Submission points • Are there any concerns with the proposal to include the worldwide income of a non-resident spouse in family scheme income? • Are there any compliance issues with this approach? • Should only remittances from the non-resident spouse be included instead? Exempt income The issue 3.76 Currently, some income that is exempt from tax, such as maintenance payments, is included in family scheme income on the basis that the income is available to meet the family’s day-to-day living expenses which the WFF scheme is designed to assist with. However, certain types of exempt income are not included even though they are available to meet the family’s living expenses. 25 Proposed solution Exempt income in the nature of salary or wages 3.77 Some salary or wages are exempt income and not counted as taxable income or family scheme income. An example would be salaries received by employees of international organisations such as the United Nations or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Note that at least one spouse, as well as any children, must be resident in New Zealand to claim WFF tax credits. Bonus bonds and similar “save and win” bank accounts 20 3.78 Bonus bonds prizes and prizes in “save and win” bank accounts are exempt income. They are similar in nature to other investments where the investor’s capital is low risk and returns on other investments are included in family scheme income. A key point of difference is that the probability of a return and the rate of return are both uncertain. In this they are similar to prizes from gaming (such as lotteries), which are also exempt from tax. However, they differ from gaming in that there is a reasonable expectation in gaming that the amount paid or bet will be lost. 3.79 Any return on bonus bonds or “save and win” bank accounts is economic income to the investor. Accordingly, bonus bond prizes and prizes in “save and win” bank accounts could be included in family scheme income. 3.80 Payments under life insurance policies entered into in New Zealand are exempt income. It is not currently proposed to include such payments in family scheme income other than annuities. However, this may be reviewed if it becomes evident that life insurance policies are being marketed and used to inflate social assistance entitlements. Submission points • Should salary and wages from international organisations that are exempt income be included in family scheme income? • Should bonus bonds prizes and prizes in “save and win” bank accounts be included in family scheme income? • Are there other types of exempt income that should be included in family scheme income? 20 These are accounts where the money deposited provides opportunity to win prizes, and where the level of interest earned is nil or significantly less than standard accounts. 26 Main income equalisation scheme deposits The issue 3.81 The main income equalisation scheme is intended to allow persons carrying on an agricultural, fishing or forestry business to smooth their incomes to address large fluctuations of income over several years. A deposit to a main income equalisation account is allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes. 3.82 By reducing their taxable income, deposits in these schemes also reduce their income for WFF purposes. This is income that was available to meet the family’s living expenses. Deposits into these accounts should not be recognised for the purposes of a family’s entitlement to social assistance such as WFF tax credits and student allowances. Proposed solution 3.83 Deposits entered in a person’s main income equalisation account should be included in family scheme income. To prevent double counting, refunds (excluding interest) from main income equalisation accounts would not be included in family scheme income. Deposits in adverse event income equalisation schemes would not be covered by this proposal. 3.84 The proposed solution is consistent with the treatment before the 2002–03 income year when a deduction was not allowed for family assistance tax credit purposes for deposits to main income equalisation accounts. Submission point Should deposits to a main income equalisation scheme account be included in family scheme income? Periodic payments The issue 3.85 Individuals may receive regular payments such as gifts, soft loans 21 from family members and trusts, or distributions of trustee income that are available to meet the family’s living expenses and are not captured by the income types mentioned earlier. Such periodic payments that are not subject to income tax in the hands of the individuals receiving them are not included in family scheme income. 21 Soft loans are loans with a discounted interest rate and/or lenient options for repayment. They are usually non- commercial loans between family members or family controlled entities. 27 3.86 Section MB 1(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 states that the Commissioner must have regard to income from all sources known to the Commissioner in calculating family scheme income. There is some uncertainty over what this provision actually captures. Including other periodic payments in the definition would reinforce this section and provide more certainty through a clearer rule. Proposed solution 3.87 Periodic payments that are used to meet the family’s living expenses should be included in family scheme income. 3.88 A definition similar to that used for welfare payments in the Social Security Act 1964 could be adopted for WFF purposes. However, any definition needs to be properly targeted and not include economic income that is not reasonably available to meet family needs, or which has high compliance costs to measure and report. Family scheme income would be defined to include any periodic cash payments received and used by the person for income-related purposes. 3.89 This definition would include various types of regular payments received by individuals that are used to meet day-to-day living expenses. It would include any regular cash gifts, payment of expenses or distributions received from trusts. 3.90 Regular or periodic would mean an expectation that the payment would be more than a one-off payment and could include annual payments. A regular payment would be considered to be used for an income-related purpose if it is: • replacing lost or diminished income; or • maintaining the applicant or their family; or • purchasing goods or services (commonly paid for from income) for the applicant or their family; or • enabling the applicant to make payments that they are liable to make and that are commonly made from income. 3.91 Examples include a person receiving payments from an income-related insurance policy, other than life insurance, to cover loss of employment income, or receiving payments from a family member to supplement income. Other examples include payments received to meet essential living costs such as rent, servicing a mortgage, food, power and clothing or to pay hire purchase accounts, insurance payments or fines. It also includes when a person’s regular expenses are directly paid for by a third person, such as paying utility bills directly. 28 3.92 Any one-off capital payments would be excluded, such as payment from the sale of a house. In addition, the following types of income or payments would be excluded: • Any payments that have specific purposes other than income-related purposes such as funeral grants, educational scholarships, lump sum ACC compensation payments, non-taxable payments under the Social Security Act 1964, charitable distributions or compensation-type payments. • Any student loan payments under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, including the living costs component of student loans. • Any specified item or amount of income, or income from a specified source, that is declared not to be income for the purposes of the Social Security Act 1964 by regulations made under section 132 of that Act, such as payments to victims of crime. • Periodic payments received from the repayment of loan principal or when the recipient of the sale of an asset is paid in instalments. • Payments that are already included under another family scheme income provision, to avoid double counting. 3.93 In other definitions of income, such as the definition used in the community services card rules, there are exclusions for 50 percent of private pensions received and 50 percent of annuities. The rationale is that some portion of these payments is the return of the original capital investment rather than income, when the capital is returned on a periodic basis rather than as a lump sum. A question arises whether a similar exclusion should apply here. 3.94 A question also arises whether to include the regular forgiveness of interest or the principal on a loan, particularly on soft loans between family members. The rationale is that by forgiving interest or debt that would otherwise be paid, usually out of income, it increases the amount of income the family has to use for other purposes. Submission points • Are there any concerns on the proposed solution to include periodic cash payments in family scheme income? • Are there any other types of income or payments that should be excluded from the above definition, such as 50 percent of annuity payments or private pensions? • Should periodic forgiveness of interest or the principal on a loan be included in the definition of “periodic payments”? 29 CHAPTER 4 Student allowances 4.1 Student support (student loans and allowances) is intended to reduce financial barriers to participation in tertiary education. Government funding for student support is substantial but not unlimited, so student allowances are targeted at those who need them most. The student allowance parental income test reflects the Government’s expectation that parents who can afford to should provide financial help to their children in tertiary study into their mid-20s. This expectation is shared by the governments of most developed countries. 4.2 As part of the reforms outlined in this paper, the new definition of “family scheme income” discussed in chapter 3 could be adopted as a more appropriate method for determining the parental income for student allowances. Current income tests 4.3 Student allowances are administered by StudyLink, which is a service line of the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). 4.4 To determine eligibility for student allowances, a number of income tests are used, depending on circumstances. These income tests are the student’s income, their spouse’s income and parental income. 22 Students are currently required to provide income details to StudyLink. 4.5 The definition of “parental income” is based on taxable income as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. Taxable income is a person’s assessable income (wages, salary, interest etc) after deductions and any losses. The adjustments made to taxable income for WFF purposes are not made for the purposes of student allowances, that is, the student allowance regulations do not refer to family scheme income. However, unlike family scheme income, the parental income test for student allowances includes the parents’ worldwide taxable income regardless of whether the student’s parent(s) are resident or not. 4.6 Taxable income was adopted because, for families reliant substantially on a salary or wages, it is a reliable proxy for determining a family’s ability to pay for regular outgoings and reduced some of the compliance costs of applying for a student allowance. However, for some parents it is not a true reflection of their economic circumstances and ability to support the student while studying. 22 There are specific rules concerning when a spouse’s income or the parental income is considered in a student allowance application. 30 The issue 4.7 Since the parental income relies solely on the definition of taxable income with adjustments for non-resident worldwide income, similar problems arise as mentioned in chapter 3. Accordingly, parents may earn income through closely held arrangements involving trusts and companies or receiving other types of income mentioned in chapter 3 without impacting the student allowance eligibility of their children. 4.8 In comparison, the student whose parents rely substantially on salary or wages and are unable to use alternative arrangements may not qualify for student allowances. If these two families’ economic income is the same, there would be a lack of horizontal equity as entitlement becomes based on the ability to divert income through different arrangements rather than the ability to meet expenses. Lack of equity undermines public confidence in the integrity of student allowances. As more people become aware of such arrangements, more are adopting them, while other parents feel they are being treated unfairly. Reviewing the definition of “parental income” responds to this growing level of concern from the public. Proposed definition of “parental income” 4.9 The proposal is to replace the current taxable income definition by amending the student allowance regulations to refer to the definition of family scheme income in the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed changes to the definition of family scheme income, referred to in chapter 3, would also apply. This would more accurately reflect the family’s economic income and better reflect their ability to provide financial help for their children undertaking study. 4.10 An alternative option would be for the parental income test to use the Social Security Act 1964 (SSA) definition of “income”. It captures all money received that is not a one-off capital payment. It includes the value of payments in kind and services provided. Particular payments are listed as being included or excluded from the definition. 23 The SSA definition is more focused on cash received rather than income available and may not include income being held in a family trust or company, for example. However, the SSA reinforces this definition by making further adjustments when a person is considered to have deprived themselves of income, such as if they invested in loss-making assets or shifted income-generating assets into a trust or company. 4.11 All other criteria for student allowances would remain unchanged, including the income test applying to the student and/or spouse. 23 See section 3 of the Social Security Act 1964. 31 When would the new definition apply from? 4.12 Student allowances relate to the academic year which generally runs from January to December, while the tax system measures annual income for the year ending 31 March. While the proposals are intended to take effect from 1 April 2011 for the WFF tax credit, it is proposed that they apply to student allowances from the start of the academic year. An implementation date is yet to be determined although it may be applied to applications for the academic year starting 1 January 2012. This would measure parental income for the tax year 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011. Submission point Should the parental income test be aligned with the proposed new family scheme income definition or the Social Security Act 1964 definition of “income”? 32 CHAPTER 5 Community services card 5.1 The purpose of the community services card is to assist low-income families and individuals with some of their costs of health care, by providing cheaper access to certain health care (such as prescriptions if the cardholder does not belong to a Primary Health Organisation, after-hours doctor visits and visits to a doctor who is not the cardholder’s regular doctor). Current income tests 5.2 To identify low-income individuals, the community services card uses multiple tests of eligibility. 5.3 For families with dependent children who receive WFF tax credits, the community services card rules refers to the definition of “family scheme income” as a basis for determining eligibility. A further adjustment is made to add-on the amount of WFF tax credits received, and then eligibility is measured against income thresholds. The income thresholds reflect family size. 5.4 Beneficiaries qualify automatically. Income thresholds apply for other groups. The income test for superannuitants refers to taxable income with adjustments made for overseas income, private pensions and annuities. Students and people without dependent children must meet an income test based on the Social Security Act 1964 definition of income. Proposed new definition of “family scheme income” 5.5 Any proposed changes in chapter 3 to the definition of “family scheme income” would apply to families with dependent children who receive WFF tax credits. These changes would automatically affect their eligibility for the community services card. 5.6 The remaining criteria for the community services card, including the income tests for superannuitants, students and people without dependent children, would remain unchanged. When would the new definition apply from? 5.7 Currently, the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) administers the community services card. Inland Revenue provides information on families receiving WFF tax credits directly to MSD through an information data- match arrangement. This enables MSD to determine eligibility for this group. 33 5.8 The new definition of “family scheme income” would similarly be provided through this data-match. The existing process for applications and approval would remain unchanged. 5.9 Therefore, the proposed definition would come into place from 1 April 2011 at the same time as for WFF tax credits. It would apply to all new applications and all reapplications for the community services card from 1 April 2011. Existing cards would continue to be valid until the date of their expiry. Submission point Are there any concerns with the proposed new definition of family scheme income being used for families applying for the community services card? 34 APPENDIX 1 Calculation of family scheme income for Working for Families tax credit purposes Assessable income derived at uniform daily rate When determining a person’s family scheme income in a relationship period 24 in an income year, assessable income derived from employment or an income-tested benefit is treated as derived at a uniform daily rate during the period of employment or period the benefit was received. All other income is treated as derived at a uniform daily rate throughout the income year. Any expenditure incurred in deriving the income from other sources that is allowed as a deduction is also treated as incurred at a uniform daily rate during the income year. Adjustments to a person’s net income (or net loss) for family scheme purposes To calculate a person’s family scheme income, the following adjustments are made to a person’s net income (or net loss): • include an amount of exempt income from overseas pensions (section CW 28(1)(e)) and child support and maintenance payments (section CW 32) derived by the person in the income year. • exclude the following income (or loss): 1. an amount of a tax loss of a qualifying company that is attributed to the person as a shareholder of the qualifying company under sections HA 20 and HA 24 (which relate to the treatment of tax losses of loss attributing qualifying companies); 2. an amount of income attributed by a portfolio investment entity that is not excluded income of the person; 3. an amount of retirement scheme contribution that is not excluded income of the person and would be their excluded income in the absence of section CX 50B(2) (contributions to retirement savings schemes); 4. loss incurred in carrying on a business: If a person carries on 1 or more businesses in a year, the income of each business must be calculated separately. If a net loss is the result of this, the net loss is treated as nil; 25 and 5. investment losses (from 1 April 2011). • deduct an amount of any child support or maintenance payments made by the person during the income year (section CW 32) and any liable parent contributions made under section 256 of the Child Support Act 1991. 24 A “relationship period” means an unbroken period in a tax year, whether the period consists of some or all of the days in the tax year. 25 If the Commissioner considers that two or more businesses are of the kind that are normally carried on in association with each other, the businesses are treated as a single business. 35 Other income included The following amounts are included as family scheme income: • major shareholders’ portion of retained earnings of close companies; • certain distributions from superannuation schemes and retirement savings schemes. Major shareholders’ portion of retained earnings of close companies When a person is a major shareholder in a close company 26 on the last day of the company’s balance date for financial purposes, the person’s family scheme income includes an amount calculated using the formula – (Person’s shares 27 /company’s shares 28 ) x company’s income 29 If the company has paid the major shareholder a dividend in the income year, the amount calculated under the above formula is reduced by the total dividends paid by the company to the shareholder for the income year. Distributions from superannuation schemes When a person receives a distribution from a superannuation scheme to which an employer has contributed, that distribution will be included in the family scheme income for the tax year or years that corresponds to the income year or years that the contributions were made, if: • the employer’s contributions to the superannuation scheme were made in – the income year in which the distribution was received; or – the 2 income years immediately before that income year; and • the person continues to work for the employer for 1 month or more after the date of the distribution. The amount does not include an amount attributable to a contribution by the person as a member of the superannuation scheme. No adjustment is required if the distribution from a superannuation scheme is made as a result of and on or after the person’s retirement from employment with an employer who was a contributor to the scheme. 26 “Close company” means, at any time, a company at the time there are 5 or fewer natural persons the total of whose voting interests or market value interests (where a market value circumstance exists) in the company is more than 50 percent (treating all natural persons associated at the time as 1 natural person). Close company does not include a special corporate entity. A “major shareholder” is a person with a 10 percent or greater shareholding in a close company. 27 “Person’s shares” is the number of shares issued by the company and held by the person, excluding fixed-rate shares, on the last day of the company’s accounting year. 28 “Company’s shares” is the number of shares issued by the company, excluding fixed-rate shares, on the last day of the company’s accounting year. 29 “Company’s income” is the net income of the company for the company’s accounting year. 36 Distributions from retirement savings schemes A person’s family scheme income includes distributions from retirement savings schemes in the income year in which the distribution is made if that person: • receives a distribution of a retirement scheme contribution from a retirement savings scheme in an income year; and • retirement scheme contribution tax has been withheld from the contribution; and • at the time of the distribution, the person is not eligible for New Zealand superannuation and eligible for a distribution of a retirement scheme contribution from a retirement scheme contributor. Other adjustments to income Adjustments for period that is less or more than 1 year If a person is returning income for tax purposes for a period which is greater than or less than a year, their family scheme income must be adjusted by an amount calculated using the formula – person’s family scheme income x 365/days 30 Historical adjustments Adjustments are also required where income is spread into a year or where depreciation recovered is received from the sale of a building if the year the income was spread from or the year the depreciation was originally claimed was before 2004. 30 “Days” is the total number of days in the period for which the income has been derived. 37 APPENDIX 2 Glossary of terms Family credit income Used for the purpose of a family’s eligibility to community services card, family credit income is the combination of family scheme income and the amount of working for families tax credits received by the family. Unlocked PIEs Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) are a form of collective investment vehicle such as superannuation schemes where a number of investors combine resources to make investments. PIEs have an optional set of tax rules that allows investors to be taxed, usually at their marginal tax rate, as if they had made the investment directly. PIEs may be “locked in” when the rules for the investment prevent a person from removing their funds before retirement (other than in specific restricted cases such as serious financial hardship or first home deposits). In comparison, unlocked PIEs allow an investor to remove their funds at any time, or before retirement. Some PIEs, known as cash PIEs, can operate similar to term deposits or bank savings accounts. All KiwiSaver funds that are PIEs are locked-in. Beneficiary income Income that vests absolutely in a beneficiary in the income year it is earned or income paid to a beneficiary in the income year or by the later of 6 months after the end of the income year or the date that the trust return is required to be filed. Beneficiary income is taxed to the individual at their marginal rate and is included as part of their taxable income. However, beneficiary income of minors is generally taxed as trustee income. Economic income One concept of economic income is that it is income available to an individual or family to use to maintain a standard of living or meet living expenses, and includes money, services and/or goods. Excluded income Income that is not subject to income tax because it has been taxed elsewhere. Defined in subpart CX of the Income Tax Act 2007. This includes fringe benefits, which are taxed when provided by the employer. Exempt income Income that is not subject to income tax as it has been taxed previously or elsewhere, or the government has decided not to collect tax from this source. Defined in subpart CW of the Income Tax Act 2007. Examples include child support payments received, income declared to be exempt under other Acts of Parliament such as accommodation supplement payments, or reimbursement of relocation expenses when someone is reimbursed by their employer for the costs of shifting to start or continue work. Family income or family scheme income Income available to a family to meet their living expenses and defined for the purpose of calculating entitlement for Working for Families tax credits in subpart MB of the Income Tax Act 2007. 38 Main income equalisation scheme This scheme enables an eligible person to level out their income from year to year by making income equalisation deposits with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and allowing an income tax deduction for the amounts deposited. Deposits are included in the person’s income when withdrawn. The persons eligible to use the scheme are those carrying on an agricultural, fishing or forestry business. The main income equalisation scheme is separate from the adverse event income equalisation scheme. Parental income Income of the parents of a student applying for Student Allowance, as defined in the Student Allowance Regulations 1998. Taxable income Taxable income, as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, is a person’s net income for a year after deducting losses carried forward. Includes wages and salaries, interest, and dividends among others. Trustee income Income of a trust that is not beneficiary income. Trustee income is taxed at the trustee rate of 33%. It can be later distributed to beneficiaries tax-free and is not counted in the beneficiary’s taxable income. Worldwide income Income earned in New Zealand or elsewhere in the world. Currently a person applying for WFF and their spouse must declare their worldwide income if they are New Zealand tax residents.
International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Singapore for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 2 International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Singapore for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends that the House take note of its report. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Singapore for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 31 March 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Singapore for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Executive summary 1 The Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Singapore for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, and its accompanying Protocol (collectively, “the new Singapore DTA”) has been negotiated to replace an existing agreement (“the existing DTA”) that dates back to 1973. The existing DTA is framed using antiquated terminology and language, has higher withholding tax rates on interest and royalties than most of New Zealand’s other DTAs, and is generally not providing the levels of certainty and protection to businesses that might be expected from a more modern DTA. Given that Singapore is one of New Zealand’s more important trading and investment partners, the inadequate nature of the existing DTA has become increasingly problematic over recent years. 2 The new Singapore DTA adopts more modern language and will provide greater certainty for persons engaged in cross-border income earning activity between New Zealand and Singapore. The allocation of taxing rights under the two agreements for the most part remains unchanged. However, withholding tax rates on dividend, interest and royalties have been reduced in line with New Zealand’s new, wider strategy on treaty withholding tax rates. The dividend withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the dividend is paid to a company that directly owns at least 10 percent the voting power of the company paying the dividend. The interest withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent. In the case of royalties, the withholding tax rate has been reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent. The exchange of information provisions of the new Singapore DTA have been updated to the new OECD standard (this will mean, for example, that information held by banks in Singapore will now be subject to full information exchange). The new Singapore DTA will therefore enhance the ability of tax officials to detect and prevent tax avoidance and evasion. The tax sparing provisions of the existing DTA have been rolled over to the new Singapore DTA, but will terminate after a ten year period. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 3 The new Singapore DTA was signed in Singapore on 21 August 2009. Subsequent to signature and completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, it is proposed that the new Singapore DTA be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 5 Council, and brought into force, in accordance with Article 25, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirm completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force in each country. The new Singapore DTA will enter into force on the date of the later of the two diplomatic notes. 4 As Singapore has not completed the necessary legislative reform to give effect to the exchange of information article, the new Singapore DTA contains a provision which allows Singapore to delay entry into force of the exchange of information article until it has completed the necessary legislative reform. In such circumstances the exchange of information provisions of the existing DTA will remain in force for Singapore until the legislative reform is complete, at which point the exchange of information provisions of the new Singapore DTA will enter into force. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 5 New Zealand currently has 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in force. This includes a DTA with Singapore that was negotiated in 1973. DTAs are principally designed to reduce tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. They do this by providing certainty of tax treatment, eliminating double taxation, reducing withholding taxes on cross-border investment returns, and exempting certain short-term activities in the host state from income tax. DTAs also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion, primarily by establishing a mechanism through which the tax administrations of the two countries can obtain information (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information) from each other. 6 Singapore is one of New Zealand’s more important trading and investment partners. The latest trade figures available show that in the year to December 2007 New Zealand exported goods worth NZ$690 million to Singapore and Singapore exported goods worth NZ$1.914 billion to New Zealand. Singapore is also an important source of investment for New Zealand, with foreign direct investment from Singapore in 2007 totalling NZ$1.636 billion. With these levels of trade and investment, it is important for New Zealand to have an effective and modern double tax agreement in place with Singapore to facilitate the continuing trade between our two countries. 7 The existing DTA with Singapore, however, is now showing its age. It is currently our second oldest DTA, and is framed using antiquated terminology and language, has higher withholding tax rates on interest and royalties than most of New Zealand’s other DTAs, and is generally not providing the levels of certainty and protection to businesses that might be expected from a more modern DTA. 8 The new Singapore DTA will provide increased levels of certainty and protection for tax residents of either country deriving income from the other country. The basic allocation of taxing rights under the two agreements for the most part remains unchanged. However, withholding tax rates on dividend, interest and royalties have been reduced. The dividend withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the dividend is paid to a company that directly owns at least 10 percent the voting power of the company paying the dividend. This is consistent with New Zealand’s new, wider strategy of seeking to reduce withholding tax rates on non- portfolio dividends in DTAs. The interest withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 6 percent to 10 percent. In the case of royalties, the withholding tax rate has been reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force 9 The advantages to New Zealand of the new Singapore DTA entering into force are:  DTAs are generally designed to foster increased trade and investment. Singapore is a key trading and investment partner. It is important to New Zealand’s interests that the DTA between New Zealand and Singapore remains up to date and relevant to the prevailing business environment. The new Singapore DTA will update existing arrangements to ensure that the DTA provides modern levels of certainty and protection with respect to cross-border income earning activities between the two countries. In particular, the fact that the provisions of the DTA now substantively follow those of the OECD Model Tax Convention will mean that the Commentary to the OECD Model will apply. This will facilitate improved consistency in the interpretation and application of the DTA provisions.  The allocation of taxing rights under the new Singapore DTA largely remains unchanged from existing arrangements. However, withholding taxes on dividend, interest and royalties will be reduced to be more in line with New Zealand’s new standard DTA rates. The dividend withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the dividend is paid to a company that directly owns at least 10 percent the voting power of the company paying the dividend. The interest withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent. In the case of royalties, the withholding tax rate has been reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent. The new Singapore DTA has anti-abuse provisions which are aimed at preventing persons who are not entitled to the low treaty withholding tax rates from gaining access to those low rates.  Tax administrations are privy to sensitive financial and personal information. This information is held subject to strict confidentiality requirements. DTAs override these confidentiality rules and ensure that tax administrations can request from each other information that will assist in the prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The new Singapore DTA improves the existing information exchange arrangements with Singapore, in that the new Singapore DTA now allows for total unrestricted exchange of information. This will allow New Zealand access to information that had previously had been denied under the existing DTA. In particular, New Zealand is now able to request bank information from Singapore. Note that information obtained under DTAs remains protected, as it can only be disclosed to specified persons and may only be used for authorised purposes. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 7  The existing DTA contains “tax sparing” provisions. It was entered into at a time when New Zealand DTA policy was to include tax sparing concessions in DTAs with developing countries. Singapore at that time was a developing country. The practice of taxing residents on their worldwide income can nullify tax concessions offered by developing nations to attract inward investment. An investor pays less foreign tax because of the concession, but also gets a smaller credit to set against their home tax liability. As a result, the tax foregone (“spared”) by the developing nation is effectively clawed back by the state in which the investor is resident. 1 The tax sparing provisions in the existing DTA counteract this by requiring New Zealand to give a credit as if foreign tax had in fact been paid. For a number of reasons, New Zealand has a policy of no longer including tax sparing provisions in its DTAs. The new Singapore DTA imposes an end date on the existing tax sparing arrangements. After ten years, the tax sparing arrangements will expire. The new Singapore DTA therefore terminates the existing tax sparing arrangements (after ten years). 10 The disadvantages to New Zealand of the new Singapore DTA entering into force are:  New Zealand will forgo some revenue from the reduction in withholding tax in dividend, interest and royalties. This revenue cost will be offset to some extent by the reciprocal reduction of Singapore’s withholding taxes on interest and royalties derived by New Zealand residents from Singapore, and the resulting reduced need for New Zealand to provide foreign tax credits. However, as investment from Singapore into New Zealand exceeds investment from New Zealand into Singapore, New Zealand will suffer a net revenue loss.  The new Singapore DTA includes an obligation on New Zealand, if we ever agree to lower withholding tax rates on dividends, interests and royalties in another DTA, to re-enter negotiations with Singapore with a view to amending the new Singapore DTA to include similar lower rates. Thus, the contingent obligation on New Zealand may potentially lead to further reductions in withholding tax rates in the new Singapore DTA, and consequently to a further reduction in New Zealand revenue. 2 11 Not signing or otherwise progressing the new Singapore DTA to entry into force is an option. However, in that case the potential benefits to New Zealand in terms of a modernised tax treaty, increased certainty of tax treatment, unrestricted information exchange, and a cap on New Zealand’s obligations to provide tax sparing credits, will be foregone. Also the current very high withholding rates on interest and royalties will continue to apply. 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude the new Singapore DTA. 1 New Zealand’s international taxation rules are currently being amended to exempt the offshore active income of controlled foreign companies. This will reduce the “claw-back” effect of New Zealand’s taxation rules, and may make tax sparing a less significant issue for New Zealand in the future. 2 It will be unlikely that the MFN clause will be triggered in the near future as the withholding tax rates in the new Singapore DTA are generally in line with New Zealand’s new treaty policy. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 8 Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position for reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 13 The new Singapore DTA will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it will impose are on the respective Governments, restricting their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis and requiring the provision of assistance in the exchange of information in relation to tax matters. The new Singapore DTA will not require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. 14 Where income is derived from one country (“the country of source”) by a tax resident of the other country (“the country of residence”) the country of residence generally retains taxing rights under the new Singapore DTA. The main impact of a DTA is to restrict the ability of the country of source to tax the income in certain circumstances. Where both countries are permitted to tax the income, a DTA requires the country of residence to provide a credit for the tax imposed by the country of source. The broad framework for allocating taxing rights under the new Singapore DTA are essentially unchanged from the existing DTA. They provide as follows:  Business profits Income from “immovable property” 3 will always be taxable in the country of source if the property is situated in that country. (Article 6 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft will not be taxable in the country of source except in respect of operations conducted solely within that country. The carriage of passengers or cargo between ports in a country, even when forming part of a longer international voyage by the ship or aircraft concerned, will be considered to be operations conducted solely within a country. (Article 8 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) Otherwise, business profits will only be taxable in the country of source when derived through a “permanent establishment” 4 situated in that country. (Article 7 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) The new Singapore DTA does not affect the ability of the country of residence to tax any of these categories of income.  Investment income Dividends will generally remain taxable in the country of source, but the tax imposed by that country may not exceed 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the recipient of that dividend is a company that owns at least 10 percent of the voting power of the company that is paying the dividends and 15 percent for all other dividends. (Article 10 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) 3 The term “immovable property” is widely used in DTAs in preference to the comparable term “real property”. 4 The term “permanent establishment” is defined in Article 5. It generally means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is carried on. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 9 Interest will generally remain taxable in the country of source, but the tax imposed by that country may not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. (Article 11 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) Royalties will generally remain taxable in the country of source, but the tax imposed in that country may not exceed 5 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. (Article 12 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) The new Singapore DTA does not affect the ability of the country of residence to tax any of these categories of income.  Gains from the alienation of property Gains from the alienation of property will always be taxable in the country of source, except for gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic which remain taxable only in the country of residence. (Article 13 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) The new Singapore DTA does not affect the ability of the country of residence to tax gains from the alienation of property.  Income from personal services Directors’ fees will be taxable in the country of source, provided that the company paying the director’s fees is resident in that country. (Article 15 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) The new Singapore DTA does not affect the ability of the country of residence to tax the income. Income derived from activity as an entertainer or sportsperson will always be taxable in the country of source if the income-earning activities take place in that country. (Article 16 of the Singapore DTA refers.) The new Singapore DTA does not affect the ability of the country of residence to tax the income. Salaries and wages relating to Government service are taxable only in the country of source. (Article 18 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) Otherwise, income from employment will not be taxable in the country of source unless the employment is performed in that country, the employee is present in that country for at least 183 days in any 12 month period, and various other conditions are met. (Article 14 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) The new Singapore DTA will not affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts. Except for salaries and wages relating to Government service, the new Singapore DTA does not affect the ability of the country of residence to tax any of these categories of income. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 10  Other income Government service pensions are taxable only in the country of source. Otherwise, pensions are taxable only in the country of residence. (Articles 17 and 18 of the new Singapore DTA refer.) Students of one country who are in the other country solely for the purpose of their education or training shall not be taxed in that other country on payments from outside that country received for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training. (Article 19 of the Singapore DTA refers.) Income not otherwise dealt with under the new Singapore DTA remains taxable in both the country of source and the country of residence. (Article 20 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) 15 Where, under the above rules, income is taxable both in the country of residence and the country of source, the country of residence is required to relieve the double taxation by providing a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. (Article 21 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) In the case of New Zealand, the crediting mechanism imposed by the new Singapore DTA is consistent with the foreign tax credit provisions at subpart LJ of the Income Tax Act 2007. 16 The new Singapore DTA contains a mutual agreement procedure, under which the “competent authority” 5 of each country may endeavour to resolve difficulties or doubts as to the interpretation or application of the new Singapore DTA. The mutual agreement procedure also serves as a limited disputes resolution mechanism for anyone who considers that the provisions of the new Singapore DTA are not being applied to them correctly. They may present a case to the competent authority of their respective country. The competent authority is required to endeavour to resolve the problem, either alone or by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other country. (Article 22 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) Note that the mutual agreement procedure does not always successfully resolve disputes, because the two competent authorities may not actually be able to agree on a solution. However, the person concerned retains the right to pursue disputes through the Courts. 17 The new Singapore DTA requires the tax administrations of each country to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and avoidance by facilitating exchanges of information on tax matters. (Article 23 of the new Singapore DTA refers.) Exchanged information typically consists of tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information. 5 The “competent authority” is a person nominated by a DTA to carry out certain functions of a DTA. In the case of New Zealand, the competent authority under the Singapore DTA is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 11 Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 18 Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that DTAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993, although generally only in relation to income tax. (The key exception is for the exchange of information, which may apply in relation to taxes other than income tax.) The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a DTA (for example, DTAs require New Zealand to forego some taxing rights imposed under those Acts). The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during DTA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions. 19 Subject to completion of Parliamentary treaty examination, the Order in Council will be promulgated and will come into effect 28 days after being published in the Gazette. Economic, social, cultural and environmental effects and costs of the treaty action 20 The main economic effect of the new Singapore DTA will be to increase certainty of tax treatment and reduce compliance costs for New Zealand businesses that operate in Singapore and vice versa. The new Singapore DTA will also reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties. This will result in a tax revenue loss to New Zealand. However, it is also anticipated that the lower rates will facilitate increased trade and investment flows between New Zealand, and that over time the benefits to New Zealand will outweigh the lost revenue. 21 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 22 DTAs generally require New Zealand to forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights on cross-border income that we are currently able to tax. The new Singapore DTA, however, replaces an existing DTA. In the majority of cases, the allocation of taxing rights under the existing DTA remain unchanged. The principle cost to New Zealand of compliance with the new Singapore DTA will therefore be the reduction in withholding tax rates on dividend, interest and royalties (paragraph 12 above discusses the new withholding tax rates in detail). 23 The reduction in withholding tax rates is reciprocal on both countries. To the extent that the lower withholding tax rates will result in reduced Singapore tax, the New Zealand tax base will benefit through a reduction in foreign tax credits. 24 To the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue from lowering withholding tax rates is not offset by a reduction in creditable Singaporean tax, it is expected that the economic benefits of the new Singapore DTA will outweigh these costs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 12 Consultation 25 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted on and agree with the proposed treaty action. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 26 Any subsequent amendment to the new Singapore DTA will be by Protocol. No specific amendments to the new Singapore DTA are contemplated. However, New Zealand has agreed to include an obligation in the new Singapore DTA that will apply if New Zealand ever agrees to lower withholding tax rates on dividends, interests and royalties in another DTA. New Zealand will then be obliged to offer to re-enter negotiations with Singapore with a view to amending the new Singapore DTA to include similar lower rates. Otherwise, any proposed amendments will be considered on a case-by- case basis and any decision to proceed with an amendment will be subject to normal domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 27 Article 26 of the new Singapore DTA provides that, after the expiration of five years from the date of entry into force, either New Zealand or Singapore may terminate the DTA. Notice of termination is to be made through diplomatic channels and must be given at least six months before the end of the calendar year in which it is made. Adequacy statement 28 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.
International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 2 Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends that the House take note of its report. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has examined the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 28 July and 4 and 18 August 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Hon Shane Jones Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Turkey for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Executive summary Negotiations have been successfully completed for an Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and its accompanying Protocol (collectively, “the DTA”). The DTA will provide greater certainty in the taxation of cross-border investment income, reduce compliance costs and set limits for withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties. It is also expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist in the prevention of fiscal avoidance and evasion. To the extent that the revenue cost of the DTA to New Zealand is not fully offset by a reduction in creditable Turkish tax, we would expect the economic benefits to outweigh the costs. It is therefore considered that the DTA is in New Zealand’s interests. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action The Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and its accompanying Protocol was signed in Ankara on 22 April 2010. It was signed in English and Turkish, both texts having equal authority. The English text of the DTA is attached as an Annex to this paper. Subsequent to signature and completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. In accordance with Article 28 of the DTA, the DTA will be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes confirming the completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force in each country. The DTA will enter into force on the date of the later of these notes. It is expected that Parliamentary treaty examination will be completed by the end of 2010. The DTA will not apply to Tokelau, the Cook Islands or Niue. Reasons for New Zealand to take the treaty action Double tax agreements are bilateral international treaties principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. More specifically, they provide greater certainty of tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 5 treatment, share the cost of relieving double taxation, limit withholding taxes on cross- border investment returns, and exempt certain short-term activities in the host State from tax in that State. Double tax agreements also enable the tax administrations of each country to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. They do this primarily by establishing a mechanism by which the two tax administrations can exchange certain tax-related information (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information) with each other. The tax authorities can use the information they obtain under the treaty to determine if residents are correctly reporting overseas income and to identify tax avoidance schemes. New Zealand’s domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions unless this is authorised by a tax treaty (sections 81 and 88 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). More recently, double tax agreements have also begun to include provisions that enable tax authorities to assist each other in the collection of unpaid taxes. The DTA with Turkey includes such provisions, providing a mechanism whereby tax can be recovered from taxpayers who move overseas. Relevant factors in considering whether to conclude a double tax agreement with a given country include the strength of political relationship with that country and the strength of existing or potential trade relationships. Relations between Turkey and New Zealand have developed steadily over the past few years, including the establishments of a Joint Economic Commission to promote trade and other economic activity. Turkey was New Zealand’s 51st most important bilateral trading partner in the year ending June 2009, with total trade valued at NZ$160 million (0.2% of total New Zealand trade). Imports stood at NZ$51 million and exports at NZ$109 million. In the short term, the areas of greatest potential for New Zealand companies in the Turkish market are likely to be services, high technology and specialised manufacturing. Turkey’s membership of the OECD is relevant to the decision to conclude the DTA. As a full member of the OECD, New Zealand has an implied obligation (although not necessarily a legal obligation) to follow the recommendation made by the OECD to member countries to pursue efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not entered into such conventions, and to revise those of the existing conventions that may no longer reflect present day needs. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action The advantages to New Zealand of the DTA entering into force are as follows:  It will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Turkey. In particular, it shares the cost of relieving the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries.  It will set limits for withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 6  When both countries are permitted to tax the same income in the hands of the same person, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit or exemption for the tax paid in the country of source.  It will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputed issues that may arise in relation to the DTA.  It will assist the tax administrations of both countries and help to prevent the avoidance and evasion of taxes by facilitating the exchange of information and allowing for assistance in the collection of taxes. The disadvantages to New Zealand of the DTA entering into force are as follows:  New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of limits imposed on withholding taxes and the allocation of taxing rights over some income wholly to Turkey. However, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue when taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and Turkish tax is correspondingly reduced or eliminated under the DTA.  The requirement for New Zealand to provide Turkey with information and assistance under the exchange of information and assistance in collection of taxes provisions of the DTA will involve some additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue, although these are expected to be small. Again, the ability to request information or seek assistance is reciprocal. It would be an option for New Zealand not to enter into the DTA with Turkey. If that option were adopted, the benefits outlined above would not be realised. There is no practical alternative to a double tax agreement for achieving the desired outcomes. On balance, it is considered to be in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the DTA with Turkey. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist in the prevention of fiscal avoidance and evasion. Legal obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it imposes are on the Contracting States, restricting their taxing rights on a reciprocal basis and requiring exchange of information and assistance in the collection of taxes. New Zealand taxes its residents on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Turkey has a similar system (in some circumstances, it may also tax the worldwide income of non-resident nationals). The two systems therefore potentially overlap, giving rise to the possibility of juridical double taxation. Juridical double taxation typically arises when the country of which the person deriving income is a resident and the country from which the income is derived both tax the same item of income in the hands of that person. The DTA seeks to prevent juridical double taxation by allocating taxing rights between the Contracting States. The rules with which New Zealand and Turkey will be required to INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 7 comply when imposing tax on residents of either country are outlined below. Subsequent paragraphs provide more detail on key issues.  Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country in which the property is situated (Article 6).  Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country of which the enterprise is a resident unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment in the other country (Article 7). In that case, the profits may be taxed in that other country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed place in a country through which the business of an enterprise is carried on.  Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic will be taxable only in that country. However the DTA ensures that the taxation of domestic carriage will be taxed on the same basis as any other business (Article 8).  Dividends, interest and royalties may generally be taxed in both countries (Articles 10, 11 and 12). However, the country in which such payments arise may not impose tax in excess of specified limits.  Gains from the sale of immovable property will be taxable in the country in which the property is situated (Article 13). Gains from the sale of moveable property will generally be taxable in the country where the vendor is resident, except when the property is the business property of a permanent establishment in the other country.  Income from services will be taxable only in the country of which the enterprise or person deriving the income is a resident, unless there is either a permanent establishment or fixed base in the other country or the services are performed in that other country for more than 183 days in any 12-month period (Article 14).  Income from employment will be taxable only in the country of which the employee is a resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country (Article 15). In such case, the country in which the employment is performed may also tax the income if the employee is present there for 183 days in any 12-month period and certain other conditions are met.  Directors’ fees will be taxable in the country where the company paying the fees is resident (Article 16).  Income from the activities of entertainers (artistes) and sportspersons may generally be taxed in the country in which those activities are performed (Article 17).  Pensions will only be taxable in the country where the recipient is resident (Article 18).  Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country will generally be exempt from tax in the other country (Article 19).  Students and apprentices from one country living in the other country will not generally be taxed on payments received from outside that other country if those payments are for maintenance or education (Article 20). Employment income earned while a person is obtaining practical experience relating to their studies may also be exempt. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 8 In addition, both countries will have to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the DTA. These include a general requirement to eliminate double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid (Article 22), not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of the other country vis-à-vis residents of any other state (Article 23), complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA (Article 24), and complying with the arrangements for the exchange of information (Article 25) and assistance in the collection of taxes (Article 26). Income from services New Zealand’s general treaty practice is to include a bright-line (non-OECD) rule allowing a country to tax income from services (such as professional services) if the person or enterprise performing the service has been present there for at least 183 days in any 12- month period. This strengthens source taxation by removing the need to establish the existence of a permanent establishment or fixed base, which can sometimes be difficult. The DTA includes an equivalent rule in Article 14, which deals with independent personal services. Non-resident withholding tax A key effect of the DTA is to limit the rate of withholding tax that can be imposed on dividends, interest and royalties by the country in which those payments arise. Article 10 of the DTA limits the rate of withholding tax on dividends on a reciprocal basis to 5% if the dividend goes to a company owning at least 25% of the company making the distribution (provided the dividend is exempt in the other State), and in all other cases the rate is 15%. Most foreign dividends received by companies are now exempt, so New Zealand companies receiving dividends from Turkish subsidiaries can qualify for the reduced rate of 5%. In other tax treaties (with Australia, Singapore and the United States), the threshold for the 5% rate was set at a lower level (10% ownership of the company paying the dividend). The treaties with Australia and the United States also included a zero rate for companies owning at least 80% of the company paying the dividend and meeting certain other criteria. However, the rates agreed in this treaty are consistent with New Zealand’s overall policy of seeking to reduce rates of withholding taxes for non-portfolio dividends where possible. Article 11 of the DTA limits the rate of withholding tax on interest on a reciprocal basis to 10% for interest paid to a bank and to 15% in all other cases. New Zealand’s tax treaties generally limit withholding tax on interest to 10%, rather than 15%. However, a 15% limit is included in a few existing treaties. As a net capital importer, this higher limit is not of particular concern to New Zealand. Article 12 of the DTA limits the rate of withholding tax on royalties on a reciprocal basis to 10%. This is consistent with New Zealand’s general treaty practice, although we have reduced the rate to 5% in some recent agreements. The DTA also provides a broad definition of “royalties”, strengthening source taxation. Although the definition is not exactly the same as that used in New Zealand’s model, the key elements are there. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 9 Alienation of property In Article 13, dealing with the alienation of property, New Zealand’s model differs from the OECD model by referring to “income” derived from such disposals as well as “gains”. The references to income ensure, in particular, that amounts derived from the sale of immovable property may always be taxed by the country in which that property is situated, even if the property is on revenue account. (Land and buildings may be on revenue account if, for example, they are bought and sold by a property speculator.) The DTA follows the OECD model in referring in this article only to gains from property disposals. This is an unusual departure from the New Zealand model, but not unprecedented. At the margins, it may limit the taxing rights of the country in which property is situated, on a reciprocal basis. The associated fiscal impact is expected to be small. Artistes & sportspersons In line with the OECD and New Zealand models, the DTA includes special rules allowing a country to tax entertainers (artistes) and sportspersons for performances within its jurisdiction, even if the person is only present there for a very short period (Article 17). This recognises that such persons can earn large fees within a short space of time. The DTA includes a special exemption from source country taxation for activities supported wholly or mainly from public funds. While this (non-OECD) measure is not something normally included in our treaties, it is consistent with the general approach of giving special recognition to activities or payments funded by foreign governments. The exemption applies on a reciprocal basis and the associated fiscal impact is expected to be small. Students In line with the OECD and New Zealand models, the DTA includes special rules for students and business apprentices from a Contracting State (Article 20). If they are studying or training in the other country, any payments for maintenance, education or training arising outside that country may not be taxed there. Article 20 includes a technical variation on our usual treaty practice, to ensure that the provision can apply to nationals of a Contracting State even if they spent time in a third country before commencing their studies/training. It also includes a source-country exemption for employment income earned while a person obtains practical experience (this can apply for up to two years). Non-discrimination The OECD model includes an article that prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality, situs of an enterprise, ownership of capital, and (in limited circumstances) residence. Article 23 of the DTA lays down an alternative formulation that we have used in a number of other treaties: this requires that non-residents be treated in a comparable manner to other non-residents, rather than as New Zealand residents. It also includes a most favoured nation (MFN) clause that commits New Zealand to renegotiating the article if we include an OECD-style non-discrimination article in a subsequent treaty with another State. Dispute resolution mechanisms Tax treaties routinely provide for taxpayer disputes to be resolved through “mutual agreement” by the revenue authorities in both countries. This DTA is no exception. Rather than having to pursue a case through the courts—possibly, in both countries—a INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 10 taxpayer can approach the local tax authority under the mutual agreement procedure set out in Article 24. If that authority considers the case to be justified, and cannot resolve it through its own actions, it shall seek to do so through mutual agreement with the tax authority of the other country. This bipartisan approach is particularly appropriate in the tax treaty context because a single issue will generally affect a person’s tax position in both countries. The mutual agreement procedure also requires the tax authorities of the two countries to endeavour to resolve together any difficulties or doubts about the correct interpretation or application of the DTA, and allows them to consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the DTA. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing legislation Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to double tax agreements by Order in Council. The Order in Council may (and will) specify that the provisions of the DTA have effect in relation to tax matters notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the core provisions of the DTA, which may provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other Contracting State do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty. Article 28 provides for the DTA to be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting States. The DTA will enter into force on the date of the last of these notes. New Zealand will be in a position to notify Turkey that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council has entered into force, 28 days after its publication in the Gazette. Thereafter, the provisions of the DTA will have effect from various dates, according to the terms of the DTA. In New Zealand, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will have effect from the beginning of the calendar year following entry into force, and for other taxes for income years beginning on or after 1 April following entry into force. In the case of Turkey, the provisions of the DTA will have effect for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force. Provisions dealing with assistance in the collection of taxes will have effect from a date to be agreed in a subsequent exchange of diplomatic notes. There is no alternative to an Order in Council for implementing a double tax agreement. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 11 Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty New Zealand will forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights, as outlined above. This will mean that we are not able to tax some income that is currently taxed under domestic law, and that the rate of tax that can be imposed on certain other income will be reduced. The revenue cost will include tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of Turkish residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt from New Zealand tax. It may also reflect reduced tax on royalties derived from New Zealand by residents of Turkey, in respect of which the DTA will restrict withholding tax rates to 10% (the domestic law rate being 15%). There may also be some revenue cost from reduced withholding tax rates on dividends and interest derived from New Zealand by residents of Turkey, although that tax is already largely relieved under domestic law. Turkey will be similarly constrained in terms of the tax it can impose on income derived by residents of New Zealand. This reduced foreign tax will tend to flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. In addition, the DTA will enhance our ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Finally, the DTA will generally give rise to favourable economic benefits (such as increased trade and investment). To the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction in creditable Turkish tax, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh the costs. The provisions of the DTA concerning the exchange of information and assistance in collection of taxes will involve some additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue, although these are expected to be small and the ability to request information or seek assistance is reciprocal. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted about the terms of the DTA and the content of this extended national interest analysis and no material concerns were raised. No private sector consultation has been entered into. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects The DTA includes a MFN clause (paragraph 11 of the Protocol) in respect of the non- discrimination article. This commits New Zealand to renegotiating the article if we include an OECD-style non-discrimination article in a subsequent treaty with another State. The likely outcome would be to amend the DTA to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of nationality, situs of an enterprise, ownership of capital, and (in limited circumstances) residence. In its current form, the DTA has a more limited non-discrimination article which only requires that non-residents are treated in a comparable manner to other non- residents, rather than as a New Zealand resident. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND TURKEY 12 No further amendments are anticipated at this time. New Zealand would consider future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Any amendments to the DTA, including amendments pursuant to the MFN clause described above, would be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. While there is no amendment clause in the DTA, amendment would be subject to the usual requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. An accompanying Protocol forms an integral part of the DTA and will be signed at the same time. Countries often prefer clarifying provisions and departures from their standard treaty model to be located in an accompanying Protocol. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty Under Article 29, either Party may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the DTA will cease to have effect for New Zealand either after 1 January or 1 April the following year depending on the tax in question. Agency disclosure statement Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing the DTA between Turkey and New Zealand and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, it has considered the option of not entering into the treaty. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. The policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation. An Order in Council will be required to give the DTA effect in New Zealand law. The DTA represents a good outcome for New Zealand. It is broadly consistent with the New Zealand negotiating model, which in turn is based on the OECD’s model. The DTA is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist in the prevention of fiscal evasion and avoidance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted about the terms of the DTA and the content of this extended national interest analysis and no material concerns were raised. Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles (as referenced in chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA.

International treaty examination of the Second Protocol amending the convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and the Protocol, signed at Brussels on 15 September 1981 Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION 2 International treaty examination of the Second Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and the Protocol, signed at Brussels on 15 September 1981 Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends that the House take note of its report. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Second Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and the Protocol, signed at Brussels on 15 September 1981 and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report.

Subsequent to signature and satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, it is proposed that the Second Protocol be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, and brought into force, in accordance with Article XIII, through an exchange of diplomatic notes, confirming completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force. The Second Protocol will enter into force on the fifteenth day after the date of the latter note. Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in force. DTAs are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. 3 The Second Protocol amends the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (“the Belgian DTA”) that entered into force in 1983. The Belgian DTA already stands amended by the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (“the First Protocol”), which came into force at the same time as the DTA itself. 4 The First Protocol included an undertaking by New Zealand to enter into further negotiations with Belgium with a view to incorporating a non-discrimination article if New Zealand ever agreed to an article of this type in any other DTA. 5 Shortly after the Belgian DTA and First Protocol were signed, New Zealand agreed to include a non-discrimination article in a DTA with the United States. This triggered the negotiation clause in the Belgian DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION 5 6 In addition to the inclusion of a non-discrimination article, the Second Protocol makes several other amendments to the Belgian DTA that were proposed by the two sides during the course of the negotiations. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 7 The advantages to New Zealand are:  The Belgian DTA, already in force, is designed to foster improved cross-border trade and investment and to assist tax administrations in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The Second Protocol generally enhances the ability of the Belgian DTA to achieve those objectives.  The Second Protocol fulfils an obligation under the Belgian DTA for New Zealand to enter into negotiations with Belgium with a view to including a non-discrimination article in the DTA if we ever agreed to an article of that type in another DTA. This obligation was triggered in 1983 when New Zealand agreed to include a non- discrimination article in our DTA with the United States. 8 No disadvantages to New Zealand from the entering into force of the Second Protocol have been identified. 9 It is in New Zealand’s interest to enter into the Second Protocol with Belgium. Obligations 10 The Second Protocol does not impose requirements on taxpayers. DTAs only impose obligations on the respective governments. The Second Protocol imposes the following obligations on the New Zealand Government:  Not to impose the following discriminatory income tax laws:  Laws that discriminate against Belgian nationals as opposed to New Zealand nationals in the same circumstances. However, laws that differentiate between residents and non-residents are expressly permitted.  Laws that treat a permanent establishment of a Belgian enterprise less favourably than a permanent establishment of an enterprise from any third State.  Laws that treat a Belgian ship or aircraft operator less favourably than a New Zealand ship or aircraft operator carrying on the same activities. However, measures reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes are expressly permitted.  Laws that discriminate against a New Zealand enterprise owned or controlled by Belgian residents as opposed to a New Zealand enterprise owned or controlled by residents of any third State. Belgian ownership or control of New Zealand enterprises cannot therefore result in more restrictive taxation rules. (Article IX of the Second Protocol refers.) INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION 6  To provide corresponding adjustments in relation to transfer pricing adjustments made by Belgium. (Transfer pricing rules enable a tax administration to adjust the value of a cross-border transaction between associated enterprises where the value has been artificially set too high or low so as to manipulate the amount of tax applying in each country. Provided that the adjustment has been correctly made, the associated enterprises article will now require an increase in taxable income in one country to be matched by a corresponding decrease in taxable income in the other country.) (Article IV of the Second Protocol refers.)  Not to impose non resident withholding tax on interest paid to the Belgian Government, central bank, or an export guarantee organisation approved by Belgium. (Article VI of the Second Protocol refers.)  To disregard any domestic time limits when giving effect to mutually agreed solutions. (Article X of the Second Protocol refers.)  To enter into further negotiations with Belgium if ever both Governments agree that double taxation of fringe benefits is occurring. (Article XI of the Second Protocol refers.) 11 All of the above obligations are reciprocal on both governments. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 12 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 13 No costs are anticipated. Future Protocols 14 No future protocols are anticipated. As noted, however, the Second Protocol does create a contingent obligation for the two sides to enter into negotiations to resolve the problem of double taxation of fringe benefits (should the two sides ever agree that such double taxation is occurring). This may require the conclusion of an additional amendment to the Belgian DTA. 15 New Zealand would consider proposed amendments on a case by case basis and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be implemented domestically by means of an overriding Regulation. 17 Section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 authorises the making of an Order in Council to give the provisions of a DTA overriding effect in relation to the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – DOUBLE TAXATION AND FISCAL EVASION 7 Consultation 18 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and concur with the terms of the Second Protocol. No private sector consultation has been entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 19 Article XIV of the Second Protocol provides that it shall remain in force as long as the Belgian DTA and the First Protocol are applicable. 20 Either party may terminate the Belgian DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, on or before 30 June in any calendar year, in accordance with Article 29. Adequacy statement The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended NIA and has assessed it as adequate in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.
International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Anguilla on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 2 International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Anguilla on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends that the House take note of its report. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Anguilla on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 21 and 28 April 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Anguilla on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes National Interest Analysis Executive Summary 1 On 11 December 2009, New Zealand signed the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Anguilla On The Exchange Of Information Relating To Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Anguilla (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in place with key trading and investment partners which provide for exchange of information arrangements similar to those which are established under the TIEA. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as with low-tax jurisdictions. Anguilla is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed a number of other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 Date and Nature of Proposed Binding Treaty Action 4 It is proposed that the TIEA be brought into force for New Zealand following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. 5 Subsequent to completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 1 Despite the reference to DTAs, the Agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 6 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, in accordance with Article 14 of the TIEA through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force of the TIEA by each Party. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action 7 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 2 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 8 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002 produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 3 The 2000 list includes Anguilla. 9 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. TIEAs have since been signed with the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 1 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. 2 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88 (by virtue of its legislative definition) is also applicable to TIEAs. 3 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 10 The TIEA with Anguilla provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity (the OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”). In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) 11 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 4 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 12 1The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. Consideration of other options 13 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Anguilla. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Anguilla would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. The fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with Anguilla. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty action 14 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Anguilla. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. The TIEA is based on the 2002 OECD model TIEA. The OECD has produced a comprehensive commentary to the 2002 model which ensures that there is consistent interpretation and application of the TIEA provisions between both Contracting Parties. 15 Anguilla is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Anguilla, New Zealand will incur administrative 4 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Anguilla will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 16 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Anguilla. A supporting less-than-treaty status instrument will be agreed between the two Contracting Parties before the TIEA enters into force. The supporting less-than-treaty status instrument will set out a shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 10 of the TIEA. The intention of the less-than-treaty status instrument is to ensure that the requested jurisdiction does not become burdened with excessive cost when complying with a request. Thus, ordinary costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested party, but extra-ordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring 3rd party translators or interpreters) will be borne by the requesting party. This means that New Zealand could be required to bear some costs when making requests to Anguilla, and vice versa. 17 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 5 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Anguilla, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Anguilla while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 18 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with Anguilla. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 19 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes (Article 1). In the case of Anguilla, the specified taxes are “the property tax, stamp duty, and the accommodation and vacation asset levy”. As noted above, Anguilla currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 5 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand read y to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 20 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request (Article 8). Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 21 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (Article 11). New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Anguilla, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Anguilla while the TIEA is in force. 22 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 23 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Anguilla, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance or the Permanent Secretary’s authorised representative). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 24 Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables TIEAs to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that TIEAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a TIEA, given that the TIEA requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is forbidden under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during TIEA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the TIEA. 25 Subject to the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 26 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, and after the supporting less- than-treaty status instrument has been finalised, New Zealand will notify Anguilla by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. Anguilla will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA. The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 27 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 28 New Zealand will likely be required to reimburse Anguilla for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. It is intended that the MOU will set out the parameters of which New Zealand will be required to reimburse Anguilla for request of information it makes. It is intended that this will ensure New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 29 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Anguilla but, if requests for information are received from Anguilla, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Anguilla are therefore expected to be marginal. 30 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 31 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 32 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 33 Article 15 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the appropriate channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 34 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Adequacy statement 35 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate and in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report.

Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes National Interest Analysis Executive Summary 1 On 18 November 2009 New Zealand signed The Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Commonwealth Of The Bahamas On The Exchange Of Information Relating To Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Bahamas (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in place with key trading and investment partners which provide for exchange of information arrangements similar to those which are established under the TIEA. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as with low-tax jurisdictions. The Bahamas is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed a number of other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 4 It is proposed that the TIEA be brought into force for New Zealand following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. 5 Subsequent to completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 1 Despite the reference to DTAs, the Agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 6 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, in accordance with Article 14 of the TIEA through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force of the TIEA by each Party. Reasons for New Zealand becoming taking the treaty action 7 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 2 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 8 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002, produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 3 The 2000 list includes the Bahamas. 9 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. TIEAs have since been signed with the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 1 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. 2 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88 (by virtue of its legislative definition) is also applicable to TIEAs. 3 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers.

The TIEA will enable tax officials from New Zealand and BVI (“the Parties”) to request information from each other (such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 2 The Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The British Virgin Islands For The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals (“the Supplementary Agreement”) has been signed with BVI at the same time as the TIEA. Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the nature of BVI’s tax system means that it will derive less benefit from the TIEA than will New Zealand. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that BVI receives some reciprocal benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. The TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement should be considered as elements of a “package deal”. New Zealand will not gain any direct benefit from the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement. However, the Supplementary Agreement is needed to support, and will indirectly benefit New Zealand through its support for the conclusion of the TIEA. In any case, there will be few, if any, negative financial, fiscal and economic implications for New Zealand from the entry into force of the Supplementary Agreement. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. In particular, it requires the Parties to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). A copy of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 The Supplementary Agreement contains a selected number of articles based on those that typically appear in New Zealand’s double tax agreements (“DTAs”). The articles allocate taxing rights in a limited number of circumstances (in respect of government service and students). A copy of the Supplementary Agreements is attached as Annex B. 5 Both the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement are further supplemented by a less- than-treaty status Memorandum of Understanding Between The New Zealand Revenue Department And The Ministry Of Finance Of The British Virgin Islands Concerning The Interpretation Or Application Of The Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And Government Of The British Virgin Islands For The Exchange Of Information Relating The Taxes (“the Understanding”). The Understanding sets out the shared understandings on matters relating to the interpretation and operation of the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 6 Before the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are brought into force for New Zealand they first must be submitted to the House for Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. Following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process it is proposed that the two agreements be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council. The Understanding has a less-than-treaty status and is not required to be submitted for parliamentary treaty examination. 7 The two agreements can then be brought into force, in accordance with Article 14 of the TIEA and Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirm that the Parties have completed their constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force. 8 Each agreement will enter into force on the date of the later of the two diplomatic notes. New Zealand officials will manage the procedures to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are double tax agreements (“DTAs”). New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002, produced a model TIEA that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. 11 The OECD model TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is provided in a timely and effective manner. Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules are specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 12 New Zealand is currently negotiating a number of TIEAs based on the OECD model TIEA. The first New Zealand TIEA to arise from those negotiations was with the Netherlands Antilles, signed on 1 March 2007. Negotiations for a TIEA with BVI have now also concluded. Each new TIEA represents a further step forward for New Zealand in terms of extending its network of exchange of information arrangements. The Supplementary Agreement 13 Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, BVI only has a limited tax system (consisting primarily of payroll taxes). BVI therefore has little need to seek information on tax matters from other countries. New Zealand, by contrast, imposes income tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents, and so has a keen interest in ensuring that it can obtain information on the income earning activities of those tax residents in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, New Zealand has a much greater interest in concluding a TIEA than BVI, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will BVI. 14 To encourage BVI to conclude the TIEA, and following the approach adopted by other OECD member countries in TIEA negotiations, New Zealand offered to enter into an additional agreement with BVI that would allocate taxing rights in a limited number of circumstances. 15 Prior to the advent of TIEAs New Zealand had previously only entered into arrangements for the allocation of taxing rights in its DTAs. As noted above, however, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems, where the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions often tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction can result in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax liability). However, given BVI’s limited tax system, entering into a DTA with BVI would mean New Zealand giving up taxing rights with little, if any, reciprocity. 16 For this reason, the Supplementary Agreement has been limited to a selected number of DTA articles chosen because they will result in minimal fiscal cost to New Zealand and will not provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in BVI: INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. However, this rule does not apply if the individual is a tax resident of that other jurisdiction (unless the individual became resident solely by reason of the rendering of those services). The Article will therefore only apply when a BVI Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 90 days.  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their eduction or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the Article will have few implications. 17 Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that where the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for any purpose of the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protects tax matters. 18 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will only have effect once the TIEA has entered into force (in practice, New Zealand officials will ensure that both the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement enter into force on the same date). The Understanding 19 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement are supplemented by a less-than-treaty status instrument that clarifies a number of areas of joint understanding between the authorities in each country that will be administering the Agreements (that is, between the New Zealand Inland Revenue and BVI’s Ministry of Finance). The clarifications generally concern administrative issues pertaining to the interpretation and operation of the Agreements. Consideration of other options 20 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with BVI. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with BVI would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. As noted above, the fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with BVI. 21 The entering into of the Supplementary Agreement is the “trade off” for BVI agreeing to enter into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. The INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement constitute a package deal. Neither agreement can be entered into without the other. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 22 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from BVI. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 23 BVI is unlikely to raise many (if any) requests for information from New Zealand. However, if requests for information are received from BVI, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing 37 DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from BVI will only be marginal. Experience gained from the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 24 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to BVI. The Understanding referred to in paragraph 19 above sets out the shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 10 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$500. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 25 The TIEA is largely based on the 2002 OECD model TIEA. A key difference from the OECD model, however, is that the TIEA includes, at Article 11, an obligation on each jurisdiction not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 2 New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with BVI, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to BVI while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 26 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with BVI. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement will, however, indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA. As noted above, the revenue implications for 2 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 New Zealand of the Supplementary Agreement entering into force are expected to be minimal, and will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from BVI concluding the TIEA. 27 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with BVI. 28 If BVI ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement would also terminate and New Zealand would likely terminate the Understanding. Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, BVI could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The TIEA 29 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of BVI, the specified taxes are “such taxes as may from time to time, be imposed by law”. As noted above, BVI currently has a very limited tax system, primarily consisting of payroll taxes, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 30 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 31 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed: the requesting Party is to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$500. 32 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (the Understanding sets out the shared understanding of how this phrase will be interpreted). As noted above, New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with BVI, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to BVI while the TIEA is in force. 33 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 34 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative). The Parties may also agree on other forms of dispute resolution. The Supplementary Agreement 35 The Supplementary Agreement imposes obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances. These circumstances are described in paragraph 16 above. At present the practical implications for New Zealand are effectively nil. 36 If New Zealand ever commences taxing maintenance payments derived from outside New Zealand by visiting students, those taxing rights will be constrained in respect of students from BVI who come to New Zealand to study. 37 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 38 Subject to the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 39 Section BH 1 authorises the giving of effect to certain tax agreements under New Zealand domestic law by overriding Regulation. That is, the Governor-General may declare by Order in Council that an agreement to which section BH 1 pertains will (within certain specified limits) override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the two agreements (it will, for example, enable the TIEA to override New Zealand’s secrecy requirements). 40 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify BVI by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are complete. BVI will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement. The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Their provisions will then have effect for income years and charges to tax arising after a period of thirteen months following entry into force. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 41 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 42 New Zealand will be required to reimburse BVI for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$500. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 43 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than BVI but, to the extent that requests for information are received from BVI, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from BVI are therefore expected to be marginal. 44 New Zealand may suffer some revenue loss from the limitation of taxing rights (but only, as noted above, if New Zealand ever commences taxing maintenance payments derived from outside New Zealand by visiting students). However, any such revenue loss would be minimal, and would be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 45 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 46 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty actions. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 47 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 48 Article 15 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving three months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the Confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 49 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Party may, terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For BVI, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 50 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA or Supplementary Agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures.

The two agreements are, respectively, the Agreement Between The Government Of The Cayman Islands And The Government Of New Zealand On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of The Cayman Islands And The Government Of New Zealand For The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Cayman Islands (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 exchange of information arrangements in place through its double tax agreements (“DTAs”) with key trading and investment partners. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as low-tax jurisdictions. The Cayman Islands is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed two other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, earlier this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement collectively constitute a “package deal”. Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the limited nature of the Cayman Islands’ tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand as part of a number of measures intended to ensure that the Cayman Islands also receives some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. (It is not appropriate to enter into a full DTA with the Cayman Islands, given the mismatch in tax systems. However, the pension, government service and students articles are three DTA articles that can be agreed with the Cayman Islands as they will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs.) The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. New Zealand will not gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to the Cayman Islands to enter into the TIEA, is found in Article 10 of the TIEA. This article constitutes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions identified as having harmful tax practices has previously been raised. The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Cayman Islands, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Cayman Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 6 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the between the Cayman Islands and New Zealand tax authorities that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 7 Before the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement are brought into force for New Zealand, the two agreements must first be submitted to the House of Representatives to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. (The less-than-treaty status Understanding does not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand and is not required to undergo treaty examination.) INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 8 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the two agreements can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the agreements can then each be brought into force, in accordance with Article 12 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Party. 10 Each agreement will enter into force on completion of the exchange of diplomatic notes. New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after that date (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after that date). The Supplementary Agreement will similarly apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action The TIEA 11 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 12 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002, produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 2 The 2000 list includes the Cayman Islands. 13 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 14 The TIEA with the Cayman Islands provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, has (by virtue of its legislative definition) the same meaning as that outlined in paragraph 8 above. Section 88 is therefore also applicable to TIEAs. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 15 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 16 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 17 Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the Cayman Islands only have a limited tax system. The Cayman Islands will therefore only rarely have any need to request information on tax matters from other countries. New Zealand, by contrast, has a comprehensive tax system and imposes income tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents. New Zealand therefore has a keen interest in ensuring that it can obtain information on the income earning activities of those tax residents in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, New Zealand has a much greater interest in concluding a TIEA than the Cayman Islands, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will the Cayman Islands. 18 To address this imbalance, New Zealand has adopted the approach of other OECD member countries in TIEA negotiations and offered the Cayman Islands a “benefits” package. The Supplementary Agreement is a key element of that package. The Supplementary Agreement allocates taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and is based on articles that appear in New Zealand’s DTAs. New Zealand also offered to establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments as part of the package. 4 19 New Zealand generally only enters into arrangements for the allocation of taxing rights in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. 4 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). However, given the Cayman Islands’ limited tax system, entering into a DTA with the Cayman Islands would mean New Zealand giving up taxing rights with little if any reciprocity. 20 For this reason, New Zealand’s proposal for a Supplementary Agreement was limited to those DTA articles that will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in the Cayman Islands. In the negotiations, the Supplementary Agreement was ultimately limited to the following:  Pursuant to article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. New Zealand will therefore gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any person from the Cayman Islands who retires to New Zealand. However, the Cayman Islands currently does not impose income tax on pensions. Therefore New Zealand will only lose taxing rights under this article if the Cayman Islands subsequently introduces an income tax on pensions.  Pursuant to article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. However, this rule does not apply if the individual is a tax resident of that other jurisdiction (unless the individual became resident solely by reason of the rendering of those services). The article will therefore only apply when a Cayman Islands Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 90 days.  Pursuant to article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their eduction or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Parties must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s existing DTAs.) 21 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 other for any purpose of the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protects tax matters. 22 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will only have effect while the TIEA is in force. 23 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. The less-than-treaty status instruments 24 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the Cayman Islands and New Zealand tax authorities that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. 25 The less-than-treaty status Understanding does not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. Consideration of other options 26 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with the Cayman Islands. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with the Cayman Islands would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. As noted above, the fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with the Cayman Islands. 27 New Zealand’s offer of “benefits” to the Cayman Islands was made at a time when the Cayman Islands had little interest in entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. It followed the precedent established by other OECD countries in offering benefits. Recent developments, such as the 2 April 2009 G20 Leaders Summit in London, have increased international pressure on international finance centres to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements. This increased pressure may to some extent lessen the need to provide benefits to induce those international finance centres to enter into exchange of information arrangements. However, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to consider withdrawing its offer of benefits. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 28 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from the Cayman Islands. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 29 The Cayman Islands is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from the Cayman Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Cayman Islands will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 30 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to the Cayman Islands. The less-than-treaty status Understanding referred to in paragraph 24 above sets out the shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 31 The TIEA contains one article, article 10, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This Article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 10 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 6 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Cayman Islands, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Cayman Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 32 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with the Cayman Islands. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in the Cayman Islands may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides are to consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 6 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand read y to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 TIEA. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with the Cayman Islands. 34 If the Cayman Islands ever unilaterally terminate the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement would cease to apply. Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, the Cayman Islands could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The TIEA 35 The TIEA places a technical reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of the Cayman Islands, because it levies no tax, it is unlikely that the Cayman Islands would make any requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 37 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Cayman Islands, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to the Cayman Islands while the TIEA is in force. 38 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 39 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for the Cayman Islands, the Tax Information Authority). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. The Supplementary Agreement 40 The Supplementary Agreement imposes obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances. (That is, in respect of pensions, government service and students.) 41 The practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be nil. If, however, New Zealand ever commences taxing maintenance payments received from outside New INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 12 Zealand by visiting students, those taxing rights will be constrained in respect of students from the Cayman Islands who come to New Zealand to study. 42 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 43 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 7 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1.) 44 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify the Cayman Islands by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are complete. The Cayman Islands will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement. The two agreements will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Their provisions will apply prospectively. (For example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force.) Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 45 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 46 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Cayman Islands but, if requests for information are received from the Cayman Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Cayman Islands are therefore expected to be marginal. 7 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 13 47 For the reasons outlined in paragraph 20 above, New Zealand is unlikely to suffer any significant revenue loss from the limitation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement. Any revenue loss that is sustained would be minimal and would be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 48 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 49 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 50 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 51 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that, after three years, either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 52 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that, after three years, either Party may, terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For the Cayman Islands, the termination will become effective immediately. 53 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures.

The two agreements are, respectively, the Agreement Between The Government Of The Cook Islands And The Government Of New Zealand On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of The Cook Islands And The Government Of New Zealand On The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Cook Islands (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 exchange of information arrangements in place through its double tax agreements (“DTAs”) with key trading and investment partners. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as low-tax jurisdictions. The Cook Islands is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed two other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, earlier this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Party to which it is given.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement collectively constitute a “package deal”. Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the limited nature of the Cook Islands’ tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand as part of a number of measures intended to ensure that the Cook Islands also receives some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. (It is not appropriate to enter into a full DTA with the Cook Islands, given the mismatch in tax systems. However, the pension, government service and students articles are three DTA articles that can be agreed with the Cook Islands as they will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs.) The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. New Zealand will not gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to the Cook Islands to enter into the TIEA is found in article 11 of the TIEA. This article constitutes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions identified as having harmful tax practices has previously been raised. The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Cook Islands, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Cook Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 6 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the Cayman Islands and New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Cook Islands’ Revenue Management that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 7 Before the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement are brought into force for New Zealand, the two agreements must first be submitted to the House of Representatives to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 (The less-than-treaty status Understanding does not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand and is not required to undergo treaty examination.) 8 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the two agreements can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the agreements can then each be brought into force, in accordance with article 13 of the TIEA and article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Party. 10 Each agreement will enter into force on completion of the exchange of diplomatic notes. New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after that date (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after that date). The Supplementary Agreement will similarly apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action The TIEA 11 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 12 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations in 2000 the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 2 The 2000 list includes the Cook Islands. 13 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, has (by virtue of its legislative definition) the same meaning as that outlined in paragraph 8 above. Section 88 is therefore also applicable to TIEAs. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 14 The TIEA with the Cook Islands provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) 15 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 16 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 17 Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the Cook Islands only has a limited tax system. The Cook Islands will therefore only rarely have any need to request information on tax matters from other countries. New Zealand, by contrast, has a comprehensive tax system and imposes income tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents. New Zealand therefore has a keen interest in ensuring that it can obtain information on the income earning activities of those tax residents in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, New Zealand has a much greater interest in concluding a TIEA than the Cook Islands, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will the Cook Islands. 18 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand has adopted the approach of other OECD member countries in TIEA negotiations and offered the Cook Islands a “benefits” package. The Supplementary Agreement is a key element of that package. The Supplementary Agreement allocates taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and is based on articles that appear in New Zealand’s DTAs. New Zealand also offered to establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments as part of the package. 4 19 New Zealand generally only enters into arrangements for the allocation of taxing rights in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. 4 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). However, given the Cook Islands’ limited tax system, entering into a DTA with the Cook Islands would mean New Zealand giving up taxing rights with little if any reciprocity. 20 For this reason, New Zealand’s proposal for a Supplementary Agreement was limited to those DTA articles that will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in the Cook Islands. In the negotiations, the Supplementary Agreement was ultimately limited to the following:  Pursuant to article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. The Cook Islands will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to the Cook Islands. (However, the article applies reciprocally to both countries. Therefore, New Zealand will also gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any person from the Cook Islands who retires to New Zealand.)  Pursuant to article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. However, this rule does not apply if the individual is a tax resident of that other jurisdiction (unless the individual became resident solely by reason of the rendering of those services). The article will therefore only apply when a Cook Islands Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 90 days.  Pursuant to article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their education or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Parties must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s existing DTAs.) 21 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for any purpose of the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protect tax matters. 22 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will only have effect while the TIEA is in force. 23 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. The less-than-treaty status instruments 24 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Cook Islands’ Revenue Management that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. 25 The less-than-treaty status Understanding does not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. Consideration of other options 26 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with the Cook Islands. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with the Cook Islands would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. As noted above, the fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with the Cook Islands. 27 New Zealand’s offer of “benefits” to the Cook Islands was made at a time when the Cook Islands had little interest in entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. It followed the precedent established by other OECD countries in offering benefits. Recent developments, such as the 2 April 2009 G20 Leaders Summit in London, have increased international pressure on international finance centres to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements. This increased pressure may to some extent lessen the need to provide benefits to induce those international finance centres to enter into exchange of information arrangements. However, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to consider withdrawing its offer of benefits. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 28 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from the Cook Islands. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 29 The Cook Islands is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from the Cook Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Cook Islands will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 30 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to the Cook Islands. The less-than-treaty status Understanding referred to in paragraph 24 sets out the shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$2000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 31 The TIEA contains one article, article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This Article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 6 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Cook Islands, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Cook Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 32 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with the Cook Islands. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in the Cook Islands may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides are to consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 6 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders’ Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 TIEA. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with the Cook Islands. 34 If the Cook Islands ever unilaterally terminate the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement would cease to apply and New Zealand would likely terminate the Understanding. Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, the Cook Islands could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The TIEA 35 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of the Cook Islands, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description”. As noted above, the Cook Islands currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Party is to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$2000. 38 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Cook Islands, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to the Cook Islands while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Article 12 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for the Cook Islands, the Collector of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Collector). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 12 The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement imposes obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances. (That is, in respect of pensions, government service and students.) 42 The practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be nil. If, however, New Zealand ever commences taxing maintenance payments received from outside New Zealand by visiting students, those taxing rights will be constrained in respect of students from the Cook Islands who come to New Zealand to study. 43 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 44 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 7 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1 45 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify the Cook Islands by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are complete. The Cook Islands will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement. The two agreements will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Their provisions will apply prospectively. (For example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force.) Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse the Cook Islands for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if 7 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 13 extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$2000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Cook Islands but, if requests for information are received from the Cook Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Cook Islands are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 For the reasons outlined in paragraph 19 above, New Zealand is unlikely to suffer any significant revenue loss from the limitation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement. Any revenue loss that is sustained would be minimal and would be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 53 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Party may terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For the Cook Islands, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 14 Adequacy statement 56 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate and in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and Tax Matters and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 21 and 28 April 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and Tax Matters National Interest Analysis Executive Summary 1 On 16 March 2010 New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and Tax Matters (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Dominica (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in place with key trading and investment partners which provide for exchange of information arrangements similar to those which are established under the TIEA. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as with low-tax jurisdictions. Dominica is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed a total of 13 TIEAs. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 A key measure offered by New Zealand to encourage Dominica to enter into the TIEA is found in Article 11 of the TIEA. This Article constitutes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions identified as having harmful tax practices has previously been raised. The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Dominica, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Dominica while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 5 It is proposed that the TIEA be brought into force for New Zealand following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. It is expected that this process will be completed by the end of 2010. 6 Subsequent to completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 1 Despite the reference to DTAs, the Agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Order in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, in accordance with Article 13 of the TIEA through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force of the TIEA by each Party. The TIEA comes into force on the date of the last notification, and takes effect for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force or, where there is no taxable period, for all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force. New Zealand will ensure that the arrangement referred to in paragraph 18 is concluded before its notification is sent. 8 New Zealand policy, once an exchange of information arrangement has been established with another jurisdiction, is to approve that jurisdiction for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Qualifying foreign investors from approved territories are exempt from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investment into New Zealand.) Approval of a jurisdiction for the purposes of section CW 12 requires the making of an additional Order in Council. This will be attended to after the TIEA enters into force. 9 The TIEAs will not apply to Tokelau, the Cook Islands or Niue Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action 10 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 2 1 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. 2 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88 (by virtue of its legislative definition) is also applicable to TIEAs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 11 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002 produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 3 The 2000 list includes Dominica. 12 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. A further 11 TIEAs have since been signed. This brings the total number of TIEAs signed by New Zealand to 13. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 13 The TIEA with Dominica provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity (the OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”). In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Parties.) 14 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 4 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 15 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 3 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 4 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 Consideration of other options 16 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Dominica. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Dominica would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. The fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with Dominica. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action Advantages 17 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Dominica. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion (the TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes). Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 18 The TIEA closely follows the 2002 OECD model TIEA and is subject to the comprehensive commentary produced by the OECD to support consistent interpretation and application of the TIEA provisions. 19 The approval of Dominica for the purposes of the section CW 12 venture capital exemption may result in increased venture capital investment into New Zealand. Disadvantages 20 Dominica is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Dominica, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Dominica will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 21 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Dominica. In order to set out a shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as provided for by Article 9, a less-than-treaty status Arrangement will be signed between the two Parties before the TIEA enters into force. The Arrangement will likely set out the parameters where the costs to a request must be borne by the requested Party and when a requesting Party must reimburse the requested Party any costs relating to a request. It is intended that the Arrangement will ensure that INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 22 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 6 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Dominica, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Dominica while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 23 New Zealand and Dominica do not have a strong bilateral relationship/history. 24 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with Dominica and to do so will achieve the Government’s policy objectives set out in the previous section. Legal obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 25 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes (Article 1). Such information includes information that is relevant to the determination, assessment and collection of taxes, the recovery and enforcement of tax claims, or the investigation or prosecution of criminal tax matters. In the case of Dominica, the TIEA will apply to “taxes of every kind and description” (this also applies to NZ). As noted above, Dominica currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 26 The legal obligations established by the TIEA include the requirement to provide information without regard to whether the conduct being investigated would constitute a crime under the laws of the Requested Party if such conduct occurred in the Requested Party (Article 5). Such an obligation is a feature of the OECD model TIEA, and is intended to counter any domestic law provision of a country that prevents the exchange of information on matters unless they constitute a crime. No such standard exists in New 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Dominica may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, it is intended that the MOU will provide for the possibility that the two sides will consult each other in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 6 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 Zealand, but they are a common feature of many of the jurisdictions with which New Zealand concludes TIEAs. 27 The TIEA also contemplates the possibility that representatives of the tax administration of the Requesting Party may be allowed to visit the Requested Party to interview individuals and examine records (Article 6). The treaty does not impose any obligation on the Requested Party to agree to such a visit. However, the possibility may prove to be useful in certain cases. For example, New Zealand officials may wish to consider visiting Dominica for the purposes of conducting interviews. 28 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request (Article 8). Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 29 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (Article 11). New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Dominica, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Dominica while the TIEA is in force. 30 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 31 Article 12 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Dominica, the Minister of Finance or the Minister’s authorised representative). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 32 Subject to the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. It is expected that this process will be completed by the end of 2010. 33 Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables TIEAs to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that TIEAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a TIEA, given that the TIEA requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is forbidden under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during TIEA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the TIEA. 34 After the Order in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify Dominica by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 entry into force of the TIEA are complete. Dominica will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA. The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last notification (Article 13). The provisions of the TIEA will apply prospectively (for example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force). Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 35 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 36 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Dominica but, if requests for information are received from Dominica, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests (Article 9). As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Dominica are therefore expected to be marginal. 37 In addition, New Zealand will likely be required to reimburse Dominica for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. It is intended that the Arrangement described above will set out the parameters where New Zealand will be required to reimburse Dominica for information requests it makes. It is intended that this will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 38 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 39 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted on the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published tax policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 40 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 41 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 42 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency disclosure statement 43 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA between New Zealand and Dominica and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation and has considered all other possible options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning that regulatory analysis. 44 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA into New Zealand domestic law. 45 Inland Revenue is of the opinion that the policy options considered will not impair additional costs on businesses during the current economic recession; impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 46 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this National Interest Analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous National Interest Analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Gibraltar on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 21 and 28 April 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Gibraltar on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes National Interest Analysis Executive Summary 1 On 13 August 2009, New Zealand signed the Agreement Between The Government Of Gibraltar And The Government Of New Zealand On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Gibraltar (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in place with key trading and investment partners which provide for exchange of information arrangements similar to those which are established under the TIEA. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as with low-tax jurisdictions. Gibraltar is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed a number of other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 A key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to Gibraltar to enter into the TIEA, is found in Article 11 of the TIEA. This Article constitutes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing sanctions on or taking other INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 defensive measures against jurisdictions identified as having harmful tax practices has previously been raised. The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Gibraltar, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Gibraltar while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 5 It is proposed that the TIEA be brought into force for New Zealand following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. 6 Subsequent to completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 1 Despite the reference to DTAs, the TIEA to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, in accordance with Article 13 of the TIEA through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force of the TIEA by each Party. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action 8 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 2 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 9 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2000, produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres 1 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. 2 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88 (by virtue of its legislative definition) is also applicable to TIEAs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 3 The 2000 list includes Gibraltar. 10 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. TIEAs have since been signed with the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 11 The TIEA with Gibraltar provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity (the OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”). In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) 12 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 4 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 13 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. Consideration of other options 14 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Gibraltar. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Gibraltar would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. The fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with Gibraltar. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 15 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Gibraltar. Access 3 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 4 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion (the TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes). Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. The TIEA is based on the 2002 OECD model TIEA and is subject to the comprehensive commentary produced by the OECD to support consistent interpretation and application of the TIEA provisions. 16 Gibraltar is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Gibraltar, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Gibraltar will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 17 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Gibraltar. The less-than-treaty status Understanding Between The Chief Secretary Of The Government Of Gibraltar And The New Zealand Inland Revenue Department Concerning The Liability For Costs Of Obtaining And Providing Information In Response To A Request Under The Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Gibraltar On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the Understanding”) sets out the shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 18 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 6 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Gibraltar may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides are to consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 6 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Gibraltar, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Gibraltar while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 19 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with Gibraltar. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 20 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Gibraltar, the specified taxes are “income taxes”. As noted above, Gibraltar currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 21 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 22 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Party is to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. 23 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Gibraltar, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Gibraltar while the TIEA is in force. 24 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 25 Article 12 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Gibraltar, the Chief Secretary or such other person as the Minister of Finance may appoint). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand read y to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 26 Subject to the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 27 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify Gibraltar by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. Gibraltar will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA. The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last notification. The provisions will apply prospectively (for example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force). Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 28 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 29 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Gibraltar for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 30 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Gibraltar but, if requests for information are received from Gibraltar New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Gibraltar are therefore expected to be marginal. 31 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 32 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 33 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 34 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving three months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 35 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Adequacy statement 36 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate and in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the States of Guernsey for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 21 and 28 April 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the States of Guernsey for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals National Interest Analysis Executive Summary 1 On 21 July 2009, New Zealand a tax-related agreement with Guernsey: the Agreement Between The States Of Guernsey And The Government Of New Zealand For The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes And The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Guernsey (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 exchange of information arrangements in place through its double tax agreements (“DTAs”) with key trading and investment partners. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as with low-tax jurisdictions. Guernsey is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed two other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, earlier this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 The TIEA contains articles that allocate taxing rights in respect of government service and students (“the additional articles”), following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The TIEA and additional articles collectively constitute a “package deal”. Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the limited nature of Guernsey’s tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 stands to gain considerable benefit. The additional articles were therefore offered by New Zealand as part of a number of measures intended to ensure that Guernsey also receives some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. (It is not appropriate to enter into a full DTA with Guernsey, given the mismatch in tax systems. However, the government service and students articles are two DTA articles that can be agreed with Guernsey as they will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs.) The TIEA also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. New Zealand will not gain any direct benefit from agreeing to the additional articles. The additional articles, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to the Guernsey to enter into the TIEA, is found in article 12 of the TIEA. This article constitutes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions identified as having harmful tax practices has previously been raised. The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Guernsey, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Guernsey while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 6 The TIEA will be supported by two less-than-treaty status instruments. The first instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand and Guernsey tax authorities that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. The second instrument is a Joint Declaration between the two Governments that contains reciprocal comments about each Government’s recognition of the other as having committed to various international standards (such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing) and cooperation in tax matters. The Joint Declaration also contemplates the possibility of future discussions that might be entered into with a view to broadening and strengthening the political and economic relationship between the Governments. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 7 Before the TIEA is brought into force for New Zealand it must first be submitted to the House of Representatives to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. (The less-than-treaty status Arrangement and Joint Declaration do not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand and are not required to undergo treaty examination.) 8 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the agreements can then each be brought into force, in accordance with article 13 of the TIEA, through an exchange of INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Party. 10 The TIEA will enter into force on the completion of the exchange of diplomatic notes. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after that date (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after that date). Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action The TIEA 11 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 12 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2000, produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 2 The 2000 list includes Guernsey. 13 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 14 The TIEA with Guernsey provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, has (by virtue of its legislative definition) the same meaning as that outlined in paragraph 8 above. Section 88 is therefore also applicable to TIEAs. The preamble of the TIEA contains a reference to “present legislation under which the parties may already exchange information in criminal tax matters”. In the case of New Zealand, this refers to the potential ability of New Zealand to provide assistance under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 15 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 16 Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, Guernsey only has a limited tax system. Guernsey will therefore only rarely have any need to request information on tax matters from other countries. New Zealand, by contrast, has a comprehensive tax system and imposes income tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents. New Zealand therefore has a keen interest in ensuring that it can obtain information on the income earning activities of those tax residents in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, New Zealand has a much greater interest in concluding a TIEA than Guernsey, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will Guernsey. 17 To address this imbalance, New Zealand has adopted the approach of other OECD member countries in TIEA negotiations and offered Guernsey a “benefits” package. The additional articles are a key element of that package. The additional articles allocates taxing rights in respect of government service and students, and is based on articles that appear in New Zealand’s DTAs. New Zealand also offered to establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments as part of the package. 4 18 New Zealand generally only enters into arrangements for the allocation of taxing rights in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). However, given Guernsey’s limited tax system, entering into a DTA with Guernsey would mean New Zealand giving up taxing rights with little if any reciprocity. 19 For this reason, New Zealand’s proposal for the additional articles was limited to those DTA articles that will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in Guernsey. In the negotiations, the additional articles were ultimately limited to the following: 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. 4 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8  Pursuant to article 9 of the TIEA, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. However, this rule does not apply if the individual is a tax resident of that other jurisdiction (unless the individual became resident solely by reason of the rendering of those services). The article will therefore only apply when a Guernsey Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 90 days.  Pursuant to article 10 of the TIEA, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their eduction or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to article 11 of the TIEA, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the TIEA provides that the Parties must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s existing DTAs.) 20 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The less-than-treaty status instruments 21 The TIEA will be supported by two less-than-treaty status instruments. The first instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand and Guernsey tax authorities that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. The second instrument is a Joint Declaration between the two Governments that contains reciprocal comments about each Government’s recognition of the other as having committed to various international standards (such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing) and cooperation in tax matters. The Joint Declaration also contemplates the possibility of future discussions that might be entered into with a view to broadening and strengthening the political and economic relationship between the Governments. 22 The less-than-treaty status Understanding and Joint Declaration do not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. They are therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. Consideration of other options 23 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Guernsey. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Guernsey would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. As noted above, the fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with Guernsey. 24 New Zealand’s offer of “benefits” to Guernsey was made at a time when Guernsey had little interest in entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. It followed the precedent established by other OECD countries in offering benefits. Recent developments, such as the 2 April 2009 G20 Leaders Summit in London, have increased international pressure on international finance centres to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements. This increased pressure may to some extent lessen the need to provide benefits to induce those international finance centres to enter into exchange of information arrangements. However, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to consider withdrawing its offer of benefits. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 25 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Guernsey. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 26 Guernsey is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Guernsey, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Guernsey will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 27 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Guernsey. The less-than-treaty status Understanding referred to in paragraph 21 above sets out the shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by article 8 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Guernsey may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides are to consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 28 The TIEA contains one article, article 12, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This Article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 12 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 6 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Guernsey, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Guernsey while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 29 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with Guernsey. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 30 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Guernsey, the specified taxes are “income tax and dwellings profits tax”. As noted above, Guernsey currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 31 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 32 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Party is to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. 33 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (the Understanding sets out the shared understanding of how this phrase will be interpreted). New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 6 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand read y to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 matters with Guernsey, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Guernsey while the TIEA is in force. 34 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 35 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Guernsey, the Director of Income Tax or the Director’s delegate). The Parties may also agree upon other forms of dispute resolution. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 36 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 7 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 37 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify Guernsey by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. Guernsey will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA. The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last notification. The provisions will apply prospectively. (For example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force.) Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 38 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 39 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Guernsey for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 7 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 12 40 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Guernsey but, if requests for information are received from Guernsey, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Guernsey are therefore expected to be marginal. 41 For the reasons outlined in paragraph 19 above, New Zealand is unlikely to suffer any significant revenue loss from the limitation of taxing rights under the additional articles. Any revenue loss that is sustained would be minimal and would be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the rest of the TIEA. 42 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 43 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 44 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 45 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving three months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in article 7 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 46 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Isle of Man on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Isle of Man for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in Respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments, and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House.

The two agreements are, respectively, the Agreement Between The Government Of The Isle Of Man And The Government Of New Zealand On the Exchange Of Information with Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of The Isle Of Man And The Government Of New Zealand For The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Isle of Man (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 exchange of information arrangements in place through its double tax agreements (“DTAs”) with key trading and investment partners. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as low-tax jurisdictions. The Isle of Man is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed two other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, earlier this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Party to which it is given.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement collectively constitute a “package deal”. Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the limited nature of the Isle of Man’s tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand as part of a number of measures intended to ensure that the Isle of Man also receives some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. (It is not appropriate to enter into a full DTA with the Isle of Man, given the mismatch in tax systems. However, the pension, government service and students articles are three DTA articles that can be agreed with the Isle of Man as they will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs.) The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. New Zealand will not gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. 5 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by two less-than-treaty status instruments. The first instrument is an Arrangement between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Treasury of the Isle of Man that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. The second instrument is a Joint Declaration between the two Governments that contains reciprocal comments about each Government’s recognition of the other as having committed to various international standards (such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing) and cooperation in tax matters. The Joint Declaration also contemplates the possibility of future discussions that might be entered into with a view to broadening and strengthening the political and economic relationship between the Governments. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 6 Before the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are brought into force for New Zealand the two agreements must first be submitted to the House of Representatives to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. (The less-than-treaty status Arrangement and Joint Declaration do not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand and are not required to undergo treaty examination.) 7 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 8 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement can then each be brought into force, in accordance with article 12 of the TIEA and article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Party. 9 Each agreement will enter into force on completion of the exchange of diplomatic notes. New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after that date (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after that date). The Supplementary Agreement will similarly apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action The TIEA 10 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 11 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2000, produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 2 The 2000 list includes the Isle of Man. 12 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 13 The TIEA with the Isle of Man provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, has (by virtue of its legislative definition) the same meaning as that outlined in paragraph 8 above. Section 88 is therefore also applicable to TIEAs. The preamble of the TIEA contains a reference to “present legislation under which the parties may already exchange information in criminal tax matters”. In the case of New Zealand, this refers to the potential ability of New Zealand to provide assistance under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) 14 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 15 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 16 Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the Isle of Man only has a limited tax system. The Isle of Man will therefore only rarely have any need to request information on tax matters from other countries. New Zealand, by contrast, has a comprehensive tax system and imposes income tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents. New Zealand therefore has a keen interest in ensuring that it can obtain information on the income earning activities of those tax residents in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, New Zealand has a much greater interest in concluding a TIEA than the Isle of Man, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will the Isle of Man. 17 To address this imbalance, New Zealand has adopted the approach of other OECD member countries in TIEA negotiations and offered the Isle of Man a “benefits” package. The Supplementary Agreement is a key element of that package. The Supplementary Agreement allocates taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and is based on articles that appear in New Zealand’s DTAs. New Zealand also offered to establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments as part of the package. 4 18 New Zealand generally only enters into arrangements for the allocation of taxing rights in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). However, given the Isle of Man’s limited tax system, entering into a 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. 4 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 DTA with the Isle of Man would mean New Zealand giving up taxing rights with little if any reciprocity. 19 For this reason, New Zealand’s proposal for a Supplementary Agreement was limited to those DTA articles that will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in the Isle of Man. In the negotiations, the Supplementary Agreement was ultimately limited to the following:  Pursuant to article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. The Isle of Man will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to the Isle of Man. (However, the article applies reciprocally to both countries. Therefore, New Zealand will also gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any person from the Isle of Man who retires to New Zealand.)  Pursuant to article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. However, this rule does not apply if the individual is a tax resident of that other jurisdiction (unless the individual became resident solely by reason of the rendering of those services). The article will therefore only apply when an Isle of Man Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 90 days.  Pursuant to article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their eduction or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Parties must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s existing DTAs.) 20 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for any purpose of the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protects tax matters. 21 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will only have effect while the TIEA is in force. 22 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. The less-than-treaty status instruments 23 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by two less-than-treaty status instruments. The first instrument is an Arrangement between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Treasury of the Isle of Man that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. The second instrument is a Joint Declaration between the two Governments that contains reciprocal comments about each Government’s recognition of the other as having committed to various international standards (such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing) and cooperation in tax matters. The Joint Declaration also contemplates the possibility of future discussions that might be entered into with a view to broadening and strengthening the political and economic relationship between the Governments. 24 The less-than-treaty status Arrangement and Joint Declaration do not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. They are therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. Consideration of other options 25 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with the Isle of Man. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with the Isle of Man would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. As noted above, the fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with the Isle of Man. 26 New Zealand’s offer of “benefits” to the Isle of Man was made at a time when the Isle of Man had little interest in entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. It followed the precedent established by other OECD countries in offering benefits. Recent developments, such as the 2 April 2009 G20 Leaders Summit in London, have increased international pressure on international finance centres to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements. This increased pressure may to some extent lessen the need to provide benefits to induce those international finance centres to enter into exchange of information arrangements. However, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to consider withdrawing its offer of benefits. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 27 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from the Isle of Man. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 28 The Isle of Man is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from the Isle of Man, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Isle of Man will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 29 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to the Isle of Man. The less-than-treaty status Arrangement referred to in paragraph 23 above sets out the shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 30 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with the Isle of Man. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 31 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with the Isle of Man. 32 If the Isle of Man ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement would cease to apply and New Zealand would likely terminate the Arrangement. Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, the Isle of Man could be expected to terminate the TIEA. 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in the Isle of Man may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides are to consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The TIEA 33 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of the Isle of Man, the specified taxes are “taxes on income or profits”. As noted above, the Isle of Man currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 34 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 35 In the Arrangement, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Party is to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. 36 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 37 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for the Isle of Man, the Assessor of Income Tax or an authorised delegate). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. The Supplementary Agreement 38 The Supplementary Agreement imposes obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances. (That is, in respect of pensions, government service and students.) 39 The practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be nil. If, however, New Zealand ever commences taxing maintenance payments received from outside New Zealand by visiting students, those taxing rights will be constrained in respect of students from the Isle of Man who come to New Zealand to study. 40 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 41 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 12 Act 2007. (Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 6 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1.) 42 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify the Isle of Man by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are complete. The Isle of Man will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement. The two agreements will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Their provisions will apply prospectively. (For example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force.) Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 43 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 44 New Zealand will be required to reimburse the Isle of Man for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Arrangement provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 45 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Isle of Man but, if requests for information are received from the Isle of Man, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Isle of Man are therefore expected to be marginal. 46 For the reasons outlined in paragraph 19 above, New Zealand is unlikely to suffer any significant revenue loss from the limitation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement. Any revenue loss that is sustained would be minimal and would be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 6 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 13 47 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 48 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 49 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 50 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 51 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Party may, terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following that in which the notice of termination is given. For the Isle of Man, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 6 April in the calendar year following that in which the notice of termination is given. 52 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Jersey for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Jersey for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in Respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House.

INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 21 and 28 April 2010 to consider the agreements.

The two agreements are, respectively, the Agreement Between The Government Of Jersey And The Government Of New Zealand For The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of Jersey And The Government Of New Zealand For The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Jersey (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 exchange of information arrangements in place through its double tax agreements (“DTAs”) with key trading and investment partners. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as low-tax jurisdictions. Jersey is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed two other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, earlier this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Party to which it is given.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement collectively constitute a “package deal”. Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the limited nature of Jersey’s tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand as part of a number of measures intended to ensure that Jersey also receives some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. (It is not appropriate to enter into a full DTA with Jersey, given the mismatch in tax systems. However, the pension, government service and students articles are three DTA articles that can be agreed with Jersey as they will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs.) The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. New Zealand will not gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to Jersey to enter into the TIEA, is found in article 9 of the TIEA. This article constitutes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions identified as having harmful tax practices has previously been raised. The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Jersey, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Jersey while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 6 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by two less-than-treaty status instruments. The first instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Jersey Ministry of Treasury and Resources that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. The second instrument is a Understanding between the two Governments that contains reciprocal comments about each Government’s recognition of the other as having committed to various international standards (such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing) and cooperation in tax matters. The Understanding also contemplates the possibility of future discussions that might be entered into with a view to broadening and strengthening the political and economic relationship between the Governments. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 7 Before the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are brought into force for New Zealand the two agreements must first be submitted to the House of Representatives to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. (The less-than-treaty status Understandings do not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand and are not required to undergo treaty examination.) 8 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement can then each be brought into force, in accordance with article 11 of the TIEA and article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Party. 10 Each agreement will enter into force on completion of its respective exchange of diplomatic notes. New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after that date (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after that date). The Supplementary Agreement will similarly apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action The TIEA 11 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 12 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2000, produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, has (by virtue of its legislative definition) the same meaning as that outlined in paragraph 8 above. Section 88 is therefore also applicable to TIEAs. The preamble of the TIEA contains a reference to “present legislation under which the parties may already exchange information in criminal tax matters”. In the case of New Zealand, this refers to the potential ability of New Zealand to provide assistance under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 2 The 2000 list includes Jersey. 13 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 14 The TIEA with Jersey provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) 15 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 16 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 17 Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, Jersey only has a limited tax system. Jersey will therefore only rarely have any need to request information on tax matters from other countries. New Zealand, by contrast, has a comprehensive tax system and imposes income tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents. New Zealand therefore has a keen interest in ensuring that it can obtain information on the income earning activities of those tax residents in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, New Zealand has a much greater interest in concluding a TIEA than Jersey, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than Jersey. 18 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand has adopted the approach of other OECD member countries in TIEA negotiations and offered Jersey a “benefits” package. The Supplementary Agreement is a key element of that package. The Supplementary 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 Agreement allocates taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and is based on articles that appear in New Zealand’s DTAs. New Zealand also offered to establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments as part of the package. 4 19 New Zealand generally only enters into arrangements for the allocation of taxing rights in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). However, given Jersey’s limited tax system, entering into a DTA with Jersey would mean New Zealand giving up taxing rights with little if any reciprocity. 20 For this reason, New Zealand’s proposal for a Supplementary Agreement was limited to those DTA articles that will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in Jersey. In the negotiations, the Supplementary Agreement was ultimately limited to the following:  Pursuant to article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. Jersey will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to Jersey. (However, the article applies reciprocally to both countries. Therefore, New Zealand will also gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any person from Jersey who retires to New Zealand.)  Pursuant to article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. However, this rule does not apply if the individual is a tax resident of that other jurisdiction (unless the individual became resident solely by reason of the rendering of those services). The article will therefore only apply when a Jersey Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 90 days.  Pursuant to article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their eduction or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications. 4 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9  Pursuant to article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Parties must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s existing DTAs.) 21 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for any purpose of the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protects tax matters. 22 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will only have effect while the TIEA is in force. 23 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. The less-than-treaty status instruments 24 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by two less-than-treaty status instruments. The first instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Jersey Ministry of Treasury and Resources that contains additional clarification on technical issues such as the meaning of terms used in the agreements. The second instrument is an Understanding between the two Governments that contains reciprocal comments about each Government’s recognition of the other as having committed to various international standards (such as combating money laundering and terrorist financing) and cooperation in tax matters. The Understanding also contemplates the possibility of future discussions that might be entered into with a view to broadening and strengthening the political and economic relationship between the Governments. 25 The less-than-treaty status Understandings do not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. They are therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. Consideration of other options 26 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Jersey. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Jersey would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. As noted above, the fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with Jersey. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 27 New Zealand’s offer of “benefits” to Jersey was made at a time when Jersey had little interest in entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. It followed the precedent established by other OECD countries in offering benefits. Recent developments, such as the 2 April 2009 G20 Leaders Summit in London, have increased international pressure on international finance centres to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements. This increased pressure may to some extent lessen the need to provide benefits to induce those international finance centres to enter into exchange of information arrangements. However, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to consider withdrawing its offer of benefits. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 28 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Jersey. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 29 Jersey is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Jersey, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Jersey will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 30 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Jersey. The less-than-treaty status technical Understanding referred to in paragraph 24 above sets out the shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by article 8 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 31 The TIEA contains one article, article 9, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This Article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 9 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Jersey may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides are to consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 6 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Jersey, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Jersey while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 32 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with Jersey. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with Jersey. 34 If Jersey ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement would also automatically terminate and New Zealand would be likely to terminate the Understanding. Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, Jersey could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The TIEA 35 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Jersey, the specified taxes are “the income tax; and the goods and services tax”. As noted above, Jersey currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 6 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand read y to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 12 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidents of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Party is to reimburse the requested Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. 38 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Jersey, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Jersey while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Article 10 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Jersey, the Treasury and Resources Minister or an authorised representative of the Minister). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement imposes obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances. (That is, in respect of pensions, government service and students.) 42 The practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be nil. If, however, New Zealand ever commences taxing maintenance payments received from outside New Zealand by visiting students, those taxing rights will be constrained in respect of students from Jersey who come to New Zealand to study. 43 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 44 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 7 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also 7 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 13 listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1.) 45 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, New Zealand will notify Jersey by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are complete. Jersey will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement. The two agreements will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Their provisions will apply prospectively. (For example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force.) Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Jersey for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Jersey but, if requests for information are received from Jersey, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Jersey are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 For the reasons outlined in paragraph 20 above, New Zealand is unlikely to suffer any significant revenue loss from the limitation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement. Any revenue loss that is sustained would be minimal and would be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 14 Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 53 Article 12 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving three months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in article 7 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Party may, terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For Jersey, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Adequacy statement 56 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate and in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 4 We have conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments; and the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes. Tax Information Exchange Agreements are special-purpose bilateral treaties that allow countries to exchange information to assist each other in the enforcement of tax laws on request. Since 2004, New Zealand and Australia have made concerted efforts to conclude a number of tax information exchange agreements with other Pacific jurisdictions. These agreements between New Zealand and the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu reflect the results of this effort. The information exchange agreements with the Marshall Islands and Samoa are accompanied by agreements on the allocation of taxing rights and transfer pricing adjustments. These supplementary agreements provide specifically for the allocation of taxing rights in a small number of cases, covering students, Government service, and pensions. They also establish a mutual agreement procedure for resolving transfer pricing cases, requiring the two jurisdictions to consult with a view to resolving any issue that may arise. The tax information exchange agreements are reciprocal, in that they allow each party to the agreements to request information from the other. They do not impose any compliance costs on taxpayers, and will not have any significant fiscal implications for New Zealand. We therefore recommend that the Executive proceed with its proposed treaty action. The national interest analyses for the agreements are appended to this report. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 5 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 15 September and 20 October 2010 to consider the agreements. It heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett Hon John Boscawen (until 8 September 2010) Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Hon Sir Roger Douglas (from 8 September 2010) Aaron Gilmore Hon Shane Jones Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 6 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments Executive summary 1 New Zealand has signed, on 6 August 2010, two tax-related agreements with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“the Marshall Islands”). The two agreements are the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Republic Of The Marshall Islands On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Republic Of The Marshall Islands On The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Marshall Islands (“the Contracting States”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Ready access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting State to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 4 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the more limited nature of the Marshall Islands’ tax system means that it will derive lesser benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that the Marshall Islands will also receive some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 7 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our double tax agreements (“DTAs”). The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. The articles contained in the Supplementary Agreement are not expected to give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex II. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to the Marshall Islands to enter into the TIEA is Article 11 of the TIEA. This article will establish an obligation for the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. Given that the TIEA with the Marshall Islands will provide for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 6 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order(s) in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order(s) in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, each agreement can then be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting State (Article 13 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement). New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). The Supplementary Agreement will apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. 8 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The agreements will not apply to these states. (The agreements apply only for the purposes of New Zealand and Marshall Islands taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and 1 Refer to Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 8 prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also (in 2000) published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The list includes the Marshall Islands. New Zealand has, to date, signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. 11 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with the Marshall Islands will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State.) 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 9 The Supplementary Agreement 15 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the Marshall Islands has a more limited tax system than New Zealand. 4 The Marshall Islands will therefore have less need to request information on tax matters from offshore than will New Zealand. Accordingly, New Zealand has a greater interest in concluding a TIEA than the Marshall Islands, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will the Marshall Islands. 16 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand offered the Marshall Islands a Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and that will establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. 5 17 New Zealand generally enters into provisions for the allocation of taxing rights only in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). 18 Full reciprocity of this type is unlikely to occur in relation to the Marshall Islands. For this reason, New Zealand proposed a Supplementary Agreement that contains a limited selection of DTA articles. The articles chosen do not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs for New Zealand. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in the Marshall Islands. The Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands will give rise to the following:  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. This will mean, for example, that the Marshall Islands will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to the Marshall Islands. (However, the pension must actually be subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands for the article to apply. Therefore, there will be no incentive for New Zealanders to seek to retire to the Marshall Islands in order to obtain a tax exemption.)  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. The rule is formulated in a way designed to ensure that it will only apply when a Marshall Islands’ Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 92 days. 4 The Marshall Islands, unlike many of the other jurisdictions with which we are concluding TIEAs, does tax the worldwide income of its residents. However, the concept of “residence” for tax purposes is more limited than is the case in New Zealand. In addition, The Marshall Islands tax law does not have many elements that are typical of developed country tax systems, such as Controlled Foreign Company legislation. 5 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 10  Pursuant to Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their education or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Contracting States must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s DTAs.) 19 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that, if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for the purpose of applying the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating the domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protect tax matters. 20 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will have effect only while the TIEA is in force. 21 New Zealand will not itself gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports both the conclusion of the TIEA and relations between the Contracting States, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. 22 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex II. The Understanding on Costs 23 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty-status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Marshall Islands’ Revenue and Taxation Office that sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability for costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 24 The less-than-treaty-status Understanding will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Marshall Islands Revenue and Taxation Office prior to entry into force of the TIEA. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 11 Consideration of Other Options 25 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with the Marshall Islands. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with the Marshall Islands would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with the Marshall Islands any priority in the short-to-medium term. 26 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as the Marshall Islands, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. This increased pressure makes it arguable that benefits such as a Supplementary Agreement no longer need to feature in TIEA negotiations. However, the offer of benefits was made to the Marshall Islands before the developments that resulted in increased international pressure. New Zealand’s approach is also consistent with that of Australia (which signed a TIEA and Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands on 12 May 2010). Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 27 The Marshall Islands is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in the Marshall Islands to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from the Marshall Islands in respect of such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 28 The Marshall Islands is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from the Marshall Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Marshall Islands will therefore be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any costs that may arise. 29 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to the Marshall Islands. The less-than-treaty-status Understanding referred to above sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting States with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting State, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 12 reimbursed by the requesting Contracting State. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 6 30 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with the Marshall Islands. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA and relations generally. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 31 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing coordinated sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions for refusing to exchange information on tax matters has been raised. 7 Given that the TIEA with the Marshall Islands provides for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. 32 The conclusion of the TIEA with the Marshall Islands will also enable New Zealand to list the Marshall Islands as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands. 34 If the Marshall Islands ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement will cease to apply. (Given that sole purpose of the Supplementary Agreement 6 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in the Marshall Islands may mean that, on occasion, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 7 Refer to the 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders’ Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 13 is to support the conclusion of the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement clarifies that it shall have effect only when a TIEA is in force between the Contracting States.) Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, the Marshall Islands could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations The TIEA 35 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation for each Contracting State to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of the Marshall Islands, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description” (see Article 2(1)(a)). As noted above, the Marshall Islands is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used only for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State), (see Article 8). 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidence of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting State is to reimburse the requested Contracting State for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting State. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. 38 Both Contracting States will be constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (see Article 11). New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Marshall Islands, New Zealand would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; for the Marshall Islands, the Minister of Revenue or an authorised representative of the Minister of Revenue). The Contracting States may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution (see Article 12). The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement will impose obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances (in respect of pensions, government service and students). For reasons detailed at paragraph 18 above, the practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be minimal. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 14  In respect of pensions, New Zealand will be unable to tax a pension paid from New Zealand to a recipient who is a tax resident of the Marshall Islands. (This obligation applies only if the pension is subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands. See Article 5.)  In respect of remuneration for government service, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments made by the Government of the Marshall Islands to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government. The rule, as formulated, will apply only when a Marshall Islands’ Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity (see Article 6).  In respect of students and business apprentices, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments received from outside New Zealand for the purposes of a student or apprentice’s maintenance, education or training (see Article 7).  In respect of transfer pricing adjustments, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department may be required to enter into consultations with the Marshall Islands’ Ministry of Revenue if a taxpayer affected by the adjustment invokes the mutual agreement procedure (see Article 8). 42 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Implementation 43 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order(s) in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order(s) in Council. 8 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 44 Upon completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, officials will arrange for Order(s) in Council to be made and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. This includes New Zealand notifying the Marshall Islands by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. The Marshall Islands will likewise notify New Zealand when its own procedures are complete. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of 2010. 45 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreements. 8 That is, the Order(s) in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters for these Acts. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 15 Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Costs and Effects of the Treaty Action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of Compliance with the Agreements 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse the Marshall Islands for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Marshall Islands but, if requests for information are received from the Marshall Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Marshall Islands are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 The allocation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement will result in some revenue cost. However, as noted in paragraph 18 above, this is not expected to be significant. Any revenue loss that is sustained will be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this national interest analysis.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in the government’s published policy work programmes. Future Protocols 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case-by-case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or Denunciation 53 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ notice, in writing, through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting States will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Contracting State may terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 16 channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For the Marshall Islands, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 October in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency Disclosure Statement 56 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA and a Supplementary Agreement between New Zealand and the Marshall Islands and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other relevant options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 57 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement into New Zealand domestic law. 58 Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 59 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and national interest analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and national interest analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 17 Appendix C Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments Executive Summary 1 New Zealand has signed, on 24 August 2010, two tax-related agreements with Samoa. The two agreements are the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Samoa On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Samoa On The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Samoa (“the Contracting States”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting State to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the more limited nature of Samoa’s tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that Samoa will also receive some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 18 mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. The articles contained in the Supplementary Agreement are not expected to give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to Samoa to enter into the TIEA is Article 11 of the TIEA. This article will establish an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. Given that the TIEA with Samoa will provide for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Samoa while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 6 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order(s) in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order(s) in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, the agreements can then each be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting State (Article 13 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement). New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). The Supplementary Agreement will apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. 8 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The agreements will not apply to these states. (The agreements apply only for the purposes of New Zealand and Samoan taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the Treaty The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 19 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also (in 2000) published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The 2000 list includes Samoa. New Zealand has, to date, signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. The TIEA with Samoa will be our 16th. 11 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with Samoa will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State.) 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 15 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, Samoa has a more limited tax system than New Zealand. 4 Samoa will therefore have less need to request information on 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. 4 Samoa, unlike many of the other jurisdictions with which we are concluding TIEAs, does tax the worldwide income of its residents. However, the concept of “residence” for tax purposes is more limited than is the case in New Zealand. In TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 20 tax matters from offshore than will New Zealand. Accordingly, New Zealand has a greater interest in concluding a TIEA than Samoa, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will Samoa. 16 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand offered Samoa a Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students and that will establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. 5 17 New Zealand generally enters into provisions for the allocation of taxing rights only in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). 18 Full reciprocity of this type is unlikely to occur in relation to Samoa. For this reason, New Zealand proposed a Supplementary Agreement that contains a limited selection of DTA articles. The articles chosen do not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs for New Zealand. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in Samoa. The Supplementary Agreement with Samoa will give rise to the following:  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. This will mean, for example, that Samoa will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to Samoa. (However, the pension must actually be subject to income tax in Samoa for the article to apply. Therefore, there will be no incentive for New Zealanders to seek to retire to Samoa in order to obtain a tax exemption.)  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. The rule is formulated in a way designed to ensure that it will only apply when a Samoan Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 92 days. addition, Samoan tax law does not have many elements that are typical of developed country tax systems, such as Controlled Foreign Company legislation. 5 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 21  Pursuant to Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their education or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Contracting States must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s DTAs.) 19 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for the purpose of applying the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protect tax matters. 20 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will have effect only while the TIEA is in force. 21 New Zealand will not itself gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports both the conclusion of the TIEA and relations between the Contracting States, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. 22 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. The Understanding 23 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Samoan Ministry of Revenue that sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability for costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 24 The less-than-treaty status Understanding will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue and Samoa’s Ministry of Revenue prior to entry into force of the TIEA. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 22 Consideration of other options 25 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Samoa. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Samoa would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with Samoa any priority in the short-to-medium term. 26 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as Samoa, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. This increased pressure makes it arguable that New Zealand did not need to offer Samoa a Supplementary Agreement. However, New Zealand has a very close relationship with Samoa, and it is appropriate to ensure that both sides derive benefit from the information-sharing arrangement. New Zealand’s approach is also consistent with that of other OECD member countries, particularly that of Australia. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 27 Samoa is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in Samoa to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Samoa in respect of such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 28 Samoa is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Samoa, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Samoa will therefore be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 29 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Samoa. The less-than-treaty status Understanding referred to above sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting States with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting State, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Contracting State. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 23 to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 6 30 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with Samoa. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA and relations generally. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 31 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing coordinated sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions for refusing to exchange information on tax matters has been raised. 7 Given that the TIEA with Samoa provides for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Samoa while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. 32 The conclusion of the TIEA with Samoa will also enable New Zealand to list Samoa as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with Samoa. 34 If Samoa ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement will cease to apply. (Given that sole purpose of the Supplementary Agreement is to support the conclusion of the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement clarifies that it shall have effect only when a TIEA is in force between the Contracting States.) Similarly, if 6 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Samoa may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 7 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders’ Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 24 New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, Samoa could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations The TIEA 35 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting State to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Samoa, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description”. Article 2(1)(a) refers. As noted above, Samoa is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used only for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State). Article 8 refers. 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidence of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting State is to reimburse the requested Contracting State for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting State. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. 38 Both Contracting States will be constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. Article 11 refers. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Samoa, New Zealand would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Samoa while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; for Samoa, the Minister of Revenue or an authorised representative of the Minister of Revenue). The Contracting States may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Article 12 refers. The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement will impose obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances (in respect of pensions, government service and students). For reasons detailed at paragraph 18 above, the practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be minimal.  In respect of pensions, New Zealand will be unable to tax a pension paid from New Zealand to a recipient who is a tax resident of Samoa. (This obligation applies only if the pension is subject to income tax in Samoa.) Article 5 refers. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 25  In respect of remuneration for government service, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments made by the Government of Samoa to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government. The rule, as formulated, will apply only when a Samoan Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Article 6 refers.  In respect of students and business apprentices, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments received from outside New Zealand for the purposes of a student or apprentice’s maintenance, education or training. Article 7 refers.  In respect of transfer pricing adjustments, the New Zealand Inland Revenue may be required to enter into consultations with Samoa’s Ministry of Revenue if a taxpayer affected by the adjustment invokes the mutual agreement procedure. Article 8 refers. 42 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Implementation 43 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 8 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 44 Upon signing, officials will arrange for an Order in Council to be made and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of the year. 45 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreements. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the agreements 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Samoa for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress 8 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 26 information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Samoa but, if requests for information are received from Samoa, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Samoa are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 The allocation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement will result in some revenue cost. However, as noted in paragraph 20 above, this is not expected to be significant. Any revenue loss that is sustained will be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this NIA.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in Inland Revenue’s published policy work programmes. Future Protocols 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation 53 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting States will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Contracting State may terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For Samoa, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 27 Agency disclosure statement 56 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA and a Supplementary Agreement between New Zealand and Samoa and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other possible options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 57 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement into New Zealand domestic law. 58 Inland Revenue is of the opinion that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights, restrict market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 59 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and National Interest Analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and National Interest Analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 28 Appendix D Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Executive Summary 1 On 4 August 2010, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Vanuatu (“the Contracting Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities), for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Ready access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons, and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting Party to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 4 The TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis. That is, tax officials from New Zealand and Vanuatu will be able to request information from each other. In practice, however, given the more limited nature of Vanuatu’s tax system, New Zealand can be expected to make more requests for information than will Vanuatu. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 5 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council, pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 6 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting Party (Article 12 of the TIEA). Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 29 7 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The TIEA will not apply to these states. (The TIEA applies only for the purposes of New Zealand and Vanuatu taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty The TIEA 8 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 9 Double tax agreements (“DTA”s) are the most common type of tax treaty that feature exchange of information provisions. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. In 2000, the OECD also published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The 2000 list includes Vanuatu. To date, New Zealand has signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. 10 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements, and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 11 The TIEA with Vanuatu will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the TIEA will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons, and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting Party). 12 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards 1 Refer to Sections 81 and 88 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations to determine whether a person has declared their income correctly. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules, with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information, if that jurisdiction does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 30 secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting Parties will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in regarding any information received pursuant to a request. 13 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. The Understanding on Costs 14 The TIEA will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding on Costs between the New Zealand Inland Revenue and the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue of Vanuatu, which sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability, for the costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 15 The less-than-treaty status of the Understanding on Costs will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue and Vanuatu’s Ministry of Revenue, prior to entry into force of the TIEA. Consideration of other options 16 New Zealand’s objective in the negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Vanuatu. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Vanuatu would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with Vanuatu any priority in the short-to-medium term. 17 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as Vanuatu, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. New Zealand’s approach is consistent with that of other OECD member countries, including that of Australia. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force 18 Vanuatu is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in Vanuatu to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Vanuatu regarding such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information regarding “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be regarding income taxes.) Any reduction in tax override any domestic tax interest rules, with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 31 avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 19 Vanuatu is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Vanuatu, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established for New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Vanuatu will therefore be marginal. Experience, gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties, indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that may arise. 20 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs regarding requests for information that it makes to Vanuatu. The less-than-treaty status Understanding on Costs, referred to above, sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Contracting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 4 21 The conclusion of the TIEA with Vanuatu will also enable New Zealand to list Vanuatu as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 22 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with Vanuatu. Obligations 23 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting Party to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Vanuatu, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description”, (see article 2(1)(a)). As noted above, Vanuatu is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 4 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Vanuatu may mean that, on occasions, Vanuatu may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding on Costs also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 32 24 The Contracting Parties will be required to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons, and may be used only for specified purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting Party, see Article 8). 25 In the Understanding on Costs, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting Party is to reimburse the requested Contracting Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise, costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. 26 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 27 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Vanuatu, the Minister of Finance or the Minister’s authorised representative). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Implementation 28 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council, in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 5 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 29 Upon completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, officials will arrange for an Order in Council to be made, and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. This includes New Zealand notifying Vanuatu by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. Vanuatu will likewise notify New Zealand when its own procedures are complete. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of the year. 30 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreement. 5 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters for these Acts. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 33 Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 31 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the agreement 32 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Vanuatu for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding on Costs provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 33 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Vanuatu but, if requests for information are received from Vanuatu, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established for New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Vanuatu are therefore expected to be marginal. 34 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 35 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this NIA.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in the government’s published policy work programmes. Future protocols 36 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation 37 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 38 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency disclosure statement 39 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA between New Zealand and Vanuatu, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 34 all other relevant options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 40 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA into New Zealand domestic law. 41 Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 42 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and National Interest Analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and National Interest Analyses prepared regarding other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed, and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties.

TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 4 We have conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments; and the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes. Tax Information Exchange Agreements are special-purpose bilateral treaties that allow countries to exchange information to assist each other in the enforcement of tax laws on request. Since 2004, New Zealand and Australia have made concerted efforts to conclude a number of tax information exchange agreements with other Pacific jurisdictions. These agreements between New Zealand and the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu reflect the results of this effort. The information exchange agreements with the Marshall Islands and Samoa are accompanied by agreements on the allocation of taxing rights and transfer pricing adjustments. These supplementary agreements provide specifically for the allocation of taxing rights in a small number of cases, covering students, Government service, and pensions. They also establish a mutual agreement procedure for resolving transfer pricing cases, requiring the two jurisdictions to consult with a view to resolving any issue that may arise. The tax information exchange agreements are reciprocal, in that they allow each party to the agreements to request information from the other. They do not impose any compliance costs on taxpayers, and will not have any significant fiscal implications for New Zealand. We therefore recommend that the Executive proceed with its proposed treaty action. The national interest analyses for the agreements are appended to this report. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 5 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 15 September and 20 October 2010 to consider the agreements. It heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett Hon John Boscawen (until 8 September 2010) Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Hon Sir Roger Douglas (from 8 September 2010) Aaron Gilmore Hon Shane Jones Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 6 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments Executive summary 1 New Zealand has signed, on 6 August 2010, two tax-related agreements with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“the Marshall Islands”). The two agreements are the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Republic Of The Marshall Islands On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Republic Of The Marshall Islands On The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Marshall Islands (“the Contracting States”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Ready access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting State to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 4 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the more limited nature of the Marshall Islands’ tax system means that it will derive lesser benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that the Marshall Islands will also receive some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 7 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our double tax agreements (“DTAs”). The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. The articles contained in the Supplementary Agreement are not expected to give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex II. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to the Marshall Islands to enter into the TIEA is Article 11 of the TIEA. This article will establish an obligation for the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. Given that the TIEA with the Marshall Islands will provide for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 6 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order(s) in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order(s) in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, each agreement can then be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting State (Article 13 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement). New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). The Supplementary Agreement will apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. 8 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The agreements will not apply to these states. (The agreements apply only for the purposes of New Zealand and Marshall Islands taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and 1 Refer to Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 8 prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also (in 2000) published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The list includes the Marshall Islands. New Zealand has, to date, signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. 11 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with the Marshall Islands will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State.) 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 9 The Supplementary Agreement 15 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the Marshall Islands has a more limited tax system than New Zealand. 4 The Marshall Islands will therefore have less need to request information on tax matters from offshore than will New Zealand. Accordingly, New Zealand has a greater interest in concluding a TIEA than the Marshall Islands, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will the Marshall Islands. 16 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand offered the Marshall Islands a Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and that will establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. 5 17 New Zealand generally enters into provisions for the allocation of taxing rights only in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). 18 Full reciprocity of this type is unlikely to occur in relation to the Marshall Islands. For this reason, New Zealand proposed a Supplementary Agreement that contains a limited selection of DTA articles. The articles chosen do not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs for New Zealand. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in the Marshall Islands. The Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands will give rise to the following:  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. This will mean, for example, that the Marshall Islands will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to the Marshall Islands. (However, the pension must actually be subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands for the article to apply. Therefore, there will be no incentive for New Zealanders to seek to retire to the Marshall Islands in order to obtain a tax exemption.)  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. The rule is formulated in a way designed to ensure that it will only apply when a Marshall Islands’ Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 92 days. 4 The Marshall Islands, unlike many of the other jurisdictions with which we are concluding TIEAs, does tax the worldwide income of its residents. However, the concept of “residence” for tax purposes is more limited than is the case in New Zealand. In addition, The Marshall Islands tax law does not have many elements that are typical of developed country tax systems, such as Controlled Foreign Company legislation. 5 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 10  Pursuant to Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their education or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Contracting States must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s DTAs.) 19 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that, if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for the purpose of applying the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating the domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protect tax matters. 20 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will have effect only while the TIEA is in force. 21 New Zealand will not itself gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports both the conclusion of the TIEA and relations between the Contracting States, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. 22 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex II. The Understanding on Costs 23 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty-status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Marshall Islands’ Revenue and Taxation Office that sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability for costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 24 The less-than-treaty-status Understanding will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Marshall Islands Revenue and Taxation Office prior to entry into force of the TIEA. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 11 Consideration of Other Options 25 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with the Marshall Islands. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with the Marshall Islands would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with the Marshall Islands any priority in the short-to-medium term. 26 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as the Marshall Islands, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. This increased pressure makes it arguable that benefits such as a Supplementary Agreement no longer need to feature in TIEA negotiations. However, the offer of benefits was made to the Marshall Islands before the developments that resulted in increased international pressure. New Zealand’s approach is also consistent with that of Australia (which signed a TIEA and Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands on 12 May 2010). Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 27 The Marshall Islands is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in the Marshall Islands to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from the Marshall Islands in respect of such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 28 The Marshall Islands is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from the Marshall Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Marshall Islands will therefore be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any costs that may arise. 29 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to the Marshall Islands. The less-than-treaty-status Understanding referred to above sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting States with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting State, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 12 reimbursed by the requesting Contracting State. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 6 30 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with the Marshall Islands. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA and relations generally. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 31 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing coordinated sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions for refusing to exchange information on tax matters has been raised. 7 Given that the TIEA with the Marshall Islands provides for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. 32 The conclusion of the TIEA with the Marshall Islands will also enable New Zealand to list the Marshall Islands as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands. 34 If the Marshall Islands ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement will cease to apply. (Given that sole purpose of the Supplementary Agreement 6 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in the Marshall Islands may mean that, on occasion, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 7 Refer to the 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders’ Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 13 is to support the conclusion of the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement clarifies that it shall have effect only when a TIEA is in force between the Contracting States.) Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, the Marshall Islands could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations The TIEA 35 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation for each Contracting State to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of the Marshall Islands, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description” (see Article 2(1)(a)). As noted above, the Marshall Islands is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used only for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State), (see Article 8). 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidence of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting State is to reimburse the requested Contracting State for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting State. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. 38 Both Contracting States will be constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (see Article 11). New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Marshall Islands, New Zealand would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; for the Marshall Islands, the Minister of Revenue or an authorised representative of the Minister of Revenue). The Contracting States may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution (see Article 12). The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement will impose obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances (in respect of pensions, government service and students). For reasons detailed at paragraph 18 above, the practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be minimal. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 14  In respect of pensions, New Zealand will be unable to tax a pension paid from New Zealand to a recipient who is a tax resident of the Marshall Islands. (This obligation applies only if the pension is subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands. See Article 5.)  In respect of remuneration for government service, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments made by the Government of the Marshall Islands to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government. The rule, as formulated, will apply only when a Marshall Islands’ Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity (see Article 6).  In respect of students and business apprentices, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments received from outside New Zealand for the purposes of a student or apprentice’s maintenance, education or training (see Article 7).  In respect of transfer pricing adjustments, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department may be required to enter into consultations with the Marshall Islands’ Ministry of Revenue if a taxpayer affected by the adjustment invokes the mutual agreement procedure (see Article 8). 42 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Implementation 43 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order(s) in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order(s) in Council. 8 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 44 Upon completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, officials will arrange for Order(s) in Council to be made and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. This includes New Zealand notifying the Marshall Islands by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. The Marshall Islands will likewise notify New Zealand when its own procedures are complete. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of 2010. 45 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreements. 8 That is, the Order(s) in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters for these Acts. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 15 Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Costs and Effects of the Treaty Action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of Compliance with the Agreements 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse the Marshall Islands for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Marshall Islands but, if requests for information are received from the Marshall Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Marshall Islands are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 The allocation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement will result in some revenue cost. However, as noted in paragraph 18 above, this is not expected to be significant. Any revenue loss that is sustained will be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this national interest analysis.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in the government’s published policy work programmes. Future Protocols 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case-by-case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or Denunciation 53 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ notice, in writing, through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting States will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Contracting State may terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 16 channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For the Marshall Islands, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 October in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency Disclosure Statement 56 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA and a Supplementary Agreement between New Zealand and the Marshall Islands and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other relevant options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 57 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement into New Zealand domestic law. 58 Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 59 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and national interest analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and national interest analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 17 Appendix C Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments Executive Summary 1 New Zealand has signed, on 24 August 2010, two tax-related agreements with Samoa. The two agreements are the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Samoa On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Samoa On The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Samoa (“the Contracting States”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting State to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the more limited nature of Samoa’s tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that Samoa will also receive some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 18 mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. The articles contained in the Supplementary Agreement are not expected to give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to Samoa to enter into the TIEA is Article 11 of the TIEA. This article will establish an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. Given that the TIEA with Samoa will provide for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Samoa while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 6 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order(s) in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order(s) in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, the agreements can then each be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting State (Article 13 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement). New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). The Supplementary Agreement will apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. 8 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The agreements will not apply to these states. (The agreements apply only for the purposes of New Zealand and Samoan taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the Treaty The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 19 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also (in 2000) published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The 2000 list includes Samoa. New Zealand has, to date, signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. The TIEA with Samoa will be our 16th. 11 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with Samoa will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State.) 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 15 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, Samoa has a more limited tax system than New Zealand. 4 Samoa will therefore have less need to request information on 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. 4 Samoa, unlike many of the other jurisdictions with which we are concluding TIEAs, does tax the worldwide income of its residents. However, the concept of “residence” for tax purposes is more limited than is the case in New Zealand. In TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 20 tax matters from offshore than will New Zealand. Accordingly, New Zealand has a greater interest in concluding a TIEA than Samoa, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will Samoa. 16 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand offered Samoa a Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students and that will establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. 5 17 New Zealand generally enters into provisions for the allocation of taxing rights only in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). 18 Full reciprocity of this type is unlikely to occur in relation to Samoa. For this reason, New Zealand proposed a Supplementary Agreement that contains a limited selection of DTA articles. The articles chosen do not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs for New Zealand. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in Samoa. The Supplementary Agreement with Samoa will give rise to the following:  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. This will mean, for example, that Samoa will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to Samoa. (However, the pension must actually be subject to income tax in Samoa for the article to apply. Therefore, there will be no incentive for New Zealanders to seek to retire to Samoa in order to obtain a tax exemption.)  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. The rule is formulated in a way designed to ensure that it will only apply when a Samoan Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 92 days. addition, Samoan tax law does not have many elements that are typical of developed country tax systems, such as Controlled Foreign Company legislation. 5 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 21  Pursuant to Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their education or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Contracting States must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s DTAs.) 19 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for the purpose of applying the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protect tax matters. 20 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will have effect only while the TIEA is in force. 21 New Zealand will not itself gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports both the conclusion of the TIEA and relations between the Contracting States, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. 22 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. The Understanding 23 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Samoan Ministry of Revenue that sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability for costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 24 The less-than-treaty status Understanding will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue and Samoa’s Ministry of Revenue prior to entry into force of the TIEA. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 22 Consideration of other options 25 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Samoa. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Samoa would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with Samoa any priority in the short-to-medium term. 26 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as Samoa, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. This increased pressure makes it arguable that New Zealand did not need to offer Samoa a Supplementary Agreement. However, New Zealand has a very close relationship with Samoa, and it is appropriate to ensure that both sides derive benefit from the information-sharing arrangement. New Zealand’s approach is also consistent with that of other OECD member countries, particularly that of Australia. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 27 Samoa is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in Samoa to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Samoa in respect of such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 28 Samoa is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Samoa, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Samoa will therefore be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 29 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Samoa. The less-than-treaty status Understanding referred to above sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting States with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting State, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Contracting State. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 23 to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 6 30 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with Samoa. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA and relations generally. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 31 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing coordinated sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions for refusing to exchange information on tax matters has been raised. 7 Given that the TIEA with Samoa provides for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Samoa while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. 32 The conclusion of the TIEA with Samoa will also enable New Zealand to list Samoa as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with Samoa. 34 If Samoa ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement will cease to apply. (Given that sole purpose of the Supplementary Agreement is to support the conclusion of the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement clarifies that it shall have effect only when a TIEA is in force between the Contracting States.) Similarly, if 6 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Samoa may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 7 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders’ Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 24 New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, Samoa could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations The TIEA 35 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting State to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Samoa, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description”. Article 2(1)(a) refers. As noted above, Samoa is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used only for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State). Article 8 refers. 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidence of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting State is to reimburse the requested Contracting State for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting State. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. 38 Both Contracting States will be constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. Article 11 refers. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Samoa, New Zealand would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Samoa while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; for Samoa, the Minister of Revenue or an authorised representative of the Minister of Revenue). The Contracting States may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Article 12 refers. The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement will impose obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances (in respect of pensions, government service and students). For reasons detailed at paragraph 18 above, the practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be minimal.  In respect of pensions, New Zealand will be unable to tax a pension paid from New Zealand to a recipient who is a tax resident of Samoa. (This obligation applies only if the pension is subject to income tax in Samoa.) Article 5 refers. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 25  In respect of remuneration for government service, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments made by the Government of Samoa to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government. The rule, as formulated, will apply only when a Samoan Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Article 6 refers.  In respect of students and business apprentices, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments received from outside New Zealand for the purposes of a student or apprentice’s maintenance, education or training. Article 7 refers.  In respect of transfer pricing adjustments, the New Zealand Inland Revenue may be required to enter into consultations with Samoa’s Ministry of Revenue if a taxpayer affected by the adjustment invokes the mutual agreement procedure. Article 8 refers. 42 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Implementation 43 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 8 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 44 Upon signing, officials will arrange for an Order in Council to be made and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of the year. 45 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreements. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the agreements 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Samoa for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress 8 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 26 information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Samoa but, if requests for information are received from Samoa, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Samoa are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 The allocation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement will result in some revenue cost. However, as noted in paragraph 20 above, this is not expected to be significant. Any revenue loss that is sustained will be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this NIA.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in Inland Revenue’s published policy work programmes. Future Protocols 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation 53 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting States will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Contracting State may terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For Samoa, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 27 Agency disclosure statement 56 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA and a Supplementary Agreement between New Zealand and Samoa and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other possible options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 57 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement into New Zealand domestic law. 58 Inland Revenue is of the opinion that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights, restrict market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 59 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and National Interest Analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and National Interest Analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 28 Appendix D Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Executive Summary 1 On 4 August 2010, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Vanuatu (“the Contracting Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities), for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Ready access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons, and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting Party to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 4 The TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis. That is, tax officials from New Zealand and Vanuatu will be able to request information from each other. In practice, however, given the more limited nature of Vanuatu’s tax system, New Zealand can be expected to make more requests for information than will Vanuatu. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 5 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council, pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 6 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting Party (Article 12 of the TIEA). Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 29 7 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The TIEA will not apply to these states. (The TIEA applies only for the purposes of New Zealand and Vanuatu taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty The TIEA 8 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 9 Double tax agreements (“DTA”s) are the most common type of tax treaty that feature exchange of information provisions. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. In 2000, the OECD also published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The 2000 list includes Vanuatu. To date, New Zealand has signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. 10 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements, and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 11 The TIEA with Vanuatu will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the TIEA will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons, and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting Party). 12 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards 1 Refer to Sections 81 and 88 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations to determine whether a person has declared their income correctly. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules, with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information, if that jurisdiction does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 30 secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting Parties will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in regarding any information received pursuant to a request. 13 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. The Understanding on Costs 14 The TIEA will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding on Costs between the New Zealand Inland Revenue and the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue of Vanuatu, which sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability, for the costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 15 The less-than-treaty status of the Understanding on Costs will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue and Vanuatu’s Ministry of Revenue, prior to entry into force of the TIEA. Consideration of other options 16 New Zealand’s objective in the negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Vanuatu. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Vanuatu would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with Vanuatu any priority in the short-to-medium term. 17 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as Vanuatu, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. New Zealand’s approach is consistent with that of other OECD member countries, including that of Australia. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force 18 Vanuatu is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in Vanuatu to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Vanuatu regarding such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information regarding “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be regarding income taxes.) Any reduction in tax override any domestic tax interest rules, with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 31 avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 19 Vanuatu is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Vanuatu, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established for New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Vanuatu will therefore be marginal. Experience, gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties, indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that may arise. 20 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs regarding requests for information that it makes to Vanuatu. The less-than-treaty status Understanding on Costs, referred to above, sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Contracting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 4 21 The conclusion of the TIEA with Vanuatu will also enable New Zealand to list Vanuatu as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 22 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with Vanuatu. Obligations 23 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting Party to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Vanuatu, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description”, (see article 2(1)(a)). As noted above, Vanuatu is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 4 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Vanuatu may mean that, on occasions, Vanuatu may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding on Costs also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 32 24 The Contracting Parties will be required to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons, and may be used only for specified purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting Party, see Article 8). 25 In the Understanding on Costs, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting Party is to reimburse the requested Contracting Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise, costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. 26 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 27 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Vanuatu, the Minister of Finance or the Minister’s authorised representative). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Implementation 28 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council, in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 5 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 29 Upon completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, officials will arrange for an Order in Council to be made, and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. This includes New Zealand notifying Vanuatu by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. Vanuatu will likewise notify New Zealand when its own procedures are complete. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of the year. 30 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreement. 5 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters for these Acts. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 33 Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 31 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the agreement 32 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Vanuatu for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding on Costs provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 33 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Vanuatu but, if requests for information are received from Vanuatu, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established for New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Vanuatu are therefore expected to be marginal. 34 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 35 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this NIA.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in the government’s published policy work programmes. Future protocols 36 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation 37 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 38 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency disclosure statement 39 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA between New Zealand and Vanuatu, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 34 all other relevant options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 40 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA into New Zealand domestic law. 41 Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 42 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and National Interest Analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and National Interest Analyses prepared regarding other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed, and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties.

The two agreements are, respectively, the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Federation Of St. Christopher And Nevis For The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and St. Christopher and Nevis (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 exchange of information arrangements in place through its double tax agreements (“DTAs”) with key trading and investment partners. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as low-tax jurisdictions. St. Christopher and Nevis is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed a number of other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement collectively constitute a “package deal”. Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, the limited nature of St. Christopher and Nevis’ tax system means that St Christopher and Nevis will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that St. Christopher and Nevis also receives some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. (It is not appropriate to enter into a full DTA with the St. Christopher and Nevis, given the mismatch in tax systems. However, the pension, government service and students articles are three DTA articles that can be agreed with St. Christopher and Nevis as they will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs.) The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. New Zealand will not gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 5 Before the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement are brought into force for New Zealand, they must first be submitted to the House of Representatives to undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. 6 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement can then each be brought into force, in accordance with Article 13 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement, through exchanges of diplomatic notes that confirm the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Party. 8 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will enter into force on completion of the exchange of diplomatic notes. New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after that date (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after that date). The Supplementary Agreement will similarly apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002, produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 2 The 2000 list includes St. Christopher and Nevis. 11 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. TIEAs have since been signed with the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with St. Christopher and Nevis provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, has (by virtue of its legislative definition) the same meaning as that outlined in paragraph 8 above. Section 88 is therefore also applicable to TIEAs. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 15 Although the TIEA applies on a reciprocal basis, St. Christopher and Nevis only has a limited tax system. St. Christopher and Nevis will therefore only rarely have any need to request information on tax matters from other countries. New Zealand, by contrast, has a comprehensive tax system and imposes income tax on the worldwide income of its tax residents. New Zealand therefore has a keen interest in ensuring that it can obtain information on the income earning activities of those tax residents in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, New Zealand has a much greater interest in concluding a TIEA than St. Christopher and Nevis, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will St. Christopher and Nevis. 16 To address this imbalance, New Zealand has adopted the approach of other OECD member countries in TIEA negotiations and offered St. Christopher and Nevis a “benefits” package. The Supplementary Agreement is a key element of that package. The Supplementary Agreement allocates taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and is based on articles that appear in New Zealand’s DTAs. New Zealand also offered, as part of the Supplementary Agreement, to establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments as part of the package. 4 17 New Zealand generally only enters into arrangements for the allocation of taxing rights in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). However, given St. Christopher and Nevis’ limited tax system, entering into a DTA with St. Christopher and Nevis would mean New Zealand giving up taxing rights with little if any reciprocity. 18 For this reason, New Zealand’s proposal for a Supplementary Agreement was limited to those DTA articles that will not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in St. Christopher and Nevis. The provisions of the Supplementary Agreement are limited to the following: 4 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. New Zealand will therefore gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any person from St. Christopher and Nevis who retires to New Zealand. However, St. Christopher and Nevis currently does not impose income tax on pensions. Therefore New Zealand will only lose taxing rights under this Article if St. Christopher and Nevis subsequently introduces an income tax on pensions.  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. However, this rule does not apply if the individual is a tax resident of that other jurisdiction (unless the individual became resident solely by reason of the rendering of those services). This Article will therefore only apply when a St. Christopher and Nevis Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 90 days.  Pursuant to Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their eduction or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, this Article will have few implications.  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Parties must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s existing DTAs.) 19 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for any purpose of the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protects tax matters. 20 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will only have effect while the TIEA is in force. 21 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 Consideration of other options 22 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with St. Christopher and Nevis. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with St. Christopher and Nevis would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. As noted above, the fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with St. Christopher and Nevis. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 23 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from St. Christopher and Nevis. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 24 St. Christopher and Nevis is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from St. Christopher and Nevis, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from St. Christopher and Nevis will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 25 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to St. Christopher and Nevis. A supporting less-than-treaty status instrument will be agreed between the two Contracting Parties before the TIEA enters into force. The supporting less-than-treaty status instrument will set out a shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. The intention of the less-than-treaty status instrument is to ensure that the requested jurisdiction does not become burdened with excessive cost when complying with a request. Thus, ordinary costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested party, but extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring 3rd party translators or interpreters) will be borne by the requesting party. This means that New Zealand could be required to bear some costs when making requests to the St.Christopher and Nevis, and vice versa. 26 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This Article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 has previously been raised. 5 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with St. Christopher and Nevis, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on St. Christopher and Nevis while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 27 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with St. Christopher and Nevis. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by allowing for the conclusion of the TIEA. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 28 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with St. Christopher and Nevis. 29 If St. Christopher and Nevis ever unilaterally terminate the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement would cease to apply. Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, St. Christopher and Nevis could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The TIEA 30 The TIEA places a technical reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes (Article 1). In the case of St. Christopher and Nevis, the specified taxes are “all taxes imposed or administered by either State, including any taxes imposed or administered after the date of signature of the Agreement”. However, as noted above, St. Christopher and Nevis currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 31 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request (Article 8). Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 32 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, 5 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand read y to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 11 given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with St. Christopher and Nevis, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to St. Christopher and Nevis while the TIEA is in force. 33 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 34 Article 12 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for St. Christopher and Nevis, the Financial Secretary or any person designated as competent authority by the Financial Secretary). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. The Supplementary Agreement 35 The Supplementary Agreement imposes obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances (that is, in respect of pensions, government service and students.) 36 The practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be minimal – as outlined in paragraph 18 above. 37 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 38 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. The override of the Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a TIEA, given that the TIEA requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is forbidden under those Acts. 39 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 40 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, and after the supporting less- than-treaty status instrument has been finalised, New Zealand will notify St. Christopher and Nevis by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement are complete. St. Christopher and Nevis will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for giving effect to the TIEA INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 12 and the Supplementary Agreement. The TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Their provisions of the TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will apply prospectively (for example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force.) Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 41 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 42 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than St. Christopher and Nevis but, if requests for information are received from St. Christopher and Nevis, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from St. Christopher and Nevis are therefore expected to be marginal. 43 For the reasons outlined in paragraph 18 above, New Zealand is unlikely to suffer any significant revenue loss from the limitation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement. Any revenue loss that is sustained would be minimal and would be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 44 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of TIEA or the Supplementary Agreement will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 45 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty actions. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 46 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to TIEA or the Supplementary Agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 47 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that, after three years, either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 48 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that, after three years, either Party may, terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 13 diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For St. Christopher and Nevis, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 49 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate TIEA or the Supplementary Agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Adequacy statement 50 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis and has assessed it as adequate and in accordance with the Code of Good Regulatory Practice.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 21 and 28 April 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes National Interest Analysis Executive Summary 1 On 16 March 2010 New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in place with key trading and investment partners which provide for exchange of information arrangements similar to those which are established under the TIEA. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as with low-tax jurisdictions. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed a total of 13 TIEAs. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Parties. The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 4 It is proposed that the TIEA be brought into force for New Zealand following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. It is expected that this process will be completed by the end of 2010. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 5 Subsequent to completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 1 Despite the reference to DTAs, the Agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 6 Upon the promulgation of the Order in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, in accordance with Article 12 of the TIEA, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force of the TIEA by each Party. The TIEA comes into force on the date of the last notification, and takes effect for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force or, where there is no taxable period, for all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force. New Zealand will ensure that the arrangement referred to in paragraph 17 is concluded before its notification is sent. 7 New Zealand policy, once an exchange of information arrangement has been established with another jurisdiction, is to approve that jurisdiction for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Qualifying foreign investors from approved territories are exempt from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. The purpose of the exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital investment into New Zealand.) Approval of a jurisdiction for the purposes of section CW 12 requires the making of an additional Order in Council. This will be attended to after the TIEA enters into force. 8 The TIEAs will not apply to Tokelau, the Cook Islands or Niue Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 2 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002 produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres 1 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters 2 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88 (by virtue of its legislative definition) is also applicable to TIEAs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 3 The 2000 list includes St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 11 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. A further 11 TIEAs have since been signed. This brings the total number of TIEAs signed by New Zealand to 13. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with St. Vincent and the Grenadines provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity (the OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”). In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Parties.) 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 4 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. Consideration of other options 15 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with St. Vincent and the Grenadines would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. The fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 3 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 4 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action Advantages 16 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion (the TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes). Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 17 The TIEA closely follows the 2002 OECD model TIEA and is subject to the comprehensive commentary produced by the OECD to support consistent interpretation and application of the TIEA provisions. 18 The approval of St. Vincent and the Grenadines for the purposes of the section CW 12 venture capital exemption may result in increased venture capital exemption into New Zealand. Disadvantages 19 St. Vincent and the Grenadines is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from St. Vincent and the Grenadines will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 20 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In order to set out a shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as provided for by Article 9, a less-than- treaty status Arrangement will be signed between the two Parties before the TIEA enters into force. The Arrangement will set out the parameters where the costs to a request must be borne by the requested Party and when a requesting Party must reimburse the requested Party any costs relating to a request. It is intended that the Arrangement will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in St. Vincent and the Grenadines may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, it is intended that the Arrangement will provide for the possibility that the two sides will consult each other in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 21 New Zealand and St. Vincent and the Grenadines do not have a strong bilateral relationship/history. 22 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with St. Vincent and the Grenadines and to do so will achieve the Government’s policy objectives set out in the previous section. Legal obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 23 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes (Article 1). Such information includes information that is relevant to the determination, assessment and collection of taxes, the recovery and enforcement of tax claims, or the investigation or prosecution of tax matters. In the case of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the TIEA will apply to “taxes of every kind and description” (this also applies to NZ – Article 3(1)). As noted above, St. Vincent and the Grenadines currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 24 The legal obligations established by the TIEA include the requirement to provide information without regard to whether the conduct being investigated would constitute a crime under the laws of the Requested Party if such conduct occurred in the Requested Party (Article 5). Such an obligation is a feature of the OECD model TIEA, and is intended to counter any domestic law provision of a country that prevents the exchange of information on matters unless they constitute a crime. No such standard exists in New Zealand, but they are a common feature of many of the jurisdictions with which New Zealand concludes TIEAs. 25 The TIEA also contemplates the possibility that representatives of the tax administration of the Requesting Party may be allowed to visit the Requested Party to interview individuals and examine records (Article 6). The treaty does not impose any obligation on the Requested Party to agree to such a visit. However, the possibility may prove to be useful in certain cases. For example, New Zealand officials may wish to consider visiting St. Vincent and the Grenadines for the purposes of conducting interviews. 26 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request (Article 8). Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 27 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 28 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Minister of Finance). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 29 Subject to the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. It is expected that this process will be completed by the end of 2010. 30 Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables TIEAs to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that TIEAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a TIEA, given that the TIEA requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is forbidden under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during TIEA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the TIEA. 31 After the Order in Council has entered into force, New Zealand will notify St. Vincent and the Grenadines by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. St. Vincent and the Grenadines will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA. The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last notification (Article 12). The provisions of the TIEA will apply prospectively (for example, this means that the TIEA provisions cannot then be used to obtain information predating entry into force). Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 32 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 33 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than St. Vincent and the Grenadines but, if requests for information are received from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests (Article 9). As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from St. Vincent and the Grenadines are therefore expected to be marginal. 34 In addition, New Zealand will likely be required to reimburse St. Vincent and the Grenadines for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. It is intended that the Arrangement described above will set out the parameters where New Zealand will be required to reimburse St. Vincent and the Grenadines for information requests it makes. It is intended that this will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 35 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 36 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted on the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published tax policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 37 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 38 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that, after 3 years from the date of its entry into force, either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 39 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency disclosure statement 40 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA between New Zealand and St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other possible options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 41 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA into New Zealand domestic law. 42 Inland Revenue is of the opinion that the policy options considered will not impair additional costs on businesses during the current economic recession; impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 43 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this National Interest Analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous National Interest Analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand.

INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 21 and 28 April 2010 to consider the agreement. Committee members Craig Foss (Chairperson) Amy Adams David Bennett John Boscawen Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Aaron Gilmore Raymond Huo Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 4 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes National Interest Analysis Executive Summary 1 On 11 December 2009, New Zealand signed the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Turks and Caicos Islands On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Turks and Caicos Islands (“the Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 35 double tax agreements (“DTAs”) in place with key trading and investment partners which provide for exchange of information arrangements similar to those which are established under the TIEA. TIEAs are designed to be used to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions where DTAs may not be appropriate, such as with low-tax jurisdictions. The Turks and Caicos Islands (“TCI”) is a low-tax jurisdiction, and is also an important international finance centre. New Zealand, to date, has signed a number of other TIEAs – with the Netherlands Antilles, in 2007, and with Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey this year. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA provides a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. These rules ensure that requested information will be obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the rules also ensure that information may not be requested or used indiscriminately. Information requests may only be made in prescribed circumstances, and information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 5 Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 4 It is proposed that the TIEA be brought into force for New Zealand following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process in accordance with Standing Orders 388 to 391. 5 Subsequent to completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can then be incorporated into domestic legislation by Orders in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 1 Despite the reference to DTAs, the Agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 6 Upon the promulgation of the Orders in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, in accordance with Article 14 of the TIEA through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force of the TIEA by each Party. Reasons for New Zealand taking the treaty action 7 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 2 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of treaties that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 8 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically only concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD, in 2002 produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also, in 2000, published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to negotiate TIEAs, based on the OECD model TIEA. 3 The 2000 list includes TCI. 9 New Zealand signed its first TIEA, with the Netherlands Antilles, on 1 March 2007. A second TIEA, with Bermuda, was signed on 16 April 2009. TIEAs have since been signed with the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Cook Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 1 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. 2 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88 (by virtue of its legislative definition) is also applicable to TIEAs. 3 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 6 10 The TIEA with TCI provides a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, also ensures that information is not to be requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity (the OECD commentary clarifies that this means the Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”). In addition, information received pursuant to a request may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used by those persons for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party.) 11 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 4 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice remain in effect. In particular, as noted above, the Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 12 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. Consideration of other options 13 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with TCI. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with TCI would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. The fact that DTAs allocate taxing rights means that New Zealand would stand to lose tax revenue if it were to enter into a DTA with TCI. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty action 14 The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from TCI. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA permits New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its likely principal application, however, will be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. The TIEA is based on the 2002 OECD model TIEA and is subject to the comprehensive commentary produced by the OECD to support consistent interpretation and application of the TIEA provisions. 15 TCI is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from TCI, New Zealand will incur administrative 4 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 7 costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from TCI will therefore only be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 16 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to TCI. A supporting less-than-treaty status instrument will be agreed between the two Contracting Parties before the TIEA enters into force. The supporting less-than-treaty status instrument will set out a shared understanding of the Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 10 of the TIEA. The intention of the less-than-treaty status instrument is to ensure that the requested jurisdiction does not become burdened with excessive cost when complying with a request. Thus, ordinary costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested party, but extra-ordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring 3rd party translators) will be borne by the requesting party. This means that New Zealand could be required to bear some costs when making requests to the TCI, and vice versa. 17 The less-than-treaty status instrument will also require the parties to consult if in any particular case extra-ordinary costs appear likely to exceed a set threshold. This measure will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 5 18 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Parties not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries taking defensive measures to restrain the harmful tax practices of other countries has previously been raised. 6 The key identifier of harmful tax practices is whether a jurisdiction engages in effective exchange of information on tax matters. Given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with TCI, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on TCI while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Parties. 19 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with TCI. 5 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in TCI may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, it is intended that the MOU will provide for the possibility that the two sides will consult each other in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 6 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand read y to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 8 Obligations which will be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 20 The TIEA places a reciprocal obligation on each Party to provide, upon request, information that is relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes (Article 1). In the case of TCI, the specified taxes are “the passenger tax, stamp duties, and the hotel and restaurant tax”. As noted above, TCI currently has a very limited tax system, and so is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 21 The Parties are required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request (Article 8). Such information may only be disclosed to authorised persons and may only be used for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Party). 22 Both Parties are constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (Article 11). New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with TCI, would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to TCI while the TIEA is in force. 23 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 24 Article 13 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for TCI, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance or the Permanent Secretary’s authorised representative). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Measures the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including the specific reference to implementing the legislation 25 Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 enables TIEAs to be given effect by Order in Council. Section BH 1 provides that TIEAs will then override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a TIEA, given that the TIEA requires New Zealand to provide information it holds to foreign jurisdictions which is forbidden under those Acts. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during TIEA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provisions of the TIEA. 26 Subject to the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Orders in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 27 After the Orders in Council have entered into force, and after the supporting less- than-treaty status instrument has been finalised, New Zealand will notify TCI by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 9 TIEA are complete. TCI will likewise notify New Zealand by diplomatic note when it has completed its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA. The TIEA will enter into force on the date of the last notification. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 28 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 29 New Zealand will likely be required to reimburse TCI for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. It is intended that the MOU will set out the parameters of which New Zealand will be required to reimburse TCI for request of information it makes. It is intended that this will ensure that New Zealand will only progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 30 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than TCI but, if requests for information are received from TCI, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, however, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from TCI are therefore expected to be marginal. 31 Any costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 32 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 33 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 34 Article 15 of the TIEA provides that either Party may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the appropriate channel. The Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION – EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES 10 35 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures.

TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 4 We have conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes; the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments; and the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes. Tax Information Exchange Agreements are special-purpose bilateral treaties that allow countries to exchange information to assist each other in the enforcement of tax laws on request. Since 2004, New Zealand and Australia have made concerted efforts to conclude a number of tax information exchange agreements with other Pacific jurisdictions. These agreements between New Zealand and the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu reflect the results of this effort. The information exchange agreements with the Marshall Islands and Samoa are accompanied by agreements on the allocation of taxing rights and transfer pricing adjustments. These supplementary agreements provide specifically for the allocation of taxing rights in a small number of cases, covering students, Government service, and pensions. They also establish a mutual agreement procedure for resolving transfer pricing cases, requiring the two jurisdictions to consult with a view to resolving any issue that may arise. The tax information exchange agreements are reciprocal, in that they allow each party to the agreements to request information from the other. They do not impose any compliance costs on taxpayers, and will not have any significant fiscal implications for New Zealand. We therefore recommend that the Executive proceed with its proposed treaty action. The national interest analyses for the agreements are appended to this report. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 5 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 15 September and 20 October 2010 to consider the agreements. It heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department.

The two agreements are the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Republic Of The Marshall Islands On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of The Republic Of The Marshall Islands On The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and the Marshall Islands (“the Contracting States”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Ready access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting State to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 4 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the more limited nature of the Marshall Islands’ tax system means that it will derive lesser benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that the Marshall Islands will also receive some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 7 The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our double tax agreements (“DTAs”). The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. The articles contained in the Supplementary Agreement are not expected to give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex II. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to the Marshall Islands to enter into the TIEA is Article 11 of the TIEA. This article will establish an obligation for the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. Given that the TIEA with the Marshall Islands will provide for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 6 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order(s) in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order(s) in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, each agreement can then be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting State (Article 13 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement). New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). The Supplementary Agreement will apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. 8 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The agreements will not apply to these states. (The agreements apply only for the purposes of New Zealand and Marshall Islands taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and 1 Refer to Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 8 prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also (in 2000) published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The list includes the Marshall Islands. New Zealand has, to date, signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. 11 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with the Marshall Islands will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State.) 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 9 The Supplementary Agreement 15 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the Marshall Islands has a more limited tax system than New Zealand. 4 The Marshall Islands will therefore have less need to request information on tax matters from offshore than will New Zealand. Accordingly, New Zealand has a greater interest in concluding a TIEA than the Marshall Islands, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will the Marshall Islands. 16 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand offered the Marshall Islands a Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, and that will establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. 5 17 New Zealand generally enters into provisions for the allocation of taxing rights only in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). 18 Full reciprocity of this type is unlikely to occur in relation to the Marshall Islands. For this reason, New Zealand proposed a Supplementary Agreement that contains a limited selection of DTA articles. The articles chosen do not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs for New Zealand. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in the Marshall Islands. The Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands will give rise to the following:  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. This will mean, for example, that the Marshall Islands will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to the Marshall Islands. (However, the pension must actually be subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands for the article to apply. Therefore, there will be no incentive for New Zealanders to seek to retire to the Marshall Islands in order to obtain a tax exemption.)  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. The rule is formulated in a way designed to ensure that it will only apply when a Marshall Islands’ Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 92 days. 4 The Marshall Islands, unlike many of the other jurisdictions with which we are concluding TIEAs, does tax the worldwide income of its residents. However, the concept of “residence” for tax purposes is more limited than is the case in New Zealand. In addition, The Marshall Islands tax law does not have many elements that are typical of developed country tax systems, such as Controlled Foreign Company legislation. 5 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 10  Pursuant to Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their education or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Contracting States must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s DTAs.) 19 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that, if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for the purpose of applying the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating the domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protect tax matters. 20 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will have effect only while the TIEA is in force. 21 New Zealand will not itself gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports both the conclusion of the TIEA and relations between the Contracting States, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. 22 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex II. The Understanding on Costs 23 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty-status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Marshall Islands’ Revenue and Taxation Office that sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability for costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 24 The less-than-treaty-status Understanding will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Marshall Islands Revenue and Taxation Office prior to entry into force of the TIEA. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 11 Consideration of Other Options 25 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with the Marshall Islands. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with the Marshall Islands would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with the Marshall Islands any priority in the short-to-medium term. 26 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as the Marshall Islands, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. This increased pressure makes it arguable that benefits such as a Supplementary Agreement no longer need to feature in TIEA negotiations. However, the offer of benefits was made to the Marshall Islands before the developments that resulted in increased international pressure. New Zealand’s approach is also consistent with that of Australia (which signed a TIEA and Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands on 12 May 2010). Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 27 The Marshall Islands is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in the Marshall Islands to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from the Marshall Islands in respect of such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 28 The Marshall Islands is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from the Marshall Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Marshall Islands will therefore be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any costs that may arise. 29 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to the Marshall Islands. The less-than-treaty-status Understanding referred to above sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting States with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting State, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 12 reimbursed by the requesting Contracting State. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 6 30 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with the Marshall Islands. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA and relations generally. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 31 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing coordinated sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions for refusing to exchange information on tax matters has been raised. 7 Given that the TIEA with the Marshall Islands provides for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. 32 The conclusion of the TIEA with the Marshall Islands will also enable New Zealand to list the Marshall Islands as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with the Marshall Islands. 34 If the Marshall Islands ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement will cease to apply. (Given that sole purpose of the Supplementary Agreement 6 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in the Marshall Islands may mean that, on occasion, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 7 Refer to the 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders’ Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 13 is to support the conclusion of the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement clarifies that it shall have effect only when a TIEA is in force between the Contracting States.) Similarly, if New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, the Marshall Islands could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations The TIEA 35 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation for each Contracting State to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of the Marshall Islands, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description” (see Article 2(1)(a)). As noted above, the Marshall Islands is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used only for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State), (see Article 8). 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidence of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting State is to reimburse the requested Contracting State for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting State. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. 38 Both Contracting States will be constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” (see Article 11). New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with the Marshall Islands, New Zealand would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to the Marshall Islands while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; for the Marshall Islands, the Minister of Revenue or an authorised representative of the Minister of Revenue). The Contracting States may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution (see Article 12). The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement will impose obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances (in respect of pensions, government service and students). For reasons detailed at paragraph 18 above, the practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be minimal. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 14  In respect of pensions, New Zealand will be unable to tax a pension paid from New Zealand to a recipient who is a tax resident of the Marshall Islands. (This obligation applies only if the pension is subject to income tax in the Marshall Islands. See Article 5.)  In respect of remuneration for government service, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments made by the Government of the Marshall Islands to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government. The rule, as formulated, will apply only when a Marshall Islands’ Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity (see Article 6).  In respect of students and business apprentices, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments received from outside New Zealand for the purposes of a student or apprentice’s maintenance, education or training (see Article 7).  In respect of transfer pricing adjustments, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department may be required to enter into consultations with the Marshall Islands’ Ministry of Revenue if a taxpayer affected by the adjustment invokes the mutual agreement procedure (see Article 8). 42 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Implementation 43 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order(s) in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order(s) in Council. 8 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 44 Upon completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, officials will arrange for Order(s) in Council to be made and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. This includes New Zealand notifying the Marshall Islands by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. The Marshall Islands will likewise notify New Zealand when its own procedures are complete. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of 2010. 45 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreements. 8 That is, the Order(s) in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters for these Acts. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 15 Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Costs and Effects of the Treaty Action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of Compliance with the Agreements 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse the Marshall Islands for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than the Marshall Islands but, if requests for information are received from the Marshall Islands, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from the Marshall Islands are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 The allocation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement will result in some revenue cost. However, as noted in paragraph 18 above, this is not expected to be significant. Any revenue loss that is sustained will be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this national interest analysis.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in the government’s published policy work programmes. Future Protocols 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case-by-case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or Denunciation 53 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ notice, in writing, through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting States will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Contracting State may terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 16 channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For the Marshall Islands, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 October in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency Disclosure Statement 56 Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA and a Supplementary Agreement between New Zealand and the Marshall Islands and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other relevant options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 57 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement into New Zealand domestic law. 58 Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 59 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and national interest analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and national interest analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 17 Appendix C Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments Executive Summary 1 New Zealand has signed, on 24 August 2010, two tax-related agreements with Samoa. The two agreements are the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Samoa On The Exchange Of Information With Respect To Taxes (“the TIEA”) and the Agreement Between The Government Of New Zealand And The Government Of Samoa On The Allocation Of Taxing Rights With Respect To Certain Income Of Individuals And To Establish A Mutual Agreement Procedure In Respect Of Transfer Pricing Adjustments (“the Supplementary Agreement”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Samoa (“the Contracting States”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities) for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Access to this previously unobtainable information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting State to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. 4 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, the more limited nature of Samoa’s tax system means that it will derive little benefit from the TIEA whereas New Zealand stands to gain considerable benefit. The Supplementary Agreement was therefore offered by New Zealand to ensure that Samoa will also receive some benefit from entering into exchange of information arrangements with New Zealand. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students, following the approach adopted for such articles in our DTAs. The Supplementary Agreement also includes an article that will establish a “best endeavours” TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 18 mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. The articles contained in the Supplementary Agreement are not expected to give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs. The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. 5 A second key measure offered by New Zealand as encouragement to Samoa to enter into the TIEA is Article 11 of the TIEA. This article will establish an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” on each other. Given that the TIEA with Samoa will provide for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Samoa while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 6 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order(s) in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order(s) in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 7 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, the agreements can then each be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting State (Article 13 of the TIEA and Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement). New Zealand officials will manage the process to ensure that both agreements enter into force on the same date. Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). The Supplementary Agreement will apply, in New Zealand, to income years beginning on or after 1 April following the date of entry into force. 8 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The agreements will not apply to these states. (The agreements apply only for the purposes of New Zealand and Samoan taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the Treaty The TIEA 9 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 1 Sections 81 and 88 of Tax Administration Act 1994 refer. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 19 10 The most common type of tax treaty in which exchange of information provisions feature are DTAs. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. The OECD also (in 2000) published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The 2000 list includes Samoa. New Zealand has, to date, signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. The TIEA with Samoa will be our 16th. 11 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 12 The TIEA with Samoa will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. The TIEA, however, will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State.) 13 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. 14 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex A. The Supplementary Agreement 15 Although the TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis, Samoa has a more limited tax system than New Zealand. 4 Samoa will therefore have less need to request information on 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refers. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations in determining whether a person has correctly declared their income. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information if that jurisdiction itself does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also override any domestic tax interest rules with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. 4 Samoa, unlike many of the other jurisdictions with which we are concluding TIEAs, does tax the worldwide income of its residents. However, the concept of “residence” for tax purposes is more limited than is the case in New Zealand. In TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 20 tax matters from offshore than will New Zealand. Accordingly, New Zealand has a greater interest in concluding a TIEA than Samoa, and can expect to derive greater benefits from the TIEA than will Samoa. 16 To redress this imbalance, New Zealand offered Samoa a Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement contains articles that will allocate taxing rights in respect of pensions, government service and students and that will establish a mutual agreement procedure that can be invoked in respect of transfer pricing adjustments. 5 17 New Zealand generally enters into provisions for the allocation of taxing rights only in its DTAs. However, as noted above, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In such cases the concession of taxing rights is reciprocal. That is, New Zealand may give up a taxing right but the other country will also give up a taxing right in reciprocal circumstances. In financial terms, these reciprocal reductions tend to offset each other (for example, reduced tax in the other jurisdiction generally results in a reduced foreign tax credit against the New Zealand tax base). 18 Full reciprocity of this type is unlikely to occur in relation to Samoa. For this reason, New Zealand proposed a Supplementary Agreement that contains a limited selection of DTA articles. The articles chosen do not give rise to any significant financial, fiscal or economic costs for New Zealand. Nor will they provide a commercial advantage to individuals or entities operating in Samoa. The Supplementary Agreement with Samoa will give rise to the following:  Pursuant to Article 5 of the Supplementary Agreement, pensions paid to an individual will be taxable only in the jurisdiction of which that individual is a tax resident. This will mean, for example, that Samoa will gain a sole taxing right over the pension of any New Zealander who retires to Samoa. (However, the pension must actually be subject to income tax in Samoa for the article to apply. Therefore, there will be no incentive for New Zealanders to seek to retire to Samoa in order to obtain a tax exemption.)  Pursuant to Article 6 of the Supplementary Agreement, remuneration paid by the Government of one jurisdiction to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government will be exempt from income tax in the other jurisdiction. The rule is formulated in a way designed to ensure that it will only apply when a Samoan Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Such visits are likely to be minimal. In any case, New Zealand generally does not tax salaries and wages earned in New Zealand where the visit is for less than 92 days. addition, Samoan tax law does not have many elements that are typical of developed country tax systems, such as Controlled Foreign Company legislation. 5 Transfer pricing rules enable a tax authority to adjust profits where transactions between associated enterprises have been entered into on other than “arm’s length” terms (i.e. where prices have been artificially set to derive a tax advantage). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 21  Pursuant to Article 7 of the Supplementary Agreement, where a student or business apprentice who is a tax resident of one jurisdiction is temporarily present in the other jurisdiction solely for the purpose of their education or training, payments which they receive from outside that other jurisdiction for their maintenance, education or training will be exempt from income tax in that other jurisdiction. As New Zealand generally does not tax payments of this type, the article will have few implications.  Pursuant to Article 8 of the Supplementary Agreement, a mutual agreement procedure can be invoked by a resident of one jurisdiction if they consider that the other jurisdiction has made an inappropriate transfer pricing adjustment. Although the Supplementary Agreement provides that the Contracting States must endeavour to resolve the issue, there is no obligation on New Zealand to change its position in any case where it considers that the transfer pricing rules have been applied correctly. (This is consistent with the outcome that arises under the mutual agreement procedure of New Zealand’s DTAs.) 19 Article 9 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that information may be exchanged for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement using the mechanism established by the TIEA. This is an important clarification to ensure that if the respective tax authorities need to communicate with each other for the purpose of applying the Supplementary Agreement, they can do so without violating their domestic secrecy laws that otherwise protect tax matters. 20 Given that the Supplementary Agreement has been negotiated primarily for the purposes of securing and supporting the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement explicitly provides that the provisions of the Supplementary Agreement will have effect only while the TIEA is in force. 21 New Zealand will not itself gain any direct benefit from entering into the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports both the conclusion of the TIEA and relations between the Contracting States, and New Zealand will therefore benefit indirectly. 22 The text of the Supplementary Agreement is attached as Annex B. The Understanding 23 The TIEA and Supplementary Agreement will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding between the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department and the Samoan Ministry of Revenue that sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability for costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 24 The less-than-treaty status Understanding will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue and Samoa’s Ministry of Revenue prior to entry into force of the TIEA. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 22 Consideration of other options 25 New Zealand’s objective in negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Samoa. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Samoa would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with Samoa any priority in the short-to-medium term. 26 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as Samoa, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. This increased pressure makes it arguable that New Zealand did not need to offer Samoa a Supplementary Agreement. However, New Zealand has a very close relationship with Samoa, and it is appropriate to ensure that both sides derive benefit from the information-sharing arrangement. New Zealand’s approach is also consistent with that of other OECD member countries, particularly that of Australia. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 27 Samoa is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in Samoa to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Samoa in respect of such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information in relation to “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be in respect of income taxes.) Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 28 Samoa is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Samoa, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Samoa will therefore be marginal. Experience gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that arise. 29 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs in relation to requests for information that it makes to Samoa. The less-than-treaty status Understanding referred to above sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting States with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting State, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Contracting State. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 23 to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 6 30 The Supplementary Agreement was negotiated primarily for the purpose of securing a TIEA with Samoa. New Zealand is not expected to derive any direct benefit from the Supplementary Agreement. The Supplementary Agreement, however, supports the conclusion of the TIEA and will indirectly benefit New Zealand by means of the TIEA and relations generally. As noted above, the Supplementary Agreement is not expected to give rise to any significant negative financial, fiscal or economic implications. Any costs that do arise will be outweighed by the benefits New Zealand stands to gain from concluding the TIEA. 31 The TIEA contains one article, Article 11, not found in the OECD model TIEA. This article constitutes the second key element of the New Zealand benefits package. Article 11 imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to impose “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices” against each other. This obligation relates to the OECD Harmful Tax Practices initiative, in which the prospect of OECD member countries imposing coordinated sanctions on or taking other defensive measures against jurisdictions for refusing to exchange information on tax matters has been raised. 7 Given that the TIEA with Samoa provides for full exchange of information on tax matters, it would be inappropriate for New Zealand to impose any such measures on Samoa while the TIEA is in force. The provision was included in recognition of this, but was expressed as a reciprocal obligation on both Contracting States. 32 The conclusion of the TIEA with Samoa will also enable New Zealand to list Samoa as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 33 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement with Samoa. 34 If Samoa ever unilaterally terminates the TIEA, the Supplementary Agreement will cease to apply. (Given that sole purpose of the Supplementary Agreement is to support the conclusion of the TIEA, Article 10 of the Supplementary Agreement clarifies that it shall have effect only when a TIEA is in force between the Contracting States.) Similarly, if 6 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Samoa may mean that, on occasions, they may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is vitally important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. 7 The 1998 OECD report “Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue” and 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices” refer. The G20 Leaders Summit of 2 April 2009 re-raised the prospect of counter-measures against non-complying jurisdictions. The Leaders’ Statement from that Summit contained the statement that “we stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 24 New Zealand ever unilaterally terminates the Supplementary Agreement, Samoa could be expected to terminate the TIEA. Obligations The TIEA 35 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting State to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Samoa, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description”. Article 2(1)(a) refers. As noted above, Samoa is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 36 The Contracting States will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in relation to any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons and may be used only for specified purposes (principally the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting State). Article 8 refers. 37 In the Understanding, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how incidence of costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting State is to reimburse the requested Contracting State for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting State. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. 38 Both Contracting States will be constrained from imposing “prejudicial or restrictive measures based on harmful tax practices”. Article 11 refers. New Zealand does not currently impose any such measures and, given that the TIEA provides for full exchange of information on tax matters with Samoa, New Zealand would not contemplate introducing such measures with respect to Samoa while the TIEA is in force. 39 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 40 Any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; for Samoa, the Minister of Revenue or an authorised representative of the Minister of Revenue). The Contracting States may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Article 12 refers. The Supplementary Agreement 41 The Supplementary Agreement will impose obligations on New Zealand to limit its taxing rights in certain limited circumstances (in respect of pensions, government service and students). For reasons detailed at paragraph 18 above, the practical implications for New Zealand are likely to be minimal.  In respect of pensions, New Zealand will be unable to tax a pension paid from New Zealand to a recipient who is a tax resident of Samoa. (This obligation applies only if the pension is subject to income tax in Samoa.) Article 5 refers. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 25  In respect of remuneration for government service, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments made by the Government of Samoa to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government. The rule, as formulated, will apply only when a Samoan Government official comes to New Zealand in an official capacity. Article 6 refers.  In respect of students and business apprentices, New Zealand will be unable to tax payments received from outside New Zealand for the purposes of a student or apprentice’s maintenance, education or training. Article 7 refers.  In respect of transfer pricing adjustments, the New Zealand Inland Revenue may be required to enter into consultations with Samoa’s Ministry of Revenue if a taxpayer affected by the adjustment invokes the mutual agreement procedure. Article 8 refers. 42 Reservations are not provided for under the Supplementary Agreement. Implementation 43 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 8 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. Relief from double taxation and relief from tax are also listed purposes. Therefore the Supplementary Agreement also falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 44 Upon signing, officials will arrange for an Order in Council to be made and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of the year. 45 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreements. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 46 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the agreements 47 New Zealand will be required to reimburse Samoa for extraordinary costs (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) that may arise from a New Zealand request made under the TIEA. However, the Understanding provides for consultation if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed NZ$1000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress 8 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 26 information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 48 New Zealand is likely to raise more requests for information than Samoa but, if requests for information are received from Samoa, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established in relation to New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Samoa are therefore expected to be marginal. 49 The allocation of taxing rights under the Supplementary Agreement will result in some revenue cost. However, as noted in paragraph 20 above, this is not expected to be significant. Any revenue loss that is sustained will be compensated by favourable financial, fiscal and economic effects of the TIEA. 50 All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of either agreement will be met within existing baselines. Consultation 51 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. (They did not raise any concerns with this NIA.) Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in Inland Revenue’s published policy work programmes. Future Protocols 52 No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to either agreement on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation 53 Article 14 of the TIEA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Contracting States will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the TIEA even after it has been terminated. 54 Article 11 of the Supplementary Agreement provides that either Contracting State may terminate the Supplementary Agreement by giving written notice through the diplomatic channel. Such termination will become effective, for New Zealand, in the income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. For Samoa, the termination will become effective in the income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. 55 Any decision by New Zealand to terminate either agreement would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 27 Agency disclosure statement 56 The Inland Revenue Department has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA and a Supplementary Agreement between New Zealand and Samoa and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other possible options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 57 An Order in Council is required to implement the TIEA and the Supplementary Agreement into New Zealand domestic law. 58 Inland Revenue is of the opinion that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights, restrict market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles (as referenced in Chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). 59 Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and National Interest Analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and National Interest Analyses prepared in relation to other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. The conclusion of a Supplementary Agreement in support of the TIEA is consistent with the approach adopted with previous TIEAs that New Zealand has signed and the terms of the Supplementary Agreement largely duplicate those in existing treaties. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 28 Appendix D Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with respect to Taxes Executive Summary 1 On 4 August 2010, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes (“the TIEA”). 2 The TIEA will establish a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Vanuatu (“the Contracting Parties”) can request information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities), for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Ready access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any reduction in tax avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. New Zealand already has a network of 36 exchange of information arrangements in place. 3 The TIEA is based on a model produced by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“the OECD”). The TIEA will provide a comprehensive set of rules that support the exchange of information. Information requests can be made only in prescribed circumstances, and information that is received pursuant to a request can be disclosed only to authorised persons, and used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the Contracting Party to which it is given). The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. 4 The TIEA will apply on a reciprocal basis. That is, tax officials from New Zealand and Vanuatu will be able to request information from each other. In practice, however, given the more limited nature of Vanuatu’s tax system, New Zealand can be expected to make more requests for information than will Vanuatu. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 5 Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA can be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council, pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order in Council is envisaged to be completed by the end of this year. 6 Upon the promulgation of the Order(s) in Council, the TIEA can then be brought into force, through an exchange of diplomatic notes that confirms the completion of the respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force by each Contracting Party (Article 12 of the TIEA). Upon entry into force, the TIEA will apply prospectively to all taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force (or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following entry into force). TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 29 7 No consultation with the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau is required. The TIEA will not apply to these states. (The TIEA applies only for the purposes of New Zealand and Vanuatu taxes. New Zealand tax laws do not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.) Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty The TIEA 8 New Zealand domestic law specifically prohibits Inland Revenue from divulging information it holds to foreign jurisdictions, except when authorised by a tax treaty. 1 Other countries generally follow the same principle. Therefore, to assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion, most developed countries are building networks of TIEAs that allow for the exchange of information on tax matters. 9 Double tax agreements (“DTA”s) are the most common type of tax treaty that feature exchange of information provisions. New Zealand currently has 35 DTAs in force. However, DTAs are typically concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. To cater for other situations, the OECD produced a model TIEA (with a comprehensive commentary) that provides solely for the exchange of information on tax matters. In 2000, the OECD also published a list of low-tax international finance centres with which member countries are encouraged to establish information sharing arrangements. 2 The 2000 list includes Vanuatu. To date, New Zealand has signed 15 TIEAs with jurisdictions included on the 2000 list. 10 Each new TIEA concluded further expands New Zealand’s network of exchange of information arrangements, and reduces the tax evasion and avoidance options available to New Zealand residents. 11 The TIEA with Vanuatu will provide a comprehensive set of rules to support the exchange of information. These rules are designed to ensure that requested information is obtained and provided in a timely and effective manner. However, the TIEA will also ensure that information is not requested or used indiscriminately. Requested information must be “foreseeably relevant” to the tax affairs of a particular person or entity. (The commentary to the OECD model TIEA clarifies that this means that the Contracting Parties are not at liberty to engage in “fishing expeditions”.) In addition, information received pursuant to a request may be disclosed only to authorised persons, and may be used by those persons only for authorised purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting Party). 12 Interference from bank secrecy and domestic tax interest rules is specifically prohibited as an obstacle to effective information exchange. 3 Otherwise, rights and safeguards 1 Refer to Sections 81 and 88 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The term “double tax agreement”, as used in section 88, is (by virtue of its legislative definition) also applicable to TIEAs. 2 The 2000 OECD report “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. 3 This is a key aspect of the TIEA. Access to bank information on transactions and savings assists tax administrations to determine whether a person has declared their income correctly. Bank secrecy rules prevent the disclosure of bank information, and therefore facilitate tax evasion. TIEAs override any such domestic bank secrecy rules, with an explicit treaty obligation to provide bank information. Domestic Tax Interest rules prohibit a jurisdiction from complying with a request for information, if that jurisdiction does not itself need that information for tax purposes. TIEAs therefore also TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 30 secured to residents of either jurisdiction by domestic law or administrative practice will remain in effect. (Thus, for example, information protected by legal professional privilege will not be required to be provided.) As noted above, the Contracting Parties will be required to maintain strict confidentiality in regarding any information received pursuant to a request. 13 The text of the TIEA is attached as Annex I. The Understanding on Costs 14 The TIEA will be supported by a less-than-treaty status instrument. The instrument is an Understanding on Costs between the New Zealand Inland Revenue and the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue of Vanuatu, which sets out the shared understanding of the respective competent authorities on matters of liability, for the costs of obtaining and providing information in response to a request under the TIEA. 15 The less-than-treaty status of the Understanding on Costs will not create legally binding commitments for New Zealand. It is therefore not required to undergo treaty examination. It will be entered into by the New Zealand Inland Revenue and Vanuatu’s Ministry of Revenue, prior to entry into force of the TIEA. Consideration of other options 16 New Zealand’s objective in the negotiations was to secure effective exchange of information arrangements with Vanuatu. The only other possible treaty mechanism for entering into such arrangements with Vanuatu would be as part of a DTA. However, DTAs are designed to be concluded between trading and investment partners with broadly similar tax systems. In addition, New Zealand’s DTA negotiation work programme is currently committed to renegotiating existing, older DTAs, and it would not be possible to give the negotiation of a DTA with Vanuatu any priority in the short-to-medium term. 17 Over the past year, there has been increased international pressure on international finance centres, such as Vanuatu, to enter into effective exchange of information arrangements with OECD member countries. New Zealand’s approach is consistent with that of other OECD member countries, including that of Australia. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force 18 Vanuatu is an international finance centre, and many New Zealanders have dealings through legal entities established in Vanuatu to take advantage of low rates of tax. The TIEA will enable New Zealand tax officials to request tax records, business books and accounts, bank information, and ownership information from Vanuatu regarding such dealings. Access to this information will enhance the New Zealand Inland Revenue’s ability to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. (The TIEA will permit New Zealand to request information regarding “taxes of every kind and description”. Its principal application, however, will likely be regarding income taxes.) Any reduction in tax override any domestic tax interest rules, with an explicit treaty obligation to provide information regardless of whether or not there is a domestic interest. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 31 avoidance or tax evasion will be beneficial to New Zealand in financial, fiscal and economic terms. 19 Vanuatu is unlikely to raise many requests for information from New Zealand. If requests for information are received from Vanuatu, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in obtaining and providing the requested information. However, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established for New Zealand’s existing DTAs and TIEAs. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Vanuatu will therefore be marginal. Experience, gained from administering the exchange of information arrangements already in place under New Zealand’s existing tax treaties, indicates that the benefits arising from the enhanced ability to reduce tax avoidance and evasion outweigh any of the costs that may arise. 20 New Zealand may be required to bear some costs regarding requests for information that it makes to Vanuatu. The less-than-treaty status Understanding on Costs, referred to above, sets out the shared understanding of the Contracting Parties with respect to costs, as is required by Article 9 of the TIEA. “Ordinary” costs of complying with a request will be borne by the requested Contracting Party, but “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of hiring translators or interpreters) will be reimbursed by the requesting Contracting Party. However, prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. This will ensure that New Zealand will progress information requests giving rise to significant reimbursement costs only if the need to obtain the information justifies the expenditure. 4 21 The conclusion of the TIEA with Vanuatu will also enable New Zealand to list Vanuatu as an approved territory for the purposes of the venture capital exemption at section CW 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The purpose of the section CW 12 exemption is to facilitate increased venture capital into New Zealand. It does this by exempting qualifying foreign investors from approved territories from paying income tax on any gains derived from the sale of shares in qualifying venture capital investments. Under existing policy, it is possible to approve territories for the purposes of the section CW 12 exemption only when effective exchange of information arrangements are in place. 22 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the TIEA with Vanuatu. Obligations 23 The TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting Party to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of specified taxes. In the case of Vanuatu, the specified taxes are “taxes of every kind and description”, (see article 2(1)(a)). As noted above, Vanuatu is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand. 4 In recognition of the possibility that capacity issues in Vanuatu may mean that, on occasions, Vanuatu may struggle to find the staff or other resources to comply with a single or multiple requests for information from New Zealand, the Understanding on Costs also provides that the two sides may consult in such circumstances with a view to finding solutions. For example, where it is important for Inland Revenue to obtain the information, New Zealand may agree to pay a larger share of the costs. TAX AGREEMENTS WITH THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAMOA, AND VANUATU 32 24 The Contracting Parties will be required to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any information received pursuant to a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons, and may be used only for specified purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting Party, see Article 8). 25 In the Understanding on Costs, the respective tax authorities set out their shared understanding of how costs incurred in providing assistance will be addressed. The requesting Contracting Party is to reimburse the requested Contracting Party for “extraordinary costs” (such as the cost of engaging an interpreter or translator) incurred in responding to the request. Otherwise, costs are to be borne by the requested Contracting Party. Prior consultation will be required if extraordinary costs appear likely to exceed US$1,000. 26 Reservations are not provided for under the TIEA. 27 Article 11 of the TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Vanuatu, the Minister of Finance or the Minister’s authorised representative). The Parties may also decide upon other forms of dispute resolution. Implementation 28 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council, in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. 5 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section.

Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. 29 Upon completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, officials will arrange for an Order in Council to be made, and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. This includes New Zealand notifying Vanuatu by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the TIEA are complete. Vanuatu will likewise notify New Zealand when its own procedures are complete. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of the year. 30 There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreement. 5 That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters for these Acts.
