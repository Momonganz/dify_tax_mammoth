Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund)
=====================================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in units in the Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income from the interest.

[TIB Volume 32 No 1 February 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no1)

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Shares in the Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund (“Russell MSV Fund”), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors.

The investments held by the Russell MSV Fund consist predominantly of financial arrangements providing funds to a person. In addition, some New Zealand resident investors hedge their attributing interests in the Russell MSV Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would apply to prevent those investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in the Russell MSV Fund. Although the Russell MSV Fund invests in assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and New Zealand resident investors may enter into related New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt investment.

### Scope of determination

This determination applies to shares held by New Zealand resident investors in the Russell MSV Fund.

The Russell MSV Fund achieves its investment objectives by investing in global equity indices and volatility indices through derivative instruments (exchange traded or over-the-counter and including futures and options) with the aim of removing directional or market exposure and for hedging or efficient portfolio management purposes. For the purposes of covering the derivative positions, the Russell MSV Fund also invests in cash and cash equivalents (including money market instruments, cash deposits, commercial paper and certificates of deposit).

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in the Russell MSV Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  The absolute value of the Russell MSV Fund’s notional derivative exposure must not fall to 20% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days. Should this occur, the determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following quarter.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and

“Russell MSV Fund” means the Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund, being a sub-fund of an Irish company incorporated on 10 November 2004 known at the date of this determination as Russell Investment Company IV plc.

### Determination

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund, being a direct income interest in the Russell MSV Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2020 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination apply for the income year.

Dated this 28th day of November 2019.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) – NZD Hedged)
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in units in the Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) (“the Fund”) is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income from the interest.

[TIB Volume 32 No 4 May 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no4)

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) (“the Fund”), an Australian Managed Investment Scheme, are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors. The Fund is structured as a multi-class Managed Investment Scheme.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in units in the Fund each year.

The Fund invests in a portfolio of global fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements. The Fund has on issue a number of unit classes including a class of units denominated in New Zealand dollars (“NZD Hedged Class”) that provide holders of that class of units with an interest in the pool of investments held by the Fund. Foreign currency hedging arrangements are in place which effectively provide investors in the NZD Hedged Class with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on the financial arrangements held by the Fund.

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply to prevent the use of the fair dividend rate (“FDR”) method but would apply if the NZD Hedged Class was the only class of shares on issue.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in the NZD Hedged Class units issued by the Fund, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment to be excluded from using the FDR method.

### Scope of determination

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    *   Is an Australian Managed Investment Scheme;
    *   Is known at the date of this determination as Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged); and
    *   Is operated with separate classes of units.
2.  The attributing interest consists of the New Zealand dollar denominated class of units issued in the Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) – NZ Hedged, a class of units that provides exposure solely to the Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index Fund (Hedged) that predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) holds financial arrangements such as international fixed interest securities; and
3.  The investment assets attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of units are subject to currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident for the purpose of eliminating exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors on a highly effective basis.

### Interpretation

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and

“Non-resident” means a person that is not resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may not use the FDR method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application Date

This determination applies for the 2020 income year and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination applies for the income year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method (Units in the Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund - Class Z)
================================================================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in units in the Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund – Class Z, to which none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply, is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income for the interest.

[Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 8, September 2022](/tib/volume-34---2022/tib-vol-34-no8)

### **Reference**

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Lead – Legal Services under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

Units in the Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund – Class Z (“Two Trees Fund”), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors when none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to EX 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply.

Under EX 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 an exemption may arise for an Australian Unit Trust and a New Zealand resident investor so that a person’s rights in the unit trust in an income year are not an attributing interest.  The determination will only apply when an attributing interest arises. 

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their Two Trees Fund investments each income year. 

The investments held by the Two Trees Fund may consist predominantly of financial arrangements providing funds to a person. In addition, some New Zealand resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in the Two Trees Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent those investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

Notwithstanding that the Two Trees Fund may have assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and New Zealand resident investors may enter into related New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in the Two Trees Fund.

### **Scope of determination**

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    *   Is known at the date of this determination as the Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund;
    *   Invests in long and short positions in equity, bond, currency and commodity markets, as well as making other investments;
    *   Is operated with separate classes of units.
2.  The attributing interest consists of class Z units issued in the Two Trees Fund, a class of units that provides an interest in the underlying assets of the Two Trees Fund that predominantly (by notional exposure) invests in long and short positions in equity, bond, currency and commodity markets, as well as making other investments. Exposure to these markets is primarily achieved through the use of exchange traded futures or over the counter derivatives such as currency forward contracts. For the purposes of covering the derivative positions, the Two Trees Fund also holds cash and cash equivalents which may mean that the underlying assets of the fund predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) consist of financial arrangements; and
3.  The investment interest attributable to the class Z units are subject to currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the New Zealand resident investors for the purposes of eliminating exchange rate risk on a highly effective basis.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in the Two Trees Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  The absolute value of the Two Trees Fund’s notional derivative exposure must not fall to 20% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days. Should this occur, the determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following quarter.

### **Interpretation**

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Financial arrangement” means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Two Trees Fund” means an Australian Unit Trust known at the date of this determination as the Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund – Class Z.

### **Determination**

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the Two Trees Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### **Application Date**

This determination applies for the 2023 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination apply for the income year.

Dated this 1st day of August 2022.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (iShares Green Bond Index Fund – NZD Share Class)
==========================================================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in shares in the iShares Green Bond Index Fund - NZD Share Class to which none of the exemptions in sections EX 29 to 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply, is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may not use the fair dividend rate ("FDR") method to calculate foreign investment fund income for the interest.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34 No 11, [December 2022](/tib/volume-34---2022/tib-vol-34-no11)

Reference
---------

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist – Network under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)
----------------------------------------------------------

Shares in the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) denominated class of the iShares Green Bond Index Fund (“the Fund”) as part of the BlackRock Fixed Income Dublin Funds public limited company (“BRFI”) incorporated under the laws of Ireland to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors. BRFI is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. These sub-funds do not have a separate legal personality.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in the NZD denominated class of the Fund (“the NZD Share Class”) each year.

The Fund is a sub-fund of BRFI which invests in a portfolio of global fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements the proceeds of which are used to fund projects with direct environmental benefits.

The Fund has on issue a number of share classes that provide holders of that class with an interest in a pool of financial instruments held by the Fund. The NZD Share Class is a share class denominated in NZD.  Foreign currency hedging arrangements are to be put in place which effectively provide investors with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on the financial arrangements held by the Fund.     

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would not apply to prevent the use of the FDR method for interests in the NZD Share class but would apply if the Fund represented a separate foreign company and the NZD Share Class was the only class of share on issue.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement including any interposed entities or financial arrangements in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On that basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in the NZD Share Class of the Fund, I consider that it is appropriate for them to be excluded from using the FDR method. 

Scope of determination
----------------------

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where: 

*   This non-resident issuer:
    *   is incorporated in Ireland and issues multiple classes of shares; and
    *   is known at the date of this determination as BlackRock Fixed Income Dublin Funds public limited company; and
    *   is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds.
*   The attributing interest consists of the New Zealand dollar denominated class of share, issued in the iShares Green Bond Index Fund, a sub-fund of BlackRock Fixed Income Dublin Funds public limited company, that provides exposure solely to a portfolio predominantly of fixed interest securities and other financial arrangements  
*   The investment assets attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of share are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non- resident for the purpose of eliminating to the extent possible any exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors on a highly effective basis.<

Interpretation
--------------

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires-

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method (Units in the Plato Global Macro Equity Fund– Class Z)
===========================================================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in units in the Plato Global Macro Equity Fund– Class Z, (previously Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund -Class Z) to which none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply, is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income for the interest.

Note: This Determination is a variation of Determination number 2022/01 previously issued to “Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund”. There are no material changes to the Discussion and Scope previously published, other than the name change.

[Tax Information Bulletin Vol 35 No 2, March 2023](/tib/volume-35---2023/tib-vol-35-no2)

### **Reference**

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Lead – Legal Services under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### **Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**

Units in the Plato Global Macro Equity Fund– Class Z (“Plato Global Fund”), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors when none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to EX 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply.

Under EX 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 an exemption may arise for an Australian Unit Trust and a New Zealand resident investor so that a person’s rights in the unit trust in an income year are not an attributing interest.  The determination will only apply when an attributing interest arises. 

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their Plato Global Fund investments each income year. 

The investments held by the Plato Global Fund may consist predominantly of financial arrangements providing funds to a person. In addition, some New Zealand resident investors may hedge their attributing interests in the Plato Global Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 could apply to prevent those investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand-resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

Notwithstanding that the Plato Global Fund may have assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and New Zealand resident investors may enter into related New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in the Plato Global Fund.

### **Scope of determination**

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination and applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    *   Is known at the date of this determination as the Plato Global Macro Equity Fund;
    *   Invests in long and short positions in equity, bond, currency and commodity markets, as well as making other investments;
    *   Is operated with separate classes of units.
2.  The attributing interest consists of class Z units issued in the Plato Global Fund, a class of units that provides an interest in the underlying assets of the Plato Global Fund that predominantly (by notional exposure) invests in long and short positions in equity, bond, currency and commodity markets, as well as making other investments. Exposure to these markets is primarily achieved through the use of exchange traded futures or over the counter derivatives such as currency forward contracts.  For the purposes of covering the derivative positions, the Plato Global Fund also holds cash and cash equivalents which may mean that the underlying assets of the fund predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) consist of financial arrangements; and
3.  The investment interest attributable to the class Z units are subject to currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the New Zealand resident investors for the purposes of eliminating exchange rate risk on a highly effective basis.

This determination is made subject to the following conditions:

1.  The investment in the Plato Global Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure.
2.  The absolute value of the Plato Global Fund’s notional derivative exposure must not fall to 20% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days. Should this occur, the determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following quarter.

### **Interpretation**

In this determination unless the context otherwise requires:

“Fair dividend rate method” means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Financial arrangement” means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Foreign investment fund” means foreign investment fund under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;

“Plato Global Fund” means an Australian Unit Trust known at the date of this determination as the Two Trees Global Equity Macro Fund – Class Z.

### **Determination**

This determination applies to an attributing interest in a FIF, being a direct income interest in the Plato Global Fund. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### **Application Date**

This determination applies for the 2023 and subsequent income years.

However, under section 91AAO(3B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this determination does not apply for a person and an income year beginning before the date of the determination unless the person chooses that the determination apply for the income year.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Wellington Management Funds (Ireland) PLC - Wellington Global Impact Bond Fund NZD Class)
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in shares in the Wellington Global Impact Bond Fund - NZD Share Class to which none of the exemptions in sections EX 29 to 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply, is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may not use the fair dividend rate ("FDR") method to calculate foreign investment fund income for the interest.

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 36 No 4, May 2024](/tib/volume-36---2024/tib-vol36-no4)

Reference
---------

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)
----------------------------------------------------------

Shares in the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) denominated class of the Wellington Global Impact Bond Fund (“the Fund”) are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors when none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to EX 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply. The Fund is part of the Wellington Management Funds (Ireland) PLC (“WMFI”) and incorporated under the laws of Ireland. 

WMFI is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. These sub-funds do not have a separate legal personality.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in the NZD denominated class of the Fund (“the NZD Share Class”) each year.

The Fund invests in a broadly diversified portfolio of eligible intermediate term domestic and global fixed interest and money market securities.  The Fund has various shares classes denominated in different currencies, including USD, AUD, GBP, EUR and NZD that provide holders of those classes of shares with an interest in the pool of investments held by the Fund.  The NZD class of shares of the Fund is denominated in New Zealand dollars.  The Fund has foreign currency hedging arrangements in place which effectively provide investors in the NZD class of the Fund with a New Zealand dollar denominated return on the financial arrangements held by the Fund.

Section EX 46(10)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would not apply to prevent the use of the FDR method for interests in the NZD Share class but would apply if the Fund represented a separate foreign company and the NZD Share Class was the only class of share on issue.

The policy intention is that the FDR method of calculating FIF income should not be applied to investments that provide a New Zealand resident investor with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement including any interposed entities or financial arrangements in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in the NZD Share Class of the Fund, and holds an attributing interest in the FIF, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment to be excluded from using the FDR method.

Scope of determination
----------------------

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination. It applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:   
  

1.  The non-resident issuer:
    *   is incorporated in Ireland and issues multiple classes of shares; and
    *   is known at the date of this determination as Wellington Management Funds (Ireland) PLC; and
    *   is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds.
2.  The attributing interest consists of the New Zealand dollar denominated class of shares issued in the Wellington Global Impact Bond Fund, a sub-fund of Wellington Management Funds (Ireland) PLC. This class of shares provides an interest in the underlying assets of the Fund that predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at a time in the income year) consist of financial arrangements such as international fixed interest securities; and
3.  The investment assets attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of share are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident issuer for the purpose of eliminating to the extent possible any exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors where this removes 80% to 125% of foreign currency risk for the assets.

Conditions
----------

It is a condition of this determination that the investment in the Fund is part of an overall arrangement that seeks to provide the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is economically equivalent to a debt instrument denominated in New Zealand dollars.

In addition, it is a condition of this determination that an investor will not be excluded from using the FDR method to calculate FIF income from an interest where the absolute notional value of the Fund’s investment in global fixed income securities (directly or indirectly via derivatives) plus the fair value of the related hedges plus cash and cash equivalents (together referred to as “the numerator”) is 80% or less than the combined total of the numerator plus the absolute nominal value of other derivatives (together referred to as “the denominator”) for a continuous period of 45 days. For the purposes of calculating the numerator and denominator hedging to NZD is excluded. Should this occur the determination will cease to apply from the first day of the quarter immediately following the expiry of the 45 day period.   
  

Interpretation
--------------

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires -

"Fair dividend rate method" means the fair dividend rate method under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 

"Financial arrangement" means financial arrangement under section EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

A type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund for which a person may not use the fair dividend rate method (Colchester Multi-Strategy Global Bond Fund PLC – The Colchester Global Green Bond Enhanced Currency Fund- NZD Hedged Accumulation Class Z Shares)

**Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Shares in the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) denominated class of The Colchester Global Green Bond Enhanced Currency Fund Share Class: NZD hedged Accumulation Class – Z Shares are an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors when none of the exemptions in section EX 29 to EX 43 of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply. The Fund is part of The Colchester Multi-Strategy Global Bond Fund PLC and incorporated under the laws of Ireland.

The Colchester Multi-Strategy Global Bond Fund PLC is structured as an umbrella fund with segregated liability between sub-funds. These sub-funds do not have a separate legal personality.

New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the FIF rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their investment in shares in the NZD denominated class of the Fund (“the NZD Share Class”) each year.

It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole of the arrangement including any interposed entities or financial arrangements in ascertaining whether an investment in a FIF provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return akin to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt investment.

On this basis, where a New Zealand resident invests in the NZD Share Class of the Fund, and holds an attributing interest in the FIF, I consider that it is appropriate for the investor holding that investment to be excluded from using the FDR method.

This determination is issued on the basis of information provided to the Commissioner before the date of this determination. It applies to an attributing interest in a FIF held by New Zealand resident investors in a non-resident issuer where:

1.  This non-resident issuer:

2.  The attributing interest consists of the New Zealand dollar denominated class of shares issued in The Colchester Global Green Bond Enhanced Currency Fund, a sub-fund of The Colchester Multi-Strategy Global Bond Fund PLC. This class of shares provides an interest in the underlying assets of the Fund that predominantly (i.e. 80% or more by value at any time in the income year) consist of financial arrangements such as international fixed interest securities; and
3.  The investment assets attributable to the New Zealand dollar denominated class of share are subject to foreign currency hedging arrangements undertaken by the non-resident issuer for the purpose of eliminating to the extent possible any exchange rate risk for New Zealand investors where this removes 80% to 125% of foreign currency risk for the assets.

In addition, it is a condition of this determination that an investor will not be excluded from using the FDR method to calculate FIF income from an interest where the absolute notional value of the Fund’s investment in global fixed income securities (directly or indirectly via derivatives) plus the fair value of the related hedges plus cash and cash equivalents (together referred to as “the numerator”) is 80% or less than the combined total of the numerator plus the absolute nominal value of other derivatives (together referred to as “the denominator”) for a continuous period of 45 days. For the purposes of calculating the numerator and denominator hedging to NZD is excluded. Should this occur, the determination will cease to apply from the first day of the quarter immediately following the expiry of the 45 day period.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee February 2018 Update – Delivering the next step in the Transformation of New Zealand’s revenue system Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding preparations for implementing the next steps in the modernisation of New Zealand’s revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note the progress being made. Inland Revenue’s Transformation Update dated February 2018 is available from the Cabinet Office. Executive Summary 2 In November 2015, Cabinet agreed to invest in the implementation of New Zealand’s future revenue system (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). A modern, digital, revenue system will serve the needs of all New Zealanders. Customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements, as tax will be correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. The government will have greater ability to make policy changes faster and more effectively and will be better able to use the information Inland Revenue holds to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealanders. 3 Transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and is an opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 4 New Zealand’s revenue system will be transformed in four broad stages – digital services, tax, social policy and a final wrap up. Modernisation of the revenue system is now well underway. GST has been administered using new systems and processes since February 2017. 5 Remaining taxes and entitlements will be moved to START 1 in a series of releases over 2018 to 2021 to reduce risk and business and customer impacts. Release 2 will go-live on 17 April 2018 and will improve customer experiences, reduce the effort required by businesses to meet their obligations and improve customer compliance. It will also set the scene for more comprehensive changes to be introduced in release 3 in 2019. 6 The key changes for customers in release 2 include employers being able to provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue every payday if they choose to, 2 and the introduction of the accounting income method option for calculating provisional tax. 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name Inland Revenue has chosen for its new system 2 Subject to legislation     Withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, payroll subsidy, and gaming machine duty will be moved to START. 7 Compared to GST, the significantly larger scope and complexity of tax types, and proposed legislative changes for release 2, means there are much wider implications for customers. Business customers will need to progressively adapt their systems and processes to ensure they continue to meet their obligations. 8 Inland Revenue is on schedule to implement release 2 on 17 April 2018 as planned. Delivery of our 100 day plan commitments is not dependent on release 2. The Families Package, Best Start and increases to Paid Parental Leave will be delivered by Inland Revenue in their existing heritage systems, and migrated to START in line with the release plan. 9 Major releases will typically occur on an annual cycle in each of the next four years, to align with the beginning of the tax year (April 2018 to 2021). Inland Revenue recognises the need for further discussions with Ministers to ensure that the release plan is well aligned with the government’s priorities. 10 Based on the current release plan, remaining taxes, Working for Families and Best Start will be implemented in START in April 2019, KiwiSaver and Student Loans in April 2020, and Child Support in April 2021. 11 The implementation of release 3 in April 2019 is a key tipping point for tax policy agility. Following that, we will be in a far stronger position to implement any recommendations made by either the Tax Working Group and/or the Welfare Working Group. 12 Maintaining momentum is critically important, as Inland Revenue is now operating two systems and the department’s risk profile has therefore increased. It will remain high until transformation is complete, due to the need for old and new systems to co-exist. Migrating products and services to START as quickly as possible will limit the period of time that the core systems need to co-exist, is the best way to manage risk, and will minimise any confusion or disruption for customers. Officials assure me they are confident the challenges of co-existence are in hand and that the collection of revenue, payment of entitlements and delivery of services will continue uninterrupted during transformation. Background 13 In March 2013, Cabinet accepted that transformation of the revenue system was required. A number of potential investment options for modernising the revenue system were presented, ranging from “do nothing” through to an all of government solution. Cabinet agreed to invest in modernising the revenue system through business process re-engineering, supported by new technology (CAB Min (13) 10/4 refers). 14 In November 2015, Cabinet agreed to invest in the implementation of New Zealand’s future revenue system (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). A multi-year funding envelope was approved, together with a financial delegation of $1,870 million to complete transformation. The funding envelope comprises new funding from the Crown of between $800 million and $1,005 million with the balance of funding provided by Inland Revenue through administrative savings and capital reserves. 15 The changes being delivered by transformation will: 15.1 Provide confidence in the continued collection of tax revenue and distribution of entitlements. 15.2 Improve the Government’s ability to make policy changes faster and more cost- effectively. 15.3 Grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right. 15.4 Create an information asset to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealand. 15.5 Deliver cumulative additional Crown revenue of $2,880m–$6,175m by 2023/24. 3 15.6 Deliver cumulative compliance cost savings (economic benefits) for small- medium sized enterprises in particular, until 2023/24 of between $1,330m to $2,265m (a reduction of 18-26 in the hours spent on compliance each year by 2023/24). 15.7 Enable Inland Revenue to realise administrative savings of $495m–$580m by 2023/24. Modernisation of the revenue system is now well underway 16 In February 2017, GST was successfully moved to Inland Revenue’s new system, START. New services mean it’s now quicker and easier for customers with straight- forward transactions to manage their GST online. Customers with more complex circumstances have experienced some challenges. Changes have been made to the new GST online services since go-live to improve the experiences of customers. 17 Inland Revenue has confirmed it remains on track to realise the benefits committed from the implementation of Stage 1. These are improved experiences for customers, compliance cost reductions for small–medium sized businesses and administrative savings for Inland Revenue. Changes will be delivered in smaller, more manageable steps for customers and Inland Revenue 18 Moving to a release-based approach means the four broad stages of transformation will overlap. Taxes and entitlements will be moved to START in smaller steps, reducing risk and business and customer impacts. At the same time, transformation will move into social policy products (Stage 3) earlier than planned. 19 Major releases will typically occur on an annual cycle in each of the next four years to align with the beginning of the tax year. Inland Revenue recognises the need for further discussions with Ministers to ensure the release plan is well aligned with the government’s priorities and acknowledge that it may need to be reassessed to ensure our objectives are met. 20 The release plan is Inland Revenue’s current view of the sequence in which remaining taxes and entitlements will be moved to new systems and processes in a way that best balances delivery risk, cost to deliver, and impacts on customers. This has taxes moving 3 The lower end of this range is already included in Government’s fiscal forecasts in two releases over April 2018 and April 2019, and Working for Families and Best Start moving in April 2019. 21 Following that, KiwiSaver and Student Loans will be implemented in April 2020, and Child Support will be implemented in 2021. Alternative sequencing for the order in which Child Support, KiwiSaver and Student Loans are moved to START is possible and other options are being explored. Officials inform me that they will be better placed to reassess the release plan towards the end of 2018. By then, some key activities, including a high- level analysis of how the social policy products will work in START, will have been completed. 22 Where possible, policy changes will be aligned with other changes such as moving products to new systems and processes, to minimise the impacts for customers and Inland Revenue. 23 The release plan will be reviewed regularly, at least annually after each major release, to ensure the optimal plan is being delivered—taking into account government priorities, new opportunities that are identified, customer experiences and benefits, co-existence and business needs. The next major release will go-live on 17 April 2018 24 Release 2 in April 2018 will include: 24.1 Introducing the accounting income method option for calculating provisional tax. 24.2 Implementing the automatic exchange of information with international tax treaty partners. 24.3 Enabling employers to send their information to Inland Revenue on payday if they choose to do so. 4 24.4 Moving withholding taxes, 5 fringe benefit tax, payroll subsidy, and gaming machine duty to new systems and processes. 24.5 Collecting income information in START so that pre-population of individuals’ information can begin. Pre-population means the information Inland Revenue already holds about people will be made available to them so they don’t have to provide it to the department again. 25 Based on the lessons learned from implementing GST, Inland Revenue has recognised the need for better design input from customers. Tax agents in particular are actively involved in transformation, and opportunities are being provided for customers to validate services. Aspects of the new system are being co-designed with tax agents, who are also testing it to ensure the design of new services meets their needs. A similar approach will be adopted with payroll professionals. 26 Following the implementation of release 2, the administration of many more products will be split across Inland Revenue’s old and new systems. Although Inland Revenue’s intent is to ensure that customer service levels are maintained during transformation and 4 Subject to legislation 5 Including resident withholding tax, non-resident withholding tax, residential land withholding tax, and approved issuer levy     to make the use of two systems as invisible as possible to customers, many more customers will need to work between them, compared to GST. 27 Moving to a release based approach has mitigated the impacts of co-existence for both customers and Inland Revenue to the greatest extent possible. Making changes in a series of releases means that the complexity of changes being introduced is balanced across the releases. 28 Release 2 in 2018 will set the scene for the more comprehensive changes to be introduced in release 3 in 2019. From 2019, it will be easier for customers to understand what their obligations and entitlements are and why, and they will be able to self-help the majority of time. This will reduce the time and effort they spend meeting their obligations and mean there is little need for them to interact with Inland Revenue. Release 3 is a key trigger point for reducing the compliance costs faced by small-medium sized businesses. Customers are being actively supported to ensure they are ready for April 2018 29 Existing channels that achieved good awareness will be used again for release 2 to help customers understand the changes being introduced. New approaches, including regional seminars for tax agents and more hands-on support for both customers and tax agents, will help target groups who may need more support. Around 250 seminars are being held by Inland Revenue around New Zealand to update tax agents and businesses on the changes happening in April 2018, including the accounting income method. About 16,000 customers in total are expected to attend one of the seminars, which begin in February and run until early May 2018. 30 Inland Revenue continues to work closely with tax professional bodies and to meet regularly with software providers and payroll developers. This collaborative approach will continue, as the department recognises that New Zealanders rely on their advisors, such as tax agents, accountancy firms and corporates, to help them make sure they have done the right thing. 31 There will also be a focus on raising awareness among small businesses, encouraging them to seek more information from their tax agent, if they have one. Marketing to customers began in late February 2018. Plans for readying Inland Revenue staff to support customers through the changes being made in release 2 are well advanced 32 Alongside implementing new systems and processes and consulting on policy changes, Inland Revenue is also changing the way it works. On February 12 2018, Inland Revenue began the move to a new organisation: agile, intelligence-led and built around the needs of customers. This means that people designing customer services will be as close to the customer as possible and people working with customers will be able to make more decisions and resolve customers’ queries and issues more quickly. Customers will increasingly be able to talk to one person to get more of their queries resolved. 33 Inland Revenue will continue to have a presence in the communities it is represented in today and will continue to look for opportunities to co-locate with other government agencies. 34 The changes being introduced by transformation will mean that Inland Revenue will need fewer people in the future. This has been well signalled to staff. All things being equal, Inland Revenue will be approximately 25%-30% smaller at the end of transformation than it is today. Implementing a new organisation design will enable Inland Revenue to deliver the administrative savings committed to (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers) as part of the department’s funding contribution towards transformation. 35 As much as possible, any reductions will be managed through attrition and flexible workforce arrangements. Since mid-2016, Inland Revenue has adopted a deliberate approach of filling the majority of vacancies with fixed-term employees. As at 31 December 2017, the department had approximately 560 people on fixed term agreements representing around 10% of the total workforce. The conclusion of fixed- term arrangements will contribute significantly to the future reduction in workforce. If there is a need to reduce the number of people in particular roles, Inland Revenue will look at options for doing that and will discuss them with staff and the unions as appropriate. Customer experiences will improve over 2018 and 2019, independently of the major releases 36 Customers’ behaviours and expectations have changed and will continue to evolve. As customers embrace technology, they expect things to move faster: instant responses, instant access to information and immediate solutions wherever they are and on their platform of choice. Only by improving and modernising its technology and changing its organisation design can Inland Revenue significantly enhance experiences for customers and meet their needs. 37 Work is underway to reduce the time and effort customers spend in finding the right information, and then understanding it, and to help customers understand what they need to do and make it easy for them to do so. A digital solution to the “what’s my IRD number” customer pain point is being developed and a Business Survival Guide has been developed for young businesses. 38 Although there is a particular focus on improving digital experiences, the experiences of all customers will be enhanced, regardless of how they choose to interact with Inland Revenue. Transformation remains inherently high risk 39 Beginning transformation in February 2017 with GST was a deliberate and considered choice. GST is a relatively simple tax and there was very little legislative change. From here on, implementation becomes much more complex. Multiple changes are being introduced to the systems and processes that customers use to meet their obligations and determine their entitlements, along with some legislative changes that affect how often and how they do that. 40 Halting partway through implementation will increase operational risk, be costly because two core systems will have to be supported and maintained and may potentially constrain government’s agility to make change. 41 A summary of the most significant risks for transformation as at January 2018 is included in Appendix 5 of Inland Revenue’s Transformation Update dated February 2018, available from the Cabinet Office.     42 Transformation combined with the tax policy work programme and Budget 2017 changes means that Inland Revenue has limited capacity to implement additional changes. The ability of stakeholders to absorb additional changes also needs to be considered. An on-going monitoring programme is in place to provide assurance to stakeholders 43 Inland Revenue undertakes regular independent quality assurance (IQA) and technical quality assurance (TQA) reviews, and Gateway reviews. Three external assurance reviews have been completed since the last progress update provided to Cabinet in mid- 2017. All three reviews concluded that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. The Minister of Finance and I are provided with the opportunity to talk directly with the review teams. We also receive copies of the reports once they have been finalised. 44 Inland Revenue is required to provide transformation progress updates to Cabinet by July and December each year (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). The next update will be provided by July 2018. Next steps 45 The next steps are to: 45.1 continue preparations for the implementation of release 2 in April 2018; 45.2 support the passage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill which contains key transformation proposals; 45.3 progress any technical legislative changes needed to support the implementation of releases 2 and 3; 45.4 45.5 45.6 work across government on the implementation options available to Ministers as part of transformation for reforms arising from the Tax Working Group and the Welfare Working Group; and 45.7 prepare a transformation update for Cabinet to consider by July 2018. Consultation 46 A copy of this paper has been provided to the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, the New Zealand Customs Service, and Statistics New Zealand. Financial Implications 47 The proposals in this paper have no financial implications. Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Human Rights 48 The proposals in this paper have no human rights implications. Legislative Implications 49 The proposals in this paper do not require any changes to legislation. Regulatory Impact Analysis 50 The proposals in this paper do not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. Gender Implications 51 The proposals in this paper have no gender implications. Disability Perspective 52 The proposals in this paper have no implications for people with disabilities. Publicity 53 I intend to ask Inland Revenue to publish this paper on its website once it has been considered by Cabinet. Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, State Services Commission and Government Chief Information Officer) 54 Corporate Centre agencies were consulted on this update. 55 Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation (BT) programme is significant, both for the department and wider society. 56 The Corporate Centre’s delivery confidence assessment of the programme remains at amber/green. This assessment is based on past and current programme delivery, ongoing learning loops in place in the transformation programme and external delivery assurance. The next assurance reviews are underway, ahead of the planned Release 2 go-live in April. The Corporate Centre continues to have good visibility of the programme and the risks/mitigations due to high standards of reporting and transparency applied by the programme team. 57 Inland Revenue continues to work with external stakeholders as they prepare to implement Release 2; incorporating lessons learned from Stage 1. This includes closer involvement with tax agents. Broad learnings and capability from BT continue to be shared and deployed across other public service change programmes, reinforcing the open ways of working seen elsewhere in the programme. We understand external stakeholders will play an important role in the planning of future releases. 58 Ministers should note that any change which has a substantial operational impact on Inland Revenue could impact their ability to deliver Business Transformation and realise the benefits committed to in the 2015 business case. This includes delays to the organisational change programme and the implementation of proposed legislation. The risk of the transition from the legacy systems to the new system is being actively managed and monitored by the programme. 59 The Corporate Centre will work with Inland Revenue on the interaction between Business Transformation and proposed changes arising from other Government initiatives, including the Tax Working Group. 60 Inland Revenue’s organisational change has featured in the media, largely due to the Public Service Association’s court proceedings. The Corporate Centre will continue to work with Inland Revenue as they implement a new organisational structure, and bring new developments to Ministers’ attention. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that the remaining stages of transformation will be implemented in a series of releases over 2018 to 2021; 2 note that maintaining momentum is critically important, as Inland Revenue is now operating two systems and the department’s risk profile has therefore increased; 3 note that release 2 in April 2018 includes: 3.1 introducing the accounting income method option for calculating provisional tax; and 3.2 implementing the automatic exchange of information with international tax treaty partners; and 3.3 moving withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, payroll subsidy and gaming machine duty to new systems and processes; 4 note that major releases will typically occur on an annual cycle in each of the next four years to align with the beginning of the tax year; 5 note that the release-based approach moves taxes and entitlements to new systems and processes in smaller steps, reducing risk and business and customer impacts; 6 note that Inland Revenue will review the release plan by the end of 2018; 7 note that transformation is required to report to Cabinet on a six-monthly basis and the next update will be provided to Cabinet to consider by July 2018; and 8 note that Inland Revenue’s Transformation Update dated February 2018 is available from the Cabinet Office.

  require   employers   to   provide   PAYE   information   on   pay day   and   more   businesses   to   file   electronically; 3   and   enable   payers   of   investment   income   to   provide   detailed   recipient   information   on   a   more   frequent   basis   if   they   choose   to. 4   From   2019,   it   will   be   easier   for   customers   to   calculate   and   pay   what   they   owe.   They’ll   be   able   to   use   their   own   systems   and   processes   to   meet   their   obligations   as   they                                                                      1   Subject   to   legislation.   2   Including   resident   withholding   tax,   non ‐ resident   withholding   tax,   dividend   withholding   tax,   resident   land   withholding   tax,   and   approved   issuer   levy   3   Subject   to   legislation   4   ibid   will   be   integrated   with   Inland   Revenue’s   systems   and   processes.   The   revenue   system   itself   will   be   more   resilient   and   agile.    Compared   to   GST,   release   2   has   much   wider   implications   for   employers,   tax   agents,   bookkeepers,   payroll   intermediaries,   software   developers,   and   financial   institutions.   For   the   majority   of   other   customers,   there   will   be   no   major   cha nges   in   2018.        To   administer   a   modern   revenue   sys tem,   Inland   Revenue   is   changing   the   way   it   works.   Implementation   of   the   first   wave   of   Inland   Revenue’s   new   organisation   design   began   on   12   February   2018.   This   is   an   important   step   in   becoming   more   agile   and   intelligence ‐ led,   and   built   around   the   needs   of   customers.   Those   delivering   customer   se rvic e s   will   be   enabled   and   empowered   to   make   more   decisions   and   resolve   customers’   issues   more   quickly.   New   delegations   combined   with   broader   roles   means   customers   will   have   their   issues   responded   to   more   quickly   and   will   be   able   to   talk   to   one   person   to   get   more   of   their   queries   resolved. Inland   Revenue   is   working   directly   with   the   businesses   that   need   to   make   the   most   changes.   This   includes   working   closely   with   large   enterprises   with   customised   payroll   systems   including   government   agencies,   and   communicating   directly   with   businesses   still   filing   on   paper.    In   confidence   Page   4     Inland   Revenue   has   adopted   a   more   collaborative   approach   to   the   design   of   future   stages   based   on   the   lessons   learned   from   implementing   GST.   Customers   are   actively   involved   in   the   remaining   stages   of   transformation.   Tax   agents   have   joined   transformation,   opportunities   for   customers   to   validate   new   services   before   go ‐ live   are   being   provided,   and   considerable   efforts   were   made   to   en gage   a   wide   range   of   New   Zealanders   in   the   social   policy   pr oposals.     Inland   Revenue   is   working   across   the   public   sector   to   ensure   that   New   Zealanders   continue   to   receive   the   services   they   do   today,   following   the   changes   being   introduced   by   transformation.   Work   on   policy   and   legislative   setting s   is   continuing.   Legislative   improvements   to   the   collection   and   use   of   PAYE   and   investment   income   information   are   currently   before   Parliament.        Trans f ormation   remains   inherently   high ‐ risk.   Transformation   is   complex   and   challenging.   Inland   Revenue   is   now   operating   two   systems   and   the   departme nt’s   risk   profile   has   increased.   It   will   remain   high   until   the   completion   of   transformation   due   to   the   need   fo r   old   and   new   systems   to   co ‐ exist.   Inland   Revenue   is   currently   undergoing   a   major   redesign   of   its   organisation   to   support   transformation.   Significant   changes   for   cu stomer ‐ facing   areas   and   some   of   the   key   capabilities   that   support   them   were   announ ced   in   Jul y   2017.    Moving   a   large   number   of   people   into   new   structures,   teams   and   roles   is   not   without   its   challenges.   During   the   change   process,   the   Public   Service   Association   initiated   legal   proceedings   regarding   aspects   of   the   process   for   moving   peo ple   into   new   roles.   A   ruling   by   the   Employ ment   Court   on   21   December   2017   resolved   some   issues.   In   January   2018,   Inland   Revenue   and   the   Public   Service   Association   had   good   discussions   about   the   process   for   and   concerns   of   the   members   the   union   represents,   and   reached   agreement   on   the   way   forward.   The   agreement   includes   a   specific   way   forward   in   supp ort   of   implementing   the   first   three   new   organisati on   gro ups.   A   further   hearing   in   the   Employment   Court   is   scheduled   for   14 ‐ 28   May   2018   regarding   some   aspects   of   the   selection   process   for   some   roles.   As   a   result   of   the   Public   Service   Association   challenge,   the   selection   pro cess   for   these   roles   was   amended   so   that   the   three   new   groups   could   be   established   as   plan ned   on   12   February   2018.   However,   Inland   Revenue   understands   that   the   PSA   has   since   withdrawn   proceedings.   Robust   risk   management   processes   are   in   place   to   identify   and   mitigate   risks,   and   the   independent   quality   assurance   programme   forms   an   integral   part   of   the   management   of   risks.   Transformation   remains   on   schedule   an d   costs   are   tracking   as   expected,   and   within   the   fundin g   approved   by   Government.     Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Background   In   confidence   Page   5     This   update   outlines   the   progress   being   made   by   Inland   Revenue   in   implementing   transformation.   It   has   been   reviewed   by   the   corporate   centre.   In   March   2013,   Cabinet   accepted   that   transformation   of   the   revenue   system   was   required.   A   number   of   potential   investment   options   for   modernising   the   revenue   system   were   presented   to   Cabinet   in   2013,   ranging   fr om   “do   nothing”   through   to   an   all   of   government   solution.   Cabi net   agreed   to   invest   in   modernising   the   revenue   system   through   business   process   re ‐ engineering,   supported   by   new   technology   (known   as   Option   3B).   Design   activity   commenced,   and   delivery   partners   (Accenture   and   FAST   Enterprises)   were   secured   to   support   Inland   Revenue.   In   November   20 15,   Cabinet   agree d   to   invest   in   the   implementation   of   New   Zealand’s   future   revenue   system.   A   multi ‐ year   funding   envelope   was   approved,   together   with   a   financial   delegation   of   $1,870   million   to   complete   transformation.   The   funding   envelope   comprises   new   funding   from   the   Crown   of   between   $800   million   and   $1,005   million   with   the   balan ce   of   funding   provided   by   Inland   Revenue   through   administrative   savings   and   cap ital   reserves   (CAB ‐ 15 ‐ MIN ‐ 0249   refers).    Business   transformation   is   a   long ‐ term   programme   to   modernise   New   Zealand’s   revenue   system.   A   modern,   digital,   revenue   system   will   serve   the   needs   of   all   New   Zealanders.   It   will   help   customers   to   get   their   tax   and   social   poli cy   payments   right   first   time,   avoid   errors   and   give   them   a   clearer   view   of   what   the y’ve   paid   and   what   they   owe   during   the   year.   The   revenue   system   will   be   simple   to   comply   with   and   responsive   to   customers’   changing   circumstances.   People   will   spend   far   less   time   and   effort   ensuring   the y   meet   their   obligations   and   receive   their   correct   social   policy   entitlements,   as   tax   will   be   correctly   withheld   and   assistance   pro vided   at   the   time   it   is   needed.   Transformation   involves   far   more   than   an   upgrade   of   technology.       Delivering   New   Zealand’s   future   revenue   system   involves:    Simplifying   policy   and   legislative   settings.    Makin g   more   intelligent   use   of   inform ation   to   proactively   ensu re   customers   get   it   right   from   the   start.    Designing   and   delivering   services   with   others   inside   and   outside   of   government   that   enable   customers   to   self ‐ manage.    Creating   an   organisation   that   works   together   better   to   improve   outcomes   for   customers.    Implementing   a   modern   technology   platfor m   (START)   that   is   highly   automate d,   more   resilient   and   more   responsive   to   change.   Central   to   the   modernisation   of   the   revenue   system   is   delivery   of   the   new   tax   and   social   policy   platform   (START).   In   addition,   a   number   of   other   changes   are   being   made   to   support   digital   services   and   intelligence ‐ led   out comes.   There   are   sign ificant   benefits   fr om   transformation   for   customers   and   the   Crown.   The   changes   being   delivered   by   transformation   will:    Provide   confidence   in   the   continued   collection   of   tax   revenue   and   distribution   of   entitlements.    Improve   the   Government’s   ability   to   make   policy   changes   faster   and   more   cost ‐ effectively.    Grow   voluntary   compliance   by   making   it   easier   for   people   to   ge t   it   right.    Create   an   information   asset   to   deliver   improved   outcomes   for   New   Zealand.    Deliver   cumulative   additional   Crown   revenue   of   $2,8 80m–$6,175m   by   2023/24.    Deliver   cumulative   compliance   cost   savings   (economic   benefits)   for   small ‐  medium   sized   enterprises   in   particular,   until   2023/24   of   between   $1, 330m   to   $2,26 5m.    Ena ble   Inland   Revenue   to   realise   administrative   savings   of   $495m–$580m   by   2023/24.   In   addition,   transformation   will   make   a   significant   contribution   to   improving   digital   interactions   with   government,   improving   cross ‐ government   outcomes   and   a   growing   healthy   economy. Transformation   is   enabled   by   a   combination   of   changes   to   policy,   process,   technology   and   the   organisation   design   of   Inland   Revenue.   It   is   an   opportunity   to   fundamentally   review   how   the   revenue   system   is   administered   and   consider   what   changes   may   be   needed.    In   confidence   Page   6     Customers’   interactions   with   government   and   Inland   Revenue   will   fundamentally   change.   Only   by   improving   and   modernising   its   technology   can   Inland   Revenue   significantly   enhance   experiences   for   customers   and   meet   their   needs.      Those   with   less   complex   needs   will   only   need   to   confirm   their   details   using   automated,   straight ‐ through   digital   services.   Customers   who   do   have   to   provid e   information   will   use   their   own   systems   and   processes   to   do   so   as   part   of   their   everyday   business   activities.   Infor mation   will   be   checked   when   it   is   received   and   errors   fixed   wherever   possible.   Earlier,   more   complete   information   will   be   available   to   Inland   Revenue   which   will   lead   to   greater   accuracy   and   mean   fewer   u nder   or   over   payments   for   customers.   Together,   new   systems,   processes   and   services   and   legislative   changes,   will   sim plify   customers’   tax   affairs   and   make   it   easier   for   them   to   meet   their   obligations.   There   are   four   broad   stages   in   transformation.   The   programme   roadmap   (please   refer   to   appendix   1)   sets   out   the   high ‐ level   order   in   which   produ cts   and   services   will   be   implemented.   The   first   stage   has   already   been   completed.   GST   has   been   successfully   implemented.   In   February   2017,   GST   was   successfully   moved   to   START.   New   services   mean   it’s   now   quicker   and   easier   for   customers   with   straight ‐ forward   transactions   to   manage   their   GST   online.   Changes   to   th e   new   online   GST   services   were   made   monthly   from   July   to   October   2017   to   improve   the   experiences   of   customers   with   more   complex   circumsta nces.   Inland   Revenue   is   on   track   to   realise   the   benefits   committed   from   the   implementation   of   GST.   These   are   improved   experiences   for   customers,   compliance   cost   reductions   for   small–medium   sized   businesses   and   administrative   savings   for   In land   Revenue.     The   next   release   will   move   more   taxes   to   new   systems   and   processes,   improve   customer   experiences,   and   introduce   legislative   change.   Stage   2   will   be   implemented   in   a   series   of   releases   over   2018   and   2019,   significantly   reducing   the   effort   required   by   businesses   to   kee p   on   top   of   their   tax   obligations   so   they   can   spend   more   time   running   their   businesses.    The   likelihood   of   errors   will   be   much   reduced,   resulting   in   greater   certainty,   fewer   interactions,   less   debt,   and   less   need   for   compliance   checks.   Businesses   will   have   a   clearer   view   of   their   tax   position   during   the   year   and   will   be   able   to   meet   their   tax   obligations   at   minimum   cos t   and   minimum   disruption.    Once   Stage   2   has   been   fully   implemented   in   2019   customers   will   have:    on ‐ line   services   for   all   tax   produ cts  ‐  for   example   customers   will   be   able   to   file   returns,   set   up   payment   plans   and   include   att achments   on ‐ line    integrated   tax   and   business   processes    faster,   more   accur ate   tax   information,   providing   near   real ‐ time   visibility   of   tax    faster   tax   refunds    less   likelihood   of   tax   debt   and   more   payment   options.   Transformation   will   make   a   significant   contribution   to   wider   government   outcomes.   Modernising   the   revenue   system   will   significantly   contrib ute   to   imp roving   outcomes   for   New   Zealanders   –   ensuring   they   pay   and   receive   the   right   amounts,   and   making   it   easy   for   them   to   interact   with   government   when   they   need   to.     In   the   future,   most   customers   will   not   need   to   interact   with   Inland   Revenue   as   their   information   will   be   provided   to   Inland   Revenue   on   their   behalf.   Enhancing   GST   online   services   In   confidence   Page   7     Moving   GST   to   new   systems   and   processes   in   February   2017   was   a   very   significant   and   public   step   forward   in   the   modernisation   of   New   Zealand’s   revenue   system.   It’s   now   quicker   and   easier   for   customers   with   straightforward   transactions   to   manage   their   GST   online.   However   it   hasn’t   been   as   easy   for   customers   with   more   complex   circumstances.   Tax   agents   in   partic ular   experienced   some   challenges   from   having   to   work   in   two   systems.   GST   accou nts   for   25%   of   the   revenue   Inland   Revenue   collects   for   the   government.   So   successfully   moving   it   to   new   systems   and   processes,   albeit   not   without   its   challenges   for   some   stakeholders,   is   significant.   Inland   Revenue   is   continuin g   to   improve   stakeholders’   experiences   with   GST.   Since   GST   went   live,   Inland   Revenue   has   been   working   with   tax   ag ents   to   improve   their   experiences.   Working   together,   tax   agents   and   Inland   Revenue    identified   the   biggest   challenges   and   agreed   the   improvements   needed   to   address   them.   To   ensure   the   most   important   issues   were   addressed   first,   Inland   Revenue   ran:    focus   grou ps   with   tax   agent   administrator s   to   better   understand   the   practical   aspects   of   tax   agents’   work    sessions   with   tax   agents   to   better   understand   the   impacts   on   their   day ‐ to ‐ day   operations   of   viewing   and   processing   GST   transactions    surveys   of   small   groups   of   tax   agents   th roughout   New   Zealand    one ‐ on ‐ one   sessions   with   tax   agen ts   in   user   experience   labs.   Changes   have   already   been   made,   however   others   will   take   longer   as   a   result   of   co ‐ existence   between   FIRST   (Inland   Revenue’s   old   system)   and   START   (Inland   Revenue’s   new   system).    Improvements   have   been   implemented   on   a   monthly   basis.    Changes   were   made   in   Ju ly,   August,   Se ptember,   and   October   2017.   Of   the   twenty ‐ five   improvements   made,   the   most   significant   were:    Making   it   easier   for   tax   agents   to   identify   their   client   names   and   IRD   numbers.    Consolidating   the   number   of   letters,   notifications   and   alerts   sent   to   customers   when   there   is   som ething   for   them   to   do   in   myIR.    Improving   traceability   of   GST   transfers   between   systems.    Improving   cus tomers’   ability   to   navigate   between   different   periods   when   viewing   GST   transactions.    Providing   tax   agents   with   a   new   summary   report   that   makes   it   easier   for   them   to   prepare   their   clients’   annual   GST   reconciliation.        The   chan ges   made   have   been   positively   received   by   tax   agents.   A   monthly   cycle   provides   sufficient   time   fo r   tax   agents   and   Inland   Revenue’s   front   line   staff   to   prepare   for   each   release   of   improvements.   Each   month   tax   agents   and   their   professional   bodies   are   provided   with   an   update   on   changes   ready   to   be   implem ented,   as   well   as   a   view   of   what   is   in   the   pipeline.   Notwith standing   the   challenges,   customer   uptake   of   new   services   is   strong.   Shifts   in   customer   behaviour   are   evident.   At   the   end   of   December   2017,   more   than   1.7   million   returns   had   been   filed   using   the   new   web   service   and   just   over   an   additional   220 ,000   returns   were   filed   by   approximately   70,000   customers   thro ugh   their   accounting   software.    For   the   year   to   date   to   December   2017,   85%   of   customers   filed   their   GST   returns   electronically,   compared   with   83%   for   the   year   to   date   to   December   2016   and   77%   for   the   year   to   date   to   December   20 15.   Stage   1   was   about   more   than   GST.   GST   was   not   the   only   thing   Inland   Revenue   delivered   as   part   of   Stage   1.   In   September   2017,   Inland   Revenue   implemented   RealMe   as   an   option   for   customers   to   use   when   identifying   themselves   to   the   department.   As   at   the   end   Improvements   were   implemented   following   user   labs   where   Inland   Revenue   worked   one ‐ on ‐ one   with   agents   around   the   country   to   make   sure   their   requirements   were   clearly   understood.   The   solutions   developed   were   then   taken   back   to   the   same   tax   agents   to   validate   before   they   were   tested   and   implemented.    In   confidence   Page   8     of   January   2018,   more   than   40,000   customers   had   linked   their   myIR   login   to   a   RealMe   account.   New   migrants   can   now   register   with   Inland   Revenue   as   part   of   their   visa   application   process.   To   the   end   of   December   2017,   more   than   35,000   new   migrants,   visa   holders   and   organisations   registered   for   IRD   numbers   through   th e   new   digital   registration   service.   This   helps   to   ensure   that   migrants   are   ready   for   work   when   they   arrive,   making   it   easier   for   them   to   settle   into   New   Zealand.   Some   of   the   found ations   for   the   remainder   of   transformation   were   also   put   in   place.   Some   foundational   technology   was   replaced   to   set   Inland   Revenue   up   fo r   the   future,   including   new   data   ce ntres   and   the   workflow   management   system   used   by   contact   centres.   Inland   Revenue   remains   on   track   to   realise   the   benefits   committed   from   the   implementation   of   Stage   1.   These   are   improved   experiences   for   customers,   compliance   cost   reductions   for   small–medium   sized   businesses   and   administrative   savings   for   Inland   Revenue :    Customers   using   their   accounting   software   to   manage   their   GST   obligations   are   providing   positive   feedback   on   their   experience   an d   on   other   enhancements   to   Inland   Revenue’s   services.    Customers   perceive   that   the   level   of   effort   in   meeting   their   GST   obligations   has   reduced   since   2013.     Administrative   savings   are   being   achieved   as   customers   increasingly   self ‐ manage   and   use   digit al   channels.   The   diagram   below   shows   Inland   Re venue’s   current   progress   in   realising   the   benefits   committed   from   Stage   1.    Stage   1   benefit   realisation Target $43m

in   March   2018   found   that   the   benefit   realisation   framework   for   transformation   “...   continues   to   be   an   excellent   example   of   good   practice   across   government   in   New   Zealand,   Australia   and   the   UK” .   While   noting   that   there   is   always   room   for   residual   improvement,   they   note d   that   “...   the   outcom e s   and   benefits   management   framework   is   world   class...”     Changing   policy   and   legislative   settings   In   confidence   Page   9     Work   on   policy   and   legislative   settings   is   continuing.    Legislative   improvements   to   the   collection   and   use   of   PAYE   and   investment   income   information   are   currently   before   Parliament.                    

who   would   traditionally   res pond   to   policy   consultation,   Inland   Revenue   looked   at   what   could   be   done   differently   to   encourage   feedback   from   as   many   people   as   possible.   This   included   making   information   available   in   languages   other   than   English,   using   animations   to   simply   explain   the   proposals,   and   raising   awareness   amongst   th ose   without   internet   access   at   home.   As   many   social   policy   customers   are   not   native   English   speakers,   summary   information,   videos   and   a   short   survey   were   translated   into   nine   oth er   languages.   The   languages   were   Cantonese,   Hindi,   Khmer,   Korean,   Mandarin,   Samoan,   Tongan   and   Vietnamese.   Translations   also   included   Te   Reo   M ā ori   and   New   Zealand   sign   language.   The   langua ges   chosen   were   based   on   those   most   commonly   spoken   by   customers,   groups   with   low   levels   of   English   speakers,   and   which   of   those   langua ge   speakers   were   most   likely   to   receive   Working   for   Families,   child   support,   or   have   student   loans.   Animations   explaining   the   proposals   were   developed   and   published   on   the   Ma king   tax   simpler   website.   Written   transcripts   were   also   published   and   Deaf   Radio   created   a   sign   language   version   for   hear ing   impaired   audiences.   “Wobblers”   were   used   to   raise   awareness   amongst   people   without   internet   access   at   home.   They   were   placed   in   the   computer   area   of   public   libraries   so   people   could   check   out   the   online   c onsultation   forum   using   the   library   computers.   The   phot o   below   shows   one   of   the   wobblers   in   Miramar   Library,   in   Wellington.     To   ensure   that   people   were   aware   of   the   social   policy   proposals   and   that   submissions   were   representative   of   the   people   who   would   be   affected   by   them,   Inland   Revenue   met   face ‐ to ‐ face   with   a   variety   of   groups   around   the   country.   Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA Withheld under

  broad   stages   in   transformation   are   digital   services,   tax,   social   policy   and   a   final   wrap   up.   From   now   on   there   will   be   more   than   one   release   in   each   stage   so   that   the   amount   of   change   being   introduced   for   both   customers   and   Inland   Revenue   can   be   carefully   managed.     Transformation   has   moved   to   a   series   of   re leases   within   stages.   The   remaining   stages   of   transformation   will   be   implemented   in   a   series   of   rel eases   from   2018   to   2021.   The   release   plan   (please   refer   to   appendix   2)   is   Inland   Revenue’s   current   view   of   the   sequence   in   which   remaining   taxes   and   entitlements   will   be   moved   to   new   systems   and   processes.   It   was   endors ed   by   Inland   Revenue’s   Portfolio   Governance   Committee   (PGC)   on   24   Au gust   2017.   Moving   to   a   release   based   approach   means   the   four   stages   will   overlap.   Taxes   and   entitlements   will   be   moved   to   START   in   smaller   steps,   reducing   risk   and   business   and   customer   impacts.   At   the   same   time,   transformatio n   will   move   into   social   policy   products   (Stage   3)   earlier   than   planne d.   Working   for   Families   will   be   aligned   with   income   taxes.   This   will   minimise   the   difficulties   for   both   customers   and   Inland   Revenue   from   having   to   work   off   both   old   and   new   systems.   Major   releases   will   typically   occur   on   an   a nnual   cycle   in   each   of   the   next   four   years   to   align   with   the   beginni ng   of   the   tax   year.   Other   releases   will   be   te chnical   only,   i.e.   not   visible   to   customers   and   staff,   some   will   be   legislative   only,   some   will   implement   new   systems   and   processes,   some   will   provide   Inland   Revenue   staff   with   new   capabilities,   and   some   will   be   a   combination.   Stage   2   will   be   delivered   in   two   major   releases   ove r   2018   (release   2)   and   2019   (release   3).   Moving   th e   remaining   taxes   to   new   systems   and   processes   will   be   split   across   two   major   releases   in   2018   and   2019   to   minimise   the   impact   on   customers.   Proposed   improvements   to   how   PAYE   and   investment   income   information   are   collecte d,   and   the   implementation   of   the   automatic   exchange   of   information   (AEO I)   with   international   tax   treaty   partners   will   be   made   progressively,   beginning   from   release   2   in   April   2018.   Based   on   current   thinking,   the   first   release   in   Stage   3   –   Working   for   Families  ‐   will   be   included   in   the   April   2019   release.   Stages   2   and   3   will   run   conc urrentl y   for   a   period   given   the   strong   inter ‐ dependencies   between   them.   Calculation   of   Working   for   Families   tax   credits   is   highly   dependent   on   information   about   family   circumstances   and   family   income   information.   Customers   are   actively   involved   in   release   2   and   the   remaining   sta ges   of   transformation.      Inland   Revenue   recognised   the   nee d   for   better   design   input   from   tax   agents   in   particular,   so   agents   have   been   seconded   from   a   range   of   businesses,   from   the   big   four   through   to   smaller   firms.   Tax   agents   and   design   and   development   teams   working   together   on   a   daily   basis   has   hel ped   to   give   Inla n d   Revenue   a   better   understanding   of   what   works,   what   doesn’t,   and   why.   The   tax   agents   who   have   joined   transformation   are   co ‐ designing   certain   aspects   of   the   system   as   well   as   testing   it   to   see   if   it   works   as   expected.   A   similar   approach   will   be   ado pted   with   payroll   professionals.   This   will   help   to   ensu r e   that   businesses   and   their   representatives   can   interact   smoothly   with   government   to   meet   their   PAYE   filing   obligations   through   their   software.   Opportunities   for   customers,   including   tax   agents,   to   validate   the   new   services   being   introduced   in   release   2   are   being   provided   throughout   the   testing   process.     Inland   Revenue   has   adopted   a   more   collaborative   approach   to   design   based   on   the   lessons   learned   from   implementing   GST.    In   confidence   Page   11     Inland   Revenue   is   on   track   to   implement   release   2   in   April   2018.   Release   2   will   include:    Introducing   the   accounting   income   method   (AIM)   option   for   calculating   provisional   tax.    Implementing   the   automatic   exchange   of   information   with   international   tax   treaty   partners.    Enabling   employers   to   send   their   information   to   Inland   Revenue   on   pay day   if   they   choose   to   do   so. 5    Moving   withholding   taxes,   fringe   benefit   tax,   payroll   subsidy,   and   gaming   machine   duty   to   new   systems   and   processes.    Collecting   income   information   in   START   so   that   pre ‐ population   of   individuals’   information   can   begin.    FIRST   will   process   income   tax   returns   for   the   2017/18   tax   year   and   process   all   prior   period   returns   until   31   March   20 19.   Once   release   2   has   been   implemented   customers   will   be   able   to   choos e   a   pay ‐ as ‐ you ‐ go   option   for   paying   their   provisional   tax,   employers   can   choose   to   meet   their   PAYE   obligations   at   the   same   time   they’re   completing   their   payroll   processes,   and   it   will   be   quicker   and   easier                                                                      5   Subject   to   legislation.   for   customers   to   meet   more   of   their   obligations   with   more   on ‐ line   services   for   a   wider   range   of   taxes.   Release   3   in   April   2019   will   include:    Moving   all   income   tax   products   and   Working   for   Families   to   new   systems   and   processes.    Enabling   customers   to   enrol   digitally   for   products   and   services.    Enabling   pa yers   of   investment   income   to   send   detailed   recipient   informati on   to   Inland   Revenue   every   month,   or   the   months   in   which   income   is   paid,   if   they   choose   to   do   so. 6    Employers   being   required   to   send   their   PAYE   information   to   Inland   Revenue   on   payday. 7    More   businesses   will   be   required   to   file   electronically   following   the   reduction   in   the   electronic   filing   threshold. 8   Any   challenges   with   historical   income   tax   and   related   data   will   be   resolved   in   FIRST   before   being   migrated   to   START   on   1   April   2019.   The   2020/21   year   will   be   the   first   full   year   of   pre ‐ populated   information   for   PAYE                                                                      6   Ibid.   7   Ibid.   8   Ibid.   and   investment   income.   Once   release   3   has   been   implemented   employers   will   have   integrated   tax   and   business   processes   making   it   quicker   and   easier   for   them   to   meet   their   obligations,   and   all   customers   will   have   access   to   faster,   more   accurate   tax   information,   providing   near   real ‐ time   visibility   of   all   their   tax   obligations.   Customers   will   have   a   lot   more   certa inty   as   there   will   be   much   les s   chance   of   them   going   into   debt   and   any   refunds   will   be   paid   more   quickly.   Costs   and   benefits   are   in   line   with   expectations.   Costs   for   the   implementation   of   Stage   2   in   a   series   of   releases   over   2018   and   2019   are   within   the   fu nding   approved   by   Cabinet   in   November   2015 .   Stage   2,   once   complete   following   the   implementation   of   releases   2   and   3,   will   deliver   bot h   financial   and   non ‐ financial   benefits.   The   non ‐ financial   benefits   are:    Customer   experiences   will   improve   as   a   result   of   more   online   services,   more   integrated   tax   and   business   processes,   and   fast er   more   accurate   tax   information.    The   resilience   of   the   revenue   system   will   improve.   However,   co ‐ existence   between   the   old   and   new   systems   means   the   inherent   risk   profile   remains   high   until   transformation   is   complete.    Government   will   have   greater   agility   for   tax   products.   However   the   complex   inter ‐ relationships   between   income   and   so cial   policy   will   place   some   limits   on   agility.   Full   policy   agility   will   be   provided   once   transformatio n   is   complete.    In   confidence   Page   12     The   financial   benefits   are:    Administrative   savings   for   Inland   Revenue   resulting   from   being   a   smaller,   more   efficient   organisation.    Increases   in   assessed   Crown   revenue   as   a   result   of   improved   customer   compliance.   Inland   Revenue   will   have   a   greater   focus   on   helping   customers   get   it   right   from   the   start,   and   there   will   be   gre ater   integration   between   customers’   natural   business   systems   and   Inland   Reven ue’s   systems.   Opportunities   for   non ‐ compliance   will   reduce   as   Inland   Revenue   will   receive   core   accounting   transactions   through   accounting   software.    The   effort   required   for   businesses   to   meet   their   obligations   will   further   reduce.   Testing   for   release   2   is   well   underway.   Business   system   testing   beg an   in   July   2017   and   involves   Inland   Revenue   staff   testin g   the   functionality   within   START   and   how   it   interacts   with   other   systems.   This   phase   of   testing   is   progressing   well   and   tracking   to   plan,   and   will   continue   until   early   2018.   The   next   phase   of   testing   is   scaled   business   simulation   testing.   It   began   in   early   201 8   and   will   continue   up   until   go ‐ live   on   17   April   2018.   This   phase   practices   the   go ‐ live   step   by   step   including   the   migration   of   data,   and   processes   following   go ‐ live   such   as   return   filing.   Preparing   and   verifying   data   is   an   on ‐ going   activity   and   will   continue   right   up   un til   go ‐ live   on   17   April   2018.   To   date,   no   major   issues   with   customer   data   have   been   identified.   The   lessons   learned   from   Stage   1   have   informed   Inland   Revenue’s   approach   to   testing   for   release   2:    Opportunities   for   customers   to   validate   new   services   will   be   provided   throughout   the   testing   process.    Formal   arrangements   for   testing   ha ve   been   established   with   organisations   whose   systems   integrate   with   Inland   R evenue’s   systems.    Testing   is   being   increasingly   automated   for   external   customer   facing   services   and   services   used   by   Inland   Revenue’s   contact   centre.    Professional   testing   resources   are   working   directly   with   the   design   and   development   teams.    Management   of   de fects   has   been   enhanc e d   to   improve   the   detection,   testing   and   resolution   of   incidents.    There   is   a   larger   volume   of   testing   required   for   release   2   compared   to   implementing   GST.   The   testing   effort   is   approximately   four   times   as   great   in   terms   of   time   for   release   2,   and   the   number   of   scenarios   to   be   te sted   is   approximately   five   times   that   required   for   GST.   Custom er   exp eriences   will   improve   over   2018   and   2019,   complementary   to   the   major   releases.   Frequent   releases   of   solutions   and   enhancements   will   make   compliance   easier,   simpler   and   more   efficient   for   both   customers   and   Inland   Revenue.   While   there   is   a   particular   focus   on   improving   digital   experiences,   the   experiences   of   all   customers   will   be   enhanc ed   regardless   of   how   they   choose   to   interact   with   Inland   R evenue.   Work   is   underway   in   a   number   of   areas   to:    Reduce   the   time   and   effort   customers   spend   in   finding   the   right   information,   and   then   understanding   it.    Help   customers   understand   what   the y   need   to   do   to   meet   their   obligations   and   mak ing   it   easy   for   them   to   do   so.   Work   on   the   look   and   feel   and   integration   with   www.ird.govt.nz   is   progressing   for   a   digital   solution   to   the   “what’s   my   IRD   number”   customer   pain   point.    A   Business   Survival   Guide   has   been   developed   for   young   businesses.   In   September   and   October   2017,   just   under   100,000   customers   received   information   about   the   site.   Work   is   underway   with   the   Community   Compliance   team   who   provide   Inland   Revenue’s   face ‐ to ‐ face   services   in   the   community,   to   determin e   how   it   might   be   used   as   a   frontline   support   tool   in   the   futu re.   As   the   site   has   recently   been   launched,   customer   reaction   and   feedback   is   not   yet   available.         In   confidence   Page   13     Over   the   2018   and   2019   period,   customer   experiences   will   be   further   improved   as:    More   information   and   returns   will   be   able   to   be   filed   through   software   as   new   gateway   services   are   made   available.    Customers   will   more   easily   be   able   to   find   the   information   they   need   following   a   re ‐ design   of   Inla nd   Revenue’s   website.    It   will   be   easier   for   customers   to   talk   to   the   right   person   in   Inland   Revenue   and   have   their   query   resolved   first   time   as   a   result   of   improved   contact   centre   technology   and   the   implementation   of   a   new   organisation   design.    Regardless   of   how   they   contact   Inland   Revenue,   customers   wil l   have   their   queries   resolved   more   quickly   as   chan nels   will   be   bet ter   integrated.    Customers   will   receive   their   GST   refunds   more   quickly   as   Inland   Revenue   invests   in   analytical   tools   to   enable   improved   decision   making.    Work   continues   on   building   Inland   Revenue’s   analytical   and   knowledge   management   capabilities.   Improved   analytical   capabilities   will   enable   Inland   Revenue   to   better   use   th e   information   and   data   it   has   about   customers   to   deliver   more   timely   and   targeted   services.   Releases   of   analytical   capabilities   can   be   made   independently   of,   however   are   complementary   to,   major   releases   of   the   core   tax   and   social   policy   system.   One   key   component   of   being   intelligence ‐ led   is   having   a   fit ‐ for ‐ purpose   analytics   te chnology   platform   –   one   that   will   help   Inland   Revenue   make   sense   of   big,   disparate   data   sets   and   view   customers   from   many   perspectives.   A   proof   of   concept   for   an   advanced   analytics   platform   was   completed   in   December   2017   to   better   inform   and   de ‐ risk   future   investment.    The   proof   of   con cept   confirmed   there   is   value   in   such   an   investment,   and   in   December   2017   Inland   Revenue   began   the   procurement   process   for   an   advanced   analytics   platform.   Implementation   of   a   new   analytics   platform   is   expected   to   be   complete   by   the   end   of   2018.   This   will   give   Inland   Revenue   a   better   view   of   a   customer’s   rel ationships   or   network,   their   obligations,   entitlements   and   interactions.   Decision   ma king   will   be   enhanced,   as   Inland   Revenue   will   better   understand   why   customers   are   calling   and   what   is   needed   to   help   them   get   things   right   from   the   start.     By   the   end   of   2019,   Inland   Revenue   intends   to   integrate   the   analyti cs   platform   with   START.   This   will   provide   Inland   Revenu e   with   b etter   insights   into   customer   behaviour   and   compliance,   enabling   more   targeted   activities   where   compliance   needs   addressing.   Where   customers   are   consistently   compliant,   any   on ‐ going   interactions   with   Inland   Revenue   will   be   increasingly   straightforward   and   automated.   A   pilot   of   an   enterprise   content   management   solution   bega n   in   October   2017   wi th   Inland   Revenue’s   legal   functions.   This   will   provide   staff   with   multiple   ways   to   search   for   and   access   information   and   help   to   ensure   customers   receive   consistent   and   timely   advice.   A   phased   roll   out   to   all   of   Inland   Revenue   will   begin   in   2018.   This   will   make   customer   and   business   infor mation   more   readily   accessible   to   Inland   Re venue   staff,   enabling   them   to   provide   more   consistent   customer   service.   Major   releases   will   occur   annually   until   2021.   Releases   4   (2020)   and   5   (2021)   will   move   the   remaining   social   policies   Inland   Revenue   administers   to   new   systems   and   processes.   The   current   sequencing   has   KiwiSaver   and   Stud ent   Loans   being   implemented   in   2020,   and   Child   Support   bei ng   implemented   in   2021.   Alternative   sequencing   is   possible.   As   major   releases   are   implemented,   customers   will   increasingly   be   able   to   manage   their   taxes   and   entitlements   themselves   as   they’ll   be   able   to   do   more   and   more   using   online   services.           The   release   sequence   may   change   as   Inland   Revenue   becomes   more   experienced   in   deploying   the   new   system,   as   new   opportunities   are   identified,   and   as   government   priorities   change.   The   current   release   plan   is   Inland   Revenue’s   view   of   the   sequence   that   best   balances   delivery   risk,   cost   to   deliver,   and   impacts   on   customers   at   this   point   in   time.    In   confidence   Page   14     The   release   plan   will   be   regularly   reviewed   to   ensure   the   optimal   plan   is   being   delivered.   This   will   take   into   consideration:    government   priorities    customer   experience   and   benefits    co ‐ existence    business   needs.    Inland   Revenue   is   also   continuing   to   explore   options   to   accelerate   the   modernisation   of   its   enterprise   support   systems   (E SS).   In   January   2018,   Inla n d   Revenue   released   an   expression   of   interest   to   the   market   for   ESS.    Transformation   is   the   key   vehicle   for   delivering   Inland   Revenue’s   contribution   to   wider   government   outcomes.   Transformation   will   make   a   major   contribution   to   making   it   easier   for   New   Zealanders   to   interact   with   government.   As   a   result   of   th e   changes   being   made   businesses   will   be   able   to   spend   more   time   on   running   their   businesses   with   tax   as   a   secondary   consideration.   Both   businesses   and   individuals   will   have   greater   confidence   that   they   are   paying   and   receiving   the   right   amounts,   with   the   minimum   of   effort   required   on   their   part.   Inland   Revenue   is   an   act ive   contribut o r   to   cross ‐ government   initiatives,   most   recently   being   involved   in   the   development   of   Te   Hokianga  ā  Wairua   –   end   of   life   services.      Inland   Revenue   is   moving   to   a   more   open   approach   to   information ‐ sharing.   Protecting   taxpayers’   confidentiality   and   privacy   is   still   vital.   However   Inland   Revenue   can   make   life   easier   for   customer s,   support   “tell   government   only   once”,   help   protec t   peo ple   from   crime,   and   become   a   more   intelligence ‐ led   organisation   by   sharing   information   across   government.   Work   with   other   agencies   continues   to   ensure   that   existing   information   sharing   arrangements   continue   to   operate   following   go ‐ live   of   release   2   in   April   2018.     Supporting   customers   to   adapt   to   release   2   changes   In   confidence   Page   15     Release   2   has   implications   predominantly   for   business   customers,   particularly   employers,   tax   agents,   bookkeepers,   payroll   intermediaries,   software   developers,   and   financial   institutions.   The   release   plan   delivers   changes   in   smaller   steps   for   customers.   Compared   to   GST,   the   significantly   larger   scope   and   complexity   of   tax   types   and   proposed   legislative   changes   for   release   2,   means   there   are   much   wider   implications   for   customers.   Reportin g   requirements   will   increase.   Emp l oyers   will   be   required   to   provide   PAYE   information   to   Inland   Revenue   on   payday,   on   a   voluntary   basis   as   a   first   step. 9   Financial   institutions   will   also   be   required   to   report   more   information   about   non ‐ residents.   Implementing   more   products   in   START   will   require   more   customers   to   work   between   the   old   and   new   systems.    Building   on   the   successes   and   lessons   learnt   from   Stage   1,   Inland   Revenue   is   committed   to   supporting   customers   to   prepare   for   the   chan ges   earlier   by   providing   them   with   relevant   information   in   a   timely   manner.    Existing   chann els   that   achieved   good   awareness   will   be   used   again   for   release   2   to   help   customers   understand   the   changes.   New   approaches   will   be   introduced   to   help   target   groups   who   may   need   more   support.   Inland   Revenue   will   provide   information   to   other   grou ps   such   as   industry   associations,   service   providers   and   tax                                                                       9   Subject   to   legislation.   professional   bodies   to   help   reach   a   wider   audience.   These   advocacy/industry   groups   will   play   an   important   change   leadership   role   in   their   respective   industries.   The   change   approach   for   all   groups   of   customers   is   twofold:    Getting   ready   for   the   changes   being   introduced   in   release   2   (from   now   until   March   2018).    Encouraging   adoption   of   ne w   services   (from   now   and   also   from   April   2018   onward s ).   Communications   and   engagement   will   vary   by   customer   group   depending   on   their   needs.    Business   customers,   tax   intermediaries,   and   software   developers   will   experience   the   most   change.   Release   2   will   implement   legislation,   the   myIR   service,   and   how   these   customer   groups   interact   with   Inland   Revenue.   There   will   be   an   increased   ne ed   for   these   customers   to   work   across   two   systems.   Busines s   customers   The   key   changes   for   business   customers   in   release   2   are:    Proposed   changes   to   legislation   mean   PAYE   information   will   need   to   be   provided   to   Inland   Revenue   every   payday   –   businesses   can   choose   to   do   so   from   Ap ril   2018   and   must   do   so   from   Apr il   2019. 10    Larger   businesses   with   in ‐ house   IT   systems   will   need   to   start   thinking   about   changes   to   their   customised   software   as,   under   current   proposals,   PAYE   information   will   need   to   be   reported   to   Inland   Revenue   every   payday   from   April   2019.    An   enhanced   myIR   service   will   enable   businesses   to   correct   payroll   errors   themselves   once   th ey   have   adopted   payday   filing,   and   also   to   manage   withholding   taxes,   gaming   mac hine   duty,   and   fringe   benefit   tax.    The   introduction   of   the   accounting   income   method   option   for   calculating   provisional   tax.   In   the   lead   up   to   the   go ‐ live   of   release   2   in   April   2018,   Inland   Revenue   will   work   directly   with   the   businesses   that   nee d   to   make   the   most   changes.   This   will   include   working   closel y   with   large   enterprises   with   customised   payroll   systems   including   government   agencies,   and   communicating   directly   with   businesses   still   filing   on   paper.   In   addition,   Inland   Revenue   will:    Leverage   established   relationships   with   customers   through   existing   account   management   arrangements    Work   with   in dustry   association   groups,   software   developers   and   tax   agents   to   provide   content   an d   information   for   their   members   and   clients.   Inland   Revenue   recognises   that   businesses   rely   on   others   to   provide   advice   and   support.                                                                      10   Ibid    In   confidence   Page   16      Increase   the   visits   made   to   businesses   by   the   Community   Compliance   team.    Communicate   directly   with   businesses   about   changes   they   need   to   be   aware   of   –   this   will   be   targeted   to   their   situation   and   needs.    Increase   the   use   of   social   media,   such   as   making   videos   available   on   YouTube.   Prior   to   go ‐ live,   opport unities   will   be   provided   for   customers   to   validate   the   new   services   being   introduced   in   release   2.   Government   a gencies   who   share   information   with   Inland   Revenue   will   have   early   visibility   of   specifications   and   test   plans   to   ensure   that   existing   information   shares   continue   to   work   effectively   after   go ‐ live.   Financial   institutions   From   1   July   20 17,   financial   institutions   have   been   required   to   identify   accounts   held   by   non ‐ residents,   collect   infor mation,   and   report   this   information   annually   to   Inland   Revenue.   The   information   collected   includes   identity   details,   account   balance,   and   income   and   payment   information.   From   April   2018,   financial   institutions   will   have   three   different   options   for   submitting   their   information   to   Inland   R evenue   (based   on   volume).   They   will   need   to   provide   their   inf ormation   to   Inland   Revenue   by   30   June   2018.   The   technology   development   is   progressing   well   and   testing   is   underway.   Financial   institutions   are   also   impacted   by   a   number   of   other   changes   being   introduced   over   2018   and   2019.   These   include   the   investment   income   and   employment   income   proposals,   and   cha nges   to   resident   withholding   tax   and   non ‐ resident   withholding   tax.   Inland   Revenue   is   working   closely   with   financial   institutions,   the   major   banks   in   particular,   to   ensure   these   are   implemented   as   smoothly   as   possible.   Software   developers   Accounting   and   payroll   software   developers   will   need   to   make   cha nges   to   their   products   to   accommodate   the   introduction   of   the   account i ng   income   method   (AIM)   option   for   calculating   provisional   tax   as   well   as   the   move   to   payday   reporting 11 .      To   ensure   changes   are   introduced   smoothly,   Inland   Revenue   will   provide   software   developers   with   a   fully   integrated   test   environment   to   enable   new   services   to   be   tested   end ‐ to ‐ end   before   release.   From   now   until   go ‐ live   of   release   2,   Inland   Revenue   will   meet   frequently   with   key   developers,   continue   workshops   to   discuss   ch anges   and   issues   as   they   arise,                                                                      11   Subject   to   legislation.   and   provide   content   for   them   to   communicate   to   their   customers.   Following   go ‐ live,   Inland   Revenue   will   work   with   software   developers   to   drive   uptake   of   filing   through   software.    Further   work   with   software   developers   is   required   to   develop   PAYE   filing   through   software   and   to   develop   alternative   solutions   to   providing   tax   agents   with   transactional   data.   Tax   agents,   payroll   inte rmediaries   and   book keepers   will   need   to   make   changes   to   how   they   operate.   These   groups   are   key   influencers   with   their   clients   regarding   uptake   of   digital   services,   use   of   software   and   the   adoption   of   the   accounting   income   method   option   for   calculating   provisional   tax.   The   release   2   changes   for   ta x   agents,   intermediaries   and   bookkeep ers   in clude:    The   introduction   of   payday   reporting,   initially   on   a   voluntary   basis. 12    The   introduction   of   the   accounting   income   method   option   for   calculating   provisional   tax.    Improved   functionality   and   some   navigation   changes   for   myIR   for   PAYE,   withholding   taxes,   gaming   machine   duty,   fringe   benefit   tax,   and   provisional   tax   (including   the   accounting   income   method   option).    There   will   be   continued   impacts   resulting   from   working   in   two   systems   for   tr ansf e rs   until   April   2019.   This   is   an   issue   for   tax   agents   in   particular.                                                                      12   Ibid.   Software   developers   have   a   critical   role   to   play   in   communicating   change   and   providing   education/training   to   their   customers.    In   confidence   Page   17     In   the   lead   up   to   go ‐ live   of   release   2   in   April   2018,   Inland   Revenue   is   continuing   to:    attend   industry   conferences,   forums   and   road ‐ shows    meet   regularly   with   professional   bodies    hold   webinars,   and    communicate   through   existing   newsletters   such   as   Agents   Answers.   Since   early   2018,   Inland   Revenue   has:    Communicat ed   directly   with   all   tax   agents,   intermediaries   and   boo kkeepers.    Increased   the   use   of   social   media,   such   as   making   videos   available   on   YouTube.    Held   seminars   regionally   to   ensure   tax   agents,   intermediaries   and   bookkeepers   are   aware   of   what   they   need   to   do   on   day   1.   Manuals,   guides,   “how   to”   videos   and   system   demos   will   be   devel oped   and   made   available   during   these   sem i nars.    Increased   the   number   of   on ‐ site   visits   made   by   the   Community   Compliance   team.      Tax   agents   There   is   an   approximate   60/40   split   between   tax   agents   who   are   members   of   professional   bodies,   such   as   Chartered   Accountants   Australia   and   New   Zealand   (CA   ANZ) ,   and   those   who   are   not.   Agents   who   are   members   of   professional   bodies   will   receive   communications   from   both   Inland   Revenue   and   from   the   body   they   are   a   member   of.   Inland   Revenue   will   provide   content   to   tax   professional   bodies   to   communicate   to   their   members.   This   will   be   co ‐ ordinated   so   th at   communications   are   comp lementary.   Tax   agents   who   are   not   represented   by   a   professional   body   will   have   the   opportunity   to   have   more   one ‐ on ‐ one   contact   (as   appropriate)   with   Inland   Revenue’s   Community   Compliance   team   and   will   receive   communications   from   software   developers.   Further   work   with   tax   agents   is   required   to   develop   alternative   sol utions   for   how   they   access   transactional   data,   and   with   intermediaries   on   gatewa y   services.   Other   customers   are   less   affected   however   they   will   still   need   to   be   aware   of   the   changes   being   made.   For   the   majority   of   customers,   there   will   be   no   major   changes   in   2018.   Customers   will   continue   to   use   myIR   for   online   services   and   th ere   will   be   more   time   for   them   to   become   familiar   with   the   new   system   and   prepare   for   fut ure   releases.   Now   that   consultation   has   concluded,   proposals   to   make   individuals’   tax   obligations   simpler   and   more   certain   will   be   finalised   for   Ministers   to   consider.   Engagement   with   key   stakeholders   and   in dustry   groups   has   focussed   on   the   release   pla n   in   recent   months.   Tax   agent   professional   bodies   Inland   Revenue   continues   to   work   closely   with   tax   professional   bodies   including   CA   ANZ,   the   Accountants   and   Tax   Agents   Institute   of   New   Zealand   (ATAINZ)   and   the   New   Zealand   Bookkeepers’   Association.   The   key   focus   in   recent   months   has   been   en surin g   thes e   groups   understand   the   release   plan   and   what   it   means   for   them   and   their   members.   Regular   meetings   are   underway   with   CA   ANZ   members   in   various   locations   around   the   country   to   ensure   they   understand   what   changes   are   being   introduced   when.    Inland   Revenue   continues   to   attend   conferences,   having   had   representatives   at   both   the   CA   ANZ   fraud   confere nce   and   the   Bookkeepers’   Association   annu al   conference.   In   addition,   the   department   attended   the   ATAINZ   board   meeting.   The   department   also   presented   at   the   New   Zealand   Payroll   Practitioners   Association’s   (NZPPA)   annual   summit.   Members   of   both   CA   ANZ   and   ATAINZ   have   had   the   opportunity   discuss   the   improvements   to   GST   online   services,   the   ac counting   income   method   option   for   calculating   pr ovisional   tax,   and   payday   reporting.   Submissions   on   the   proposals   for   Modernising   the   Tax   Administration   Act   Discussion   Document   have   been   discussed   with   the   CA   ANZ   Tax   Advisory   Group.     Focus   groups   have   been   established   to   assess   and   provide   advice   about   the   readiness   of   tax   agents,   payroll   intermediaries   and   bookkeepers   for   go ‐ live.    In   confidence   Page   18     Business   and   industry   groups   Inland   Revenue   continues   to   be   actively   involved   in   the   MYOB   Employer   Essentials   series,   MBIE   small   business   road ‐ shows,   and   Tax   Management   New   Zealand   road ‐ shows.   MBIE’s   small   business   road ‐ shows   have   also   provided   the   opportunity   to   engage   with   M ā ori   businesses   in   Kaitaia   and   Whakatane,   and   Chinese   businesses   in   Au ckland,   to   better   understand   their   difficulties   with   estimating   provisional   tax   and   amending   returns   in   particular.   The   E   RERE!   –   The   Future   of   the   M ā ori   Economy   –   conference   in   Rotorua,   jointly   hosted   by   MBIE   and   Te   Puni   K ō kiri,   provided   another   opportunity   to   discuss   business   tax.    Meetings   with   software   providers   and   pa yroll   developers   are   continuing   to   ensure   that   the   changes   to   payday   reporting 13   and   the   introduction   of   the   accounting   income   method   option   for   calculating   provisional   tax   are   successfully   implemented.   A   key   focus   in   recent   months   has   been   working   with   them   to   ensure   they   understand   the   release   plan.                                                                      13   Subject   to   legislation   Inland   Revenue   has   made   good   progress   on   the   development   of   options   for   making   the   accounting   income   method   concept   available   to   larger   businesses.   Phil   O’Reilly,   formerly   Business   NZ,   has   worked   with   Inland   Revenue,   to   help   test   the   issues   identified   with   relevant   medium ‐ sized   businesses.   A   two ‐ week   series   of   workshops   was   held   in   Christchur ch,   Dunedi n,   Tauranga ,   Wellington   and   Auckland   in   late   June   to   early   July   2017   with   key   stakeholders   and   their   medium ‐ sized   business   clients.    Following   this   successful   series   of   workshops,   Inland   Revenue   held   a   Service   Innovation   Lab   to   look   at   possible   solutions   to   the   problems   that   have   been   defined.   Financial   sector   The   departm ent   continues   to   work   with   financial   industr y   representatives   to   help   ready   them   for   the   changes   being   introduced.   A   lot   of   work   has   already   been   done   to   ready   financial   institutions   for   the   automatic   exchange   of   information   with   international   tax   treaty   partners,   and   this   will   continue   in   the   lead   up   to   the   first   reporting   deadline   on   30   J une   2018.    Around   150   people   att ended   financial   industry   information   sessions   in   early   June   2017   to   help   prepare   institutions   for   the   account   holders’   due   diligence   procedures   that   took   effect   from   1   July   2017.   The   sessions   took   place   in   Wellington,   Auckland   and   via   teleconference.   Guidance   material   for   financial   institutions   was   published   in   June   20 17,   and   brochures   were   also   produ ced   and   distributed   to   industry   associations.   A   list   of   participating   jurisdictions   was   published   in   the   Gazette   at   the   end   of   June   2017   and   in   the   July   2017   edition   of   the   Tax   Information   Bulletin.    A   targeted   public   awareness   campaign   ‘Sharing   information   to   combat   glo bal   tax   evasion’   ran   from   1   June   until   14   July   20 17.   The   campaign   highlighted   the   responsibilities   of   account   holders   and   how   the   information   collected   will   be   used.   The   campaign   attracted   approximately   10,000   visits   to   its   landing   page.   Facebook   and   LinkedIn   advertisements   also   provided   good   exposure   with   approximately   3   million   impressions   (the   number   of   tim es   the   post   was   displayed),   and   more   than   4,000   clicks.   A   video   explaining   the   a utomatic   exchange   of   information   was   viewed   about   1,000   times   in   the   English   language   version   and   approximately   9,000   times   in   the   Chinese   version.   Engagement   with   small ‐ to ‐ medium ‐ sized   financial   institutions,   large   financial   institutions,   and   industr y   associations   continues.   Inland   Revenue   is   actively   seeking   their   inv olvement   to   provide   feedback   on   both   the   technology   solution   and   the   legislative   guidance   tools   being   developed.    In   confidence   Page   19     The   major   banks   and   Inland   Revenue   are   also   exploring   the   opportunities   arising   from   a   more   digital   environment.   Several   workshops   have   been   held   with   the   major   banks   to   discuss   automation   opportunities   for   requests   for   information   under   section   17   of   the   Tax   Administration   Act,   and   requests   for   deduction   of   tax   from   payments   under   section   1 57.   Government      This   means   working   collaboratively   with   other   government   agencies   to   en sure:    They   are   well   informed   about   the   changes   being   introduced.    They   are   on   track   to   meet   legislative   requirements   such   as   payday   reporting. 14    The   relationships   they   have   with   their   customers   can   be   leveraged   so   that   customers   receive   messages   from   sources   they   are   familiar   with   and   trust.   There   has   been   a   particular   focus   in   recent   months   on   meeting   regularly   with   the   agencies   most   critical   to   the   changes   being   made.   These   are   the   Accident   Compensation   Corporation   (ACC ),   the   Ministry   of   Educ ation /Education   Payroll   Limited,   the   Ministry   of   Social   Development   (MSD)   and   Statistics   New   Zealand.                                                                      14   Subject   to   legislation   Inland   Revenue   and   Education   Payroll   Limited   meet   regularly   to   discuss   PAYE   changes.   On ‐ going   meetings   are   taking   place   with   MSD   to   discuss   how   the   benefit   management   and   revenue   systems   can   work   together   to   ensure   people   are   paid   their   correct   entitlements.   Statistics   New   Zealand   and   Inland   Revenue   are   working   together   to   ensure   existing   inform ation   sharing   arrangements   continue   to   wo rk   effectively   following   the   go ‐ live   of   release   2.   Information   sharing   arrangements   have   also   been   discussed   with   the   Treasury   and   the   Ministry   of   Justice.   In   addition,   regular   meetings   continue   with   MSD   and   ACC   to   align   transformation   programmes.   At   this   stage,   there   is   no   cause   for   con cern   about   the   readiness   of   any   these   agencies   for   release   2   in   April   2018.   Inland   Revenue   will   contin ue   to   work   alongside   ACC,   MSD,   Education   Payroll   Limited,   and   Statistics   New   Zealand   to   ensure   that   any   issues   are   highlighted   and   dealt   with   early.   Communications   and   marketing   activity   is   raising   awareness   of   the   Acco unting   Income   Method.   Communicatio n s   and   marketing   activity   is   continuing   to   raise   awareness   of   AIM.    Five   AIM   webinars   were   run   in   late   2017,   listened   to   by   around   3,500   people,   and   a   further   three   webinars   were   held   in   February   and   March   2018,   one   for   businesses   and   two   for   tax   agents.   Inland   Revenue   also   co ‐ presente d   at   two   webinars   hosted   by   Xero   in   earl y   February   2018   for   their   tax   agents.    General   information   about   AIM   was   published   on   Inland   Revenue’s   website   in   late   September   2017,   and   has   received   about   9,500   unique   views.   Information   is   being   provided   to   small   business   publications   and   newsletters,   and   industry   groups   are   be ing   asked   to   promote   AIM   through   social   media   and   on   their   own   websites.    The   focus   of   communications   is   to   continue   to   provide   information   to   tax   agents,   particularly   to   emphasise   that   AIM   is   easy   and   not   complicated.   There   is   also   a   focus   on   raising   awareness   among   small   businesses,   encouraging   them   to   seek   more   information   from   their   tax   age nt,   if   they   have   one.   Marketin g   AIM   to   customers   began   in   late   February   2018.    Around   250   seminars   will   be   held   around   New   Zealand   to   update   tax   agents   and   businesses   on   the   changes   happening   in   April   2018,   including   AIM.   About   16,000   customers   in   total   are   expe cted   to   attend   one   of   the   seminars,   which   began   in   F ebruary   and   run   until   early   May   2018.   Plans   for   readying   staff   to   support   customers   with   release   2   changes   are   well   in   hand.   Inland   Revenue   people   will   need   to   be   ready   to   support   customers   to   adapt   to   the   changes   being   introduced   in   release   2.   There   will   be   a   strong   focus   on   providing   educ ation   and   information,   either   proactively   through   the   community   compliance   and   acco unt   management   teams   or   reactively   through   cu stomer   contacts.   Inland   Revenue   is   working   across   the   public   sector   to   ensure   that   New   Zealanders   continue   to   receive   the   services   they   do   today,   following   the   changes   being   introduced   by   transformation.    In   confidence   Page   20     A   total   of   4,700   people   will   experience   the   release   2   changes   and   for   many   this   will   mean   a   change   to   some   part   of   their   jobs:    Many   people   will   need   to   work   across   both   FIRST   and   START.     More   than   700   people   will   use   START   for   the   first   time.    A   large   portio n   of   employer   information   work   will   move   into   START.   This   is   a   core   information   source   for   most   tax   types.   Making   amendments   and   resolving   errors   will   require   working   across   two   systems.    The   look   and   feel   and   navigation   for   employer   information   in   START   is   very   different   to   FIRST   and   will   take   time   to   learn.    There   will   be   ch anges   to   how   cases   are   managed.    There   will   be   new   workflow   and   security   permissions   in   START   based   on   the   new   roles   that   are   part   of   the   new   customer   facing   organisation   groups   and   the   associated   new   delegations.     People   have   been   segmented   into   four   groups   based   on   the   level   of   change   they   will   experience:    Individuals   and   groups   who   could   not   continue   to   work   if   they   were   not   ready   for   go ‐ live   (group   A).    Individuals   whose   work   would   be   disrupted   if   they   were   not   ready   for   go ‐ live   (group   B).    Individuals   whose   work   coul d   be   disrupted   if   they   were   not   ready   for   go ‐ live   (grou p   C) .    All   other   non ‐ customer   facing   people   (group   D).   To   ready   people   for   release   2,   Inland   Revenue   will:   1. Deliver   training   –   on ‐ line,   on ‐ the ‐ job   and   classroom   training:   the   latter   will   be   delivered   close   to   go ‐ live.   2. Put   in   place   us er   support  ‐  on ‐ line   help.    3. Introduce   key   users  ‐  to   embed   the   changes.   4. Tailor   communications.   5. Undertake   change   readiness   assessments.   6. Provide   early   life   support  ‐  help   following   go ‐ live.   This   approach   builds   on   the   lessons   learned   from   Stage   1.   The   key   adaptations   are   the   introductio n   of   key   users,   providing   more   time   for   informal   and   on ‐ the ‐ jo b   learning,   focusing   on   the   big   things   people   need   to   know   well   for   day   1   and   week   1,   and   providing   more   time   to   practice   with   START   before   go ‐ live.   Each   group   will   require   different   levels   of   training,   communication   an d   support.   At   the   same   time,   many,   if   not   all,   of   the   4,70 0   people   who   will   experience   release   2   changes   will   be   moving   into   a   new   organisation   design.   People   will   be   moving   into   new   roles   and   teams   in   a   new   structure,   and   may   be   responding   to   increased   customer   contacts   at   the   same   time.    Moving   a   large   num ber   of   people   into   new   structures,   teams   and   roles,   at   the   same   time   as   ch anging   the   processes   and   systems   they   use   to   do   their   work,   is   not   without   its   challenges.   This   will   continue   to   consume   significant   amounts   of   management   attention.    Implementing   a   new   organisational   design   for   Inland   Revenue   In   confidence   Page   21     Inland   Revenue   implemented   the   first   wave   of   its   new   organisation   design   in   February   2018.   This   is   focused   mostly   on   customer   facing   areas   and   is   an   important   step   in   becoming   more   agile   and   intelligence ‐ led,   and   built   around   the   needs   of   customers.   Those   delivering   customer   services   will   be   enabled   and   empowered   to   make   more   decisions   and   resolve   customers’   iss ues   more   quickly.   Five   key   shifts   underpi n   the   new   organisati on   design   as   shown   below.     A   new   organisation   design   will   enable   people   at   Inland   Revenue   to:    Apply   their   skills   more   broadly   to   a   range   of   work.    Work   together   more   closely.    Provide   better   services   to   customers.    Make   the   most   of   a   ne w   and   evolving   working   environment,   supported   by   technology.     In   July   2017,   the   first   steps   towards   a   new   organisation   design   were   confirmed.   In   May   2017,   Inland   Revenue   consulted   with   all   staff   on   the   proposed   design   for   three   new   organisation   groups   and   the   propo sed   process   for   moving   people   into   roles   within   these   gr oups.   The   final   design   was   confirmed   in   July   2017,   with   changes   made   based   on   the   feedback   received.   Three   new   groups   were   implemented   from   12   February   2018:    Customer   and   Compliance   Services   –   Individuals,   Customer   and   Compliance   Services   –   Businesses    Information   and   Intelligence   Services.   Selection   processes   for   senior   leaders,   team   leads,   specialists   and   business   support   roles   in   these   grou ps   were   completed   by   Decemb er   20 17.   Staff   in   customer   facing   roles   received   an   offer   to   appoint   or   confirmation   to   a   role   in   October   2017.   Changes   are   being   made   to   Inland   Revenue’s   working   environment   to   support   the   new   organisa tion   design.   To   support   the   new   or ganisation   design   and   the   implementation   of   release   2,   how   Inland   Revenue   works   will   change:    A   new   decision   making   model   and   broader   delegations   will   be   introduced   so   people   are   clear   about   what   decisions   they   can   make   and   how   to   get   help   if   th ey   need   it.    New   internal   organisation   measures   will   be   developed   that   show   the   impact   of   the   chang es   being   made.    Workflows   will   be   configured   to   new   roles   so   that   people   get   work   relevant   to   their   customer   segment,   skills   and   abilities.    Programmes   will   be   developed   for   new   leaders   and   tailored,   on ‐ go ing   support   provided   for   leaders   at   all   levels.    Performance,   recognition   and   pay   approaches   will   be   redesigned.   New   delegations,   combined   with   broader   roles,   means   that   customers   will   have   their   queries   responded   to   more   quickly   and   will   be   able   to   talk   to   one   person   to   get   more   of   their   queries   resolved.   Inland   Revenue   will   coac h   and   train   people   to   be   able   to   pr ovide   better   service   to   customers.   Inland   Revenue   is   investing   in   its   people   to   grow   their   capabilities.   The   new,   broad   roles   focus   on   the   outcomes   that   need   to   be   achieved   and   the   capabilities   required   for   a   role.   Capabilities   are   a   person’ s   unique   mix   of   skills,   knowledge,   experience   and   attitudes.   Inland   Revenu e   has   identified   12   people   capabilities   that   describe   what   is   important   for   the   future,   transformed   organisation.   They   are:    business   acumen   and   partnering    change   management    complex   compliance   management    customer   advisory    In   confidence   Page   22      data,   analytics   and   insight    design   and   integration    digital   literacy    information   and   knowledge   management    leadership    policy   quality   and   agility    quality   decision   making,   and     workforce   management.   Help   will   be   provided   so   that   people   develop   the   skills   and   capabilities   they   need   now   and   in   the   future.   Sup ported   by   their   leader,   people   will   grow   and   build   their   capabilities   over   time,   mostly   as   they   gain   experience   in   their   role.   A   range   of   learning   opport unities   will   be   available:    On   the   job   –   for   example   through   taking   on   new   things,   trying   new   ways   of   working,   working   in   a   project   team,   acting   in   a   hig her   level   role,   reviewing   how   something   went   and   work i ng   out   what   could   be   done    differently   next   time.    Self ‐ directed   learning   –   for   example   having   a   coach   or   mentor,   buddying   up   with   someone   or   looking   at   information   online.    Training   –   for   example   through   face ‐ to ‐ face   courses ,   e ‐ learning,   workshops   and   w ebinars.   The   most   significant   part   of   people’s   learning   and   development   will   be   on   the   job.   Inland   Revenue   will   provide   tools   to   support   people   to   do   that,   and   has   already   made   resources   available   to   give   people   more   information   about   the   capabilities   and   how   they   can   be   developed.     Furthe r   change   will   occur   in   2019.   Once   tra nsformation   is   complete,   Inland   Revenue   will   be   a   smaller,   different   and   more   efficient   organisation.   The   overall   workforce   is   expected   to   reduce   by   25–30%,   although   total   workforce   numbers   are   not   expected   to   change   significantly   until   2019/20.   Implementing   a   new   organisation   design   will   enable   delivery   of   the   administrative   savings   committed   to   as   part   of   Inland   Revenue   fu nding   contributio n   towards   transformation.   The   changes   being   introduced   by   transformation   will   mean   that   Inland   Revenue   will   need   fewer   people   in   the   future.    Customers   will   be   easily   able   to   get   their   tax   and   social   policy   payments   right   first   time,   avoid   erro rs   and   have   a   clear   view   of   what   they’ve   paid   and   what   they   ow e   during   the   year.   They’ll   spend   far   less   time   and   effort   ensuring   they   meet   their   obligations   and   receive   their   correct   social   policy   entitlements,   as   tax   will   be   correctly   withheld   and   assistance   provided   at   the   time   it   is   needed.     As   much   as   possible,   any   re ductions   in   the   numbers   of   people   workin g   in   partic ular   roles   will   be   managed   through   attrition   and   flexible   workforce   arrangements.    Since   mid ‐ 2016,   Inland   Revenue   has   adopted   a   deliberate   approach   of   filling   the   majority   of   vacancies   with   fixed ‐ term   employees.   As   at   31   December   2017,   the   departme nt   had   approximately   560   people   on   fixed   term   agreements   representing   around   10%   of   the   total   workforce.   The   conclusion   of   fixed ‐ term   arrangements   will   contribute   significantly   to   the   future   reduction   in   workforce.   If   there   is   a   need   to   reduce   the   number   of   people   in   particular   roles,   Inland   Revenue   will   look   at   optio ns   for   doing   that   and   will   discuss   them   with   staff   and   th e   unions   as   appropriate.   Inland   Revenue   continues   to   work   with   the   unions   to   implement   the   new   organisation   design,   although   this   is   not   without   its   challenges.   During   the   change   process,   the   Public   Service   Association   (PSA)   initiated   legal   proceedings   regarding   aspects   of   the   process   for   moving   peo ple   into   new   roles.   A   ruling   by   the   Employment   Court   on   21   De cember   2017,   the   Employment   Court   resolved   some   aspects   of   the   process.   In   January   2018,   Inland   Revenue   and   the   PSA   had   good   discussions   about   the   process   for   and   concerns   of   the   members   the   PSA   represent,   and   reached   agreement   on   the   way   forwa rd.   The   agre eme nt   includes   commitments   about   the   relationship   generally   as   well   as   a   specific   way    In   confidence   Page   23     forward   in   support   of   implementing   the   three   new   organisation   groups.   A   further   hearing   in   the   Employment   Court   is   scheduled   for   14 ‐ 28   May   2018   regarding   aspects   of   the   selection   process   for   some   roles.   As   a   result   of   the   PSA   challenge,   the   selection   process   for   these   roles   was   amended   so   that   the   th ree   new   groups   could   be   established   as   planned   on   12   February   2018 .   However,   Inland   Revenue   understands   that   the   PSA   has   since   withdrawn   proceedings.   Procuring   the   products   and   services   required   for   transformation   In   confidence   Page   24     All   procurement   processes   continue   to   be   consistent   with   Government   Rules   of   Sourcing.   Since   the   July   2017   update,   Inland   Revenue   has   completed   further   procurement   activity   to   select   the   services   and   products   required   for   transformation.   A   number   of   agreements   have   been   signed   in   recent   months.   These   include:    A   support   contract   with   Deloitte   which   consolidates   the   ma nagement   of   Deloitte   support   ac tivities   acros s   IT.    Contracts   with   Assurity   and   Team   Asparona   –   our   testing   and   information   and   knowledge   management   solution   partners   respectively.    Two   new   statements   of   work   (SoW)   with   Prismac   and   Ebit   Asia   Pacific   to   continue   progressing   changes   to   the   cheque   payment   processing   system   and   an   Automa ted   Remittance   Processing   solution   (ARP   Solution).   A   number   of   commercial   ag reements   have   also   been   progressed.   These   include:    The   scope   of   Assurity   test   services   was   confirmed   following   the   finalisation   of   the   release   plan.    The   advanced   analytics   proof   of   concept   request   for   proposal   (RFP)   was   awarded   to   PWC   and   Smar t   Associates.    The   customer   experience   RFP   was   awarded   to   two   New   Zealand   s uppliers,   Davanti   and   Alphero.   Market   engagement   is   underway   in   a   number   of   areas:      requests   for   proposals   (RFP)   for   a   web   content   management   and   an   advanced   analytics   platform    an   expression   of   interest   (EOI)   document   for   enterprise   supp ort   services.   Inland   Revenue   continues   to   consum e   common   capabilities   and   ICT   capabilities   where   they   exist,   meet   the   department’s   business   needs   and   are   cost ‐ effective.     Infrastructure ‐ as ‐ a ‐ Service   (IaaS),   Software   Framework   Agreements   and   Telecommunications ‐ as ‐ a ‐ Service   (TaaS)   are   being   used   by   Inland   Revenue.   Inland   Revenue   has   selected   Vodafone   to   provide   network   co nnectivity   and   move   additional   serv i ces   to   the   all ‐ of ‐ government   (AoG)   common   capability   (TaaS).   A   memorandum   of   understanding   has   been   signed   between   Inland   Revenue   and   the   Government   Chief   Digital   Officer   for   Inland   Revenue   to   adopt   the   AoG   Cloud   Framework   Agreement   for   the   provision   of   Amazon   Web   Services.   The   AoG   Co nsultancy   Services   panel   is   expected   to   be   established   in   December   2017 .   In   the   meantime,   Inland   Revenue   has   joined   the   New   Zealand   Defence   Force   ICT   Professional   Services   syndicated   panel.   This   provides   an   interim   solution   and   allows   the   department   to   access   specialist   ICT   services   quickly.   New   Zealand   businesses   have   secured   a   considerable   amount   of   tra nsformation   work .   Inland   R evenue   seeks   a   wide   range   of   providers   for   transformation   and   will   continue   to   do   so.   Opportunities   are   actively   promoted   to   the   market   place,   including   New   Zealand   businesses   –   for   example,   advertising   on   GETS   and   communications   with   vendors.     From   1   July   2014   to   31   December   2017,   $303m   has   been   spent   on   comp anies   and   indi vidual   contractors   providing   services   to   transformation,   of   which   $221m   (73%)   has   been   spent   on   New   Zealand   resident   businesses.    Both   delivery   partners,   FAST   and   Accenture,   have   recruited   New   Zealand   staff.   FAST   has   employed   23   New   Zealanders   as   START   developers   out   of   65   total   employees   in   New   Zealand.   Ac centure   have   employed   in   excess   of   40.   Inland   Reven ue   continue s   to   share   its   commercial   expertise   with   other   agencies.   Lessons   learned   have   been   shared   with   the   Ministry   of   Health   and   Land   Information   New   Zealand   (LINZ).   Inland   Revenue   also   shared   insights   with   the   Ministry   and   LINZ   regarding   improved   vendor   segmentation,   vendor   management   processes   an d   partner   governance.   Inland   Revenue   contin ues   to   work   with   DIA   and   MBIE   to   explore   options   for   a   single   integrated   solution   for   vendor   sourcing,   contract   management,   purchasing   and   payments   for   vendor   relationship   management.   The   Ministry   of   Education   and   Inland   Revenue   are   continuing   to   work   closely   together   to   help   the   Minis try   reduce   the   time   it   takes   to   pay   vendor   invoices.   Managing   and   governing   transformation    In   confidence   Page   25     Transformation   is   tracking   to   plan.   Release   2   is   on   schedule   and   costs   are   tracking   as   expected.   Monitoring   focuses   on   delivery   progress   and   realisation   of   benefits.    Inland   Revenue   and   the   Treasury   have   worked   together   to   agree   the   key   performance   indicators   (KPIs)   and   outcome   measures   that   will   be   used   to   monitor   progress   in   realising   the   benefits   and   outc o mes   from   transformation.   Unlike   the   single   product   implemented   in   Stage   1,   future   stages   will   overlap   and   be   implemented   through   a   series   of   releases.   To   reflect   this,   progress   is   being   monitored   through   a   set   of   time ‐ bound   indicators,   rather   than   indicators   related   to   a   particular   stage.   There   are   three   main   measures   of   success   for   transformatio n:    easier   for   customers    reduced   time   and   cost   to   i mplement   policy   (policy   agility),   and    administrative   savings   to   Inland   Revenue.   Progress   towards   achieving   these   outcomes   will   be   measured   against   a   number   of   lead   and   lag   indicators   (please   refer   to   appendix   3),   and   th rough   case   studies   (please   refer   to   appendix   4).   Case   studies   will   be   used   to   show   observable   changes   for:    improved   outcomes   for   customers   from   more   secure   sharing   of   information    agility,   and    revenue/compliance   uplift.   Transformation   remains   inherently   high   risk.   Transformation   is   complex   and   challenging.   Inland   Revenue   is   now   operating   two   systems   and   the   departme nt’s   risk   profile   has   increased.   It   will   remain   high   until   the   completion   of   transformatio n   due   to   the   need   for   old   and   new   systems   to   co ‐ exist.      The   key   risks   facing   transformation   were   identified   and   communicated   to   Ministers   as   part   of   the   2015   business   case.   The   most   significant   risks   and   the   ris k   profile   for   transformation   are   reported   regularly   to   the   Portfolio   Governance   Committee   and   to   the   Ministers   of   Finance   and   Revenue.   At   the   end   of   January   2018,   the   risk   profile   for   transformation   was   amber.   The   change   since   the   July   2017   update,   which   reported   a   light   amber   risk   profile,   is   due   to   the   work   required   to   confirm   the   release   plan   for   future   stages.    An   am ber   profile   means   that   risks   and   mitigations   are   reasonably   define d   and   un derstood,   and   support   is   needed   from   senior   leaders   to   actively   manage   specific   issues   in   defined   areas.    Current   risks   reported   to   the   Portfolio   Governance   Committee   relate   to:    The   need   for   legislative   change   that   has   not   been   anticipated,   resulting   in   Inland   Revenue   bein g   unable   to   meet   legislated   timing.    Changes   to   scope,   timescales   and   funding.    The   scale   of   change   impacting   revenue   distribution   and   collection,   Inland   Revenue’s   ability   to   achieve   performance   targets,   and   source   and   retain   peo ple   with   the   right   skills.    Inland   Re venue   not   meeting   expect ations   regarding   the   realisation   of   benefits,   adoption   and/or   delivery   of   all ‐ of ‐ Government   capabilities.    Government   losing   confidence   in   Inland   Revenue’s   ability   to   deliver.    Co ‐ existence.   Please   refer   to   appendix   5   for   a   summary   of   the   most   significant   risks   for   transform ation   as   at   January   2018.   The   risk   profile   has   been   refreshed   following   the   endorsement   of   the   release   plan   by   the   Portfolio   Governance   Committee   in   August   20 17.   The   most   significant   risks   have   been   re ‐ assessed   on   the   basis   of   release   2,   rather   than   over   the   life   of   the   programme   as   was   previously   the   case.    Four   new   risks   have   been   raised   since   the   last   update ,   two   have   been   closed   and   the   status   of   one   has   changed.   The   new   risks   ra ised   relate   to:    Managing   the   time   demands   on   key   core   resources Transformation   is   recognised   as   a   high   risk   initiative.   Robust   risk   management   approaches   are   in   place,   and   the   assurance   programme   forms   an   important   part   of   management   of   risks.    In   confidence   Page   26      Inland   Revenue’s   ability   to   retain   people   with   the   right   skills    The   Unisys   mainframe,   on   which   FIRST   resides,   becoming   unsupported   and   end   of   life   in   June   2021   (this   is   a   known   risk   that   is   now   reported   to   the   PGC   given   its   approaching   proximity)    Inland   Revenue’s   ability   to   attract   people   with   the   right   skills.   Two   risks   have   been   closed   since   the   July   201 7   update.   One   related   to   disruption   to   transition   processes   caused   by   not   havin g   union   support.   This   has   been   replaced   with   two,   new   separate   risks   regarding   union   disruption   and   loss   of   union   support.   These   risks   are   not   reported   to   the   Portfolio   Governance   Commi ttee.   The   other   closed   risk   related   to   previously   unk nown   anomalies   being   discovered   during   detailed   design.   This   risk   has   been   closed   for   Stage   1   and   release   2,   and   a   new   risk   has   been   raised   for   release   3.   This   risk   is   not   reported   to   the   Portfolio   Governance   Committee.   The   rating   of   one   risk   has   improved   since   the   July   20 17   update.   This   relates   to   insufficient   fundi ng   to   complete   delivery   of   transformation   due   to   competing   priorities.   Following   discussions   in   late   2017   with   the   Investment   Panel   and   Treasury,   Inland   Revenue’s   view   is   that   this   risk   has   a   reduced   likelihood   of   occurring.   While   risks   may   bec ome   issues   from   time   to   time,   this   is   not   unexpec te d.   Should   any   opportunities   or   issues   arise   that   may   impact   timelines,   costs,   benefits   or   risk   profile   these   will   be   highlighted   for   Ministers   to   consider.     Assurance   reviews   are   on ‐ going   to   provide   confidence   that   transformation   continues   to   be   well   managed   and   governed.   Inland   R evenue   undertakes   reg u lar   independent   quality   assurance   (IQA)   and   technical   quality   assurance   (TQA)   reviews.   The   outcomes   of   previous   assurance   reviews   are   included   in   earlier   business   cases   and   transformation   updates.   Three   external   assurance   reviews   have   been   completed   since   the   last   update   in   July ‐ 2017.    A   Gateway   0   (strategic   assessment)   review   was   completed   in   Ju ly   2017.   The   review   team’s   vi ew   was   that   transformation   is   on   a   positive   trajectory,   due   in   large   part   to   the   strength   of   leadership   and   governance.   The   review   team   commented   that   “the   quality   and   capability   of   its   leadership   and   governance   is   first   rate   and   provides   a   basis   for   confidence” .    A   Gateway   0   (strateg ic   assessment)   and   4   (r eadiness   for   service)   review   completed   in   March   2018   found   that   transformation   “...   continues   to   be   strongly   led,   governed   and   managed” .    The   review   team   noted   positive   momentum   within   Inland   Revenue,   “...   there   is   a   high   degree   of   confidence   arising   from   considerable   system   testing   in   readines s   for   release   2   in   April   2018”.   Overall,   the   Gateway   review   team   rated   tran sformation   as   amber/green.    In   their   August   2017   IQA6/TQA5   report,   KPMG   noted   that   “In   general,   the   Programme   overall   continues   to   be   managed   in   accordance   with   good   industry   practice,   and   we   also   noted   some   welcome   improvements   since   our   prior   reviews” .      Fieldwork   for   IQA7/TQA6   is   currently   underway.   This   review   is   assessing   Inland

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee Inland Revenue’s February 2021 Transformation Update Proposal 1 This paper provides an update regarding Inland Revenue’s progress in modernising the revenue system. I am asking Cabinet to note Inland Revenue’s plans for completing the transformation programme and the progress made with realising benefits, and to authorise the Minister of Finance and me to agree to re-purpose up to $47 million of remaining transformation capital funding to support the integrity of the revenue system. Executive Summary 2 The transformation programme has a wide scope. While there is a significant investment in systems, there is also an equally important investment in simplifying policies and processes for customers, new ways of working within Inland Revenue, and better experiences for customers. 3 Inland Revenue is nearing the end of the programme, with the final stage now well progressed. The next set of changes will go-live on 1 March 2021 and will move some smaller products, including paid parental leave, to new systems and processes. Child support will then be the last product remaining on old systems and processes and Inland Revenue intends to move it in October 2021. Inland Revenue has created some capacity in this final stage to respond to our priorities. 4 Based on current plans, the programme will close by 30 June 2022 within the funding envelope agreed by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers). The benefits of the investment in transformation are now very evident. Inland Revenue tracks its progress in realising benefits. The results for the year ending 30 June 2020 are included in this paper. A report by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) noted that ”...progress is positive, and largely on track with expectations at this point of the programme...”. 5 We now have significantly more agility to make changes to the revenue system. Inland Revenue’s initial response to COVID-19 shows it is now possible to deliver new products and services within weeks rather than years. Business tax changes to free up cashflow have been implemented, as has a loss carry-back scheme and a small business loan scheme. The latter was implemented in 39 days end-to-end. This was possible as requirements were clear and simple, it was designed as a digital service with easy and simple processes for customers, and data sources were clearly understood. 6 It is easier for customers to do what they need to do themselves using digital services. Inland Revenue is also maintaining the integrity of the revenue system by using its new analytical capabilities to focus on helping customers to get things right at the beginning rather than correcting things when they go wrong. All returns that result in a refund are 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] screened, customers are prompted when they need to take some action, and checks are built in as part of application processes. It is far easier to deal with issues before they become too large for customers to see their way out of or before behaviour patterns become too entrenched. Where needed, Inland Revenue continues to deal with fraudulent behaviour and avoidance to ensure people pay and receive the right amounts. 7 Although Inland Revenue is nearing the end of transformation, its operational risk remains high. This will continue to be the case until the department fully migrates off old systems and processes. Moving as quickly as possible, as safely as possible, is the best way to manage risk. 8 A strong revenue system is needed to help support the recovery from COVID-19 and there are opportunities to further leverage Inland Revenue’s capabilities in the years ahead. The Minister of Finance and I have considered how we fund Inland Revenue to support customers to cope with the impacts of the pandemic and to take advantage of new capabilities to ensure the integrity of the system. 9 There are also undoubtedly opportunities to leverage the investment made in Inland Revenue more widely across the public sector. The key factor to consider is timing so that the successful completion of transformation is not put at risk. The optimal timeframe to leverage Inland Revenue’s new systems, processes and expertise will be from early-mid 2022, once the programme has completed its key deliverables. Inland Revenue is nearing the end of its multi-year, multi-stage transformation programme 10 The modern, digital, revenue system envisaged by transformation is now largely in place. Transformation set out to reduce customer effort and cost, improve compliance levels, make policy changes faster and more cost effectively, improve systems resilience, and make Inland Revenue more efficient. Achieving this has required a combination of changes to policy, process, technology, and Inland Revenue’s people capabilities. Significant changes have been made to the revenue system since implementation began in February 2017. 11 The tax year ended 31 March 2020 was the first full year Inland Revenue received employment income information every payday. Although many payers still reported investment income information at the end of the year, they reported it earlier than previously. 12 Wage and salary earners no longer have to do anything at the end of the tax year, as Inland Revenue works out for them whether they have a refund or a bill to pay. The automatic issuing of income tax assessments for individuals ran for the second time in mid-2020, with most assessments completed within a three-week period. For the year ending 31 March 2020, around 1.8 million people received refunds totalling $713 million. When the process runs for the third time for the year ending 31 March 2021, it will be the first full year Inland Revenue receives more detailed information about the recipients of investment income and receives it more frequently. The department is intending to complete all assessments in days rather than weeks. 13 For most individuals, tax is being withheld more correctly, and assistance is provided at the time it is needed. Customers receiving social policy entitlements can be more confident they are doing the right thing. Processing times are much faster, and customers have greater certainty sooner. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14 Inland Revenue can now prompt customers if they need to do something. For example, suggesting a tailored tax code to those who might benefit from one, and advising people and their investment provider to change prescribed investor rates (PIR) when they are on the incorrect rate. As part of the automatic income tax assessment process, some individuals are prompted to consider whether they have other income to report. They may have previously reported income or Inland Revenue can see based on other information it holds that they may have income to report. Ensuring people are on the right rates and providing the correct information is improving the accuracy of the revenue system overall. 15 All taxes, Working for Families, student loans and KiwiSaver are now running on new systems and processes. Online services are available for all these products, making it easier for customers to do what they need to do without needing to contact Inland Revenue. Customers can now see their tax and payments and what they need to do in a single place. New systems are significantly more stable and robust. 16 The final stage is moving remaining products to new systems and processes in two releases during 2021: 16.1 Paid parental leave, unclaimed money, duties 1 , and New Zealand foreign trusts will move to new systems and processes on 1 March 2021. 16.2 A later release, currently planned for October 2021, will include Child Support and an upgrade to online services. The programme has been successful to date and the benefits are now evident 17 Four releases across three stages have been successfully implemented so far. Inland Revenue has worked closely with all customer groups to help them adapt to the changes made and with tax agents in particular to ensure there is good identification, prioritisation and tracking of any issues that affect agents and their clients. 18 All stages so far have been implemented on time and within budget. To date, Inland Revenue has returned $160 million (including depreciation and capital charge) to the Crown. 19 Inland Revenue is making very good progress with achieving the benefits it has committed to and has achieved seven of the ten indicators for 2019/20 for which there are qualitative measures. These are shown in the appendix. In July 2020, the OAG completed its performance audit of benefits management for transformation. The report concluded that Inland Revenue is well positioned to realise the benefits of transformation and notes that ”...progress is positive, and largely on track with expectations at this point of the programme...”. 20 There are three main measures of success for transformation: 20.1 easier for customers 20.2 reduced time and cost to implement policy (policy agility), and 20.3 administrative savings to Inland Revenue. 1 Including casino, lottery and totalisator duty, and the problem gambling levy. 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 21 Inland Revenue is making it easier for customers to pay and receive the right amounts and harder not to. 21.1 More customers are using digital services. There has been a 300% increase in user sessions for myIR, Inland Revenue’s secure online service. Just 1% of employment income information is now received on paper. Call centres and appointments are available for customers unable or unwilling to use digital services. 21.2 It is easy for the majority of customers to do what they need to do, with 81% saying they find it easy to comply. This is one of the indicators Inland Revenue did not achieve, as the target was 87%. It appears it is taking longer than expected for customers to adopt new services and become comfortable with them. However, there are positive signs, with student loan customers in particular being very positive about how easy to use the new services are. 21.3 Effort has reduced for small-to-medium sized businesses. This is measured through a survey run every two years, with the last survey carried out in 2018. The survey indicated businesses are spending nine fewer hours a year meeting their tax obligations than they were in 2013, which is the baseline. This is lower than the target of 13 hours for 2019/20. The next survey will be carried out in 2021. It was deferred from 2020 given the impacts of COVID-19. 21.4 New infrastructure is more robust and secure, with customer-facing online services available 99.3% of the time. For example, myIR handles 50% to 60% more transactions than it did before and peak use is up to 200% higher. 21.5 Proxy measures, such as the percentage of returns filed on time and filed electronically, are used for the increase in assessed Crown revenue, given the difficulty of direct attribution. Both measures increased by 7% for the year ended 30 June 2020 to 93% of returns filed on time and 96% filed electronically. 22 The government now has greater ability to make policy changes faster and more cost effectively, as has been clearly demonstrated by Inland Revenue’s response to COVID- 19. For the small business loan scheme, it was 39 working days from the initial preparatory work until launch. It took just 10 days from when the Government confirmed its intentions until the scheme was launched. These timeframes were unthinkable two to three years ago. However, these results were not achieved without cost. Work had to be re-prioritised and resources re-directed to enable people to focus on the higher priority COVID-19 response work. 23 Business tax changes to free up cashflow, including a provisional tax threshold lift, the reinstatement of building depreciation and writing off interest on the late payment of tax were also implemented, as was a loss carry-back scheme. The key to Inland Revenue’s ability to implement changes quickly has been adopting out-of-the-box processes and focusing on: 23.1 Easy and simple processes that reduce effort for customers. 23.2 Clear and simple requirements. 23.3 Leveraging digital services. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 23.4 Clearly understanding data sources. 24 The government is also better able to use the information Inland Revenue holds to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealanders. A good example is the portal Inland Revenue established with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to help support the administration of the wage subsidy. MSD can now access the information it needs directly from Inland Revenue’s systems to verify applications, rather than having to contact Inland Revenue. 25 Inland Revenue is working more efficiently and has achieved $118 million in savings for the three years ending 30 June 2020. The department’s approach to identifying and addressing compliance risks is a good example of more cost-effective ways of working. More timely matching of information means errors and non-compliance, both inadvertent and deliberate, are detected more easily and detected earlier: 25.1 Every return that can generate a refund is checked automatically and either released or sent for review. All amended returns are checked and screened. Between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020, Inland Revenue identified approximately 23,000 returns across all tax types that had errors or were potentially fraudulent, with a value of just under $200 million. This data is unaudited and is indicative only. Even with these caveats, this is an impressive result. 25.2 For the 2019/20 year, Inland Revenue identified approximately 31,000 donations tax credit claims worth $23 million that were either an error or fraud. Donations receipts are now scanned, so invalid claims are easier to identify. And generic rules, such as donations as a percentage of income, stop claims from being processed for someone to have a look at them. 25.3 Checks at the front-end help customers to get things right from the start and help them stay right on an on-going basis. For example, the small business loan scheme has compliance checks built in as part of the application process. 26 Identifying and addressing compliance risks upfront is a very cost-effective way to ensure customers pay and receive the right amounts. There will always be customers who deliberately choose not to comply. Inland Revenue will continue to focus on ensuring these customers meet their obligations and pay their fair share, including enforcement activity where necessary. 27 COVID-19 has changed the business and economic environment. Inland Revenue has and will continue to take a highly supportive and empathetic approach with customers who are experiencing difficulties. The focus is on helping them through this period and working with them to find the best way to manage their obligations over time, while actively addressing fraudulent behaviour or tax avoidance when it is identified. 28 Although the annual savings target for 2019/20 was not achieved, the trend is positive with annual savings increasing year-on-year and cumulative savings ahead of target. There was always expected to be some inter-year variability as new systems and processes bed in. This has been evident in the results achieved to date. Inland Revenue achieved more savings than expected in both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 years. As agreed by Cabinet (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers), administrative savings form part of Inland Revenue’s funding contribution towards transformation. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 29 Further changes to Inland Revenue’s size, workforce and ways of working are underway to maximise the benefits of the tools and technology now available. The new organisation design for back office functions will be in place from 1 March 2021. Detailed plans for changes to some front-line roles will be finalised in March 2021 following consultation with unions. These changes will help to ensure the department is well positioned, efficient, and the integrity of the revenue system is maintained. The final stage is well underway 30 Although implementation has been successful to date, Inland Revenue’s operational risk is high and will remain so until transformation is complete. This is due to co-existence, where Inland Revenue’s old and new systems need to keep running in parallel until all products and services have moved to new systems and processes. The last product to remain on old systems and processes is child support. Child support implementations are notoriously complex and involve a vulnerable customer group. 31 COVID-19 has had an impact on Inland Revenue’s plans to complete transformation. Inland Revenue had originally planned to migrate all remaining products to new systems and processes in one large release in April 2021. This is no longer possible. Some work on the final stage was paused in March 2020 to enable Inland Revenue to focus on higher priority COVID-19 work. The transformation programme will conclude by 30 June 2022. 32 There are five areas of work in the final stage: 32.1 Completing the implementation of the core system. This includes migrating all remaining products to new systems and processes. Inland Revenue will also upgrade GenTax (the proprietary name for START 2 ) to provide customers with a new look and feel for online services, a new home page for myIR, and an improved mobile-friendly design. There is some additional capacity for delivery of our priorities in this area of work. 32.2 Optimising Inland Revenue’s technology environment including decommissioning of its heritage systems and processes. The risks of co- existence could be heightened as decommissioning gathers pace during the final stage. 32.3 Completing the intelligence-led programme of work which will further enhance Inland Revenue’s analytical capabilities. Inland Revenue is also working to ensure that online help will be in place to support both its own people and customers once transformation is completed. 32.4 Completing the enterprise support services programme of work. Inland Revenue has moved its finance, planning and human resources functions to new systems and processes. Payroll replacement is the remaining piece of work. Inland Revenue is closely aligned with the all-of-government payroll programme to ensure its approach is consistent with the broader government sector. 32.5 Transitioning the processes, frameworks and methods developed by the transformation programme to Inland Revenue’s future operating model. This will help to ensure the benefits of transformation are enduring. 2 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name chosen by Inland Revenue for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The next set of changes will go live on 1 March 2021 33 From March 2021, digital services for paid parental leave customers will be significantly improved. Customers will be able to apply for and track the progress of their application, view next payment details, and view and maintain their personal details. Currently, everything is paper-based, and paid parental leave payments are not in myIR. Customers and their employers will no longer have to provide an income estimate, as Inland Revenue will pre-populate customers’ income for them as part of the application process. 34 Proposed policy changes will make it easier for the owners of unclaimed funds to track down their money down and claim it, and for the organisations holding the funds to comply. The owners of the funds will be able to claim their money through myIR. This will reduce the information they need to provide as Inland Revenue will already know who they are and they will just need to prove ownership. Organisations holding unclaimed money will be able to provide information to Inland Revenue electronically and in a standard format, which will reduce some of their compliance effort. 35 For duties and New Zealand foreign trusts, customers will be able to manage their obligations through myIR, making it significantly easier for them to meet these obligations. For New Zealand foreign trusts the information will be visible within Inland Revenue for compliance purposes and more easily reportable to the Financial Intelligence Unit in the Police, the Department of Internal Affairs, and overseas tax jurisdictions. 36 As has been the case with previous releases, Inland Revenue has communicated regularly with customers about the changes being made. The department has also been engaging with stakeholders, such as financial institutions and tax intermediaries, to ensure changes are implemented smoothly. The department remains under pressure, notwithstanding the successes achieved 37 A strong revenue system is essential to supporting the recovery from COVID-19. Completing transformation combined with the tax policy work programme and responding to our priorities means that Inland Revenue has limited capacity to implement any additional changes. The ability of individual customers, businesses (particularly in their role as employers), tax agents and other key intermediaries such as software companies, and the banks to absorb additional changes also needs to be considered. 38 The Minister of Finance and I have considered how we fund Inland Revenue to protect revenue and address emerging risks resulting from the COVID-19 environment. Some of Inland Revenue’s front-line capability will be retained for longer than originally planned by re-prioritising some of the funding that is forecast to remain once transformation is complete. 39 Based on what is known today, Inland Revenue estimates there will be up to approximately $100 million in capital funding remaining at the end of the programme. I am asking Cabinet to authorise the Minister of Finance and me to agree to re-purpose up to $47 million of remaining transformation capital funding, including swapping capital to operating expenditure, to support the integrity of the revenue system in the COVID-19 environment. 40 There are opportunities to consider leveraging the investment made in Inland Revenue’s systems and processes across the public sector. However, the key consideration here is timing. Inland Revenue’s priorities are to support customers, implement government 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] priorities, and successfully complete the transformation programme. Areas where there are opportunities to leverage Inland Revenue’s capabilities more widely include: 40.1 Enterprise support services. Inland Revenue is already working closely with a number of other agencies and is willing to support other agencies to adopt the common process model. 40.2 START and associated analytical capabilities, and the Data and Intelligence Platform (DIP). The DIP is Inland Revenue’s advanced analytics platform and was implemented in a scalable manner to enable other agencies to access and leverage its cloud-based capability. There is a continuum of options here and I will discuss these with Inland Revenue. 41 The optimal timeframe for further leveraging these assets will be from early-mid 2022, once the programme has completed its key deliverables. By leveraging these assets and Inland Revenue’s digital capability there is a significant opportunity to reduce compliance costs for small-to-medium enterprises and to support the recommendations of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group by ensuring certainty of entitlements and reducing debt. Risk remains high 42 Inland Revenue needs to maintain momentum to ensure it moves completely off its heritage systems and processes. If this does not happen, costs will be higher as two core systems would have to be run and be maintained indefinitely, operational risk will be higher due to on-going co-existence, and the benefits will not be fully realised. The department is going as fast as it can, as safely as it can. Regular independent assurance reviews provide confidence that transformation continues to be well managed and governed. 43 The most significant risks I see for the remainder of the programme are: 43.1 The on-going and unknown impacts of COVID-19. Inland Revenue recognises it is likely to have an on-going role in responding to the pandemic. Delivering additional government priorities could have an impact on customer service levels and the completion of transformation. Care must be taken not to overload the department. Mitigations include retaining and building on the approach taken during 2020 to delivering response packages and making the data Inland Revenue holds available to other agencies where it makes more sense for those agencies to deliver services. 43.2 Moving child support to new systems and processes is more difficult than expected. To mitigate this, Inland Revenue is involving specialists from across its business and external stakeholders as appropriate, to ensure the design of services meet customers’ needs. However, there are likely to be difficulties as child support customers can have complex and unique circumstances and can be hard to reach. 43.3 Leveraging the investment made in Inland Revenue across the public sector distracts the department from successfully completing transformation. Timing will be key to ensure resources are not diverted, putting the successful completion of the programme at risk. Mitigations include on-going engagement with other agencies and ensuring the Minister of Finance and I are fully informed to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck. 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Next steps 44 The next steps are to: 44.1 continue with preparations for the implementation of the first release in Stage 4; 44.2 support the passage of the Child Support Amendment Bill and the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill, and their Supplementary Order Papers, which contain key transformation proposals; 44.3 work with the Minister of Finance and Inland Revenue to ensure the integrity of the revenue system during the recovery from COVID-19 and to discuss options for leveraging the capabilities of Inland Revenue; 44.4 continue with the on-going programme of independent quality assurance; and 44.5 provide a further progress update to Cabinet by July 2021.

Proactive Release 52 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes, in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Central agencies’ comment (The Treasury, Public Service Commission and Government Chief Digital Officer) Acknowledgement of success: 53 The Central Agencies acknowledge Inland Revenue’s achievement with regard to progressing both the Business Transformation Programme and the Government’s tax initiatives in response to COVID-19 over the past year. Inland Revenue has now successfully completed many of the core components of the Transformation programme and is nearing the end of the programme, with planning for the final stage well progressed. However, while the programme is nearing completion, it remains an inherently high-risk programme that requires careful management to successfully complete. Benefits realisation: 54 There are four main measures of success for the transformation programme: decreased customer compliance costs, increased policy agility, a revenue uplift, and the realisation of administrative savings. 55 As mentioned in previous updates, IR’s ability to rapidly build and administer the systems required to progress new Government initiatives in response to COVID-19 is evidence of achievement in the programme’s policy agility and system resilience benefit areas. Transformation has also decreased compliance costs for small-medium enterprises since 2017/18 and decreases for other customer groups are expected by the programme’s end. 56 To deliver the expected administrative savings, Inland Revenue is set to begin a change process that is expected to reduce the department’s FTE count by approximately 800, primarily across their Customer and Compliance business groups. Central Agencies have previously expressed concern about Inland Revenue’s ability to sustainably realise the projected revenue uplift and achieve the administrative savings through staff reductions, while also maintaining the tax system’s integrity at current levels. The effect of COVID-19 exacerbates these concerns as it may place additional demands on the department. 57 As set out in the Cabinet paper, Inland Revenue is seeking agreement from Cabinet to delegate authority to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to reprioritise up to $47 million over 2021/22 and 2022/23 of the expected underspend resulting from Business Transformation to fund cost pressures and emerging system risks that were not foreseen when the business case was established. In particular, Inland Revenue is proposing to retain around 240 front line staff for longer than originally planned. This funding would be in addition to the $48.1 million worth of time-limited funding Cabinet has already approved to support Inland Revenue to deliver the Government’s COVID response and address COVID-related cost pressures. 58 Central Agencies consider there is value in reinvesting the transformation underspend in Inland Revenue to address cost pressures and emerging system integrity risks arising due to COVID-19, although note this does not allow the value of this spending to be weighed against other budget initiatives. A more gradual reduction in staff numbers allows the Department to assess how reduced staff numbers are impacting on its ability to maintain the integrity of the tax system in a staged manner. However, it is important that this increased time-limited funding does not delay Inland Revenue’s transformation change programme. To this end, Central Agencies support the conditions under which further funding is to be provided: 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 58.1 Inland Revenue will develop outcome measures to assess value for money; and 58.2 Inland Revenue will commit to working with the Treasury to examine their long- term funding requirements. 59 As the programme transitions to future operating model, Central Agencies expect IR to continue to invest in people to ensure the Department is well set up for life after transformation and to realise enduring benefits. This includes working closely with its people and continuing to invest in seeking positive and effective relationships with the unions. Recommendations I recommend that the Committee: 1 note that Inland Revenue will migrate paid parental leave, unclaimed money, New Zealand foreign trusts, and duties to new systems and processes on 1 March 2021; 2 note that child support will migrate to new systems and processes in October 2021 based on current plans, and that Inland Revenue’s eServices will be upgraded at the same time; 3 note that the programme will close by 30 June 2022 after decommissioning of heritage systems and processes has been completed; 4 note that, based on current plans, Inland Revenue will complete the programme within the approved funding envelope (CAB-15-MIN-0249 refers); 5 authorise the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to reprioritise up to $47 million of remaining transformation capital funding to support the integrity of the revenue system including swapping surplus capital into operating expenditure; 6 note that for 2019/20, Inland Revenue has achieved seven out of the ten indicators tracking achievement of the investment objectives for transformation and that the review completed by the Auditor General confirms the good progress made to date; 7 note there are opportunities to maximise the investment made in transformation and that the optimal timing will be from early to the middle of the 2022 calendar year to ensure the programme can successfully complete its remaining deliverables; 8 note the next progress update will be provided to Cabinet by July 2021.

From 2018/19 onwards, Inland Revenue reports on the overall percentage digital uptake measured in returns filed electronically. 4 Inland Revenue had intended to run the SME compliance cost survey again in 2020, however the impacts of COVID-19, especially on smaller businesses, resulted in a decision being taken to delay the survey until 2021. The 2018 survey has been used as an indicative result. 5 The additional revenue is already included in the government’s revenue forecasts. This indicator is rated as achieved based on increases in proxy measures.

Including the contingency held by the Commissioner and transitional funding, the overall budget for the current phase of transformation, Stage 4, is $208.2 million for operating expenditure and $88.3 million for capital expenditure.

Noted Noted Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation 09 March 2021 Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 4 IR2021/068: Transformation status update: February 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stage 4 first release update 8. Paid parental leave, unclaimed money, New Zealand foreign trusts, and duties are now successfully running on new systems and processes. Our systems were up and running at 4pm on 28 February 2021, slightly ahead of the scheduled re-opening time of 1 March 2021. This meant that businesses could apply for the resurgence support payment following the change in alert levels over the weekend of 27 and 28 February 2021. 9. At this early stage we are not seeing anything of concern from our customers. We are monitoring customer contacts to determine their reaction to the changes. Early life support 10. Early life support is in place and running smoothly. We have no critical or high priority issues. Other updates Stage 4 second release (Release 4.1.2) 11. Writing of test scenarios is well underway, with increased support required for key subject matter experts to remain on schedule. There is no risk to the overall test schedule. 12. Testing began during the first week of March 2021. For common areas we conduct verification testing, which focuses on fields, rules, and validations. Business system testing (making sure START works as expected) is undertaken for complex or high-risk areas. Both verification testing and business system testing are on track. Policy 13. The Child Support Amendment Bill and the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure and Remedial Matters) Bill were reported back to Parliament on 4 March 2021. 14. We are working with the Minister of Revenue’s office to ensure the Bills go through their remaining stages over the next three weeks and receive assent by 1 April 2021. E- File 15. E- File is a service which allows tax agents to file their clients’ returns to us. As reported to you (IR2020/457 refers), we are decommissioning this service on 16 April 2021. Around 2,500 tax agents currently use E-File. 16. We have developed gateway services to replace E-File, along with providing the ability for other customers to file and update their information such as employers, banks and KiwiSaver scheme providers. Each of the five current E-File software providers have the discretion to choose which of the new gateway services they build for their customers. At present, they are all tracking to have their selected services available when E-File is decommissioned. For any functionality they don’t build, tax agents can still use myIR. 17. From 1 April 2021, we will no longer accept new E-File registrations other than for special circumstances. This means tax agents can still register up to the 31 March 2021 filing date. 18. Final submissions through E-File will be at 4pm on 16 April 2021. Some software providers may move to gateway services before then and will communicate this to their clients. E-File will be ‘switched off’ sometime after 6pm on 16 April 2021. 5 IR2021/068: Transformation status update: February 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 19. We have signalled this change since early 2019 and, with software providers, are ensuring tax agents have the information they need to be ready. Software providers are leading communications to their clients, especially about the functionality they will adopt and how to use it. We are providing supporting information for both providers and tax agents. Key risks and issues 20. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber 1 , with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 21. We are monitoring one issue (a risk that has been realised). This relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. There are no concerns to report at this time. 22. As at February 2021, the programme has a total of 57 open risks 2 , of which 14 are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). 23. There has been no change in the status of any of the risks reported to the PGC since the last report. 24. The top three risks for transformation remain unchanged and relate to the need to move off all our heritage applications by 1 July 2022, so that we can fully decommission our heritage data centres. Coming up in the next two months 25. Key activities over the next two months include: March 2021 • Begin Pou Whirinaki/early life support for Release 4.1.1 April 2021 • Complete business function definitions for Release 4.1.2 • Decommission E- File. • FEC hearing on the Auditor-General’s report into our benefits management practices (IR2020/358 refers). 1 The risk RAG status is separate from the overall programme status which is light amber as stated on page 2. Table 1 on page 2 shows the RAG key for risk as amber and the overall programme rating as light amber. 2 During February 2021, one programme risk was closed.

Between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, the programme spent $747 million in operating, and $374.9 million in capital. Any under-spending to date has either been moved to later periods or returned to the Crown. 6. The overall budget for the current phase of transformation, Stage 4, is $278 million for operating expenditure and $90.3 million for capital expenditure. Stage 4 delivery operating costs have changed this month to reflect funding approved for some of the change activity we had planned to do, which was deferred due to the impacts of COVID- 19. 7. We have confirmed the amount of funding we expect to hand back at the closure of the programme (IR2022/037 refers). Recommendatio ns 8. I recommend that you note the contents of this report.

We are on track with our decommissioning activity. 10. As at February 2022, we had decommissioned approximately 88 % of our heritage systems, and removed about 50% of the infrastructure components from our heritage data centres. There is no direct correlation between applications and infrastructure, as much of the infrastructure supports multiple applications. 11. A key achievement during February 2022 was the successful shutdown and removal of our heritage data warehouse, an application our staff had previously used to analyse data. 12. Our high-level timetable is unchanged and remains: • From 1 December 2021 until early April 2022, we will shut down old heritage systems, archive any data that is to be retained, and then remove the systems and databases. • In April 2022, once all the systems have been removed, the network connections and supporting services will be shut down, and the process of dismantling and disposing of the infrastructure will begin. • We remain on track to e xit our heritage Unisys data centres by 30 June 2022. Independent quality assurance reviews 13. The final Gateway review to be completed on the programme will take place during the week beginning 28 March 2022. This will be a final Gate 0 (Strategic Assessment) review. We expect to report the results of the review to the Minister of Revenue during April 2022. Identity control and print replacement initiatives 14. Last month (IR2022/043 refers), we reported that we were experiencing some challenges with the identity control and administration 1 project and print replacement projects. The identity control and administration initiative is meeting its revised plan and is on schedule, and the print replacement project is now on track. Key risks and issues 15. The transformation programme’s risk profile has improved to light green. A light green profile means that risks are under control and mitigations are effective. 16. There are no new issues (a risk that has been realised) to report. 17. As of February 2022, the programme had a total of six open risks 2 , none of which are reported to the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC). 18. The one remaining risk previously reported to the PGC was closed during February 2022. The risk relating to delays in decommissioning our heritage data warehouse, an application our staff use to analyse data, has been closed. The warehouse is now available to be decommissioned, with final quality checks and archiving having been completed. 1 Management of user accounts, roles, and access rights for individuals in an organisation. 2 During February 2022, nine programme risks were closed, including one reported to the PGC. 5 IR2022/096: Transformation status update: February 2022 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Coming up in the next two months 19. Key activities over the next two months include: March 2022 • Continue with decommissioning activity. • Final Gateway review. April 2022 • Continue with decommissioning activity. • Final progress update considered by the Cabinet Government Administration and Expenditure Review Committee.

What happens next
-----------------

We’ll use your return to update your running balance for your imputation credit account.

It will be updated with the latest return’s income tax payments, transfers in, income tax disbursements and transfers out.  
  
The running balance determines which income tax disbursement limitation rules will apply. 

If you file an imputation return with a credit or nil closing balance we will not post a transaction to your account.  
  
Any imputation liabilities will be managed through your company’s income tax account.

**Narrator**

You can file your GST returns electronically, or by paper.

We encourage businesses to file electronically.

Electronic returns are processed faster, and you have immediate confirmation that we’ve received it.

You can file your return by logging in to myIR, and keying in the figures.

Or you may be able to use your software.

It generally only takes a couple of minutes to file in myIR.

Some other benefits in filing online are that you can pay your GST by direct debit, credit, or debit card when you file your return.

You can set up email or text reminders for due dates.

You can also propose an instalment arrangement if you can’t pay in full, and request an amendment to a return.

We have a video on our YouTube channel that shows how to file your return in myIR.

To view it, go to YouTube, search, Inland Revenue New Zealand, and select the video, How to file a GST return in myIR.

Due dates

*   GST returns and payments are due on the 28th of the following month.
*   Two exceptions are:

*   March GST is due on 7 May
*   November GST is due on 15 January

*   There are penalties and interest for filing and paying late.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Most GST returns and payments are due on the twenty-eighth day of the following month.

The 2 exceptions to this rule, are for March and November returns.

March returns are due on the seventh of May, as Easter and ANZAC day fall around the twenty-eighth of April.

The November return is due on the fifteenth of January because of the Christmas period.

If the twenty-eighth falls on a weekend or public holiday, then the due date is the next business day.

It’s important to budget for your GST payments, and to set money aside.

Penalties and interest apply if your GST isn’t paid by the due date.

If you’re unable to make payment in full, make sure you still file your return on time.

That way you’ll avoid the late filing penalty.

Then pay whatever you can, and request an instalment arrangement in myIR, or by phoning us before the due date.

If we agree to your instalment plan, we can freeze the penalties that would normally be charged.

If you don’t have any sales or expenses for a GST period, a nil return is still required to be filed.

Cancelling GST

*   Your GST must be cancelled if you cease all business activities
*   You can cancel your GST:

*   online
*   in writing
*   by phone or
*   by completing a business cessation form

*   Adjustments are required for assets sold or retained.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

There are a couple of situations when you must cancel your GST.

This is if you cease your business activity, or you change your business structure.

For example if you shift from being a sole trader to being a company.

You can also choose to cancel your registration if your turnover for the next 12 months will be less than 60 thousand dollars, unless GST is always included in your prices.

This is the case for certain industries, like the taxi industry.

GST cancellations can be requested in myIR, by writing to us, by calling the contact centre, or by completing an IR315 form.

When you cease, you’ll need to do an adjustment for any business assets you sell, or are keeping.

You’ll pay GST on the sale price, or for assets you keep, on their market value.

If you sell your business as a going concern, then the sale may be able to be zero-rated for GST purposes.

As mentioned earlier, the criteria for zero-rating the sale, is on our website.

Remember, you must file returns that cover the dates up to your cessation date.

Filing challenge out of time (Appeal)
=====================================

2007 case note - taxpayer appealed the decision to not grant leave to commence proceedings out of time – expiry of response period, exceptional circumstances.

Case

Amaltal Fishing Co Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer appealed the decision of the Authority which declined to grant leave to commence proceedings out of time, on the basis that no exceptional circumstances existed.

### Facts

In about 2000, a dispute developed between the parties over tax payable in the 1994 and 1995 years. There were dealings between the taxpayer's solicitors and the investigator based in Nelson, Litigation Management and the Crown Law Office. The in-house accountant received copies of all communications between the parties but generally such communications took place between the taxpayer's solicitor and the Inland Revenue Department ("IRD").

The IRD sent a letter to the taxpayer's solicitor on 20 April 2006 to advise notices of assessment would be issued shortly. The letter also noted that the assessments would be sent directly to the taxpayer. A copy of the letter was sent to the in-house accountant, and the external accountant. The assessments were then issued on 27 April 2006. The taxpayer failed to commence proceedings before the response period expired on 26 June 2006, but did so on 10 August 2006.

The in-house accountant received the assessments on either 28 April or 1 May 2006, but took no action until 8 May 2006. That appeared to be due to the investigator having telephoned the external accountant in relation to the assessments, and the external accountant telephoning the in-house accountant who said he had received them and would contact the external accountant to discuss them.

In mid June 2006, the external accountant reminded the in-house accountant he had not forwarded on the assessments. The in-house accountant undertook to do so, but did not attend to that until 26 June 2006, the last day of the response period.

### Decision

The taxpayer essentially advanced the same propositions that were rejected by the Authority. These included:

It was reasonable to expect the notices to have been copied to the solicitor given this is what had happened in the past. The failure of IRD to do this was beyond the accountant' control.

It was reasonable for the accountant to ignore the fact that the letter from IRD said the assessments would be issued shortly and what the time period was given the history of the proceedings.

Justice France considered the taxpayer's submissions owed much to the misreading of the Court of Appeal decision in _Fuji Xerox_. Whilst that Court accepted in isolation the fact the notices had not been sent to the agent who had been dealing with the dispute was beyond the taxpayer's control, it dismissed the argument that such a fact provided a reasonable justification. As in the current case, it was not a relevant factor once the taxpayer had the notices.

His Honour considered it was an impossible proposition to suggest that the statutory test of exceptional circumstances was met here. While errors were made they were not beyond the taxpayers’ control. It was incorrect to say the failure of the IRD to copy the letter to the solicitor was beyond the taxpayer' control. IRD advised the parties a week before the assessments were issued where they would be going and how long the period to challenge was. The same analysis in _Fuji_ existed here-it was not the omission to send a copy that was causative of the failure to file in time but the omissions of the accountant who received the assessments.

Geof Nightingale Advisory Ltd Team Lead & Management Support (CE & DC ED&I) – Executive Services Enterprise Design & Integrity Inland Revenue WELLINGTON 6011 4 November 2024 Tēnā koe This letter records the outcomes of my independent review of Inland Revenue’s draft review report titled “Review and Analysis of Social Media Usage for Custom Audiences” (the Final Draft Review Report). My review has been conducted in accordance with my engagement letter dated 22 October 2024. Thank you for your time and the time and prompt engagement of Inland Revenue officials who I met with in the course of the review. Summary Based on my review of the report, its associated references and my discussions with key Inland Revenue officials involved in the review, the Final Draft Review Report reflects a careful and considered review of the custom audience programme. The review reflects the importance of communicating with customers using approaches that best support customers to access their entitlements and meet their obligations while meeting Inland Revenue’s confidentiality obligations to customers. The scope of the custom audience review has been appropriate to consider the concerns raised with the custom audience programme. The findings are well supported and clearly set out. I have not identified any unaddressed concerns. The review identified some areas for further consideration by Inland Revenue. The review identified two instances of unintended disclosure of confidential information and outlines how these are being dealt with. Strictly Confidential 1 Background The Commissioner has a statutory duty to protect the integrity of the tax system and is charged with a duty of care and management of the tax system. 1 In particular, the Commissioner is required to have regard to the importance of promoting compliance, including voluntary compliance, by all persons with the Inland Revenue Acts. 2 Since 2014 Inland Revenue has contracted social media platforms to provide targeted communications to customers to remind them of their obligations and to make them aware of their potential entitlements. Using custom audiences assists the Commissioner to fulfil his duty of care and management of the tax system and to provide the best customer support that he can using modern communication channels. However, the Commissioner also has important confidentiality obligations to customers arising under the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Privacy Act 2020. Inland Revenue communicates those confidentiality obligations to customers through its charter and its privacy policy. Despite those confidentiality obligations, Inland Revenue has the ability to make permitted disclosures of sensitive revenue information in certain circumstances in order to carry out or support a lawful function of the Commissioner administering the tax system 3 . It is in that context that in order to target relevant messages to specific customer groups some customer details are provided to the social media platforms in controlled circumstances on a de-identified and encrypted basis to enable the platforms to generate custom audiences. In response to concerns raised recently by the public in the media and in order to respond to requests made under the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 2020, Inland Revenue has stopped its custom audience programme and undertaken a detailed internal review of its engagement with social media platforms to determine if there is a threat or risk to customer privacy. The internal review is documented in the Final Draft Review Report. That report, once finalised, is intended to be released to the public at a press conference by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Scope and timing of the independent review The scope and timing of the independent review is set out in appendix one. Meetings held with relevant Inland Revenue officials in conjunction with the independent review are set out in appendix two. 3 Section 18D(1) and (2), and Schedule 7, Part A, clause 11 of the TAA. 2 Section 6A(2)(b) of the TAA. 1 Sections 6 and 6A of the TAA. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Strictly Confidential 2 My review considered three versions of the Final Draft Review Report: 1. The original version was provided on Thursday 24 October 2024 to enable the review to commence while Inland Revenue continued to work on the review. 2. An updated version was provided on Wednesday 30 October 2024. 3. A final updated version provided on Friday 1 November 2024. My independent review is based on the final updated version. Feedback from the independent review process has been incorporated into the Final Draft Review Report. I am happy to discuss any matters in relation to my independent review.

Final payment triggers a base price adjustment
==============================================

2016 case note – TRA ruling that final payment triggers a base price adjustment - financial arrangement rules.

Case

TRA 025/14 \[2016\] NZTRA 02

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

The assignment of a debt was a financial arrangement and on crediting of the debt amount to the disputant’s current account, the financial arrangement matured and a base price adjustment ("BPA") was required.

### Impact

This decision confirms that when a distribution is made available to a shareholder(s) for draw down, that constitutes a final payment (and maturity of a financial arrangement) and a BPA is triggered in accordance with the financial arrangement rules.

### Facts

The disputant is the sole shareholder and director of Properties Ltd ("Properties").

In 1986, Properties entered into a large construction contract for which ABC Bank ("ABC") provided loan facilities.

The disputant personally guaranteed the lending in respect of Properties' debts and Properties gave ABC a debenture over its assets to secure the lending.

Properties then ran into financial difficulty and ABC appointed receivers to Properties' assets.

Litigation commenced between ABC and the disputant. By way of settlement of this dispute, agreement was reached between the parties and a Deed of Admission of Liability and Settlement ("Deed") was executed.

The Deed included: an acknowledgement of $2,659,442.06 in debt to ABC an admission by the disputant of liability for the debt under the guarantee; agreement that, if $90,000 ("the Settlement Sum") and interest thereon was paid by the disputant, ABC would assign to the disputant the liability of Properties Ltd; agreement that until the Settlement Sum and interest was paid in full to ABC, Properties and the disputant would remain fully liable to ABC for the total debt; and agreement that after payment of two of the instalments making up the Settlement Sum, the receivers would retire from Properties.

The receivers did retire in 1993 and after the last portion of the monies due was paid in February 1996, ABC assigned the debt to the disputant.

Properties did not trade again until 2004 when it commenced a property development project.

Properties recorded an opening balance in the disputant’s current account of $2,659,442 in the 2005 year (being the amount of the debt assigned under the Deed). Losses carried forward from previous years had the effect that there was no income tax payable in the 2005 income year.

Financial statements for Properties for the 2005 to 2007 income years showed net drawings over this three year period of $2,238,592 but the assigned debt was not recorded in the financial statements as a term liability.

The disputant ultimately returned no taxable income for the 2001 to 2010 income years.

The disputant had no bank account, did not draw a salary from Properties and he drew money from his current account to fund family living expenses.In the 2005 to 2007 income years, the disputant and his partner also claimed approximately $35,000 in Working for Families Tax Credits.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") contended that the assignment of the debt was a financial arrangement and on the crediting of the $2,659,441 to the disputant’s current account the financial arrangement matured and a BPA was required.

The disputant argued that no event occurred in 2005 which triggered a BPA. Even if something had happened materially in that year, the disputant contended that it would not amount to a payment which required a BPA.

### Decision

The disputant’s claim was dismissed.

The Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") was satisfied that a payment of the assigned debt of $2,659,442 was made to the disputant in 2005 by the crediting of this sum to his current account and available for the disputant to draw down. This was not a simple entry to reflect the change in party to whom the debt was owed nor was it a term loan owed to the disputant. Accordingly, the financial arrangement matured and a BPA was required in the 2005 year.

Accordingly, the Authority held that it was not necessary to address the Commissioner's alternative arguments and consequently whether this alternative argument could be raised by the Commissioner under s 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

As for whether the disputant could rely on documents not previously discovered in support of an additional issue, the Authority was of the view that the disputant could have located the documents and discerned the issue at the time of delivery of his statement of position. The disputant was therefore unable to pursue this issue. Furthermore, the Authority did not consider that the raising of the additional issue was necessary to avoid any manifest injustice to the disputant.

In any event, as to the admissibility of the undiscovered documents, the Authority considered that the disputant was clearly well aware of his discovery obligations and because of her view on the merits of the disputant’s proposed argument, the documents did not have any particular significance to the disputant. There was therefore no real risk of prejudice to the disputant if the documents were not produced. Accordingly, the disputant’s application to admit the documents was declined.

Financial arrangements - agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services in foreign currency
=========================================================================================================

2014 change to tax rules for the valuation of property or services included in agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services in foreign currency.

#### _Sections EW 15D, EW 15F to EW 15I, EW 32, EW 33B, EW 33C, EW 35, EZ 75, EZ 76 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

The tax rules for the valuation of property or services included in agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services (ASAPs) in foreign currency (foreign currency ASAPs as defined) have been changed. Consequently, the taxation spreading methods for income and expenditure under foreign currency ASAPs for tax have also been changed. The changes have been made to make compliance easier for all taxpayers and to remove volatility between accounting income and taxable income.

There is an exception to the new rules for foreign currency ASAPs that are life financial reinsurance. There are no changes to the tax rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services which are not foreign currency ASAPs.

### Key features

Taxpayers who use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS taxpayers) to prepare financial statements will almost always use the accounting valuation of the property or services in foreign currency ASAPs as the tax cost for depreciation purposes. They will also use the accounting results to spread income and expenditure under foreign currency ASAPs. The income or expenditure included in the financial statements for foreign currency ASAPs will generally be any recognised interest.

The valuation and spreading rules for foreign currency ASAPs will incorporate the effect of IFRS designated FX hedging of FX amounts in the financial statements.

There are some legislative modifications to the use of the accounting results. These modifications only apply to hedges of certain transactions.

Non-IFRS taxpayers will generally use spot foreign exchange rates to convert amounts paid to value property or services included in foreign currency ASAPs. Interest income or expenditure will arise in two situations:

*   interest may be commercially agreed and expressly included in the terms of the contract; or
*   it will be calculated where there are payments 12 months or more before or after the "rights date" (as defined).

In the second situation, interest is calculated on a future or discounted value basis. Progress payments and deposits up to 10 percent of the total price are not payments included in the second situation. The spreading and valuation rules will allow a one-time-only election to include the effects of prescribed hedging rules for foreign exchange amounts included in foreign currency ASAPs. In substance this is designed to replicate the tenor of the equivalent IFRS rules.

It is expected that relatively few foreign currency ASAPs for non-IFRS taxpayers will have interest income or expenditure to spread under the new rules. The reasons for that are the exclusion of 10 percent deposits and progress payments, and other payments that are less than 12 months before or after the rights date.

The changes to the rules mean that Determination G29 will have no relevance for either IFRS or non-IFRS taxpayers for foreign currency ASAPs that are subject to the new rules.

The new rules apply to foreign currency ASAPs entered into from the 2014-15 income year. IFRS taxpayers can make a one-time-only election to apply the new rules to foreign currency ASAPs entered into from the beginning of an income year commencing with the 2011-12 income year so long as they have filed on that basis since that first year.

Further, tax positions taken consistently for existing agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services in foreign currency which are based on the new rules are confirmed.

Foreign currency ASAPs entered into before the 2014-15 income year or an earlier elective year will continue to have the old rules applied to them for their life.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Background_

Agreements for the sale and purchase of property (or services) in foreign currency have been subject to Determination G29 since the 1996-97 income year. Determination G29 and associated deemed interest rules have caused significant compliance difficulties and volatility of taxable income (compared with accounting income). The volatility of taxable income is especially significant for IFRS taxpayers. The compliance difficulties are relevant to all taxpayers but are especially significant for non-IFRS taxpayers.

Modern IFRS accounting practice has now comprehensively and coherently dealt with this issue, thereby offering an opportunity to change the tax rules for the foreign currency ASAPs.

#### _Foreign currency ASAPs_

A foreign currency ASAP is defined in section YA 1. It is a financial arrangement that is an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services. At the time it is entered into, 50 percent or more of the consideration in New Zealand dollars is in a foreign currency, measured using spot rates at that time. For example, where a contract includes the sale of aluminium for a total consideration equivalent to New Zealand $5 million it will be a foreign currency ASAP if $2.5 million or more equivalent New Zealand dollars is to be paid in a foreign currency (measured at the spot rate when the contract is entered into).

#### _IFRS taxpayers_

Subsection EW 15D(2)(ae) has been inserted. The subsection, along with the amendments to sections EW 15F, EW 15G and EW 15H, means that the IFRS financial spreading method applies to foreign currency ASAPs entered into from the 2014-15 income year (or an earlier income year from the 2011–12 income year if returns were filed under the new rules, see the section "Application dates"). There is an exception to the application of section EW 15D(2)(ae) for foreign currency ASAPs that are life financial reinsurance. Section EW 15I continues to apply to spread income and expenditure for foreign currency ASAPs that are life financial reinsurance.

Some foreign currency ASAPs may include significant payments before or payments after the accounting recognition dates for property or services. In these cases the IFRS financial statements may exclude some of the amounts paid from the value of the property or services and allocate them separately to the income statement. This treatment will generally not apply to deposits and progress payments which are not generally regarded as financial instruments under IFRS.

Any amounts allocated directly to the income statement are in the nature of interest resulting from future value or discounted value calculations for the amounts paid. Using section EW 15D for foreign currency ASAPs means these amounts are income or expenditure in the income years they are allocated to the income statement. The IFRS valuation and spreading of interest treatment described in this paragraph applies to all foreign currency ASAPs.

Subsection EW 15D(2)(ae) refers to sections EW 32 and EW 33B to value property or services in foreign currency ASAPs and any relevant IFRS-designated FX hedges for those foreign currency ASAPs. Those sections are discussed further below.

Subsection EW 15D(2B)(b) has been amended to remove Determination G29 for foreign currency ASAPs entered into from the 2014–15 income year (or an earlier income year from the 2011–12 income year if returns were filed under the new rules).

Subsection EW 15F(1)(bb) has been inserted to remove the expected value method for calculating income and expenditure for foreign currency ASAPs.

Subsection EW 15G(1)(bb) has been inserted to exclude using the modified fair value method for calculating income and expenditure for foreign currency ASAPs.

Subsection EW15H(1)(d) has been repealed to remove Determination G29 from being used to value property or services and spread income and expenditure for foreign currency ASAPs.

Subsection EW 15I(1)(b)(iii) has been replaced. It previously applied to all agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services (including foreign currency ASAPs). It now applies to foreign currency ASAPs that are life financial reinsurance, or agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services that are not foreign currency ASAPs. Income and expenditure on these financial arrangements will continue to be spread under section EW 15I.

New subsection EW 32(2B) applies to foreign currency ASAPs of IFRS taxpayers. It values property and services in foreign currency ASAPs at the values under IFRS accounting rules. These are usually amounts in New Zealand dollars at the time they are recognised in IFRS financial statements, using spot exchange rates to convert foreign currency amounts.

New subsection EW 32(8) provides that section EZ 75 overrides the application of section EW 32 for IFRS taxpayers in certain cases. The effect of section EZ 75 is described in the section "Application dates".

The IFRS values will include amounts allocated to the value of the property or services in the IFRS financial statements for IFRS-designated FX hedges of foreign currency amounts (as provided for in new subsections EW 33B(1) and (3) below).

Section EW 35 (as amended by this Act) applies to use the IFRS values for property or services in foreign currency ASAPs for other provisions of the Act, such as the cost of depreciable assets, the cost of revenue account property, or income from sales of goods or services.

#### _IFRS-designated hedging_

Subsections EW 33B(1), (3) and (5) apply to certain foreign currency ASAPs and IFRS-designated FX hedges (defined in section YA 1) of foreign currency amounts in those foreign currency ASAPs. Subsection EW 33B(1) limits the application of the IFRS-designated FX hedges rules to certain property or services. Subsection EW 33B(3) includes in the tax values of property or services described in subsection EW 33B(1) amounts for IFRS-designated FX hedges attributed to the values of that property or services in the IFRS financial statements.

Subsection EW 33B(1) limits the IFRS-designated FX hedging rules. They are limited to foreign currency ASAPs for depreciable property and revenue account property, or services which result in assessable income or deductible expenditure under provisions under the Act outside the financial arrangements rules. Therefore the rules do not apply to IFRS-designated FX hedges for foreign currency ASAPs for non-revenue account property that is not depreciable property and non-deductible/non-taxable services. Hedges for these matters will continue to be treated as stand-alone financial arrangements. All consideration for, and under those hedges, will continue to be spread under the present rules. None of the consideration for the IFRS-designated FX hedge will be included in the value of the non-revenue account property or services under the new rules for foreign currency ASAPs.

This is the appropriate policy outcome. The objectives of new rules for foreign currency ASAPs are to reduce compliance with, and the volatility of, taxable income compared with accounting income. They are achieved by allowing IFRS taxpayers to use the values and spreading of any income and expenditure used in the financial statements for tax. However, IFRS-designated FX hedges are financial arrangements which, in the absence of the new tax rules, would be fully taxed under the financial arrangements rules. Where the hedges are for non-revenue account property, amounts relating to the hedges should continue to be taxed under the financial arrangements rules because they otherwise would not be in the tax base.

Subsection EW 33B(3) allocates for tax amounts for IFRS-designated FX hedges attributed under IFRS rules to the value of relevant property or services in a foreign currency ASAP described in subsection EW 33B(1). So the tax values for property or services in these cases are those used in the IFRS financial statements, including amounts attributed to them for IFRS-designated FX hedges.

Subsection EW 33B(5) excludes from the spreading methods and base price adjustments for the IFRS-designated FX hedges amounts attributed to the tax values of property or services by subsection EW 33B(3). This prevents double counting of these amounts under the two financial arrangements. Therefore amounts for designated FX hedges attributed to the value of property or services will not be spread for tax under the FX-designated hedge. Those amounts will usually be allocated to reserves in "Other Comprehensive Income" in the IFRS financial statements until the property or services are recognised in the financial statements. The amounts attributed to the value of property or services will also be excluded from the base price adjustment for the IFRS-designated hedges.

New subsection EW 33B(6) provides that section EZ 75 overrides the application of section EW 33B for IFRS taxpayers in certain cases. The effect of section EZ 75 is described in the section "Application dates".

Example**The new tax rules applied to the purchase of a depreciable asset of an IFRS taxpayer**

The example is based on the following assumptions:

The purchase of a depreciable asset for US$100,000 in 12 months (being the IFRS GAAP recognition date).

The payments are US$50,000 in 6 months (payment A, a non-monetary item for IFRS GAAP), and US$50,000 at the recognition date in 12 months (payment B).

Both payments are hedged from the beginning with forward exchange contracts (FEC/s) designated as cashflow hedges. However, for comparison the example includes the treatment where both payments are not hedged at all (the "No Hedges" column) and where the hedge is not designated.

The forward (FEC) rate for payment A is 0.72 and the FEC rate for payment B is 0.65.

The spot rate for payment A is 0.65 and the spot rate for payment B is 0.80.

A balance date falls three months prior to the recognition date when the spot rate is 0.75.

The IFRS GAAP results are set out for three situations: the hedges are designated as cashflow hedges; the hedges are not designated as hedges; and there are no hedges at all.

| Profit and loss | **0** |     | **7 DR** |     | **0** |     |

**Designated IFRS FX hedges:** The asset is capitalised and depreciated for tax at the FEC rates, being $146k. There is no impact on the profit and loss up to the IFRS recognition date and therefore no income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules for tax up to that point.

**Undesignated IFRS FX hedges:** The asset is capitalised and depreciated for tax at the spot rates, being $139k. The P&L has been debited with $7k ($3k and $4k for the two years up to the recognition date). These amounts are expenditure under the financial arrangements rules for the undesignated IFRS FX hedges. The spreading of them will depend on which of the available spreading methods is being used for these types of financial arrangements.

**No hedges:** The asset is capitalised and depreciated for tax at the spot rates being $139k. There is no impact on the profit and loss and therefore no income or expenditure for tax under the financial arrangements rules.

#### _Non-IFRS taxpayers_

#### _Rights date_

A new definition of "rights date" has been inserted into section YA 1 for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. The definition only applies to foreign currency ASAPs of non-IFRS taxpayers because the tax rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services which are not foreign currency ASAPs are not being changed. The definition does not apply to IFRS taxpayers because they will apply the IFRS recognition dates for property or services in foreign currency ASAPs. The definition means the date on which the first right in the property is transferred or the services are provided. The words used in the new definition are similar to those contained in section EW 32(3) for the use of lowest price to establish the point at which the property or services in non-foreign currency ASAPs is valued.

The intended effect of the definition of "rights date" is to identify when property or services in foreign currency ASAPs are valued under the new rules for non-IFRS taxpayers. It is intended that this is the same point at which the property or services would be valued under the old rules for foreign currency ASAPs and the ongoing rules for non-foreign currency ASAPs. For instance, if the first right in the property under the foreign currency ASAP was to possession, that would be the rights date under the new rules and the point at which the value was established under the old rules.

#### _Spreading methods_

The spreading methods in sections EW 16 to EW 22 (based on their terms) are available to use to spread income or expenditure for foreign currency ASAPs of non-IFRS taxpayers. Using them has to recognise the consistency and anti-arbitrage rules contained in sections EW 24, EW 25 and EW 26. However, as an integral part of the new tax rules it is intended that under section EW 20, Determination G29 is not used by non-IFRS taxpayers for foreign currency ASAPs entered into from the 2014–15 income year.[1](#01)

#### _Value of property or services_

#### Express "interest" foreign currency ASAPs (section EW 32(2C))

Section EW 32(2C) applies to the foreign currency ASAPs of non-IFRS taxpayers. It values property and services in foreign currency ASAPs at the aggregate of the amounts paid or payable in the foreign currency ASAPs. However, it excludes from the values of property or services amounts expressly provided for in the foreign currency ASAPs as "interest" (amounts paid or payable on account of the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of both the future and discounted values, on the rights date"). The exclusion is intended to apply to interest which has been agreed on a commercial basis where there are payments before or after the rights date. These amounts will be income or expenditure under foreign currency ASAPs and spread using an applicable spreading method.

Where interest is expressly provided for in a foreign currency ASAP subsection EW 32(2C) applies to exclude it from the value of property or services. Subsections EW 32(2D) and (2E) (see below) are therefore overridden by subsection EW 32(2C) where interest is expressly provided in foreign currency ASAPs. Otherwise the subsequent subsections will apply to value property or services in foreign currency ASAPs of non-IFRS taxpayers.

After the value of the property or services and the express interest in the foreign currency ASAP are identified in foreign currency an appropriate spreading method will be applied to spread the interest income or expenditure.

The conversion of the foreign currency value of the property or services into New Zealand dollars will use spot rates on the payments dates (see below). The value may include amounts for non-IFRS designated FX hedges if the non-IFRS taxpayer elects into that part of the new rules (see below).

#### 12-month ASAPs (section EW 32(2D))

Section EW 32 (2D) applies to foreign currency ASAPs of non-IFRS taxpayers which are "12-month ASAPs". The policy background is that significant pre-payments and delayed payments for property or services are in the nature of loans under the financial arrangements rules. Any interest component of the financial arrangement should be spread as income or expenditure for tax and not be included in the value of the property or services.

Section YA 1 has a new two-part definition of "12-month ASAP". A 12-month ASAP means an agreement for sale and purchase of property or services for which:

1.  An amount paid or payable for property or services is pre-paid by reference to the rights date and the pre-payment is 12 months or more before the rights date. A pre-payment by the purchaser of property under a foreign currency ASAP is a loan by the purchaser to the supplier and will result in assessable income to the purchaser under the financial arrangements rules. Limiting the definition to payments 12 months or more before the rights date should significantly restrict its application to a small number of foreign currency ASAPs of non-IFRS taxpayers and limit compliance for taxpayers. The limitation also reflects that there would not be a significant overall tax impact of pre-payments within 12 months of the rights date. As well, some pre-payments are excluded from the definition which should also help to restrict its application to relatively few foreign currency ASAPs. They are:
    1.  Pre-payments which are made for either making or constructing property, or providing services ("progress payments"). The exclusion of progress payments is to recognise that some commercial contracts provide for payments which are linked to the progress for making or constructing property, or providing services, and they are not in the nature of loans. Therefore they should be excluded from creating income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules for foreign currency ASAPs.
    2.  Deposits paid within the first three months of the contract which aggregate to 10 percent or less of the amount paid or payable for the property or services. This exclusion is intended to apply to commercially agreed deposits which are often included in agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. As with progress payments these amounts are not considered to be in the nature of loans; and
2.  An amount paid or payable for the property or services is delayed (the deferment) and the deferment is paid 12 months or more after the rights date. Some deferments are excluded from the definition. They are amounts or adjustments that are commonly commercially agreed and included in agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services:
    1.  Earnout amounts based on business performance after the sale of a business. The deferral of payment in such a case occurs because of uncertainty regarding the value of the business, not because there is some imputed interest component as between the parties that ought to be recognised for tax purposes.
    2.  Adjustments to amounts paid or payable for property services under warranties. These types of adjustments can take more than 12 months to determine.
    3.  Adjustments to amounts paid or payable for property or services on account of working capital. Sales and purchases of businesses often include these adjustments which can sometimes take more than 12 months to determine.

Property or services in a foreign currency ASAP which is a 12-month ASAP is valued at the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of the two, on the rights date, of the amounts paid under the foreign currency ASAP. The interest component will be income or expenditure under the foreign currency ASAP and spread appropriately using an applicable spreading method.

Calculating the future and/or discounted values for foreign currency ASAPs applies when the foreign currency ASAP is a 12-month ASAP. It is anticipated this will apply to relatively few foreign currency ASAPs which have qualifying pre-payments or deferred payments, or both. Qualifying pre-payments or deferred payments do not include the exclusions set out in a) and b) above, for example, progress payments and earnout amounts.

It is intended that only pre-payments and deferred payments 12 months or more before or after the rights date will result in interest income or expenditure. So when a foreign currency ASAP also has pre-payments or deferred payments within 12 months of the rights date, they are ignored for calculating the value of the property or services and any interest income and expenditure.

Calculation of the future value or discounted value amounts to be used to value property or services in foreign currency ASAPs which are 12-month ASAPs will be on usual commercial principles. Existing Determination G21A encompasses these principles in paragraphs 1.(2)(a)(ii) (Explanation - discounted value), 4.(4) (Principle - discounted value), 5.(2) (Interpretation - acceptable present value calculation), and 6.(2)-(4) (Method - present value calculations). The calculations are carried out using foreign currency and interest rates relevant for those foreign currencies. Determination G21A also refers to the use of Determinations G10B (Present Value Calculations) and G13A (Prices or Yields) where relevant. These three determinations provide appropriate guidance for calculating discounted/present values and include examples. While they do not expressly address future valuing, the principles to be applied are the same as for discounted/present valuing but in reverse. These principles are applied in the simple example provided below.

Once the value of the property or services and any income or expenditure has been calculated in foreign currency, Determinations G9A or G9C may be applied as applicable to spread the income or expenditure on the deemed loans. Using Determinations G9A and G9B to spread the income or expenditure will need to meet the consistency requirements for the same or similar financial arrangements in section EW 24. Other spreading methods in sections EW 16 to EW 22 may be applied as appropriate.

Converting the foreign currency values of property or services at spot rates and including amounts for non-IFRS designated FX hedges if relevant is on the same basis as set out for section EW 32(2C) (see below).

#### Express value: Foreign currency ASAPs not subject to 12-month ASAP (section EW 32(2E))

Section EW 32 (2E) applies to foreign currency ASAPs of non-IFRS taxpayers which are not "12-month ASAP(s)". The value of property or services is the value expressly provided in the agreement as paid or payable for the property or services. The value of property or services in commercial contracts is usually clearly stated and easy to obtain. It will usually be the aggregate of the total amounts paid or payable for the property or services under the contract.

Section EW 33B (non-IFRS designated FX hedges) may apply to valuing property or services in 12-month ASAPs. Its application will be the same as set out for "express interest" foreign currency ASAPs above.

Converting the foreign currency values of property or services at spot rates and including amounts for non-IFRS designated FX hedges if relevant is on the same basis as set out for section EW 32(2C) (see below).

#### _Use of spot exchange rates to convert amounts in foreign currency ASAPs_

Section EW 33C applies to convert amounts paid or payable in foreign currency to New Zealand dollars. It applies the spot exchange rate for the foreign currency on the payment dates to convert them to New Zealand dollars.

When no spot exchange rate is available because payments are deferred until a subsequent income year, two alternative spot rates can be used for the deferred payments. The spot exchange rate at the end of the current income year can be used in all cases. Alternatively, if amounts are paid or payable within 93 days of the end of the income year, the spot exchange rates on the dates they are paid or payable may be used. Differences between New Zealand dollar amounts converted at these spot exchange rates and the New Zealand dollar amounts converted at spot exchange rates when they are ultimately paid will be income or expenditure under foreign currency ASAPs.

#### _Non-IFRS designated FX hedges_

Section EW 33B may apply in relation to FX hedges. Section EW 33B(2) applies to foreign currency ASAPs when section EW 32(2C), (2D), or (2E) applies, and:

1.  The foreign currency ASAP relates to:
    1.  property that is depreciable property or revenue account property (such as trading stock); or
    2.  services which give rise to assessable income or deductions under the Income Tax Act 2007 outside the financial arrangements rules (which are on revenue account); and
2.  The taxpayer has made, at the time of filing a return of income for the income year in which they enter into the foreign currency ASAP or at the time of filing a return of income for an earlier income year, an irrevocable election in writing to apply section EW 33B(2) to all foreign currency ASAPs described in (a)(i) and (ii) above; and
3.  The person holds a non-IFRS designated FX hedge in relation to the foreign currency ASAP.

Section EW 33B(4) applies to modify the value of property or services in foreign currency ASAPs which are subject to section EW 33B(2). For non-IFRS taxpayers these are foreign currency ASAPs when section EW 32(2C), (2D), or (2E) applies. The value of the property or services in these foreign currency ASAPs is modified by the amount that would be the base price adjustment for the non-IFRS designated FX hedge in the absence of section EW 33B. Section EW 33B(4) works in tandem with section EW 33B(5) to obtain the value of property or services in foreign currency ASAPs when the elective non-IFRS designated FX hedging rules apply.

Section EW 33B(5) applies to amounts for non-IFRS designated FX hedges which are attributed to the value of property or services in foreign currency ASAPs. It excludes these amounts from being included in the spreading methods or the base price adjustments for the non-IFRS designated FX hedges. This prevents double counting these amounts for tax purposes. They are included in the value of the property or services and are not included in income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules. The intention is to allow non-IFRS taxpayers to ignore spreading of income and expenditure on non-IFRS designated FX hedges. It also provides that amounts for non-IFRS designated FX hedges included in the value of property or services is not taken into account for the base price adjustment calculations.

The elective hedging rules for non-IFRS taxpayers apply in a different manner to IFRS-designated hedging and all gains or losses on non-IFRS designated hedges are mandatorily included in the value of property or services. So where the overall gain or loss for a non-IFRS designated FX hedge is included in the value of property or services there is no income or expenditure to spread and the base price adjustment will be nil. The application of section EW 33B(4) and (5) is intended to provide those outcomes for non-IFRS taxpayers who elect into the rules for non-IFRS designated FX hedging.

The effects of section EW 33B for non-IFRS designated FX hedges described above apply to all foreign currency ASAPs under section EW 32(2C), (2D) and (2E). It is intended that amounts from non-IFRS designated FX hedges attributed to the value of property or services are attributed after the provisions of other sections are applied to arrive at the relevant values. Therefore sections EW 32(2C) or (2D) (interest) and EW 33C (spot exchange rates) are applied before amounts for non-IFRS designated FX hedges are attributed.

### Flowchart of new tax rules for foreign currency ASAPs for non-IFRS taxpayers

![Flowchart of new tax rules for foreign currency ASAPs for non-IFRS taxpayers](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/4/e/4ee06a14-6e18-4d61-b08e-c749909fde11/new-leg-aug14-image8.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214346&hash=F34EFA2799A4D9F744C43F356C37A905 "Flowchart of new tax rules for foreign currency ASAPs for non-IFRS taxpayers")

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example | **Future valuing and discounted valuing of amounts for valuing property in a foreign currency ASAP of a non-IFRS taxpayer** |
| A non-IFRS taxpayer agrees to buy trading stock for US$2 million for possession in 12 months' time (the rights date). Unusual payment terms are agreed (for the purposes of this example) where the taxpayer pays US$1 million when the contract is signed and US$1 million 12 months after the possession date. The US$1 million paid when the contract is signed is not a progress payment as defined.<br><br>The foreign currency ASAP is a 12-month ASAP as defined because it has at least one payment 12 months or more before or after the rights date. In this case the foreign currency ASAP has two payments which meet the definition.<br><br>Assume that an appropriate discount rate for discounted and future valuing purposes in this case is 4% a year.<br><br>To value the trading stock at the rights date, the taxpayer will future-value the first payment to the rights date and discount the last payment back to the rights date.  <br>From [Investopedia's future value calculator](http://www.investopedia.com/calculator/fvcal.aspx "This link will open in a new window")<br> the future value of US$1 million paid 12 months before the rights date for one 12-month period at 4% per period is US$1,040,000 approximately. This amount will be included in the value of the trading stock for tax. The taxpayer is treated as making a loan to the supplier of US$1 million from the date it is paid to the rights date. The deemed loan will earn US$40,000 interest over the 12-month period to the rights date.<br><br>The US$1 million paid 12 months after the rights date is discounted back to the rights date.  <br>From [Investopedia's discounted value/present value calculator](http://www.investopedia.com/calculator/pvcal.aspx "This link will open in a new window")<br> the discounted/present value of US$1 million paid 12 months after the rights date for one 12-month period at 4% per period is US$962,000 approximately. This amount will be included in the value of the trading stock for tax. The taxpayer is treated as receiving a loan for US$962,000 from the rights date to the final payment date. Interest of US$38,000 is paid on this deemed loan over that period.<br><br>As the term of the foreign currency ASAP runs for 24 months it will be relevant to two or three income years. However each deemed loan only affects two income years. Spreading the income and expenditure on the deemed loans for tax may be achieved by various appropriate spreading methods. Determinations G9A or G9B (section EW 20) could be applied to calculate how the income and expenditure is spread for each loan. They are both variants of YTM (yield to maturity) calculations (section EW 16) for financial arrangements in foreign currency. Section EW 17 (Straight-Line) may be applied if the total value of the taxpayer's financial arrangements is less than $1.85 million during the income year (which it would probably not be in this example).<br><br>The trading stock is valued at US$2,002,000 approximately (US$1,040,000 + US$962,000) for tax and this will be the tax cost of the stock. It will be converted to New Zealand dollars at the spot exchange rate on the rights date. Say the spot exchange rate at the rights date is 0.8500, the New Zealand dollar value of the stock is $2,355,294.<br><br>The taxpayer may hedge the US$1 million payment 12 months after the rights date and make an election under section EW 33B(2) to include hedging amounts in the value of the trading stock. It will include any gain or loss on the hedge in the value of the trading stock which has been converted to New Zealand dollars. Say there is a gain of $15,000 on the hedge; this will be included in the value of the stock to reduce the tax value of the stock to $2,340,294. The amount of the gain or loss on the hedge is not spread or included in the base price adjustment for the hedge. |     |

#### _Value of property or services relevant for non-financial arrangements rule_

Section EW 35 has been amended to include services. The omission of services from this section was an oversight when the previous legislation was extended to services. This change is treated as coming into force on 1 April 2008.

### Application date(s)

#### _General application - IFRS and non-IFRS taxpayers_

The new rules apply to foreign currency ASAPs entered into in the 2014–15 and later income years. This means that foreign currency ASAPs entered into before the 2014–15 income year remain subject to the old rules until base price adjustments are performed.

#### _Early adoption by IFRS taxpayers from the 2011-12 income year_

IFRS taxpayers can apply the new rules for foreign currency ASAPs entered into from the 2011–12 or subsequent income years. They apply the new rules for foreign currency ASAPs by filing the return of income for the relevant income year using the new rules.

The new rules will be applied to all foreign currency ASAPs entered into in that income year and all subsequent income years. The first income year to apply the new rules can be any of the 2011-12 to 2013-14 income years. They will continue to apply the old rules to foreign currency ASAPs entered into before the relevant income year.

#### _Foreign currency ASAPs entered into before the 2014-15 income year_

Sections EZ 75 and EZ 76 apply to foreign currency ASAPs entered into before the 2014-15 income year. They are "savings" positions for taxpayers who have filed returns of income for foreign currency ASAPs essentially based on the new rules for years prior to the 2014-15 year.

Section EZ 75 applies to IFRS taxpayers who have foreign currency ASAPs for which section EW 32 applies to value the property or services, the foreign currency ASAPs have been entered into before the end of the 2013–14 income year, and the taxpayers have filed returns of income for the foreign currency ASAPs in accordance with section EZ 75 for the 2013-14 income year and every earlier income year.

Under section EZ 75(2) the taxpayer, applying sections 66 and 67 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 as if in force, may:

1.  treat sections EW 32 and EW 33B as applying to the foreign currency ASAPs for the 2013-14 income year and every earlier income year; or
2.  treat section EW 32 as applying, but excluding section EW 33B. The value of the relevant property or services is modified by excluding amounts attributed under IFRS accounting rules from the value on account of IFRS-designated FX hedges.

Therefore, tax positions taken for foreign currency ASAPs which have followed the new IFRS rules are confirmed. Those positions will have been taken for all income years for the relevant foreign currency ASAPs. Those positions will have followed the IFRS accounting treatment (para (a) above), being based on either spot exchange rates or including designated hedging where relevant. However, where IFRS designated hedge accounting applies to a foreign currency ASAP the position taken may have excluded that effect (para (b) above) and effectively be based on spot exchange rates.

As well, subsection (3) of section EZ 75 modifies the treatment under subsection (2) for payments that have been made prior to the property or services being recognised in IFRS financial statements. These payments will have been recognised at their original New Zealand dollar amounts using the spot exchange rates at that time. This modification allows those payments to be revalued for tax using spot exchange rates at the point they are recognised in IFRS financial statements. Those payments will not have been revalued in the IFRS financial statements from the amounts recognised at the spot exchange rates when they were paid. However for tax the revaluation changes on the amounts paid have been taxed and the value of the property or services adjusted by the same amounts compared with the values recognised in IFRS financial statements.

Section EZ 76 applies to non-IFRS taxpayers who have foreign currency ASAPs for which section EW 32 applies to value the property or services; the foreign currency ASAPs have been entered into before the end of the 2013-14 income year; and the taxpayers have filed returns of income for the foreign currency ASAPs in accordance with section EW 76 for the 2013–14 income year and every earlier income year.

Under section EW 76(2) the taxpayer, applying sections 65 and 66 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 as if in force, may treat sections EW 32 and EW 33C as applying to the foreign currency ASAPs for the 2013-14 income year and every earlier income year. However, section EW 33B (non-IFRS designated FX hedges) is excluded from this application. This means that returns filed in those years for relevant foreign currency ASAPs based on spot exchange rates are confirmed.

1 After further analysis, it is considered that as currently drafted, the legislation does not give the intended result for cancelling the use of Determination G29 for new foreign currency ASAPs from the application dates. Legislative amendments are expected to be made in the next tax bill to achieve the intended result, with the application date for the amendments likely to be the same as the application dates for the new rules for foreign currency ASAPs.

Financial arrangements subject to Determinations G22 and G22A
=============================================================

Determination G22A, replacing Determination G22, denies artificial deductions on optional convertible notes being claimed by NZ subsidiaries of overseas companies.

On 26 September 2006 Determination G22 was replaced with Determination G22A. The stated purpose of the replacement was to deny artificial deductions on certain optional convertible notes (OCNs) that were being claimed by New Zealand subsidiaries of overseas companies. Many of these arrangements are currently the subject of litigation between Inland Revenue and the taxpayers concerned.

At that stage the tax Act in force was the Income Tax Act 2004. That Act and its replacement, the Income Tax Act 2007, provide that when a determination is cancelled" it remains in force for another four years for arrangements (the grandparented OCNs) that were in place when it was cancelled.

### Key features

Under black letter law, tax deductions are available in respect of the grandparented OCNs until G22A becomes effective in respect of the grandparented OCNs.

Specifically, for the grandparented OCNs there is a need to ensure that:

*   the change of spreading method adjustment that would have effect when the G22 expires for the grandparented OCNs in September 2010 does not claw back any deductions taken under G22 that are eventually allowed; and
*   when the base price adjustment (BPA) is eventually calculated on the grandparented OCNs, it does not claw back any deductions taken under G22 that are eventually allowed.

Sections EZ 52C and EZ 52D have been inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007 to achieve these objectives. Inland Revenue consulted extensively with interested parties and their advisors on the provisions necessary to amend the legislation.

### Detailed analysis

#### Changing from G22 to G22A

Section EZ 52C provides that when a taxpayer has been using G22 for a financial arrangement and is changing to G22A for that arrangement, a change of spreading method adjustment under sections EW 26 and EW 27 is not performed. Instead the taxpayer will apply the spreading method that has been followed in previous years under G22 for the portion of the income year up to the date of change in that income year. For the remainder of that income year and the following income years it will apply a spreading method under G22A to the financial arrangement. For the grandparented OCNs that means there will be no tax deductions for the remainder of the income year in which the change is made from G22 to G22A and for all subsequent income years.

#### BPA where both G22 and G22A have applied

As stated above, the BPA performed at maturity of a grandparented OCN to which both G22 and G22A have applied should not claw back any deductions taken under G22 that are eventually allowed. This has been achieved by making an adjustment to the consideration to be used in the BPA calculation for OCNs to which both G22 and G22A have applied.

The consideration for a financial arrangement in these situations has been amended by section EZ 52D for both the issuer and the holder in terms of G22 and G22A. The consideration in both cases is amended by an amount calculated as follows.

*   "X \- Z"
*   **where X":** is an amount equal to the items in Determination G22, clause 6(1), if that item were calculated in accordance with that determination at the time immediately before the change of spreading method described in section EZ 52C(2).  
      
    Item s in clause 6(1) of G22 is the present value of the cash flows in respect of the OCN and the person. In G22 item s is used as part of the calculation of the core acquisition price of a convertible note attributable to the option to buy or sell shares (which is an excepted financial arrangement).  
      
    Therefore the amount for X in Section EZ 52D is the present value of the cash flows in respect of the OCN and the person calculated up to and including the day before the taxpayer starts using G22A. It is effectively what items would be if the OCN were to start at that moment and consisted of only the cash flows which were to occur from that moment into the future. In respect of grandparented OCNs that moment is effectively midnight of the day being 25 September 2010, as G22A applies from 26 September 2010; and
*     
    
*   **where Z":** is an amount equal to the item s in Determination G22, clause 6(1), if that item were calculated in accordance with that determination at the time when the determination first applied. So Z is therefore the original amount of s (being the present value of the debt component of the OCN on its date of issue) when the taxpayer started applying G22 to the financial arrangement.

When calculating the BPA for a grandparented OCN, the amount of X - Z is added to all consideration paid/payable by the issuer and added to all consideration paid/payable to the holder. This will mean that the resulting BPA will not reverse deductions taken by the issuer under G22 that are eventually allowable. It will also mean that revenue returned by the holder is not reversed.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| For a grandparented OCN with a term of 10 years and a face value (FV) of $1 million, under G22 the warrant (equity) component of the OCN is determined to equal $491,650.71 in accordance with the formula "y \- s" in clause 6(1) of G22.  <br>y = $1,000,000 being the total consideration paid for the OCN  <br>s = the present value (PV) of the bond component  <br>  = $508,349.29 and is deemed to be a zero coupon bond discounted at the "specified rate" of 7%  <br>y - s = 1,000,000 \- 508,349.29 = 491,650.71 |     |

The table below sets out the accrual expenditure and tax book values for the OCN.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FV  |     | **1,000,000** |     |     |
| Term |     | 10 years |     |     |
| Specified rate |     | 7.00% |     |     |
| PV  |     | **508,349.29** |     |     |
|     | **\# of days** | **Starting tax book balance** | **Accrual expenditure** | **Ending tax book value** |
| 1/04/2004 |     | 508,349.29 | 35,584.45 | 543,933.74 |
| 1/04/2005 | 365 | 543,933.74 | 38,075.36 | 582,009.10 |
| 1/04/2006 | 365 | 582,009.10 | 40,740.64 | 622,749.74 |
| 1/04/2007 | 365 | 622,749.74 | 43,592.48 | 666,342.22 |
| 1/04/2008 | 366 | 666,342.22 | 46,643.96 | 712,986.18 |
| 1/04/2009 | 365 | 712,986.18 | 49,909.03 | 762,895.21 |
| 1/04/2010 | 365 | 762,895.21 | 25,591.74 | **788,486.95** |
| 25/09/2010 | 178 | 788,486.95 | 27,810.92 | 816,297.88 |
| 1/04/2011 | 187 | 816,297.88 | 57,140.85 | 873,438.73 |
| 1/04/2012 | 366 | 873,438.73 | 61,140.71 | 934,579.44 |
| 1/04/2013 | 365 | 934,579.44 | 65,420.56 | 1,000,000.00 |
| 1/04/2014 | 365 | 1,000,000.00 |     |     |
| Total deemed/implied interest |     |     | **491,650.71** |     |
| Accrual expenditure up to 25 Sep 2010 |     |     | 280,137.66 |     |

The deemed equity component of $491,650.71 is deducted from the total consideration paid for the OCN of $1 million, which leaves the amount attributable to the financial arrangement of $508,349.29 (1,000,000 \- 491,650.71 = 508,349.29).

Over the term of the arrangement the debt component of $508,349.29 tends towards its FV of $1,000,000 at maturity. The difference ($491,650.71) is deemed to be interest and is accrual expenditure calculated on a yield-to-maturity (YTM) basis for each year over the 10-year term of the arrangement.

For G22 deductions which are eventually allowable, the total accrual expenditure that should be allowed according to the example is $280,137.66. This is highlighted on the table above and is the amount, under a YTM calculation process, that would be allowed up to 25 September 2010.

The application of G22A works to disallow any deemed accrual expenditure from 26 September 2010, if the parties to a grandparented OCN are members of the same wholly owned group of companies and the conditions described in clause 4(3) of G22A are applicable.

However, without these amendments and given the definitions and methodology contained in G22A, when a BPA is calculated, the result would otherwise be accrual income to the issuer of $280,137.66.

The reason is that the consideration attributable to the bond component of the OCN would otherwise be $1,000,000, in combination with the accrual expenditure deduction in earlier income years of $280,137.66. This can be demonstrated as follows:  
BPA = consideration \- income + expenditure + amount remitted  
BPA = ( +1,000,000 \- 1,000,000) \- 0 + 254,545.92 + 0 = 254,545.92

The remedial changes in Section EZ 52D provide for a "consideration adjustment" defined as:  

*   "X \- Z"
*   **where "X"** is the PV of the debt component of the OCN as at 26 September 2010 (up to and including 25 September 2010). From the table above, this amount is shown in red, as $788,486.95.  
      
    **where "Z"** is what "S" would have been under G22 - in other words, the PV of the debt component of the OCN when it was issued at the start. In the example the PV of the bond on the issue date is $508,349.29.

So when the BPA is recast, the following outcome is achieved:  
BPA = ( +508,349.29 \- 788,486.95) \- 0 + 280,137.66 + 0 = 0

The result of the proposed changes is that the BPA will not claw back the $280,137.66 of accrual expenditure claimed up to and including 25 September 2010.

Note also that the G22 deduction eventually allowed for the part year when the change of method from G22 to G22A occurs (assuming a 31 March tax balance date) will be the $25,591.74 amount in the table above, which results from the application of section EZ 52C explained above.

Sections EZ 52C and EZ 52D apply so that a litigant and the Commissioner may not use the application of sections EZ 52C and EZ 52D on or after 26 September 2010 for their positions in respect of Determination G22.

### Application date

The commencement date for these amendments was 26 September 2010.

What financial institutions need to do
--------------------------------------

From 1 July 2017 Reporting New Zealand financial institutions (Reporting NZFIs) will need to:

*   carry out CRS due diligence by reviewing their financial accounts to identify accounts held and/or in certain circumstances controlled by relevant foreign tax residents
*   collect prescribed information about these people or entities (and accounts)
*   in certain circumstances report this information annually to Inland Revenue for exchange with jurisdictions that have automatic exchange of information (AEOI) exchange agreements with New Zealand.

Similarly, overseas financial institutions must identify their New Zealand tax resident account holders and certain controlling persons and report accounts to us through their local tax authorities if New Zealand has an AEOI exchange relationship with that jurisdiction.

Go to Inland Revenue's Special report on the automatic exchange of information:

What a financial institution is for CRS purposes
---------------------------------------------------

Reporting NZFIs will have CRS due diligence and reporting obligations, if they are an entity, that is, not an individual and if all of the following are satisfied:

*   the entity is a financial institution
*   the financial institution is a NZFI
*   the NZFI is a Reporting NZFI.

An 'entity' will be a financial institution based on the activities that it carries out or how it is managed. This covers both:

*   legal persons, for example, incorporated companies
*   legal arrangements, for example, trusts and partnerships.

This means that legal persons and legal arrangements can, depending on the circumstances, be financial institutions. However, the definition of 'entity' does not cover individuals.

There are two types of entities for CRS purposes - financial institutions and non-financial entities (NFEs).

Financial institutions
----------------------

There are four types of financial institutions covered by the CRS:

*   custodial institutions
*   depository institutions
*   investment entities
*   specified insurance companies.

For more information on the types of financial institutions, go to section 3.1 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

These types of financial institutions are broadly similar to FATCA. Apart from more obvious entities such as banks, this can also include non-bank deposit takers, collective investment entities, mutual funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, investment managers and advisors, and certain brokers and trusts (including some managed family trusts). You can find more information in the Inland Revenue guidance Section 11 'Application of CRS to particular types of entities and structures'.

Non-financial entities (NFEs)
--------------------------------

If an entity is not a financial institution it will by default be an NFE. There are two categories of NFEs - active NFEs and passive NFEs. The meaning of active and passive NFE is summarised in section 1.9 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

[Guidance on the Common Reporting Standard for Automatic Exchange of Information IR1048 2019 (PDF 1MB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir1000---ir1099/ir1048/ir1048-2019.pdf?modified=20240204231833&modified=20240204231833)

  
If an NFE is not active, it will by default be a passive NFE. NFEs will not have due diligence and reporting obligations. However, if they hold accounts with Reporting NZFIs they will have obligations to assist those institutions with their due diligence and reporting obligations. For passive NFEs, this would include providing information about their controlling persons.

When a financial institution is a 'New Zealand' financial institution
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A financial institution will be an NZFI if it is either a:

*   New Zealand resident entity for CRS purposes, excluding any branch located outside New Zealand
*   New Zealand branch of a foreign resident entity for CRS purposes.

The circumstances when a financial institution will be a NZFI are summarised in section 3.2 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

When a New Zealand financial institution is a 'Reporting' New Zealand financial institution
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An NZFI will be a Reporting New Zealand financial institution (Reporting NZFI) unless it is a Non-Reporting NZFI. The meaning of Non-Reporting financial institution is set out in Section VIII (B)(1) of the CRS. For more information about NZFIs go to section 3.3 to 3.6 of the Inland Revenue Guidance on the CRS.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue can determine that certain institutions that satisfy set criteria are Non-Reporting financial institutions.

1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] High-Wealth Individuals Research Project Financial Questionnaire Guide June 2022 Project purpose 1. The high-wealth individuals research project is a statistical research project that seeks to fill a gap in our knowledge of economic measures of income and effective tax rates of high-wealth New Zealanders. The project will improve the evidence base regarding how the tax system is currently operating, which is the first step in policy development, that of problem identification. A final report on the project’s findings will be made public in 2023. 2. No-one’s tax liability will be reassessed as part of this project; information provided for the project will not be used for any tax compliance or assessment purposes. The final report will not identify any individual or entity. Income and effective tax rate measures 3. This collection seeks further information to allow us to estimate the following measures of income for the high-wealth population group. These measures provide a broader concept of income than taxable income: • Gross cash income: bro adly taxable income plus untaxed receipts and realised capital gains. • Economic income: broadly taxable income plus untaxed receipts and realised and unrealised capital gains. 1 Economic income will be calculated with and without a measure of imputed rents from owner-occupied housing – that is the income a person could otherwise have earned from renting out their house. 4. An output from the project will be the calculation of average effective tax rates for the 2016 – 2021 income years. An effective tax rate (a measure of tax paid divided by a measure of income) helps us understand how much tax is paid by this group, relative to their income. 5. The tax paid included in the calculation will only be that which directly relates to the income included. For example, tax paid by entities will be included to the extent capital gains from ownership of entities are included. We will also estimate an effective tax rate measure including GST paid by the family. 1 Information on gifts and inheritances is sought as components of economic income. However, the irregular nature of gifts and inheritances means the six-year period may not be representative, so we will seek this information for a longer period. 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This questionnaire 6. You are receiving this questionnaire as you are in the project population. Consistent with the Entity Collection, you are required to provide the information in this request as either: • individual A (the person identified in the initial population); or • the d omestic partner of individual A. 7. This information is sought under section 17GB(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 17GB allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to collect information considered relevant for a purpose relating to the development of policy for the improvement or reform of the tax system. Each person who has received a notice is legally required to provide this information. You may request a tax agent or other representative to complete the form on your behalf although you remain ultimately responsible. 8. You are required to provide this information by 5 pm on 24 August 2022. 9. You must use reasonable endeavours to provide the information. It is acceptable to use reasonable estimates where you are unsure of certain information. State “unknown” where you cannot obtain the requested information or leave blank questions that are not applicable. 10. The exception to this is in relation to trusts. If you are unable to provide the information relating to a trust 2 because the information is not within your knowledge, possession or control then you are required to provide the name and contact details of the person(s) who does have this information in their knowledge, possession or control by 5pm on 4 July 2022. Further information is found in Appendix 1. 11. Key terms, bolded from here, are defined in the glossary at the end of this guide. The defined terms apply for the Financial Disclosure Statements as well. What is covered by this questionnaire? 12. The last questionnaire (Entity Collection) sought information on entities you and your family owned or had an interest in at any time between 2016 to 2021, where your interest was over a threshold. This information was needed as the income measures will include income (capital gains and distributions) your family received from the ownership of entities. 13. This questionnaire asks for a range of financial information on your investments, and trusts, to enable estimation of the income measures, the attribution of some sources of income to individuals and t he calculation of the effective tax rates. 14. Information is required to be provided in five Financial Disclosure Statements named: • Index • Real Property • Trusts 2 In particular, the information sought in the Trusts Disclosure Statement and the Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement relating to trusts. 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • Portfolio Interests • Entities. 15. Questions in the Trusts and Entities Disclosure Statements relate to a subset of entities required to be disclosed in the Entity Collection (whether or not previously disclosed). Direct interests in entities that were not in scope of the Entity Collection are disclosed in the Portfolio Interests Disclosure St atement. 16. Many of the questions are aimed at the estimation of capital gains and untaxed distributions or receipts. As these gains fall outside the tax system, we do not hold information on them. We will need to make assumptions to make estimates of capital gains income. Any income and expenditure estimates provided or made, will only be used for this research project. 17. The questions we ask will not cover all the assets you own. This is because we will utilise information available to us internally (tax data) or through public databases (listed company share prices, real property ownership and council property valuations) where reasonably practicable. Further, capital gains will only be estimated for financial assets, and not personal assets like art works. This is to minimise the compliance costs on you as much as possible, while still obtaining the data we require. 18. Our internal data includes financial statement information on the entities disclosed in the Entity Collection. We will use this information to determine the income from these entities. However, our internal information is not complete. In early July, we intend to request additional information, but only from those individuals for whom we have insufficient or inadequate financial statement information in relation to their entities to undertake our estimates. For this reason, this questionnaire is more focussed on your personal finances rather than financial statement information on the entities you own. How to complete this questionnaire 19. The required information is to be provided in the five Financial Disclosure Statements that are contained in the workbook distributed with this guide. The Detailed Instructions in this guide set out the requested information and tell you how to complete the Disclosure Statements. 20. Answers to questions should be provided in the light blue boxes within the workbook only. 21. The workbook contains custom formatting and formulas to assist you. We recommend using Office 365 (desktop application or Excel online). Alternatively, uploading to Google Sheets will allow you to complete the workbook. 22. For electronic Disclosure Statements, certain cells will be auto filled using information you provide to other questions, for example the Index Disclosure Statement. Your responses may also result in subsequent cells being blanked out where you are not required to answer the question. 23. Where you are asked to provide the number of entities or properties held, cells will appear for you to provide that number of entries. 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 24. For this functionality to assist you most, we recommend you provide information in the Disclosure Statements in the order provided, that is: Index, Real Property, Trusts, Portfolio Interests and Entities. You will need to select who the response is being completed for in the Index Disclosure Statement to commence. If you change who the Statements are being completed for or add additional trusts in the Trusts Disclosure Statement this will impact on later Di sclosure Statements. 25. The Detailed Instructions assume you are completing the Financial Disclosure Statements electronically. If you are completing in hard copy, you will need to write in information that is auto filled or has drop-down menus within the electronic version. 26. Information sought is in New Zealand dollars ($NZ). If a transaction or asset is denominated in foreign currency, convert to $NZ using an appropriate exchange rate from that period. If your income year or reporting date differs from that of any relevant investment account or entity, use the closest comparable date. 27. Questions that require you to provide a property address should follow this format: \[number\] \[street name\], \[suburb\], \[town/city\] \[postcode\]. Application to individual A, domestic partner and dependent children 28. If you are individual A, you are required to complete all the Financial Disclosure Statements for yourself and any dependent children, including providing information on in-scope disclosed trusts for which you or a dependent child is a settlor, appointer or beneficiary. Some questions are only required to be answered by individual A. 29. If you are the domestic partner, you only need to provide information for yourself (not your dependent children) and in-scope disclosed trusts for which you are a settlor, appointer, or beneficiary. 30. Only financial information relating to the interests of qualifying dependent children needs to be disclosed for the Entities and Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statements. Financial information relating to the interests of all dependent children is required to be included in the Trusts Disclosure Statement. If you have more than one dependent child, provide aggregate figures for all relevant children ( in all Disclosure Statements). 3 31. Individual A and the domestic partner may complete the Financial Disclosure Statements jointly or separately (that is either in one workbook or two). In either case, the interests of each of the following needs to be identified (see paragraphs 28-30): • individual A • qualifying dependent children (all dependent children for the Trusts Disclosure Statement) • domestic partner • an in-scope disclosed trust ( in the Trusts and Portfolio Interests D isclosure Statements). 3 Qualifying dependent children are dependent children with assets or income over a threshold (see glossary). 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 32. For interests held jointly by individual A and their domestic partner, you should each separately disclose your best estimate of your share of the joint asset or transaction. For entities this will be in the proportion specified in your Disclosure Statements submitted for the Entity Collection. 4 33. The Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement must be completed for the portfolio interests of in-scope disclosed trusts ( as well as family members), subject to paragraph 10. In the Entities Disclosure Statement you are only required to provide information on entities that meet the scope criteria that you hold directly. More information 34.

In the Index Disclosure S tatement, you are required to identify who the questionnaire is being completed for (to start, select either ‘Individual A’ or ‘Domestic Partner’ for a separate response or select ‘Joint response’, then provide the identifying information). You are also required to provide information of gifts, inheritances, and expenditure in this Disclosure Statement. Questions 41. You are required to provide your best estimate for the information on gifts, inheritances, and expenditure. You are not required to undertake an independent valuation or undertake a detailed financial review to answer these questions. Gifts and inheritances 42. For individual A and the domestic partner (as relevant), provide an estimate of the total nominal value of gifts and inheritances received from relatives, per decade. The total amount should be rounded to the nearest $1,000,000 per decade (you may ignore a single receipt below $25,000 in determining if the total amount meets the threshold). 5 43. The amount you received as gifts or inheritances should include amounts you received in trust distributions from testamentary trusts or trusts settled by a relative. 6 44. This question applies for the decades commencing 1970-2010. Expenditure on goods and services 45. Only individual A is required to provide expenditure information. Questions on expenditure will not be visible if you are completing a domestic partner only response electronically. 46. If you are individual A, provide an estimate of your family’s annual expenditure in the 2019 income year on goods and services rounded to the nearest $50,000. 5 A total amount below $500,000 in a decade does not need to be reported. 6 Distributions from trusts are also requested as part of the Trusts Disclosure Statement but only for the reporting period. You should include distributions from trusts in this period in both responses. 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Expenditure on housing costs and motor-vehicles 47. If you are individual A, provide the total amount (rounded to the nearest $10,000) you have allowed in your annual expenditure estimate for housing costs. This includes rent, principal and interest payments on mortgages, housing maintenance, property insurance premiums, and property rates. 48. Als o provide the total amount (rounded to the nearest $10,000) you have allowed in your annual expenditure estimate for new or second-hand vehicles (cars and motorcycles). Expenditure on selected items 49. If you are individual A, provide the total amount (rounded to the nearest $10,000) you have allowed in your annual expenditure estimate for: • overseas travel (flights and accommodation), • goods and services purchased while overseas, • non-mortgage loan payments (principal and interest), • life insurance premiums and • financial services fees. Why we need this information 50. The purpose of the inheritances and gifts question is to get a better understanding of the full economic income of the individuals in the population. Other surveys of income, such as the Household Economic Survey, seek information on inheritances and gifts. Given the irregular nature of gifts and inheritances we ask for this information over a longer period. 51. The purpose of the questions on expenditure is to get a better understanding of the expenditure of the family on goods and services for the purpose of estimating the amount incurred in GST. We ask for you to disclose expenditure on specific items that do not incur GST, and on specific durables. GST paid will be included in one of the effective tax rate measures. Part 2: Real Property Disclosure Statement Scope 52. In the Real P roperty Disclosure Statement, you are required to provide information on New Zealand residential and non-residential property owned by individual A or the domestic partner. Questions Section A: Primary residence in New Zealand 53. Only individual A is required to complete Section A. 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Address of family’s primary residence in New Zealand 54. If you are individual A, provide the address of the family’s primary residence in New Zealand during the reporting period. Only provide this information if a family member or disclosed trust owned the property (otherwise leave blank). 55. If the family had more than one residence over the reporting period, the primary residence is the property they stayed in the longest. If family members lived in different properties, it is the property that individual A lived in for the longest total time during the reporting period. Average value of family’ s mortgage on the primary residence 56. If you are individual A, provide the average nominal value of the family’s total mortgage secured against t he primary New Zealand residence during the reporting period. If an average cannot be estimated, provide the estimated value of the mortgage as at the end of the 2018 income year. Section B: New Zealand property Property held by you in only a trustee capacity 57. Provide the total number and the address(es) of New Zealand residential or non-residential property where you were named on the title, during the reporting period, but held the property only in the capacity of trustee, where the trust is not a disclosed trust. Property held by a bare trustee or other nominee on your behalf 58. Provide the total number and address(es) of New Zealand residential or non-residential property for which the title is held by another person in the capacity of a bare trustee or nominee on your behalf at any time during the reporting period. Exclude any residential property disclosed in the Entity Collection. 59. Provide the first and final income years the property was held on your behalf in the reporting period. If the property was held on your behalf before 2016, record “2016” for the first year held. If the property was still held on your behalf beyond the end of the 2021 income year, leave the final year blank. 60. Provide your average percentage ownership interest in the property for these years. If you do not have an accurate record, provide your best estimate. Why we need this information 61. The purpose of Section A is to enable an estimate of the imputed rent on your primary residence (based on your net equity in the property). We will use public databases to value your primary residence and do not require you to do so. 62. We will source information on your ownership of real property from public databases. However, this data will include ownership interests on property titles, which may in fact only be in a trustee capacity, or alternatively, a nominee/bare trustee may be on the title of a property held on a family member’s behalf. Section B questions seek to identify these properties to ensure we only attribute capital gains from property ownership to the family where a family member benefits from the property. 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Part 3: Trusts Disclosure Statement Scope 63. Information on a trust must be provided in the Trusts Disclosure Statement in respect of any trust that was an in-scope disclosed trust in the reporting period. 64. Where the domestic partner is submitting separate Financial Disclosure Statements, they need to complete both Section A and C of this Disclosure Statement in respect of their interests for in-scope disclosed trusts. They also need to complete Section B i n respect of their in-scope disclosed trusts, unless they confirm (‘yes/no’) that Section B is being completed by individual A for that trust. 65. You are not required to disclose information on charitable trusts, widely held or listed investment trusts, or unit trusts in this Disclosure Statement. Include investments in widely held, listed investment and unit trusts within the Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement. 66. Follow the instructions in paragraph 10 if any of the information requested in relation to trusts is not within your knowledge, possession, or control. Questions Section A: In-scope disclosed trusts identifying information Trust name & IRD number; family members’ relationships to trust 67. Provide the total number of in-scope disclosed trusts being reported on, and the name and IRD number (if applicable) of these trusts. 68. Provide ‘yes’ if, over the reporting period, either all beneficiaries or all appointers were family members, or both, and ‘no’ otherwise. If ‘yes’, certain other questions are not required to be answered. 69. Provide ‘yes/no’ as to whether individual A, domestic partner, or any dependent children (as relevant for a joint/separate response) were a beneficiary, settlor or appointer of the in-scope disclosed trust in the reporting period (this will auto-fill Section C to make completing the Statements easier for you). Section B: Trust information Real property owned by the trust 70. Provide the total number and the address(es) of New Zealand residential or non-residential property owned by an in-scope disclosed trust during the reporting period. Do not include property disclosed in either the Entity Collection or in the Real Property Disclosure Statement. 71. The address(es) is recorded at the bottom of the Trusts Disclosure Statement. 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Total annual settlements on the trust 72. For each in-scope disclosed trust, provide the total annual market value (at the time) of settlements made on the trust for each relevant year. This includes settlements made by family members and those outside the family. 73. If there was consideration or value provided in return for the settlement, estimate the net value received by the trust. It will be nil if the trust provided equal or greater value than it received. 74. A set tlement for the purposes of this question can be made by someone other than a “settlor” as defined in the trust deed. Provide your best estimate where the settlement is not in money and there is no listed price. Total liabilities of the trust 75. Provide the total balance of all debts that each in-scope disclosed trust owed (including debts to settlors and beneficiaries) as at the start of each income year from 2016-2022. 7 Total annual trust distributions from the trust 76. You are not required to answer this question if either all beneficiaries or all appointers of the trust were family members, or both, as disclosed in Section A. 77. Provide the total trust distributions made from an in-scope disclosed trust in each relevant year. This includes distributions made to family members and to those outside the family. Proportion of appointers within the family 78. You are not required to answer this question if either all beneficiaries or all appointers of the trust were family members, or both, as disclosed in Section A. 79. Provide the current (or most recent) proportion of appointers that are in the family to all appointers (as a percentage). Section C: Individuals’ interests in trusts Total annual untaxed trust distributions received by the family member 80. Provide the total annual untaxed trust distributions made by the in-scope disclosed trust to the family member for each relevant year. Untaxed trust distributions of a nominal value less than $10,000 in an annual period do not need to be disclosed. 7 The opening value for 2022 is required to measure the change in value for the 2021 income year. 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The family member’s share of trust income 81. You are not required to answer this question if either all beneficiaries or all appointers of the trust were family members, or both, as disclosed in Section A. 82. Provide the share of trust income that the family member is presently, or most recently, entitled to according to the trust deed or other documentation. This question is most applicable to fixed trusts. 83. If the trust deed is silent on the share of income but provides for a share of assets, then provide the share of assets for this question. If the trust deed or documentation does not specify any share of income or assets to beneficiaries, then leave blank. The family member’s share of trust assets if the trust was to be wound-up 84. You are not required to answer this question if either all beneficiaries or all appointers of the trust were family members, or both, as disclosed in Section A. 85. Provide the share of trust assets that the family member would receive if the trust was to be wound-up, according to the most recent trust deed or other documentation. If the trust deed or documentation does not specify individuals’ shares on wind-up, then leave blank. Why we need this information 86. The Trusts Disclosure Statement and other questions on trusts have two purposes. 87. First, to allow us to use different approaches to attribute capital gains income from the trust to the family and individual A in the estimates of economic income. Attributing income of trusts to individuals is inherently uncertain and often the trust itself may not know how income will be distributed. F or this reason, we will use multiple methods to model different potential outcomes based on the following concepts: • Whether all the trust’s beneficiaries are members of the family. • Whether the family controls the trust, ascertained by the power of appointment. • Individuals’ rights to the assets were the trust to be wound-up. • Proportion of distributions received or receivable by the individual (actual or based on the trust deed). 88. Second, to determine the total income the family received from the trust from distributions and capital gains on the assets in the trust. You are required to complete the Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement for in-scope disclosed trusts, and provide certain balance sheet information for trusts, to enable an estimate of the capital gains on assets held in trust. 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Part 4: Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement Scope 89. The Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement must be completed for all family members (except for children, only the interests of qualifying dependent children (in aggregate) need to be disclosed). It must also be completed for the portfolio interests of in-scope disclosed trusts. 90. An in-scope disclosed trust’s portfolio interests are those portfolio interests held directly by the trustees of the trust in their capacity as trustee. Do not include the in-scope disclosed trust’s portfolio interests in any family member’s portfolio. 91. Where the domestic partner is submitting separate Financial Disclosure Statements, they need to complete this Disclosure Statement in respect of their own bank account and portfolio interests. They also need to complete this Disclosure Statement in respect of their in-scope disclosed trusts, except for a trust for which individual A is providing the information in their response (you may leave blank for such a trust). 92. Follow the instructions in paragraph 10 if any of the information requested in relation to trusts is not within your knowledge, possession, or control. 93. Portfolio interests are defined fully in the glossary. They are direct interests in financial investments, such as investments in equities and debt instruments ( including direct interests in entities that do not meet the scope criteria). Portfolio interests exclude your ownership interest in a CFC or in an entity that meets the scope criteria. 94. Cash and cash equivalents held in investment accounts are included as portfolio interests. Bank accounts not held in investments accounts ( e.g., your personal savings and chequing accounts) are included as bank accounts, see below, rather than being a portfolio interest. 95. We have structured the Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement to align with common portfolio summaries or Performance Reports you may receive from investment brokers. This is designed to make providing this information easier. Questions Interest being disclosed 96. Whose interest is being disclosed will be auto-filled (for electronic Disclosure Statements) using the information you provided in the Index Disclosure Statement for family members and the Trusts Disclosure Statement for in-scope disclosed trusts. Otherwise provide. Bank account balance Total net balance of b ank accounts 97. Provide the total net balance of all bank accounts of the family member being reported on (excluding those in investment accounts included in your portfolio interests), as at the start of 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] each income year from 2016-2022. Only combined amounts exceeding $500,000 need to be reported, rounded to the nearest $100,000. 98. Provide the total net balance of all bank accounts of each in-scope disclosed trust (excluding those in investment accounts included in the trust’s portfolio interests), as at the start of each income year from 2016-2022. 8 A mounts should be rounded to the nearest $100,000. 9 99. Include both domestic and foreign held bank balances. Portfolio interests Opening and closing market value of portfolio interests 100. Provide the total market value of all your portfolio interests at the start or end of each relevant year (see paragraph 104), rounded to the nearest $500,000. 10 This requires you to add all of the market values held in: • investment accounts, and • directly held portfolio interests, including o debt and ownership interests in entities that do not meet the scope criteria, and o debt interests in entities that do meet the scope criteria. 101. For investments held in investment accounts, use the total reported value of all assets in the account (including cash or cash-equivalents held in that account). If you have portfolio interests held directly by you outside of these accounts, such as shares held in your name where dividends are paid directly to you (including your bank account) instead of a securities account, also add the market values of these investments. 102. For interests that do not have a reported market value, such as an interest in an unlisted entity that does not meet the scope criteria, provide an estimate of the market value. You are not required to obtain an independent valuation of these assets. 103. Ownership interests in entities that do not meet the scope criteria do not need to be included in the total amount provided where the entity has a book value of equity of less than $50,000 as at the reporting date of the relevant year. 104. Provide the opening total market value of your portfolio interests for the start of the 2016 income year and the closing market value (end of year) for each re levant year. The opening market value for income years 2017-2021 will be auto-filled using the amount you disclosed as the previous year’s closing market value for electronic Disclosure Statement. 8 The opening value for 2022 is required to measure the change in value for the 2021 income year. 9 This means only total amounts over $50,000 need to be reported. 10 This means only total amounts over $250,000 need to be reported. 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Annual contributions to portfolio interests 105. Provide the total amount of new capital you contributed to your portfolio interests for each relevant year. This should not include realised amounts reinvested or the reinvestment of dividends and interest included in the closing value. 106. For investments held in investment accounts, provide the amounts you contributed (i.e., deposited) during the income year, regardless of what was done with the money once in the accounts. Include contributions made by an employer (or another person) on your behalf, such as with KiwiSaver. For directly held investments, include amounts paid by you to purchase such investments that represent additional capital, i.e., excluding amount reinvested per above. Annual withdrawals of portfolio interests 107. Provide the sum of the amount you received as a withdrawal (i.e., transfer out) from your portfolio interests for each relevant year, excluding amounts reinvested into that portfolio. For example, if you were paid a dividend or interest, or sold an interest, and reinvested it (such that it is included in the closing balance value), this should not be treated as a withdrawal. Why we need this information 108. The portfolio interests and individuals’ bank account information will help us to determine the income of the family members from investing in portfolio investments. We will calculate the income from portfolio interests by taking the portfolio closing value less the portfolio opening value (adjusted for contributions and withdrawals). 109. Reinvested dividends and interest from portfolio investments will be included in the closing value of the portfolio. This makes providing portfolio information easier for you. However, this means we need to ask you for information on dividends and interest (imputed from your bank balance) outside of your portfolio interests. This is because the portfolio approach means we cannot use internal information on dividends and interest, as it is aggregated and includes dividends and interest from both inside and outside your portfolio. Part 5: Entities Disclosure Statement Scope 110. The Entities Disclosure Statement must be completed for the interests of all family members (except for children - only the interests of qualifying dependent children (in aggregate) need be disclosed) in respect of each in-scope entity. 111. An entity is within scope of this Entities Disclosure Statement if it was required to be disclosed as a company, partnership or other entity (excluding a trust) in the Entity Collection, 11 and a family member had a direct interest in the entity during the reporting period. This is a subset of entities disclosed in the Entity Collection (noting that for companies, only New Zealand companies were required to be disclosed in the Entity Collection). 11 See the scope criteria and other requirements in entity-questionnaire-guide-feb-2022.pdf (ird.govt.nz). 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 112. Information on trusts (including trusts’ holdings of entities) and portfolio interests is provided in other Disclosure Statements and does NOT need to be provided in this D isclosure Statement. Questions Section A: Entity details Number of entities and identifying information 113. Provide the total number of entities you are reporting on, and the name and IRD number of these entities. Select the entity type (company, partnership, other (non-trust)) from the drop-down menu. Entities fully included in the Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement or publicly listed 114. Provide ‘ yes’ if a company within the scope of this Entities Disclosure Statement was publicly listed on the New Zealand S tock Exchange during the entire reporting period. Alternatively, provide ‘yes’ if your ownership interest in an entity was fully included as a portfolio interest in the Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement. Otherwise provide ‘no’. If you answered ‘yes’, you do not need to complete the remaining questions for this entity. If you answered ‘no’ because only part of your ownership interest is reported as a portfolio interest, provide information on the remaining part in the Entities Disclosure Statement. Family member who has a direct ownership interest in the entity 115. Specify ( by selecting ‘yes/no’) which family member had a direct ownership interest in the entity you are disclosing. For electronic Disclosure Statements this will auto-fill further cells. Section B: Transactions involving entities Entity distributions received 116. Provide the total value of entity distributions (excluding imputation credits), not including distributions received from the sale of shares or other ownership interests in the entity, the family member received from the entity for each relevant year. Capital invested in the entity by the family member 117. Provide the amount of new paid-in capital to the entity provided by the family member in any relevant year e.g., payment for shares issued by the entity. P ut $0 for any year no capital was invested. This question is most relevant for businesses that have been recapitalised. Percent of shares (or other ownership interest) that were sold or purchased 118. Pro vide the percent of shares (or ownership interest) of the entity each family member sold or purchased during any relevant year. Put ‘0%’ if your ownership interest was unchanged during the year. If shares (or other ownership interest) were sold, put a minus sign in front of the figure. 119. You should include where you sold shares (or other ownership interest) to the entity, but d o not include acquisitions of new shares issued by the entity (include this in the Capital invested question, see paragraph 117). 16 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 120. The percent of shares (or other ownership interest) sold or purchased should be calculated in reference to the total shares outstanding (or other ownership interest) prior to the transaction. Consideration paid and received 121. Provide the value of consideration in each relevant year from the sale/purchase of shares (or other ownership interest). Consideration received or paid includes cash, the value of debt forgiven, or any other assets received or paid. Why we need this information 122. The purpose of the Entities D isclosure Statement is to measure the realised capital gains and distributions received directly by the family from investing in non-portfolio entities. The tax paid at the entity level associated with these investments will be determined by reviewing the tax records of the entity. We require information on all entity distributions, including taxable distributions, as we only hold aggregate, rather than entity specific dividend information internally (see ‘Why we need this information’, Portfolio Interests Disclosure Statement). 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Appendix 1: providing alternative contact details for an in-scope disclosed trust 1. If you are unable to provide any of the information sought about in-scope disclosed trusts as it is not within your knowledge, possession or control, you are required to provide the name of a person who does hold that information. 2. 3. 4. The form asks for the trust’s name, IRD number, the name and contact details for the contact person(s), and their role or connection to the trust (i.e., trustee, lawyer etc). The form also asks you to specify which individual(s) or additional trusts the disclosure relates to. 5. 6. This information is due by 5pm on 4 July 2022. If we do not hear from you by this date, then we will assume that you will be able to provide all the required information by 24 August 2022. 7. This enables us to ask the person who has the relevant knowledge to answer questions relating to the in-scope disclosed trust.  s18(c)(i) s18(c)(i) s18(c)(i)

Hōtaka pūtea Wāhi kē Financial Schedules - Non-departmental
===========================================================

Why we include the non-departmental schedules
---------------------------------------------

Inland Revenue collects and distributes money on behalf of the Crown and the following non-departmental schedules provide information on the financial extent of these activities. The Commissioner is accountable for the financial management of these activities.

In 2020-21, we collected $94.5 billion of revenue on behalf of New Zealand to fund government programmes. We paid $6.1 billion in non-departmental expenses, including Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver member tax credits, interest, the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payment and other expenses.

What non-departmental schedules are and are not
-----------------------------------------------

The non-departmental schedules are prepared in accordance with relevant accounting policies and the Treasury instructions to disclose non-departmental activities.

The non-departmental schedules do not, and are not intended to, constitute a set of financial statements and, therefore, do not include elements that would normally be expected to be found in financial statements, such as details of a surplus or deficit or ‘Statement of financial position’.

Hōtaka pūtea Wāhi Kē Financial schedules - Non-departmental (2023)
==================================================================

Why we include the non-departmental schedules
---------------------------------------------

Te Tari Taake, Inland Revenue collects and distributes money on behalf of the Crown, and the following non-departmental schedules provide information on the financial extent of these activities. The Commissioner is accountable for the financial management of these activities.

2022-23 non-departmental tax revenue totalled $104 billion and comprises tax returns and accruals. The majority of this amount is expected to be collected and will be used to fund government programmes. 2022-23 non-departmental expenses totalled $7 billion, including Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver Tax Credits, interest and other expenses.

What non-departmental schedules are and are not
-----------------------------------------------

The non-departmental schedules are prepared in accordance with relevant accounting policies and Te Tai Ōhanga, the Treasury instructions to disclose non-departmental activities.

The non-departmental schedules do not, and are not intended to, constitute a set of financial statements and therefore do not include elements that would normally be expected to be found in financial statements such as details of a surplus or deficit or Statement of Financial Position.

[Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Act 2015](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-kiwisaver-homestart-and-remedial-matters-act-2015 "Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Act 2015")

First home withdrawal available for homes on Māori land
=======================================================

2015 legislative changes make it clear that a first home withdrawal under the KiwiSaver member rules is available to purchase or build a home on M?ori land.

_Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, clauses 8(3B), 8(6) and 8(7)(c)(iii)_

Changes have been made to make it clear that a first home withdrawal under the KiwiSaver member rules is available to purchase or build a home on Māori land.

### Background

Previously a first home withdrawal under the KiwiSaver rules was only available for the purchase of "an estate in land". This requirement generally excluded people with an interest in Māori land because they are not purchasing an "estate".

The rules also stated that a member with a previous interest in land, including any interest as a tenant-in-common, was not eligible for a first home withdrawal. A narrow interpretation of the rules automatically excluded Māori land owners because of the tenancy-in-common status of Māori land, despite the fact that the individual interest is extremely small and generally cannot be economically realised.

A change to specifically recognise interests in Māori land was required to align with the original policy intent of KiwiSaver, and the policy intent of the Kāinga Whenua funding programmes and the Government's Māori home ownership and land use goals set out in He Whare Āhuru He Oranga Tāngata - the Māori Housing Strategy and He Kai Kei Aku Ringa - The Crown-Māori economic growth partnership.

### Key features

First home withdrawals can be made to purchase a dwellinghouse on Māori land.

The dwellinghouse must be intended as the principal place of residence for the member.

Prior ownership of a dwellinghouse on Māori land and an existing interest in Māori land is not a bar to accessing a first home withdrawal.

Evidence of the right to occupy the land is required, such as a licence to occupy or an occupation order.

### Application date

The amendment came into force for first home withdrawal applications made on and after 1 April 2015.

### Detailed analysis

The amendment has been made, in response to evidence indicating that applications for first home withdrawals to purchase or build a home on Māori land were generally being declined because the first home withdrawal was tied to the purchase of "an estate in land".

### _Meaning of "estate in land"_

"Estate" is defined in the KiwiSaver rules as "a fee simple estate, a leasehold estate or a stratum estate" and comprises the home _and_ the land on which the home is situated (or the right to use the land). This requirement generally excludes people with an interest in Māori land because while they have a right to use the land on which the home is situated, they do not generally purchase the land or pay for the right to use it. Only the home is purchased and the land usually remains with all of the owners as Māori land.

The previous rules stated that members with a previous or existing interest in an estate in land were not generally eligible for a first home withdrawal. A narrow interpretation of this rule automatically excluded Māori land owners because of their existing interest in an estate in land due to the tenancy-in-common status of Māori land. This rule was a barrier despite the fact that the individual interest in the estate in land is extremely small and generally cannot be economically realised.

### _Inclusion of "dwellinghouse"_

It is now possible to make a first home withdrawal in respect of a dwellinghouse on Māori land. The dwellinghouse must be the principal place of residence for the member or the member and the member's family and the member must have evidence of the right to occupy the land on which the dwellinghouse is situated.

### _Evidence of right to occupy_

In addition to the existing conditions listed in clause 8(7), the fund manager may require from the member's solicitor or conveyancing practitioner evidence of the right to occupy the land. This could be a licence to occupy or an occupation order.

_Previous ownership_

The existing eligibility rules provide that a KiwiSaver member can access KiwiSaver funds to purchase a first home if the member:

*   has not made a withdrawal from any KiwiSaver scheme to buy a home;
*   has never owned a property (this does not include previously holding an estate in land as a bare trustee or a leasehold estate); or
*   can demonstrate that they are in the same financial situation as a first-home buyer.

Under the amendments, the first of those eligibility rules is unchanged but the second eligibility rule has been adapted to deal with the special circumstances relating to interests in Māori land.

If a person holds or has held an estate in land which is an interest in Māori land, it is ignored under clauses 8(3)(b)(ii) and 8(3B)(b)(ii). That includes:

*   a dwellinghouse on Māori land (which is broadly analogous to a leasehold estate, which is already excluded from the eligibility rules under clause 8(5)(ab)); and
*   an existing interest in Māori land, such as an interest as a tenant-in-common, which cannot be economically realised.

If the person with an interest in Māori land holds any other estate in land, such as a fee simple estate, they are not eligible for a first home withdrawal unless they can demonstrate that they are in the same financial situation as a first-home buyer. This approach is consistent with the existing eligibility rules.

First-time landlords in Christchurch and Auckland reminded not to be caught out
===============================================================================

**04 June 2014**

First time landlords who rent out temporary accommodation in Christchurch and Auckland are being reminded they have to pay tax on their rental income.

More than 44,000 households rented their home in the greater Christchurch area according to the 2013 Census and housing demand in the city is expected to reach its peak in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Andrew King, Executive Officer for the New Zealand Property Investors' Federation said accommodation in Christchurch is under pressure with people being displaced from their homes and workers moving to the city to help with the rebuild.

"More people are renting out all or parts of their properties. In Auckland there is a high demand for rentals and a constant turnover of landlords.

"Many people renting out accommodation may be first-time landlords and some may not be aware they have to pay tax. We welcome the work Inland Revenue is doing with first-time landlords and believe this is much needed," said Mr King.

Rental income is taxable, including income received from residential property, a room in your own home, sleep outs, caravans and holiday homes.

In Christchurch many are renting out accommodation for only four or five weeks while people are having their homes renovated.

Inland Revenue Group Manager Investigations and Advice, Patrick Goggin said people on salary and wages may not have completed a tax return before and may not know they need to file an income tax return if receiving rental income.

"Inland Revenue is working closely with new and temporary landlords in Christchurch and Auckland to help them understand their tax requirements. Taxes help to provide important public services like hospitals, education and the Government's contribution to the Christchurch rebuild.

"People who are thinking of renting out accommodation should find out what tax they'll need to pay so they can include it in their plans. If landlords have been renting out property for some time and have not saved their tax payments they may find themselves under some pressure and we would encourage them to speak to us as soon as possible," said Mr Goggin.

Income tax returns are due to Inland Revenue by 7 July and can quickly and easily be filed using myIR on Inland Revenue's website.

First wave of automatic tax refunds to be released
==================================================

**20 May 2019**

More than 2.5 million New Zealanders will receive their first ever automatic tax assessment over the next two months with the first batch going out today.

From Monday 20 May through to the end of July, Inland Revenue will be letting salary and wage earners know if they have a refund owing, a bill to pay or neither of these.

Deputy Commissioner Sharon Thompson says refunds will be going out in batches rather than all at the same time.

“This is our first year issuing automatic assessments and we want to make sure everything goes smoothly. That’s why we’re taking a little extra time this year and we will review whether we can speed up the process for 2020.

“We’ll be contacting customers to let them know about their assessments by email or through a letter in the post.

“The main thing to remember is that if you have any doubt about whether that communication is genuine, then type ird.govt.nz into your browser and access our secure online services portal myIR from there. If you don’t have a myIR account, then it’s a good idea to register for one, as that’s where all your information is securely displayed.

“There could be scammers out there trying to direct you to other websites so we encourage everyone to be vigilant. If you make your own way to ird.govt.nz, you can be sure you’re in the right place.”

\[embed width="480" height="270" class="leftAlone" thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWgK7es5m78/hqdefault.jpg?r"\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWgK7es5m78\[/embed\]

Tax assessments are automatic for the first time

Ms Thompson says an estimated 1.65 million New Zealanders are likely to have a refund against their name – around seven times more than the number who will receive a bill.

“Most customers will see that money deposited straight into their bank account and won’t have to lift a finger.

“After receiving an assessment, we expect it will take up to two days before any refund reaches a customer’s account.”

Latest estimates show that around 240,000 customers can expect to receive a tax bill and that may come as a surprise to customers who haven’t had one before. They will have plenty of time to pay with a due date of 7 February 2020 or they can set up an instalment arrangement.

Ms Thompson says automatic tax assessments are part of Inland Revenue’s efforts to make tax more straight forward.

“We expect the amount paid out annually in refunds and the number of bills to pay will decline over the coming years as we now have a system that can recognise when someone is over- or under-paying tax and can help customers correct that.”

Five members of one family sentenced for tax evasion
====================================================

**02 October 2019**

Five members of one family have been sentenced to prison and home detention or ordered to pay reparations after a $2.3 million tax evasion case brought by Inland Revenue.

They’ve been ordered to pay more than $2.2 million in reparations by the High Court in Wellington.

The five – Boonrouen Thongskul, Sirirat Kampeng, Anchalee Minwong, Chanaratt Thongskul and Anuchit Tongskul – plead guilty five weeks into a trial expected to last ten weeks.  They were part of a family group of eleven who initially faced charges they’d been part of co-ordinated tax evasion effort over a seven-year period.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Richard Philp says the trial ended early when the five siblings entered guilty pleas.

“Once they’d heard much of the Crown evidence against them, these five entered guilty pleas in relation to the GST and income tax returns of the businesses for which they were responsible, and their own income tax return,” Richard Philp says.

“By their guilty pleas the brothers and sisters acknowledged they knew their returns were false and were a deliberate ploy to evade tax. Cash sales were deliberately suppressed to pay less tax.

“An aggravating feature of the offending for Chanaratt Thongskul and Anuchit Tongskul was that their declared income was low enough to qualify for Working for Families Tax Credits in some of the years charged.

“This family operated 21 restaurants in a number of cities and towns across New Zealand, most trading as ‘Thai House Express’. During the trial, IR maintained the family operated the businesses in the same format and style akin to a franchise operation.

“The case followed an extensive investigation into the family group with searches of private properties disclosing business records, luxury goods and cash in some instances.

“The general allegation was that the family distributed the cash amongst themselves, as part of a deliberate practice of not reporting or recording cash sales and diverting the cash to private use.

“This is not trivial tax evasion.  At one point in the trial the cash deposited in personal bank accounts was said to be more than $9 million.  For these five defendants the sum is more than $5.2 million.

“IR’s prosecution action was a success with the five defendants entering guilty pleas to  charges of filing 366 false income tax, GST and personal tax returns evasion relating to their own tax affairs and those of their 11 companies.

At the High Court in Wellington today Chanaratt Thongskul was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison and ordered to pay $900,000 in reparation; Sirirat Kampeng will serve 12 months home detention and pay $600,000 in reparation; Anchalee Minwong was sentenced to 10 months home detention with $400,000 in reparations; And Anuchit Tongskul got nine months home detention and must pay $300,000 in reparations.

Boonruen Thongskul was convicted and discharged with $5,000 in reparation to pay.

“While most people are honest and pay tax on all their income, those who intentionally avoid paying tax or claim money they aren't entitled to, are robbing honest people of services they might have had. “That's why we help people do the right thing and act when people deliberately try to avoid paying tax.”

There are several ways everyone can help make sure everyone pays their fair share. [https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/stop-tax-crime/](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/stop-tax-crime/)

Progress under the 5 Papa Pounamu focus areas
=============================================

Progress under the 5 Papa Pounamu focus areas
=============================================

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, Naomi Ferguson, is Functional Co-Lead for Diversity and Inclusion in the Public Service. She co-leads Papa Pounamu, a steering group of 12 public sector chief executives driving a programme of diversity and inclusion across the Public Service. Over the last year we have progressed work under 5 areas designated as priorities by Papa Pounamu.

1\. Cultural competence
-----------------------

### Māori-Crown relations - building cultural competence

Inland Revenue’s approach to building capability to be a better Treaty partner is through Māhutonga. A key element of the approach is a strong focus on capability uplift, aligned to the capability framework devised by Te Arawhiti.

We have provided learning programmes to support Māori cultural competence (te reo Māori, tikanga Māori and Te Tiriti o Waitangi) for some time. We’re in the early stages of developing a capability-focused training programme for our people, Te Arapiki, that will help deliver te reo Māori training appropriate for our various roles. This focus is supported through our Whāinga Amorangi plan for 2021-22.

A key driver for Te Arapiki is Te Mata o Te Arero (our te reo Māori language plan). This plan seeks to actively support the revitalisation of te reo Māori and the use of it in our workplace. The plan underpins our contribution to Maihi Karauna, Government’s Māori Language Strategy.

We will contribute to the Government’s goals and aspirations for te reo Māori through the following.

*   Te reo and tikanga Māori is valued by our people and has equal status as English here.
*   Our te reo capability development is aligned with the Government’s Maihi Karauna strategy and Te Arawhiti te reo Māori capability expectations.
*   Te reo Māori is supporting our Māhutonga strategic approach to integrate te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori worldviews into Inland Revenue.
*   We have the te reo Māori capability to support delivering services to Māori.

### Cross-cultural competency

In May 2021, we piloted and launched Mana Āki. This programme was developed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. It supports learners to reflect on the ways we think about and interact with people from different cultures, either with each other, or with our customers.

2\. Addressing bias
-------------------

More than 3,100 of our people, including all people leaders, have completed online training to build awareness and mitigate unconscious bias. This refers to assumptions in favour of, or against, a thing, person or group in comparison to another that can influence our interactions and decisions.

Inland Revenue recognises that unconscious bias can impact us all, and the importance of our people understanding it, recognising it and knowing how to address it. This awareness supports leaders to make decisions that help us continue to build a diverse and inclusive workplace. Unconscious bias training is now a mandatory part of induction for new starters here.

3\. Leadership
--------------

Inclusive leaders are critical to making our people feel like they can bring their whole selves to work. We’re supporting leaders to be inclusive through a combination of actions and learning.

We embrace inclusion through our day-to-day work, for example through flexible working, supporting employee-led networks, and proactively understanding and acting on the experience of our people.

In addition to our focus on unconscious bias and cultural competence, wellbeing and resilience has been a particular area of focus. Over the last year, all our people leaders completed mental health awareness training, applying that learning by reflecting with their teams on how to build an inclusive team culture.

Inland Revenue’s leader forums have focused on their roles, our future, vision and values, resilience, mental health and wellbeing. These are all central to our strategy of ensuring leaders can support their people from all walks of life to deliver their best work.

4\. Employee-led networks
-------------------------

Employee-led networks play a significant role in creating inclusive workplaces. They provide a sense of belonging for our people and often contribute to the attraction and retention of diverse talent.

Inland Revenue has a long history of people-led networks. In 2019, we re-established our diversity and inclusion employee-led networks and have been providing more centralised support to the networks.

While our people can create a network themselves, there are 6 that form part of our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. They’re supported by having an executive sponsor, coaching, time allocated to and dedicated funding for their involvement, and by taking part in cross-agency networks.

Our networks promote and support the goals and needs of the people they represent - they’re often a voice for our people and customers.

### Our people have set up diversity and inclusion networks

*   Māori Network
*   Tagata Pasifika Network
*   He Toa Takatini Rainbow Network
*   Women’s Network
*   Diversability Network
*   Multicultural Network

5\. Building relationships
--------------------------

Building a diverse range of purposeful relationships that are positive and inclusive is a priority for us. These relationships encourage diverse perspectives, value different worldviews, avoid assumptions and help to mitigate bias. We do this in several ways.

*   Our Whanake learning and development approach supports the one-to-one relationship between people leaders and their people.
*   The unconscious bias training completed by our leaders helps to foster positive relationships.
*   Our employee-led networks provide a sense of community for people and support positive peer relationships. The networks are also increasingly involved in supporting work with customers. For example, our Tagata Pasifika Network has been proactive in improving the awareness and understanding of donation tax credits across the Pasifika community.

Te whakatika i ngā hapa i taku puka tāke takitahi Fixing mistakes in my return
==============================================================================

If you realise you've made mistakes in your tax return after you've filed, you can fix these:

*   in myIR
*   in your next return
*   by asking us to do it.

Do not send us a replacement return to fix your mistake.

Fixing mistakes in your next return
-----------------------------------

If you've made a mistake calculating your annual gross income or the amount of GST you've collected, you can fix it in the next taxable period if:

*   your return has 1 or more mistakes meaning the final tax amount is wrong
*   the tax difference caused by the mistake is $1,000 or less.

You can also fix a mistake in your return if the tax difference caused by the mistake is the same as or less than both:

*   $10,000 of your yearly gross income or GST collected
*   2% of your yearly gross income or GST collected.

This only applies if you are not correcting your return mainly to delay paying your tax. 

Fixing mistakes in the same return
----------------------------------

You may be able to fix mistakes in the original return in myIR. If you cannot, you'll need to ask us to change your return instead.

See below for what kinds of information you'll need to provide.

If we agree, we'll change your original GST or income tax return and send you a new notice of assessment.

Disputing a return
------------------

If you choose a tax position in a return and change your mind about it, you cannot correct it. You must use our disputes process and both:

*   complete a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770
*   send it to us no later than 4 months after the return you want to correct is due.

[Disputes process initiated by the taxpayer](https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/disputes/when-you-start-the-disputes-process)

GST returns
-----------

You can fix mistakes in GST returns in the same ways as returns for any other tax type. However, there are some other ways you may be able to fix mistakes in a GST return.

### Unclaimed purchases or expenses in GST returns

You can claim purchases or expenses in your next return if you have not claimed them within 2 years of supply, or because:

*   you were not able to get taxable supply information
*   there was a dispute over the price of the taxable supply
*   you mistakenly decided the expense was not a taxable supply
*   of a clear mistake or simple oversight.

### Supply correction information

If you provide or receive supply correction information changing the GST for a period, account for the change in the period this was provided or received.

[Supply correction information](/gst/tax-invoices-for-gst/credit-and-debit-notes)
 

Information you need to provide
-------------------------------

To help us amend your return as fast as possible you need to provide:

*   your IRD number
*   the account period and years
*   the amount of tax involved
*   a description of the change including which parts of the return to update
*   why the change is needed, how the mistake happened and how you found it
*   if needed, details of any wrong advice we gave you
*   any relevant documentation, records or information supporting the request.

 You may also need to provide:

*   details from your accounting packages
*   GST audit trail before and after amendment
*   bank statements
*   customs invoices
*   taxable supply information
*   supply correction information.

Voluntary disclosures
---------------------

A voluntary disclosure is when you tell us what's wrong with your tax returns before we find out in some other way. For example, you left out some income from your return or incorrectly claimed expenses.

Error messages when amending your return in myIR
------------------------------------------------

Below are some error messages you may get when trying to amend a return in myIR.

Focus on overseas student loan and child support debt
=====================================================

**13 November 2024**

Inland Revenue is increasing its efforts to gather child support and student loan debt owed by Kiwis living overseas.  
  
IR has doubled the staff working in these areas and is looking at new ways to recover debt owed by expats.   
  
It is part of IR’s work, using the $29 million allocated for compliance in this year’s Budget, to increase debt collection in countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom.  
  

**Student loans**   
  
Inland Revenue has increased the number of the team chasing overseas based student loan debt, from 20 FTE at the end of June to more than 45 now.  It means we can now contact most people with a debt who return to New Zealand at any time.   
  
We’ve registered civil proceedings in the Australian and United Kingdom courts against people who haven’t repaid their loans.   
  
We’re monitoring the border movements of the largest debtors and also contacting people with a student loan debt who also own property or have investments in New Zealand.  
  
**A story from the border**

_"Customs alerted us that a borrower in serious default of their loan had returned to New Zealand from a country that we don't have any reach into. They applied for financial relief, but we established they had significant funds in a New Zealand bank, and the request was declined._

_In exchange for a small remission of late payment interest, we negotiated the full repayment of the $70k loan._ _This customer has since told us they will be putting their friends in touch with us to clear their loans also."_

**The stats**  
  
• The number of overseas-based borrowers (OBB) has increased by 5,362 

• The number of defaulters has increased by 11,921 5.2k of OBB customers paid off their loan in the past 12 months 

• 3,158 defaulters are in an active arrangement with default of $22m

**Child Support**  
  
We’ve also doubled the size of our team working on Child Support Debt.  
   
They’re looking at customers who we suspect are hiding income, perhaps through being self-employed. Where we can't establish someone’s income, we will look at the assets they have and look to use those to pay their debt.  
  
We’re also stopping some child support debtors at the border and looking to get a lump sum payment upfront or have them enter a payment arrangement.  
  
**A liable parent’s experience**

_"Recently when working on a case to collect a debt from a liable parent, we found that they were selling their property._ _Once it was sold, we collected the full amount of their outstanding debt totaling over $10,000 from the proceeds of the sale. The funds were paid out to all the receiving carers it was owed to."_ 

**The statistics**

• From September 2023 to September 2024 Child Support international debt decreased from $394 to $336 million

• From September 2023 to September 2024 Child Support international customers increased from 2,306 to 2,394 customers

• We were alerted to nearly 600 child support customers with serious default as soon as they entered New Zealand. Eleven warrants were issued at the border for overdue child support payments       during the year.

• Under the Hague Convention reciprocal agreements resulted in $88,388.20 child support received.

• We received $45 million from Services Australia that is passed on to receiving carers in New Zealand.

Focus on Pacific Peoples' representation
========================================

Pacific people make up 9.3% of our workforce, with 7% being Pacific women. The New Zealand population is approximately 8% Pacific peoples.

Today we currently have a 13.5%  pay gap across all Pacific peoples and 24.6% for Pacific women, being the largest pay gap for any Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake population.

As with our all pay gaps, our Pacific peoples’ pay gap is driven by representation.

Our data shows that 46% of our Pacific people are in Customer Service Officer Level 1 roles - this is one of the lowest paid roles in the organisation. Representation in the Team Lead group is 9.2%, reducing to just 3.7% in management (tier 4-5) and 2.9% in senior leadership (tier 1-3) level roles.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |Pacific people's average pay gap
| Group | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pacific average pay gap | 14.2% | 13.3% | 13.5% |
| Pacific wāhine average pay gap | 26.8% | 25.1% | 24.6% |

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |Pacific people's representation by role level
| Role | 2022 |     |     |     | 2023 |     |     |     | 2024 |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Staff | 9.3% |     |     |     | 9.3% |     |     |     | 9.5% |     |     |     |
| Team leader | 8.5% |     |     |     | 10.6% |     |     |     | 9.2% |     |     |     |
| Management | 2.8% |     |     |     | 3.8% |     |     |     | 3.7% |     |     |     |

Representation for Pacific peoples in team leader, management and senior leadership roles has remained relatively stable from 2022 to 2024. In the past year there has been a reduction in representation in all leadership roles, and as a result an increase in the pay gap, although minimal. This highlights a need to continue focusing on representation of Pacific peoples in leadership roles.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |Pacific people's overall representation 2022-2024
| Group | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |

| Pacific Wāhine | 6.59% | 6.84% | 7.04% |
| Pacific Tāne | 2.38% | 2.31% | 2.19% |

The percentage of Pacific peoples in Inland Revenue has been stable from 2022 to 2024.

Understanding the lived experiences
-----------------------------------

We have been working alongside members of our Pacific communities at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake to understand their experience in relation to development and careers.

The experiences they have shared cross many of our people processes, leadership including the capability of people leaders, the behaviours we demonstrate and our working environment in general.

We have worked in partnership to establish the way forward and a series of actions to continue to support a positive shift in representation of our Pacific people.

Taking action
-------------

Engagement and insights from across our Pacific community have informed actions in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Roadmaps. These include:

*   leadership development 
*   recruitment practices that are inclusive of cultural needs and create a supportive experience for Pacific peoples
*   an open and visible approach to set people up for success when they apply for external development programmes aimed at underrepresented communities (such as Tū Mau Mana Moana).

We are also supporting the progress of a development programme for Pacific peoples, developed with Pacific peoples.

Other actions in this roadmap that relate to our talent system, access to learning that supports individual needs and the cultural capability of people leaders will all contribute to creating a positive change to Pacific peoples’ representation.

Creating outcomes
-----------------

The overall outcome of this focus is to support a positive shift in the representation of Pacific peoples at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake, and to enable increased outcomes for Pacific peoples in terms of career development and aspirations. For specific representation outcomes see the Representation goals section of the roadmap.

Foreign account information-sharing agreements
==============================================

2014 legislation to enable NZ's intergovernmental agreement with the USA that clarifies NZ institutions' reporting obligations under FACTA.

#### _Sections BB 3(2), BH 1(5B), DB 1(1)(bb) and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 3, 22(2)(lc), 143(1)(ab), 143(2B), 143A(1)(ab), 173B and 185E–M (Part 11A) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

New Zealand has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States to clarify the reporting obligations of New Zealand financial institutions under the United States law commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).

Amendments to New Zealand's tax legislation were required to bring the IGA into domestic law and allow New Zealand financial institutions to comply with its terms.

FATCA requirements took effect from 1 July 2014. Accordingly, this is the effective date for the new provisions.

### Background

The United States has enacted a law commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA.

It requires foreign financial institutions (including New Zealand financial institutions) to enter into individual reporting agreements with the United States' Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These agreements require the institution to report to the IRS account information on accounts held (and certain accounts controlled) by United States taxpayers – or otherwise have a 30% withholding penalty imposed on certain United States-sourced income that they derive.

Because of domestic legal constraints, the Government understands that New Zealand financial institutions would be unable to comply with these individual reporting agreements, effectively leaving financial institutions with the choice of:

*   not investing either directly or indirectly into the United States (to avoid the withholding penalty); or
*   investing in the United States and incurring the withholding penalty.

To alleviate these concerns, and to reduce compliance costs more generally, the Government has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States. Many other countries (including Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada) have signed similar agreements with the United States and many more are still negotiating such agreements.

Under the IGA, instead of sending account information individually to the IRS, New Zealand financial institutions will instead send the information to Inland Revenue, which will exchange it with the IRS. The IGA is reciprocal, meaning that New Zealand will also receive information about certain accounts held by New Zealand residents with United States financial institutions.

It was necessary to amend the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enable financial institutions to comply with the terms of the IGA.

### Key features

The Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 now contain "foreign account information-sharing agreement" as a defined term. The first such agreement is the IGA with the United States. There may be other similar agreements entered into in the future. For this reason, the legislation is deliberately broad in its nature—so other agreements can, if possible, be accommodated with as few legislative amendments as possible.

Although this broad drafting is deliberate, the IGA is currently the only agreement of this type that New Zealand has entered into. As it uses defined terms in the IGA, it is recognised that the relevant provisions and terms may have limited or no application to other similar agreements that may be entered into in the future.

#### _Status of the agreement_

The IGA, and other similar agreements that New Zealand may enter into in the future, are defined as "foreign account information-sharing agreements". The new legislation introduces this concept as a defined term in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and a cross-reference to that definition in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Amendments to sections BB 3(2) and BH 1(4) clarify that foreign account information-sharing agreements will be "double tax agreements for the purposes of the Income Tax Act". This means the agreements, like other double tax agreements and tax information exchange agreements, have effect despite anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. New section BH 1(5) states that proposed part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to these agreements. This simply clarifies that part 11B sets rules for these agreements despite their generally overriding nature.

#### _Operative provisions_

Part 11B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains the operative provisions that govern how foreign account information-sharing agreements are brought into New Zealand law. A consequential amendment has moved the definition of "competent authority" from section 173B to section 3 of this Act.

#### _Part 11B_

Part 11B contains provisions that implement foreign account information-sharing agreements. These provisions are important because, for the New Zealand Government to comply with its obligations under such an agreement, it is required to obtain and exchange certain information with a foreign government. It is necessary to have rules that require the relevant New Zealand taxpayers to acquire this information and provide it to the New Zealand Government, so this exchange can take place.

This part of the Act therefore provides the compulsion for New Zealand taxpayers to obtain this information and pass it on to Inland Revenue. It comprises the following sections:

#### _185E - Purpose_

This section sets out the purpose of the Part, which is to give effect to and implement foreign account information-sharing agreements.

#### _Section 185F - Permitted choices_

**Industry choices**

The IGA contemplates that financial institutions may have choices in the way they comply with the agreement. Equally, the agreement allows the New Zealand Government to make choices that could have consequences for the affected financial institution. The choices a person makes will determine the way the agreement applies to them. Section 185F is designed to recognise these choices, and then authorises a person to make them and treat such choices as being binding for the purposes of the agreement and the person's obligations under the agreement.

Section 185F(1) identifies these choices. Section 185F(2) explicitly authorises a person to make such a choice and anything necessarily incidental to give effect to that choice. Section 185F(3) clarifies that a person's obligations are modified to the extent necessary to give effect to that choice.

This is important because financial institutions should not be in a position where they are required to comply with all possible scenarios that an agreement contemplates. An institution that makes a choice should be accountable for the consequences of that choice—but not be punished for failing to take the alternative option. In other words, the provision allows a financial institution to make, and carry into effect, a choice contained in the relevant agreement. It is not intended to compel a financial institution to make all possible choices.

**Government choices**

Under the IGA, New Zealand has a number of choices it can make at government level. As the IGA is a double tax agreement, these choices will be made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Section 185F caters for these choices and allows the Commissioner to publish a choice made or revoked in a publication of the Commissioner's choosing (see subsection (4)). The method of publication is broad, to allow the Commissioner maximum flexibility in the publication method, which may be important in terms of quickly communicating decisions.

In relation to the IGA, the Commissioner has made three choices in accordance with section 185F - with this _Tax Information Bulletin_ \[Vol 26, No 7 August 2014\] (along with the Inland Revenue website) being the Commissioner's publication of choice for these purposes. Reporting New Zealand financial institutions are permitted to:

*   rely on due diligence procedures in the United States Treasury Regulations in lieu of procedures in Annex I of the IGA (per Annex I (I)(C) of the IGA);
*   use third-party service providers to fulfil the obligations imposed on such institutions as contemplated by the IGA (per Article 5(3) of the IGA); and
*   rely on due diligence procedures performed by third parties to the extent provided in relevant United States Treasury Regulations (per Annex I (VI)(F) of the IGA).

It is important to note that these choices are accurate at the time of publication, but may be varied or revoked by future action or regulatory change. Notification of any changes will be made by the Commissioner at that time.

**Effect of choices**

Section 185F(5) clarifies that choices made by the Government or by an affected person are treated as part of the agreement for all aspects of Part 11B and section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

**Excluded choices**

The general ability to make choices is removed if the choice is an "excluded choice" under sections 185F(6) and (7). Having these particular choices as "excluded" is intended to prevent unnecessary reporting of accounts. The IGA provides for certain reporting thresholds. An example being that a financial institution does not have to report on a "depository account" with an end of reporting period balance of US$50,000 or less.

Without the excluded choices provision, a financial institution could report on these low value accounts if it was administratively more convenient for it to do so. However, given the privacy concerns surrounding the exchange of personal data, it was not considered appropriate for low-value accounts to be reported.

It is important to note that the "excluded choice" wording does not prevent the financial institution from gathering relevant information on account opening (or any other time designated under the agreement); it merely prevents the provision of that information to Inland Revenue.

#### _Section 185G of the Tax Administration Act - Registration_

The IGA provides that financial institutions that meet certain requirements must register with the United States IRS. Section 185G brings the aspects of this registration requirement relevant to the financial institution into New Zealand law.

#### _Section 185H of the Tax Administration Act - Due diligence_

The IGA also sets out detailed due diligence obligations for affected financial institutions. Section 185H therefore clarifies that a financial institution is required to apply the relevant procedures. The relevant procedures may depend on permitted choices that the Government and/or the financial institution will have made. A financial institution is only required to perform the due diligence procedures that flow from permitted choices they have made.

#### _Section 185I of the Tax Administration Act - Information for New Zealand competent authority_

Section 185I is the central provision for ensuring New Zealand's compliance with foreign account information-sharing agreements. In essence, it says that if New Zealand is obliged to obtain and exchange information with a foreign competent authority, the person described or contemplated in the agreement as obtaining and providing the information must obtain and provide it to the New Zealand competent authority. All relevant steps in relation to obtaining and providing that information must be done in accordance with the agreement.

In the IGA context, this means that any information the New Zealand Government is obliged to exchange with the United States must be obtained by New Zealand financial institutions and provided to Inland Revenue.

The section allows the provision of information if it is not required for exchange purposes, as long as obtaining and providing that information is contemplated in the agreement.

As with the other operative provisions, the relevant information may be dependent on choices that the Government and financial institution have made. Section 185I compels the person to provide whatever information is produced from the exercise of their choices. The provision of this information is not optional—however, the composition of this information will depend on choices made.

The section is designed to neither force a financial institution to report on the maximum or minimum number of people. Such an obligation would be impossible to enforce in any event because it may not be known at the time the choice is made what the exact consequences of that choice will be. An institution is simply required to follow the consequences of any choices made. However, to the extent that obtaining and providing the information is not described or contemplated in the agreement, there is no statutory protection for a person that obtains or provides it.

The section also clarifies that the Government may wish to make regulations in this area (under the existing regulation-making power in section 224 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) to spell out any finer details in a person's reporting obligations.

#### _Section 185J of the Tax Administration Act - Information for third parties_

The IGA contemplates that a financial institution may have to provide information to third parties. These third parties could be foreign competent authorities or other financial institutions. Section 185J authorises obtaining and proving this information, provided it is described or contemplated in the agreement.

For foreign competent authorities, the request for information must be "validly requested" under the terms of the agreement. In the IGA context, a "valid" request from the United States competent authority is one where the competent authority has reason to believe that a minor or administrative error may have led to incorrect information reporting. It is anticipated that these requests will be made when the Internal Revenue Service is attempting to quickly resolve simple queries. Where it is unclear whether a request is strictly of a "minor or administrative" nature or whether the request is actually more substantial, the competent authority at Inland Revenue will be available to assist financial institutions in making this judgement call, if the need ever arises.

Again, this section clarifies that the Government may wish to make regulations in this area (under the existing regulation-making power in section 224 of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

#### _Section 185K of the Tax Administration Act - Prescribed form_

Section 185K allows the Commissioner to prescribe the form in which information is received. This is particularly important for foreign account information-sharing agreements because it may be that the form of the information is set by either a foreign competent authority or other international organisation. Some flexibility to set these forms is therefore crucial to the smooth administration of these agreements.

#### _Section 185L of the Tax Administration Act - Anti-avoidance_

Section 185L is an anti-avoidance provision that allows an arrangement to be treated as having no effect if the main purpose of entering into the arrangement is to avoid a person's obligations under part 11B. This provision recognises that some people may not want to report on their customers for commercial/compliance costs reasons. However, in entering into foreign account information-sharing agreements, the Government is agreeing to obtain and provide certain information. The ability to unwind arrangements that avoid reporting is a requirement of the IGA.

#### _Section 185M of the Tax Administration Act - Timeframes_

Foreign account information-sharing agreements may not set a specific reporting period. For example, the IGA states that relevant account balances or values "shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year **or other appropriate reporting period**" (emphasis added).

In New Zealand most businesses have systems designed to report on a tax-year basis. Section 185M therefore provides that, when an agreement or regulation does not specify or is discretionary as to a reporting period, that period will be a tax year, from 1 April to 31 March. For the IGA, this means that the "appropriate reporting period" will be the year ended 31 March.

When an agreement or regulation does not specify or is discretionary about the time in which a person must provide the information to Inland Revenue, it must be provided within three months of the end of the period. For the IGA, as the reporting period ends on 31 March, the information must be provided to Inland Revenue by 30 June of that year.

### Other matters

#### _Tax returns_

The definition of "tax return" in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act sets out that information provided in the form set out in section 185K is not a tax return for the purposes of the Act.

#### _Records_

Section 22(2)(lc) has been added to the Tax Administration Act to clarify that a taxpayer must keep sufficient records to allow the Commissioner to readily ascertain the person's compliance with part 11B. This makes it a statutory requirement for an affected person to collect and keep the information necessary for compliance with a foreign account information-sharing agreement. It also ensures that the records must be kept for the statutory record-keeping period set out in section 22.

Failure to keep documents required by this provision will result in an absolute liability offence under section 143 or a knowledge offence under section 143A, as applicable.

#### _Penalties_

Sections 143(1)(ab) and 143A(1)(ab) introduce an "absolute liability" offence and "knowledge" offence related to a person's failure to register with a foreign competent authority as required by part 11B.

These offences enable New Zealand to comply with obligations under the IGA, and possibly future agreements. New Zealand has an obligation under the IGA to rectify what is known as "significant non-compliance" through its domestic law.

The main form of non-compliance that existing legislation did not appear to address was if a financial institution failed to register. The amendments to sections 143 and 143A provide the legislative sanction to support section 185G, which, as mentioned above, requires a financial institution to comply with any registration requirements in a relevant agreement. However, to recognise the fact that a failure to register may occur for circumstances beyond the control of the person concerned, section 143(2B) provides an exclusion from the absolute liability offence if the relevant failure to register occurred through no fault of the person.

#### _Deductions for withholding_

Under section DB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, various types of taxes are disallowed as deductions for income tax purposes. Section DB 1(1)(bb) states that any withholding that a person suffers under FATCA law (in particular under section 1471 or 1472 of the United States Internal Revenue Code) is not available as a deduction, even if the general permissions for deductions are satisfied.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 1 July 2014.

Missing contact information The Contact element must be completed with the contact details that Inland Revenue can use if they have any questions about the information provided. Reporting period The New Zealand reporting period will always end on the 31 s t March. Reporting group elements provided incorrectly Only one ReportingFI element can be provided in each disclosure. The Intermediary and PoolReport elements must not be used for FATCA reporting. Nil reports The NilReport element may be used to indicate that the reporting financial institution has no accounts to report. Mismatch between document type indicators Only one type of DocTypeIndic value can be used within a disclosure. A combination of new, corrected, amended or void data records must not be used within the same disclosure. June 2018 2 Inland Revenue FATCA validations (updated draft) Document type indicators used incorrectly When a DocTypeIndic value of 'FATCA3' (void data) is used, then none of the corresponding ReportingFI/AccountReport information should have changed from the previous record submitted. Conversely, if a DocTypeIndic value of 'FATCA2' (corrected data) or 'FATCA4' (amended data) is used, then at least one of the ReportingFI/AccountReport element values should have changed from the previously submitted record. A DocTypeIndic value of FATCA2 (corrected data) must only be used when the IRS has sent a notification requesting that the record is corrected. Missing or incorrect message reference IDs The MessageRefId element must be a unique value and must not match any previously submitted MessageRefId values. Only one MessageRefId value must be used in the disclosure. The MessageRefId value must be provided in the format \[Reporting FI GIIN\].\[Unique ID\]. For example ABCDEF.99999.LE.554.00001 Corresponding message reference ID provided incorrectly The CorrMessageRefId element must only be used when correcting, amending or voiding previously submitted information. The CorrMessageRefId must always match to a previously submitted MessageRefId. The CorrMessageRefId value must only be used once and must not have been used to correct the same record previously. For example, when correcting a corrected file, the CorrMessageRefId should reference the previous file rather than the original disclosure. Missing or incorrect document reference IDs The DocRefId value must be provided in the format \[Reporting FI GIIN\].\[Unique ID\]. For example ABCDEF.99999.LE.554.00001. The DocRefId element must be a unique value and must not match any DocRefId values previously submitted. The DocRefID must not include any non-alphanumeric characters, excluding periods and dashes. Prohibited non-alphanumeric characters include but are not limited to\_, @, , &, ! and \*. Corresponding document reference ID provided incorrectly The CorrDocRefId element must only be used when correcting, amending or voiding previously submitted information, and must always match to a previously submitted DocRefId. The CorrDocRefId value must only be used once and must not have been used to correct the same record previously. For example, when correcting a corrected file, the CorrDocRefId must reference the previous file rather than the original disclosure. Incorrect TIN The sponsor (if a sponsor is provided) and reporting financial institution TIN must always be provided and must match the format for a GIIN issued by the IRS. The reporting financial institution TIN should match the GIIN associated to the myIR account that the disclosure is being uploaded to. Individual TINs must match the format for a U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) or individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). If a TIN is unknown, an A can be used nine times (AAAAAAAAA) in the TIN element instead, providing the NZ financial institution: 1. Reports the date of birth of the individual account holder/controlling person 2. Request the account holder annually for the missing U.S. TIN; and 3. Before reporting their information for the period ended 31 March 2018, searches electronically searchable data maintained by the NZFI, for any missing U.S. TINs. Blank TIN fields and generic TIN values that have previously been used by NZ financial institutions (such as ‘99’,’000000000’ and ‘999999999’) will be rejected. 3 Inland Revenue FATCA validations (updated draft) Birth information provided incorrectly The BirthDate is the only sub-element within the BirthInfo element that can be provided for FATCA reporting. The earliest BirthDate value that will be accepted is '1900-01-01'. A BirthDate must only be reported if the financial institution does not hold the U.S. TIN for that person. Resident country codes At least one of the reportable account holder or substantial owner’s ResCountryCode values must be ‘US’. Incomplete address information When using the AddressFix element, the Street, City and Country information must be provided. When using the AddressFree element, the AddressFree and Country information must be provided. Incorrect account number types When an account number type attribute is used, then this must match the account number format provided. For example, when the AccountNumber AcctNumberType attribute is 'OECD601' (IBAN), then the AccountNumber value must follow an IBAN format. When the AcctNumberType attribute is 'OECD603' (ISIN) then the AccountNumber value must meet the ISIN format. The account number type attribute can only be used for the reporting period 31 March 2017 onwards. Reporting financial institution details The identification details for the reporting financial institution must match the details that Inland Revenue holds. The TIN provided must be the GIIN that was provided to us at enrolment. The country of residence for a financial institution reporting to Inland Revenue must be NZ. Filer category The Reporting financial institution filer category must only be provided if there is no Sponsor element present. If the disclosure contains Sponsoring entity details, then the Sponsor filer category must be provided instead. A filer category is required for the period ending 31 March 2017 and thereafter. A reporting New Zealand financial institution must only be reported with a filer category of Registered deemed-compliant (FATCA602). A sponsoring entity must only be reported as a Sponsoring Entity of a Sponsored FFI (FATCA607) or the Trustee of a Trustee-Documented Trust (FATCA609). Incorrect or missing substantial owner information The Substantial owner element must be provided when the account holder is an organisation with an AcctHolderType of FATCA102 ('Passive NFE with substantial US owners(or controlling persons under an applicable IGA)'). Account holder types of 'Non-participating FFI' and 'Specified US person' must not have substantial owner information reported. The remaining account holder types of 'Owner documented FFI' and 'Direct reporting NFFE' should not be used in FATCA reporting to Inland Revenue. Unused elements The Nationality, PaymentTypeDesc, CARRef and AdditionalData elements must not be used for FATCA reporting. Unused attributes The nameType attribute must not be used for FATCA reporting. The AccountClosed and AcctNumberType attributes must not be used for periods ending prior to 31 March 2017.

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for six months ending 30 September 2010)
======================================================================================================

The exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency amounts to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for the six months ending 30 Sep 2010.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the six months ending 30 September 2010.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

New legislation was enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 which permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in all circumstances, ie, where the Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6), or in circumstances where the Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007.

#### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   Where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying either: the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2011 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

#### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2010 - [rolling 12-month average table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits method (section EX 49(8)); comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57)
*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of 12 months.

#### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2010 - [mid-month actual table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC or FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   a person's FIF income or loss under: the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

**Example 1**

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2010. Its opening market value on 1 October 2010 or its closing market value on 30 September 2010 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 32.2373 = $10,856.99

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2010 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2011 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 2**

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2010. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.4945 = $36,400.37

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2010 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 3**

A resident individual with a 30 September 2010 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2009 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2010 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 64.5675 = $162,620.51  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 64.5675 = $154,876.68

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2010 has been applied to both calculations.)

**Example 4**

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2010 and has a balance date of 30 September 2010. During the period 1 May 2010 to 30 September 2010, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May - September 2009:  
    0.9815 + 0.9718 + 1.0021 + 0.9619 + 0.9782 = 4.8955  
    4.8955 ÷ 5 = 0.9791
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9791
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9791 = $510,673.07

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2010 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for six months ending 30 September 2011)
======================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for six months ending 30 Sep 2011.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the six months ending 30 September 2011.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in all circumstances, ie, where the Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6), or in circumstances where the Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2)).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

Note: All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   Where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying either: the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2012 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2011 - [rolling 12-month average table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits method (section EX 49(8)); comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57)
*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2011 - [mid-month actual table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC or FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   a person's FIF income or loss under: the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2011. Its opening market value on 1 October 2011 or its closing market value on 30 September 2011 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 33.5621 = $10,428.43

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2011 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2012 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2011. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.8956 = $33,923.60

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2011 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 3 

A resident individual with a 30 September 2011 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2010 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2011 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 63.5987 = $165,097.71  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 63.5987 = $157,235.92

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2011 has been applied to both calculations.)

Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2011 and has a balance date of 30 September 2011. During the period 1 May 2011 to 30 September 2011, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2011:  
    0.9805 + 0.9986 + 1.0310 + 1.0004 + 1.0228 = 5.0333  
    5.0333 ÷ 5 = 1.0067
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 1.0067
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 1.0067 = $496,672.30

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for six months ending 30 September 2012)
======================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for six months ending 30 Sep 2011.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the six months ending 30 September 2011.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2013 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2013 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in all circumstances, ie, where the Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6), or in circumstances where the Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2)).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

Note: All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   Where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying either: the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2013 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2012 - [rolling 12-month average table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits method (section EX 49(8)); comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57)
*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2012 - [mid-month actual table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC or FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   a person's FIF income or loss under: the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2012. Its opening market value on 1 October 2012 or its closing market value on 30 September 2012 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 34.8141 = $10,053.40

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2012 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2013 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2012. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 6.2572 = $31,963.18

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2012 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2013 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 3 

A resident individual with a 30 September 2012 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2011 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2012 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 63.1043 = $166,391.19  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 63.1043 = $158,467.80

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2012 has been applied to both calculations.)

Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2012 and has a balance date of 30 September 2012. During the period 1 May 2012 to 30 September 2012, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2012:  
    0.9706 +1.0014 +1.0077 +1.0085 + 1.0115 = 4.9997  
    4.9997 ÷ 5 = 0.99994
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9999
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9999 = $500,050.00

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2013 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2012 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for six months ending 30 September 2014)
======================================================================================================

The exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency amounts to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for the six months ending 30 Sep 2014.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the six months ending 30 September 2014.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2015 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2015 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the transaction is required to be measured or calculated (section YF 1(2)).
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss by applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2015 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2014 - [rolling 12-month average table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57) (2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2014 - [mid-month actual table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8) and (9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 6 September 2014. Its opening market value on 1 October 2014 or its closing market value on 30 September 2014 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷34.9056 = $10,027.04

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2014 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2015 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2014. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 6.4779 = $30,874.20

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2014 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2015 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 3 

A resident individual with a 30 September 2014 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2013 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2014 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 86.5238 = $121,353.89  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 86.5238 = $115,575.14

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2014 for JPY has been applied to both calculations.)

Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 19 April 2014 and has a balance date of 30 September 2014. During the period 1 May 2014 to 30 September 2014, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2012:  
    1.0824 + 1.0838 + 1.0906 + 1.0569 + 1.0334 = 5.3471  
    5.3471 ÷ 5 = 1.06942
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 1.0694
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷1.0694 = $467,551.90

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2015 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2014 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for six months ending 30 September 2015)
======================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for six months ending 30 Sep 2015.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the six months ending 30 September 2015.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2016 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2016 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the transaction is required to be measured or calculated (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss by applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2016 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2015 - rolling 12-month average table

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2015 - rolling 12-month average table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2015 - mid-month table

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2015 - mid-month table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

**Example 1**

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2015. Its opening market value on 1 October 2015 or its closing market value on 30 September 2015 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷29.8648 = $11,719.48

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2015 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2016 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 2**

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2015. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 6.0582 = $33,013.11

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2015 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2016 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 3** 

A resident individual with a 30 September 2015 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2014 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2015 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 86.8026 = $120,964.12  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 86.8026 = $115,203.92

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2015 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2016 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 4**

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 20 April 2015 and has a balance date of 30 September 2015. During the period 1 May 2015 to 30 September 2015, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2015:  
    0.9871 + 0.9424 + 0.8998 + 0.9209 + 0.8912 = 4.6414  
    4.6414 ÷ 5 = 0.92828
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9283
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷0.9283 = $538,618.98

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2016 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2015 inclusive for SGD.)

[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2016 - mid-month table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

##### Example 1 - taxpayer with 30 September balance date purchases shares in Philippine company

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2016. Its opening market value on 1 October 2016 or its closing market value on 30 September 2016 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 35.184 = $9,947.70

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2016 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2017 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 2 - CFC resident in Hong Kong with accounting period ending 30 June 2016

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2016. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.1782 = $38,623.46

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2016 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2017 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

##### Example 3 - resident individual with 30 September 2016 accounting period acquired FIF interest in Japanese company

A resident individual with a 30 September 2016 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2015 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2016 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 76.3236 = $137,572.13  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 76.3236 = $131,021.07

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2016 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2017 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2017 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2017 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the transaction is required to be measured or calculated (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss by applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2017 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2017 - rolling 12-month average table

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2017 - mid-month table

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

##### Example 1 - taxpayer with 30 September balance date purchases shares in Philippine company

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2017. Its opening market value on 1 October 2017 or its closing market value on 30 September 2017 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 36.6797 = $9,542.06

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2017 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2017 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 2 - CFC resident in Hong Kong with accounting period ending 30 June 2017

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2017. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.524 = $36,205.65

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2017 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2017 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 3 - resident individual with 30 September 2017 accounting period acquired FIF interest in Japanese company

A resident individual with a 30 September 2017 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2016 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2017 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 79.6986 = $131,746.35  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 79.6986 = $125,472.72

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2017 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2017 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

##### Example 4 - CFC resident in Singapore formed on 20 April 2017 with balance date of 30 September 2017

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 20 April 2017 and has a balance date of 30 September 2017. During the period 1 May 2017 to 30 September 2017, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2017:  
    0.9621 + 0.9974 + 1.0074 + 0.9893 + 0.9812 = 4.9374  
    4.93744 ÷ 5 = 0.98748
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9875
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9875 = $506,329.11

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2017 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2017 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for six months ending 30 September 2018)
======================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for the six months ending 30 Sept 2018.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company ("CFC") and foreign investment fund ("FIF") rules for the six months ending 30 September 2018.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the transaction is required to be measured or calculated (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss by applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - rolling 12-month average table

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - mid-month actual table

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

##### Example 1 - taxpayer with 30 September balance date purchases shares in Philippine company

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2018. Its opening market value on 1 October 2018 or its closing market value on 30 September 2018 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 35.7208 = $9,798.21

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2018 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 2 - CFC resident in Hong Kong with accounting period ending 30 June 2018

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2018. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.6126 = $35,634.11

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2018 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 3 - resident individual with 30 September 2018 accounting period acquired FIF interest in Japanese company

A resident individual with a 30 September 2018 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2017 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2018 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 77.2760 = $135,876.60  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 77.2760 = $129,406.28

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2018 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

##### Example 4 - CFC resident in Singapore formed on 20 April 2018 with balance date of 30 September 2018

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 20 April 2018 and has a balance date of 30 September 2018. During the period 1 May 2018 to 30 September 2018, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2018:  
    0.9227 + 0.9385 + 0.9221 + 0.9061 + 0.9001 = 4.58907  
    4.58907 ÷ 5 = 0.917814
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9178
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9178 = $544,781.00

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2018 - mid month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 6 September 2014. Its opening market value on 1 October 2014 or its closing market value on 30 September 2014 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷34.9056 = $10,027.04

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2014 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2015 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 2**

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 2014. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 6.4795 = $30,866.58

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for December 2014 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2015 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 3** 

A resident individual with a 31 October 2014 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 November 2013 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in October 2014 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 86.6823 = $121,132.00  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 86.6823 = $115,363.81

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for October 2014 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2015 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 4**

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 19 April 2014 and has a balance date of 30 September 2014. During the period 1 May 2014 to 30 September 2014, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2014:  
    1.0824 + 1.0838 + 1.0906 + 1.0569 + 1.0334 = 5.3471  
    5.3471 ÷ 5 = 1.06942
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 1.0694
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷1.0694 = $467,551.90

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2015 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2014 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for the 12 months ending 31 March 2011)
=====================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for 12 months ending 31 Mar 2011.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2011.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation was enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 which permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in all circumstances, ie, where the Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   Where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying either: the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2011 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

[**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2011 - rolling 12-month average table**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits method (section EX 49(8)); comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57)
*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of 12 months.

[**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2011 - mid-month actual table**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC or FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   a person's FIF income or loss under: the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

**Example 1**

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2010. Its opening market value on 1 October 2010 or its closing market value on 30 September 2010 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 32.2373 = $10,856.99

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2010 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2011 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 2**

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2010. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.4945= $36,400.37

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2010 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 3** 

A resident individual with a 30 September 2010 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2009 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2010 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 64.5675 = $162,620.51  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 64.5675 = $154,876.68

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2010 has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 4** 

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2010 and has a balance date of 30 September 2010. During the period 1 May 2010 to 30 September 2010, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

*   Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2010:

0.9815 + 0.9718 + 1.0021 + 0.9619 + 0.9782 = 4.8955  
4.8955 ÷ 5 = 0.9791

*   Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9791

*   Conversion to New Zealand currency:

SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9791 = $510,673.07

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2011 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2010 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for the 12 months ending 31 March 2012
====================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for 12 months ending 31 Mar 2012.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2012.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner’s ability to set rates and approve methods applies in all circumstances, ie, where the Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007.

**Actual rate for the day for each transaction**  
The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   Where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying either: the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2012 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits method (section EX 49(8)); comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b))
*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of 12 months.

**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2012 - [mid-month actual table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
**

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC or FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   a person’s FIF income or loss under: the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

**Example 1**

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2011. Its opening market value on 1 October 2011 or its closing market value on 30 September 2011 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 33.5621 = $10,428.43

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2011 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2012 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 2**

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 2011. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 6.1470 = $32,536.19

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for December 2011 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 3**

A resident individual with a 31 October 2011 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 November 2010 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in October 2011 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 63.6430 = $164,982.79  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 63.6430 = $157,126.47

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for October 2011 has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

**Example 4**

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2011 and has a balance date of 30 September 2011. During the period 1 May 2011 to 30 September 2011, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2011:  
    0.9805 + 0.9986 Plus + 1.0310 + 1.0004 + 1.0228 = 5.0333  
    5.0333 ÷ 5 = 1.0067
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 1.0067
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 1.0067 = $496,672.30

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2012 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for the 12 months ending 31 March 2013)
=====================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for 12 months ending 31 Mar 2013.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2013.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2013 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2013 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

The 2007 Act sets out specific currency conversion rules and also permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates (sections YF 1 and 2). The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in all circumstances, ie, where the Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

Note: All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007.

**Actual rate for the day for each transaction** 

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   Where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying either: the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or a FIF for which they use the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(9)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2013 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2013 - [rolling 12-month average table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
**

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b))
*   attributed CFC income or loss and FIF income or loss (where the attributable FIF income method is adopted) calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated where a taxpayer derives attributed CFC income (section CQ 1) or where the taxpayer derives FIF income (section CQ 4) and applies the attributable FIF income method.  Section LK 3(b) applies to attributed CFC income and FIF income (section EX 50(9)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2013 - [mid-month actual table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
**

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   attributed CFC income or loss and FIF income or loss (where the attributable FIF income method is adopted) calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   a person's FIF income or loss under: the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated where a taxpayer derives attributed CFC income (section CQ 1) or where the taxpayer derives FIF income (section CQ 4) and applies the attributable FIF income method. Section LK 3(b) applies to attributed CFC income and FIF income (section EX 50(9)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

**Example 1**  
A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF) on 7 September 2012. Its opening market value on 1 October 2012 or its closing market value on 30 September 2012 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 34.8141 = $10,053.40

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2012 for PHP. Refer to the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2013 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
.)

**Example 2**  
A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 2012. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 6.2921 = $31,785.89

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for December 2012 for HKD. Refer to the table [Currency rates 12 months ending March 2013 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
.)

**Example 3**  
A resident individual with a 31 October 2012 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 November 2011 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in October 2012 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 63.2866 = $165,911.89  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 63.2866 = $158,011.33

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for October 2012 has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table [Currency rates 12 months ending March 2013 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
.)

**Example 4**  
A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 20 April 2012 and has a balance date of 30 September 2012. During the period 1 May 2012 to 30 September 2012, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

*   Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2012:

0.9706 + 1.0014 + 1.0077 + 1.0085 + 1.0115 = 4.9997  
4.9997 ÷ 5 = 0.99994

*   Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9999
*   Conversion to New Zealand currency:

SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9999 = $500,050.00

(In this example, the rates are from the table [Currency rates 12 months ending March 2013 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
, from May to September 2012 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for the 12 months ending 31 March 2014)
=====================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for 12 months ending 31 Mar 2014.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for the 12 months ending 31 March 2014.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2014 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Overseas currency rates 2014 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

**Actual rate for the day for each transaction**

The actual rate for the day for a transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the rate for the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Overseas currency rates 2014 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2014 -** [**rolling 12-month average table**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2014 -** [**mid-month actual table**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 6 September 2013. Its opening market value on 1 October 2013 or its closing market value on 30 September 2013 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000÷ 35.9919 = $9,724.41

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2013 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2014 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 2  
A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 2013. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷6.3871 = $31,313.12

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for December 2013 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2014 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 3

A resident individual with a 31 October 2013 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 November 2012 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in October 2013 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 77.4843 = $135,511.32  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 77.4843 = $129,058.40

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for October 2013 has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2014 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 19 April 2013 and has a balance date of 30 September 2013. During the period 1 May 2013 to 30 September 2013, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2013:  
    1.0264 + 1.0074 + 0.9854 + 1.0243 + 1.0322 = 5.0757  
    5.0757 ÷ 5 = 1.01514
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 1.0151
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 1.0151 = $492,562.31

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2014 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2013 inclusive for SGD.)

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for the 12 months ending 31 March 2016.

The Income Tax Act 2007 ("2007 Act") requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

**Actual rate for the day for each transaction**

The actual rate for the day for a transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the rate for the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 -** [**rolling 12-month average table**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

**Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 -** [**mid-month actual table**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

##### Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 6 September 2015. Its opening market value on 1 October 2015 or its closing market value on 30 September 2015 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000÷ 29.8648 = $11,719.48

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2015 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 2015. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷5.4484 = $36,708.02

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for December 2015 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 3

A resident individual with a 31 October 2015 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 November 2014 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in October 2015 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 86.5413 = $121,329.35  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 86.5413 = $115,551.76

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for October 2013 has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2016 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 19 April 2015 and has a balance date of 30 September 2015. During the period 1 May 2015 to 30 September 2015, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2015:  
    0.9871 + 0.9424 + 0.8998 + 0.9209 + 0.8912 = 4.6414  
    4.6414 ÷ 5 = 0.92828
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9283
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9283 = $538,618.98

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Currency rates 12 months 31 March 2016 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2015 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for the 12 months ending 31 March 2018)
=====================================================================================================

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company ("CFC") and foreign investment fund ("FIF") rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2018.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (“CFC”) and foreign investment fund (“FIF”) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2018.

The Income Tax Act 2007 (“2007 Act”) requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner's ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand's major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the transaction is required to be measured or calculated (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss by applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 - mid-month actual table

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

##### Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 6 September 2017. Its opening market value on 1 October 2017 or its closing market value on 30 September 2017 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 36.6797 = $9,542.06

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2017 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 – month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 2017. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.5468 = $36,056.83

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for December 2017 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 – rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 3

A resident individual with a 31 October 2017 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 November 2016 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in October 2017 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 80.2425 = $130,853.35  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 80.2425 = $124,622.24

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for October 2017 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 – rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 19 April 2017 and has a balance date of 30 September 2017. During the period 1 May 2017 to 30 September 2017, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2017:  
    0.9621 + 0.9974 + 1.0074 + 0.9893 + 0.9812 = 4.9374  
    4.9374 ÷ 5 = 0.98748
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9875
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9875 = $506,329.10

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2018 – mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2017 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for the 12 months ending 31 March 2019)
=====================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for the 12 months ending 31 Mar 2019.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (“CFC”) and foreign investment fund (“FIF”) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2019.

The Income Tax Act 2007 (“2007 Act”) requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner’s ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the transaction is required to be measured or calculated (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss by applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)–(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - rolling 12-month average table

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - mid-month actual table

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)-(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

##### Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 6 September 2018. Its opening market value on 1 October 2018 or its closing market value on 30 September 2018 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 35.7208 = $9,798.21

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2018 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 2018. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.4341 = $36,804.62

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for December 2018 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 3

A resident individual with a 31 October 2018 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 November 2017 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in October 2018 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 76.6840 = $136,925.57  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 76.6840 = $130,405.30

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for October 2018 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 19 April 2018 and has a balance date of 30 September 2018. During the period 1 May 2018 to 30 September 2018, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2018:  
    0.9227 + 0.9385 + 0.9221 + 0.9061 + 0.9000 = 4.5894  
    4.5894 ÷ 5 = 0.91788
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9179
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9179 = $544,721.65

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2019 - mid month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

**Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2013 -** [**mid-month actual table**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (section EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months

Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 6 September 2013. Its opening market value on 1 October 2013 or its closing market value on 30 September 2013 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 35.9919 = $9,727.41

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2013 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2014 - end of month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2013. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 6.3913 = $31,292.54

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2013 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Overseas currency rates 2013 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

Example 3 

A resident individual with a 30 September 2013 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2012 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2013 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 75.9964 = $138,164.43  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 75.9964 = $131,585.18

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2013 has been applied to both calculations.)

Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 19 April 2013 and has a balance date of 30 September 2013. During the period 1 May 2013 to 30 September 2013, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2013:  
    1.0264 +1.0074 +0.9854 +1.0243 + 1.0322 = 5.0757  
    5.0757 ÷ 5 = 1.01514
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 1.0151
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 1.0151 = $492,562.31

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Overseas currency rates 2013 - rolling 12-month average and mid-month](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2013 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars (for the six months ending 30 September 2019)
==========================================================================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for the six months ending 30 Sept 2019.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (“CFC”) and foreign investment fund (“FIF”) rules for the six months ending 30 September 2019.

The Income Tax Act 2007 (“2007 Act”) requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

Legislation enacted in September 2010 with effect from 1 April 2008 permits the Commissioner to set currency rates and approve methods of calculating exchange rates. The Commissioner can set rates for general use by taxpayers or for specific taxpayers. The Commissioner’s ability to set rates and approve methods applies in circumstances where the 2007 Act does not contain a specific currency conversion rule (sections YF 1(5) and (6)), or in circumstances where the 2007 Act provides a rate or method for currency conversion (section YF 2).

Inland Revenue uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the 2007 Act.

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the transaction is required to be measured or calculated (section YF 1(2))
*   where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss by applying the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a))
*   where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)) or by a FIF where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)–(9) and LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 – rolling 12-month average table

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie, the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   calculating the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)–(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 – mid-month actual table

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   FIF income or loss under the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   FIF income or loss calculated under the attributable FIF income method (sections EX 21(4)(b) and EX 50(3)(a)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   attributed CFC income or loss calculated under the CFC rules (section EX 21(4)(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   the New Zealand dollar amount of foreign income tax under the CFC rules (section LK 3(b)) or under the FIF rules where the attributable FIF income method is used (sections EX 50(8)–(9) and LK 3(b)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

##### Example 1

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2019. Its opening market value on 1 October 2019 or its closing market value on 30 September 2019 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 32.4776 = $10,766.58

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2019 for PHP. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 2

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 June 2019. Attributed CFC income for the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.2525 = $38,077.11

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for June 2019 for HKD. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 31 March 2019 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 3

A resident individual with a 30 September 2019 accounting period acquired a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2018 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2019 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 73.5156 = $142,826.83  
JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 73.5156 = $136,052.55

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2019 for JPY has been applied to both calculations. Refer to the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
".)

##### Example 4

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 20 April 2019 and has a balance date of 30 September 2019. During the period 1 May 2019 to 30 September 2019, attributed CFC income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-September 2019:  
    0.8982 + 0.8903 + 0.9112 + 0.8956 + 0.8759 = 4.4712  
    4.4712 ÷ 5 = 0.89424
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.8942
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency:  
    SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.89424 = $559,159.02

(In this example, the rates are from the table "[Currency rates 6 months ending 30 September 2019 - mid month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
", from May to September 2019 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign currency amounts - conversion to New Zealand dollars
============================================================

Exchange rates acceptable to IR for converting foreign currency to NZ dollars under the CFC and FIF rules for 12 months ending 31 Mar 2010.

**Note:** On 1 April 2009, Inland Revenue changed the method of sourcing exchange rate information and now uses wholesale rates from Bloomberg for rolling 12-month average, mid-month actual and end of month. These rates are provided in three tables.

This article provides the exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2010.

The Income Tax Act 2007 (“2007 Act”) requires foreign currency amounts to be converted into New Zealand dollars applying one of the following methods:

*   actual rate for the day for each transaction (including close of trading spot exchange rate on the day), or
*   rolling 12-month average rate for a 12-month accounting period or income year (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - rolling 12-month average](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ), or
*   mid-month actual rate as the basis of the rolling average for accounting periods or income years greater or lesser than 12 months (see the table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - mid-month actual](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
    ).

You must apply the chosen conversion method to all interests for which you use the FIF or CFC calculation method in that and each later income year.

To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible. If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in the tables, please contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks.

**Note:** All section references relate to the Income Tax Act 2007

### Actual rate for the day for each transaction

The actual rate for the day for each transaction can be used in the following circumstances:

*   Where the 2007 Act does not provide a specific currency conversion rule, then foreign currency amounts can be converted by applying the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date that the transaction which is required to be measured or calculated occurs (section YF 1(2)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the actual rate for the day of the transaction when calculating their FIF income or loss when applying either: the comparative value method, fair dividend rate method, deemed rate of return method or the cost method (section EX 57(2)(a)).
*   Where a person chooses to use the close of trading spot exchange rate to convert foreign income tax paid by a CFC (section LK 3(a)).

Unless the actual rate is the 15th or the last day of the month, these rates are not supplied by Inland Revenue.

The table [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - month end](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)
 provides exchange rates for the last day of the month. These are provided for convenience to assist taxpayers who may need exchange rates on those days.

### [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - rolling 12-month average table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for that month and the previous 11 months, ie the 12-month average. This table should be used where the accounting period or income year encompasses 12 complete months.

This table can be used to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for:

*   FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits method (section EX 49(8)); comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57)
*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC and FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of 12 months.

### [Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - mid-month actual table](https://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/overseas-currency-convert-nz.html)

This table sets out the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted. This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average where the accounting period or income year is less than or greater than 12 months (see Example 4). You can also use the rates from this table as the actual rate for any transactions arising on the 15th of the month.

This table can be used as the basis of the rolling average for calculating:

*   branch equivalent income or loss calculated under the CFC or FIF rules (section EX 21(4)) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months
*   a person's FIF income or loss under: the comparative value method, the fair dividend rate method, the deemed rate of return method or cost method (section EX 57(2)(b)) for accounting periods or income years of less than or greater than 12 months
*   foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LK 3(b) for accounting periods of less than or greater than 12 months.

**Note:** In the current Bill before Parliament there is a proposal to amend section YF 1 of the 2007 Act to give the Commissioner the ability to approve an exchange rate as an alternative to the one specified in the legislation. If that change is enacted into law, Inland Revenue will accept the mid-month rate as an acceptable proxy for the actual rate on the day for any transactions falling within that month.

**Example 1**

A taxpayer with a 30 September balance date purchases shares in a Philippine company (which is a FIF but does produce a guaranteed yield) on 7 September 2009. Its opening market value on 1 October 2009 or its closing market value on 30 September 2009 is PHP 350,000. Using the comparative value method and applying the actual rate for the day (section EX 57(2)(a)), the opening market value is converted as follows:

PHP 350,000 ÷ 34.3916 = $10,176.90

(In this example, the rate selected is the month-end rate for September 2009 for PHP. Refer to the table "Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - month end".)

**Example 2**

A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 March 2010. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), which converts to:

HKD 200,000 ÷ 5.2836 = $37,852.99

(In this example, the rate selected is the rolling 12-month average rate for March 2010 for HKD. Refer to the table "Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - rolling 12-month average".)

**Example 3**

A resident individual with a 30 September 2009 accounting period acquires a FIF interest in a Japanese company on 1 October 2008 for 10,500,000 yen. The interest is sold in September 2009 for 10,000,000 yen. Using the comparative value method and applying section EX 57(2)(b), these amounts are converted as:

JPY 10,500,000 ÷ 56.3883 = $186,208.84

JPY 10,000,000 ÷ 56.3883 = $177,341.75

(In this example, the rolling 12-month rate for September 2009 has been applied to both calculations.)

**Example 4**

A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2009 and has a balance date of 30 September 2009. During the period 1 May 2009 to 30 September 2009, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singaporean dollars was derived. For the conversion to New Zealand dollars the taxpayer chooses the method set out in section EX 21(4)(b).

1.  Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May - September 2009: 0.8614 + 0.9212 + 0.9416 + 0.9790 + 1.0005 = 4.7037  
    4.7037 ÷ 5 = 0.940740
2.  Round exchange rate to four decimal places: 0.9407
3.  Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.9407 = $531,519.08

(In this example, the rates are from the table "Currency rates 12 months ending 31 March 2010 - mid-month actual", from May to September 2009 inclusive for SGD.)

Foreign dividend exemptions
===========================

2012 legislation covers foreign dividend exemptions and applying the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) rules.

_Section CW 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

#### Key features

Most foreign dividends are exempt from New Zealand tax. The exceptions to this general rule depend on whether the person who receives the dividend is a company, or not a company.

If the person is not a company, foreign dividends will be assessable income of the person if the person uses the attributable FIF income method, or if an exemption from the FIF rules applies (including the exemption for interests of 10% or more in CFCs). The exemptions from the FIF rules have been described previously.

If the person is a company, foreign dividends will be assessable income if they are paid in relation to fixed-rate shares or if the dividend is tax-deductible in the foreign company's country of residence. They will also be assessable income if certain exemptions from the FIF rules apply (most notably the exemption for interests in ASX-listed companies), as long as sections EX 34 or EX 35 do not also apply.

#### Detailed analysis

When a person uses the comparative value, deemed rate of return or cost method for a FIF, they are treated as not receiving dividend income from that FIF (see section CD 36(1)), so any dividends received are effectively exempt.

When a taxpayer uses the fair dividend rate method for a FIF there is only one rare situation where dividends from certain Australian FIFs are assessable income of the person (see the section CD 36(2) example below). In all other cases the dividends are effectively exempt (section CD 36(1)).

**Example when section CD 36(2) applies**

At the beginning of their 2012-13 income year, a person holds an interest of 10% or more in an Australian company. The person's interest in the FIF would have satisfied the section EX 35 Australian exemption if they had maintained a 10% or greater income interest for the entire year. However, during the course of that year, the person's income interest in the FIF drops below 10% (for example, they may have sold some shares).

Because an exemption from the FIF rules no longer applies, the taxpayer uses the fair dividend rate method for the Australian company. For the 2012-13 income year the person has no income attributed under the fair dividend method for the Australian company (as the opening market value is treated as zero). However, any dividends that the Australian company pays to the person in 2012-13 are assessable income. From 2013-14 onward, there will be fair dividend rate income from the FIF and dividends will be exempt income of the person.

Foreign dividends are generally exempt when they are received by a New Zealand company. This is achieved by section CW 9(1). However, there are some complex exceptions to this. The effect of section CW 9 is summarised in the following table:

| Type of FIF interest | Dividends |
| --- | --- |
| The dividend is paid in relation to fixed-rate foreign equity or deductible foreign equity. | Dividends are assessable income.  <br>(See sections CW 9(2)(b) and (c).) |
| One or more of the following exemptions from the FIF rules applies:<br><br>*   section EX 31 (ASX-listed companies); or<br>*   section EX 32 (certain Australian unit trusts); or<br>*   sections EX 36, 37 or 37B  (various exemptions for venture capital companies);<br><br>AND neither of the following two exemptions apply:<br><br>*   section EX 34 (a 10% or greater interest in a CFC); nor<br>*   section EX 35 (a 10% or greater interest in a FIF that is resident and subject to tax in Australia). | Dividends are assessable income.  <br>(See section CW 9(2)(a).) |
| All other cases. | Dividends are exempt income if received by a company. |

Section CW 9 achieves the above results. Section EX 20B(3)(a) mirrors section CW 9(2) by attributing income from these dividends when they are received by CFCs or FIFs for which the person uses the attributable FIF income method.

Section CW 9(3)(a) prevents any type of PIE from accessing the foreign dividend exemption previously; only multi-rate PIEs were excluded from the foreign dividend exemption. Note that dividends received by PIEs will only be taxed in cases where an exemption from the FIF rules applies. For attributing FIF interests, the PIE will use one of the methods listed in section CD 36(1) and so will be treated as not receiving dividend income from those FIFs.

Foreign investment PIEs
=======================

2011 new portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules align the tax treatment of non-resident investors in PIEs with the tax treatment of direct investors.

**_Sections CP 1, CX 56, CX 56B, DB 54B, HM 1, HM 2, HM 6, HM 6B, HM 7, HM 8, HM 11 to 13, HM 19B, HM 19C, HM 31 to 33, HM 35C, HM 41, HM 44, HM 44B, HM 47, HM 51, HM 53, HM 55C to 55H, HM 60, HM 61, HM 64, HM 65, HM 71B, HM 82, IC 3, LS 1, LS 2, YA 1 and schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 28D, 31B and 31C of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

These new rules for foreign investment PIEs aim to align the tax treatment of non-resident investors in PIEs with the tax treatment of direct investors. Resident investors in a foreign investment PIE will continue to be taxed as if they were in an ordinary PIE.

#### Background

When the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules were originally developed in 2007, the focus was ensuring that the rules operated properly for resident investors in KiwiSaver funds. The rules were designed so the tax treatment of a resident investor in a PIE roughly matched that of direct investment into the PIE's underlying assets. This required reasonably complex rules in a number of areas. Given the complexity of the new rules and the systems changes for managed funds it was not practical at that time to also provide non-resident investors in a PIE a tax treatment similar to that of direct investors.

Non-resident investors are currently taxed at a flat 28 percent on their PIE income, regardless of the income's source and type. In many instances this rate is much higher than that which would apply had the investor invested directly into the PIE's underlying assets. For example, a non-resident investing in a foreign company would not be subject to New Zealand tax. This is because of the general principle underlying the tax system that non-residents should only be subject to tax on their New Zealand-sourced income. Despite this, such an investment through an ordinary PIE would be taxed at 28 percent.

The PIE rules have had time to bed down and the relevant legislation is now relatively settled. At the same time, various reports (most recently, the report of the International Funds Services Development Group) noted there is the potential for New Zealand to become a "financial hub", providing back-office services to international managed funds. To take advantage of such an opportunity, the over-taxation of non-resident investors in PIEs would need to be resolved. This is the objective of the new foreign investment PIE rules.

#### Key features

*   The Act introduces two new categories of PIE: "foreign investment zero-rate PIE" (referred to as "zero-rate PIEs") and "foreign investment variable-rate PIE" (referred to as "variable-rate PIEs"). The rules for these PIEs aim to align the tax treatment of non-resident investors in the PIE with the tax treatment of direct non-resident investors. Resident investors in a foreign investment PIE will continue to be taxed as if they were in an ordinary PIE.
*   The new rules are optional. PIEs do not need to elect to become one of the new types of PIE and can continue to apply the existing rules, where PIEs are taxed at 28 percent on the income attributable to non-residents.
*   Zero-rate PIEs are generally only able to invest offshore. De minimis levels of New Zealand-sourced income are allowed, however. This allows such a PIE to finance its day-to-day operations with a New Zealand bank account, for example.
*   Zero-rate PIEs are taxed at zero percent on all PIE income attributable to certain non-residents.
*   Variable-rate PIEs can invest into both New Zealand and offshore assets.
*   Variable-rate PIEs face a variety of different tax rates on income attributable to non-residents, depending on the type and source of the income.

#### Application date

The rules for zero-rate PIEs apply from the date of Royal Assent of the Act on 29 August 2011. The rules for variable-rate PIEs will apply from 1 April 2012.

#### Detailed analysis

#### _Introductory provisions_

**_Sections HM 2, HM 6 and YA 1_**

Section HM 2 has been amended to include the two types of foreign investment PIE in the list of PIE types. Additionally, section HM 6 has been amended to set out the intended effects for investors in foreign investment PIEs - namely:

*   that for a "notified foreign investor" in a foreign investment PIE, the PIE has a tax liability that resembles that of the investor if they were to make the investment directly; and
*   a notified foreign investor should have no tax liability on their PIE income unless they have been treated as a notified foreign investor when they do not in fact meet the relevant requirements.

A "notified foreign investor" is essentially a non-resident who has elected for the new rules to apply to them and has supplied the required information to the PIE. This concept is described more fully below.

Definitions have been inserted in section YA 1 for "foreign investment PIE", "foreign investment variable-rate PIE", "foreign investment zero-rate PIE" and "notified foreign investor".

#### _Notified foreign investors_

**_Sections CX 56, HM 55D and YA 1_**

The new tax treatment of investors in a foreign investment PIE applies to those who elect to become a "notified foreign investor". The relevant criteria for this election are set out in section HM 55D.

The general rule is that a notified foreign investor must be a non-resident. Specifically, a person cannot be:

*   resident in New Zealand;
*   a controlled foreign company;
*   a non-portfolio foreign investment fund; or
*   a non-resident trustee of a trust other than a foreign trust.

To target what is a non-portfolio foreign investment fund (FIF), the legislated restriction is that the item "income interest" in section EX 50(4) cannot be 10% or more for an investor. In effect, this means that if a FIF has a New Zealand-resident investor entitled to 10% or more of its income, either directly or indirectly, that FIF cannot elect to be a notified foreign investor.

A non-resident trustee of trusts other than foreign trusts cannot be a notified foreign investor. Such trustees are not taxed in the same way as other non-residents, so it is not appropriate for them to be treated as notified foreign investors. Similarly, resident trustees of foreign trusts are not able to be notified foreign investors as such trustees are taxed as New Zealand residents on any New Zealand-sourced trustee income.

In addition to a person not being one of the types described above, in order to be treated as a notified foreign investor, a person must also provide the PIE with the information set out in section 28D(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Examples of required information are the person's name, address, country, and their tax file number in their home country (if applicable).

If an investor in a foreign investment PIE meets these requirements, the investor can notify the foreign investment PIE that they wish to be treated as a notified foreign investor. If the person meets the relevant criteria, they then become a notified foreign investor. Special rules apply when a person transitions to or from being a notified foreign investor as set out in section HM 55E. See "Change in status of investors in foreign investment PIEs" later in this section for more detail.

_PIE relying on notification_

Investors must self-assess that they are a person who can be a notified foreign investor. Accordingly, a foreign investment PIE can rely on an investor's notification that they should be treated as a notified foreign investor.

The investor must provide the PIE with the information set out in section 28D(1) of the Tax Administration Act. If the investor does not, the PIE is unable to treat the investor as a notified foreign investor.

_Ineligible investor treated as a notified foreign investor_

If an investor has been treated as a notified foreign investor when they do not in fact meet the relevant requirements, the investor will generally be treated in the same way as a resident investor who notifies a PIE of a tax rate that is too low. That is, section CX 56 will not apply to the PIE income attributed to them, so the income will not be excluded. If this is the case the investor should include the attributed PIE income in their tax return and is able to claim a tax credit for any tax paid by the PIE on their behalf.

An exception to this general rule is if one of the transitional rules in section HM 55E apply. These are described in more detail below.

_Commissioner can override notification_

Although a PIE is able to rely on an investor's notification that they are eligible to be a notified foreign investor, section HM 55D(6) provides that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is able to advise the PIE to disregard the investor's notification and treat them as an ordinary non-resident investing in a PIE, taxed at 28%. This notification must be on reasonable grounds.

#### _Calculation of income and tax liability for notified foreign investors_

**_Sections DB 54B, HM 35C, HM 47, HM 55F, HM 64, HM 65 and schedule 6_**

Foreign investment PIEs have special rules for calculating PIE income attributed to notified foreign investors and the associated tax liability.

_Calculating income_

The aim of the foreign investment PIE regime is to tax PIE income attributed to non-resident investors in a similar manner to a direct non-resident investor. To reflect this, expenses incurred in relation to notified foreign investors are non-deductible. This is provided by section DB 54B. Further, the calculation formulae in sections HM 35 to 47 are modified so any expenses cannot be subtracted from the income of a notified foreign investor. Carry-forward losses and land losses are similarly set to zero. It should be noted, however, that streaming is not allowed. Expenses and losses must still be attributed to notified foreign investors even though they cannot be utilised by them.

Section HM 35C(2) provides that, for the purpose of the calculations in sections HM 35 to 47, for each investor class, a foreign investment PIE must treat the notified foreign investors of that class as if they were in a separate notional investor class. The purpose of this rule is to split each investor class in two - one part containing investors to whom the normal PIE rules apply and one part containing notified foreign investors.

Importantly, it is not intended that a foreign investment PIE be forced to create a notional investor class for its notified foreign investors if there is a better way for the PIE to create the same result.

##### Example

In the current calculation period, ABC, a PIE, has derived $1000 in assessable income and incurred $100 of expenses deriving that income. In addition, ABC has $200 of formation losses that it can use in the period.

ABC has 2 investors, Rachael and Grant, who are each entitled to 50% of its distributions (for simplicity, assume that ABC does not need to meet the "investor in" requirements of the PIE rules). Rachael is a notified foreign investor and Grant is a resident investor with a 28% prescribed investor rate.

ABC must attribute Rachael's share of its expenses and formation losses; however, it cannot use these to reduce Rachael's net income. Her attributed PIE income is therefore equivalent to her share of the PIE's assessable income, ie $500.

As Grant is an ordinary resident investor he is able to benefit from ABC's expenses and formation losses. Grant will have attributed PIE income of $350, which is his share of ABC's income less his share of the expenses and formation losses.

The $50 of expenses and $100 of formation losses that ABC was not able to utilise (as they were attributed to a notified foreign investor) are exhausted. They cannot be used in a later period.

#### _Correction of errors_

PIEs, on occasion, erroneously attribute an amount of income to an investor. In some cases it is not possible to directly undo this error, for example due to the passage of time. In such cases a PIE will often attribute an investor, in the current period, an offsetting negative amount of income, which effectively undoes the earlier error.

It is not intended for such an adjustment to be affected by section HM 35C, which modifies section HM 35 so expenses cannot be subtracted from a notified foreign investor's income. Such adjustments are considered to be accounting entries designed to correct earlier errors, so do not form part of the legislated formulae.

_Calculation of tax liability_

Section HM 47 is amended to establish how a notified foreign investor's tax liability should be calculated. Subsection (2B) clarifies that, for a notified foreign investor, the calculation in subsection (3) must be done for each investment type and source. This requirement is only relevant for variable-rate PIEs, for which different tax rates apply for different investment types and sources.

Linking in with this is section HM 55F(2), which requires a variable-rate PIE to identify the source and type (if it is not a foreign-sourced amount) of all amounts attributed to notified foreign investors. The different tax rates for income of differing types and sources are set out in schedule 6, table 1B. The requirement to perform the calculation in subsection (3) for each investment type and source does not apply to a zero-rate PIE, as all its income attributed to a notified foreign investor is taxed at the same rate (0%).

There is no change in the tax liability calculation for investors other than for notified foreign investors in either type of foreign investment PIE.

Finally, if a notified foreign investor's tax liability is negative, new section HM 55F(6) provides that no tax credit arises.

#### _Optional flow-through rule_

**_Section HM 6B_**

PIEs often use a tiered investment structure, where retail PIEs invest through larger wholesale PIEs. New section HM 6B provides an optional flow-through rule to ensure this structure is compatible with foreign investment PIEs.

_Full flow-through_

Sections HM 6B(1) and (2) provide a rule ultimately designed to be used by variable-rate PIEs, however, the rule can be used by any type of PIE.

The flow-through rule allows a PIE (PIE A) to be treated as if it has derived another PIE's (PIE B's) income directly. If PIE A applies the flow-through rule, income from PIE B would not be "attributed PIE income" but would retain its character. This includes notional income, such as income under the fair dividend rate (FDR) regime, which is not paid to B but is deemed to be derived by it nonetheless.

The intention is that expenses charged to A by B will also be treated as incurred by A. This should be the case regardless of whether the charge is explicit (ie, an invoice sent to A) or implicit (ie, B takes out its charges from what it attributes to A). Nevertheless, these expenses will not be deductible if they are attributed to notified foreign investors or if there is no nexus with assessable income (for example, they were incurred in deriving untaxed amounts).

The flow-through rule is designed to look through multiple levels of PIE. For example, say PIE A invested into PIE B, which in turn invested into PIE C. B could use the flow-through rule for the income it derives from C, and in turn A could use the flow-through rule for the income it derives from B. In effect, A will be treated as if it has derived its share of C's income directly.

Applying the optional flow-through rule requires information about the gross receipts from each investment source and type to flow between PIEs each attribution period. The rule cannot be used unless this information is available. As such, if the information is not available, any attributed PIE income should be treated as such, and accordingly will have a New Zealand source.

##### Example

R is a retail PIE that invests solely into W, a wholesale PIE. R holds 20% of the units in W, so is entitled to 20% of W's income. R is a variable-rate PIE while W is an ordinary PIE.

In the latest calculation period, W has derived the following amounts of New Zealand-sourced income:

*   $1,000 interest income;
*   $2,000 fully imputed dividends;
*   $5,000 from a foreign currency hedge.

W has also derived $10,000 in foreign-sourced amounts.

R is able to get this information from W, which is sufficient information to apply the flow-through rule, and chooses to apply the flow-through. Accordingly, R is treated as deriving its share of W's income. Specifically:

*   $200 New Zealand-sourced interest income;
*   $400 New Zealand-sourced fully imputed dividends;
*   $1,000 New Zealand-sourced non-interest financial arrangement income; and
*   $2,000 foreign-sourced income.

#### _Variable-rate PIE treating amounts as foreign-sourced_

Section HM 6B(3) provides a flow-through rule that allows it to treat income derived from a zero-rate PIE (or a PIE eligible to become a zero-rate PIE) as a foreign-sourced amount. This is on the basis that the ultimate investments will generally be offshore.

A similar rule operates for zero-rate PIEs, allowing such PIEs to derive income from a zero-rate PIE (or a PIE eligible to become a zero-rate PIE) although, on its face, the income will be New Zealand sourced. This is described in the section "Allowable amounts".

#### _Modified residence rules_

**_Sections HM 8(2) and HM 19B(2)_**

Section HM 19B(2) is designed to clarify that a zero-rate PIE will be treated as resident in New Zealand provided it is a unit trust to which the Unit Trust Act applies and has a New Zealand resident trustee. The clarification is necessary because unit trusts are not incorporated, so country of incorporation cannot be used to determine residence. No such clarification is necessary for PIEs that are companies, as place of incorporation is available to determine residence for companies.

The section is not intended to restrict the types of entity eligible to become a zero-rate PIE.

#### _Investment types and sources_

**_Sections HM 11, HM 12, HM 19B(1) and HM 19C_** 

Sections HM 19B(1) and HM 19C set out the rules for the investment types and sources that zero-rate PIEs and variable-rate PIEs, respectively, are able to derive. It is important to note that the "investment-out" restrictions of HM 11 to HM 13 that apply to ordinary PIEs also generally apply to foreign investment PIEs.

A zero-rate is only able to derive a foreign sourced amount or an allowable amount (a concept defined by section HM 55G).

It is intended that the measurement of whether or not a zero-rate PIE's New Zealand-sourced income falls within the criteria of allowable amounts should only be done quarterly (as per section HM 55H). If a zero-rate PIE inadvertently breaches one of the allowable amount thresholds, the PIE will generally have a quarter to remedy the breach. That said, it is not intended that this rule should be used by a PIE to intentionally derive New Zealand sourced income in between the quarterly tests.

A variable-rate PIE is able to derive both foreign sourced amounts and New Zealand sourced amounts. However, variable-rate PIEs are not able to invest in New Zealand land (or rights or options in relation to land), nor are they able to derive income from New Zealand land. Non-residents can generally deduct expenses incurred in deriving income from land, so allowing such investment would greatly complicate the foreign investment PIE rules.

Both variable-rate and zero-rate PIEs are able to invest in land not situated in New Zealand. Variable-rate PIEs can also invest in New Zealand companies that own land, although there are limits on the percentage of ownership the PIE can have.

As with zero-rate PIEs, variable-rate PIEs are also generally given a "grace period", designed to allow corrections of any inadvertent breaches of these rules.

#### _Modified investment-out test_

**_Section HM 13_**

PIEs are generally only able to hold up to 20% of the voting rights in ordinary companies (or, for unit trusts, 20% of the interests in that trust). This restriction is extended for foreign investment PIEs so that it also applies to land investment companies and entities that qualify for PIE status. In effect, foreign investment PIEs can only exceed the 20% limit on investments in other PIEs (including foreign investment PIEs) and foreign PIE equivalents.

The reason for this broad 20% ownership restriction is to ensure the non-deductibility of expenses attributed to notified foreign investors. Allowing a foreign investment PIE to have controlling interests in subsidiary companies could provide opportunities for that PIE to shift non-deductible expenses to its subsidiary entities, where the expenses may be deductible. The same concern does not arise with controlling interests in subsidiary PIEs due to the operation of the flow-through rule. Thus, the ownership restriction does not apply to such investments.

#### _Rules for the treatment of investors_

**_Section HM 32(3)_**

Section HM 32(3) provides that, if a person notifies a PIE that they wish to be treated as a notified foreign investor, that person is treated as having notified the PIE of a tax rate for the purposes of section HM 32(1). The default rate therefore does not apply for the person.

#### _Foreign investment PIEs and PIE proxies_

**_Section HM 33_**

The rules for PIE proxies have been modified to cater for foreign investment PIEs. If a PIE proxy chooses to provide the benefits to its non-resident investors of the foreign investment PIE rules, it must:

*   act as a proxy for a foreign investment PIE;
*   obtain the PIE's income details in order to apply the appropriate tax rates to each type and source of income if acting for a variable-rate PIE; and
*   collect any information from the investor required by the PIE (such as the investor's country of residence, which is required under section HM 55D(4)).

These new provisions only apply to proxies that choose to act for foreign investment PIEs. There is no change in the treatment of proxies that act only for ordinary PIEs.

#### _No provisional tax option for foreign investment PIEs_

**_Sections HM 41(3) and HM 44_**

Foreign investment PIEs are unable to use the provisional tax option for calculating their tax liability. The rationale for this restriction was that, given the nature of PIEs that pay provisional tax, it was considered they would be unable to comply with the new rules.

#### _Ability to withhold NRWT_

**_Sections HM 44 and CX 56B_**

Instead of paying tax on behalf of a notified foreign investor, a foreign investment PIE has the option of withholding non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on distributions of unimputed dividends paid out to the investor. If the PIE received partially imputed dividends from a New Zealand company, it would be able to use this option to the extent the dividends were unimputed. For example, if it received a $100 dividend with $20 of imputation credits attached, and the PIE distributed the full $100, it could withhold NRWT on $48.57 of the distribution.

As NRWT is a withholding tax, this option can only be applied to amounts actually distributed. Note that, due to the fungibility of money, it is only required that the PIE distribute an amount equivalent to what it has in unimputed dividends. This distribution must be made on or before the date the PIE would otherwise be required to pay PIE tax on the amount.

For example, if the PIE were an "exit PIE" (ie, pays tax under section HM 42), it would generally have until 30 April after the end of the tax year to make a distribution and withhold NRWT. However, if a notified foreign investor reached an exit period, the PIE would generally need to make the distribution one month after the end of the month in which the exit period fell in order to be able to apply this NRWT option.

If a PIE elects to withhold NRWT on an amount on behalf of a notified foreign investor, that amount is not included in the investor's assessable income in section HM 35(3) or their income in section HM 36(3). As such, it does not constitute income that the PIE must pay tax on, nor is it included in the investor's attributed PIE income. Further, section CX 56, which normally deems distributions from a PIE to be excluded, does not apply. In all, this is to clarify that the NRWT is a tax borne by the investor, not the PIE.

Finally, section CX 56B does not apply to the extent a distribution has had NRWT withheld on it. This means the income is not excluded income of the investor. If the amount distributed exceeds the amount that has been subject to NRWT, the balance continues to be excluded.

##### Example

Z has elected to become a variable-rate foreign investment PIE. Z has derived $400 in income, constituting:

*   $200 New Zealand-sourced partially imputed dividends ($200 cash dividend with $40 of imputation credits attached);
*   $200 foreign-sourced amounts.

Z has decided it will distribute all of this income to its investors.

Z has two investors: Sarah, who has elected to be a notified foreign investor, and Frank, who is a resident investor with a 28% prescribed investor rate (for simplicity, assume that Z does not need to meet the "investor in" requirements of the PIE rules). Each investor holds 50% of the units in Z.

Since Sarah is a notified foreign investor, Z has decided to withhold NRWT on the payment to her. Sarah's share of Z's dividends is $100 and $20 of imputation credits, which is equivalent to $51.43 in fully imputed dividends and $48.57 in unimputed dividends. Z therefore withholds NRWT on $48.57 of its distribution, which is $7.29 (assuming the applicable NRWT rate is 15%).

The income that Z has withheld NRWT on ceases to be attributed PIE income of Sarah's - her attributed PIE income is now $151.43. Z must pay tax on this amount as usual; however, since it only consists of fully imputed dividends and foreign-sourced amounts, the applicable tax rate is 0%.

Net of tax, Sarah receives $192.71.

As Frank is a resident investor, Z must pay tax on income attributed to him as normal. Frank's share of Z's income is $200 (plus $20 of imputation credits) and Z must pay tax on this. Net of tax and after accounting for the imputation credits, Frank receives $158.40.

#### _Use of tax credits by foreign investment PIEs_

**_Sections LS 1, HM 51 and HM 53_**

The intention of the new rules is that notified foreign investors in foreign investment PIEs are unable to utilise foreign tax credits and imputation credits attributed to them. Other credits can be utilised by notified foreign investors, but we do not expect this to be a common occurrence. PIEs generally hold RWT exemption certificates so it would be unusual for a notified foreign investor to be attributed an RWT credit in relation to interest earned. Nevertheless, if this were to happen, the PIE would be able to utilise this credit on the investor's behalf. In turn, the investor would be taxed at the rate generally charged on interest paid to non-residents. Overall, the treatment should match that afforded to a non-resident investing directly.

It is important to note that a foreign investment PIE cannot stream its tax credits. It must still attribute its credits amongst investors as stipulated by section HM 50, despite the fact that credits attributed to notified foreign investors will generally not be able to be used.

#### _Modified source rules_

**_Section HM 55C_**

For foreign investment PIEs, certain source rules are overridden in some situations. Income attributed to a notified foreign investor is not deemed to have a New Zealand source merely because:

*   a foreign investment PIE carries on a business in New Zealand; or
*   the income is derived from a contract made or performed in New Zealand, provided the income from the contract relates to the PIE's offshore investments.

The restriction that a contract's income must relate to the PIE's offshore investment is designed to cover arrangements such as foreign currency hedges or derivatives to increase or decrease exposure to foreign share markets - even if that contract is entered into with a New Zealand counterparty. The restriction was put in place as otherwise the rule could be too far-reaching. Some contracts may only be given a New Zealand source by the operation of section YD 4(3) (contracts made or performed in New Zealand). Overriding it without qualification would therefore be risky.

Importantly, if there is some other reason for an amount to have a New Zealand source, the income will continue to be treated as having a New Zealand source under section YD 4(18).

#### _Zero percent rate for transitional residents_

**_Sections CX 56, HM 55D(8) and schedule 6, table 1_**

Transitional residents are generally not taxed on their non-New Zealand sourced investment income. Accordingly, transitional residents are able to invest in zero-rate PIEs and be taxed at a 0% tax rate. Similar rules that apply to notified foreign investors are intended to also apply to such transitional residents, for example, fees and expenses should not be deductible to such investors and credits should not be able to be utilised by them. Similar transitional rules to those that apply to notified foreign investors who become or cease to be non-residents in a tax year also apply.

It should be noted that transitional residents cannot be notified foreign investors; they are only able to elect a 0% tax rate in zero-rate PIEs. This is on the basis that, while transitional residents are generally not taxed on their foreign-sourced investment income, they are taxed as a New Zealand resident on any New Zealand-sourced income. Allowing transitional residents to elect to be a notified foreign investor would therefore be inappropriate.

#### _Change in status of investors in foreign investment PIEs_

**_Sections CX 56 and HM 55E_**

Transitional rules can apply when a person changes to or from being a notified foreign investor. These rules are designed to simplify when an investor transitions to and from being a New Zealand resident. The rules reflect that a person's change of residency can be retrospective by the operation of the "183-day rule" in section YD 1(3) and that not all PIEs will be able to apply an investor's new status immediately.

Section CX 56 applies to an investor if that investor has become or ceased to be a New Zealand-resident in the tax year. For such an investor, any attributed PIE income will be excluded income, even if the investor is treated as a notified foreign investor when they are resident.

Similarly, section HM 55E does not require a foreign investment PIE to change an investor's status as soon as they are notified. At the latest the change needs to be effected by the start of the next tax year, but must be as soon as is practicable by the PIE. If a PIE's systems are able to change an investor's status quickly, it cannot defer the change to the start of the next tax year. As described above, if there is a delay in changing an investor's status, there are no consequences for that investor.

#### _Allowable amounts for foreign investment zero-rate PIEs_

**_Sections HM 19B, HM 55G and HM 55H_**

Zero-rate PIEs are generally only supposed to derive foreign-sourced amounts. However, it is acknowledged that such PIEs will, in some situations need to derive some New Zealand-sourced income. Accordingly, zero-rate PIEs are permitted to derive the following "allowable amounts".

#### _Income from financial arrangements_

Zero-rate PIEs are able to derive income from financial arrangements with a New Zealand-source in two situations. The first situation is if the arrangements do not pay interest and relate to the PIE's offshore investments. "Offshore investments" in this context is intended to have a similar meaning to that in the modified source rules, discussed above.

The second situation is if the arrangements pay only interest income and have a term of 90 days or less (or no term at all). This exemption only applies if the total value of the PIE's financial arrangements that have a term of 90 days or less (but not including any non-interest arrangements as described above), is less than 5% of the total value of the PIE's investments (including the value of any non-interest arrangements).

In both cases, "interest" is intended to have its defined meaning, that is, a payment made for money lent to any person.

The purpose of the first exemption is to allow zero-rate PIEs to enter into derivatives (such as foreign currency hedges) in New Zealand. The purpose of the second exemption is to allow these PIEs to have New Zealand bank accounts to fund day-to-day management costs.

##### Example

A variable-rate PIE has the following New Zealand-sourced financial arrangements:

*   $5,000 in a 30-day term deposit, paying interest at 5% p.a.;
*   $10,000 in an on-call account, paying interest at 1.43% p.a.;
*   a foreign-exchange hedge (which does not pay any interest), designed to remove the effect of currency fluctuations on its offshore investments, with a market value of $7500.

The total value of all of the PIE's other investments is currently $285,000 and the income from these investments does not have a New Zealand source.

The total value of the PIE's investments is $307,500. The PIE has $15000 in interest-bearing financial arrangements with a term of 90 days or less, or no term at all. As a percent of total investments this is 4.88%.

The PIE therefore meets the requirement of deriving only foreign-sourced amounts and "allowable amounts". The PIE's New Zealand-sourced financial arrangements that pay interest both have a term of 90 days or less and constitute less than 5% of the PIE's investment portfolio. The only other New Zealand-sourced income that the PIE could derive is from a non-interest bearing financial arrangement that relates to the PIE's offshore investments

_Income from dividends_

Zero-rate PIEs are also able to derive income from New Zealand dividends if the total value of all shares held by the PIE in New Zealand-resident companies is less than 1% of its investments.

The purpose of this exemption is to allow PIEs that track a global share index to be zero-rate PIEs, even though they may have a small exposure to New Zealand equity.

_Income from other foreign investment zero-rate PIEs_

Income from other zero-rate PIEs (or PIEs that could be zero-rate PIEs if they elected to be one) also count as an "allowable amount". This is on the basis that the ultimate investments of the PIE will be offshore. This forms a similar flow-through rule provided to variable-rate PIEs by section HM 6B(3).

#### _Breaches of the foreign investment PIE rules_

**_Section HM 55H_**

Section HM 55H provides special breach rules for the additional requirements of foreign investment PIEs. The existing breach rules also apply to foreign investment PIEs where a requirement of being a normal PIE is not met.

As with the original PIE rules, it is intended that whether or not a foreign investment PIE meets the relevant rules is to be tested every quarter. This is because requiring more frequent testing would be excessively costly from a compliance perspective. However, there are certain requirements that, if breached, have immediate consequences.

_Zero-rate PIEs_

Zero-rate PIEs are only allowed to derive foreign-sourced and "allowable" amounts. As described above, certain thresholds apply to some of these allowable amounts, for example, there is a maximum of 1% of total assets in New Zealand shares. If one of these thresholds is exceeded, that breach must be remedied on the last day of the next quarter (when the PIE will again do its quarterly check). If the breach is not remedied, the foreign investment zero-rate PIE will become a foreign investment variable-rate PIE on the first day of the third quarter.

If, on the other hand, a zero-rate PIE derives an amount other than an allowable amount or a foreign sourced amount, the PIE will become a foreign investment variable-rate PIE immediately. The reason for this difference is that it was considered very unlikely that a PIE could inadvertently derive an amount other than a foreign-sourced or allowable amount, but it is feasible that a PIE could inadvertently breach a threshold for an allowable amount from time to time.

_Foreign investment variable-rate PIEs_

Variable-rate PIEs are required to meet the requirements of sections HM 55F(3) and HM 19C. Among other things, these provisions require the PIE to identify the source and type of amounts of income derived. If one of these criteria is not met, then, similar to a foreign investment zero-rate PIE, the PIE will have until the last day of the next quarter to remedy the breach. If this is not done, the PIE will become an ordinary multi-rate PIE from the first day of the third quarter.

_Transitional rule_

The rules for foreign investment variable-rate PIEs do not come into force until 1 April 2012. Therefore, section HM 55H(5) provides that if a foreign investment zero-rate PIE breaches one of the rules and loses its status before 1 April 2012, it will become a multi-rate PIE.

#### _Election to be a foreign investor PIE_

**_Sections HM 71B and HM 72_**

Section HM 71B provides that an entity can elect to become a foreign investment PIE if it:

*   is, or is eligible to be, a multi-rate PIE;
*   has, or intends to have, non-resident investors; and
*   does not use the provisional tax option of section HM 44 to pay its tax if the entity is a PIE.

The entity's election will have to include which type of foreign investment PIE it wishes to become. Finally, the existing rules providing when an entity's election to become a PIE take effect have been modified to also apply to entities becoming foreign investment PIEs.

#### _Modified grouping rules_

**_Section IC 3_**

New subsection IC 3(2D) provides that a foreign investment PIE cannot be part of a group of companies that includes a land investment company. In other words, a foreign investment PIE is only able to group with wholly-owned PIEs.

#### _Yearly request of information_

**_Section 31C of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Section 31C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been modified to provide that a foreign investment PIE must, at least once a year, ask its notified foreign investors to confirm that:

*   they are still eligible to be a notified foreign investor; and
*   the information the PIE is required to collect under section 28D(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has not changed.

If the PIE receives no response, the PIE may continue to treat the investor as a notified foreign investor.

Foreign superannuation are funds created outside of New Zealand to provide retirement benefits to individuals. 

Periodic payments and lump sum withdrawals or transfers
-------------------------------------------------------

Your foreign superannuation transactions will be taxed differently depending on:

*   your type of transaction
*   if a double tax agreement applies.

For lump sum withdrawals or transfers, you might also qualify for a 4-year tax exemption.

### Double tax agreements

Keep in mind that a double tax agreement (DTA) may be in place between New Zealand and the country or territory where you have foreign superannuation. You, or a tax professional, will need to check because DTAs can affect how you're taxed on your foreign superannuation transactions.

### Tax on lump sums begins after 4 years

A 4-year tax exemption can apply to [lump sums](/api/glossary/item?id={5F5AE3AC-6071-4E79-A5F5-09FE1AF59965})
. You will not have to pay tax in the exemption period for the lump sum you receive.

The exemption period:

*   starts from the date you become a [New Zealand tax resident](/api/glossary/item?id={CC613A0F-B2AE-4755-B947-A74A5002A8EF})
     and runs for 4 years
*   is not available for foreign super acquired while you were a New Zealand tax resident.

If you become a [non-resident](/api/glossary/item?id={629D26DB-A2DC-4E9F-88E8-397C0AA00D67})
 within 4 years of becoming a tax resident, the exemption only applies from the date you became a resident until when you became a non-resident again.

This 4-year tax exemption applies only to foreign superannuation. There is another temporary tax exemption of the same name and timeframe but with different conditions and effects. It comes up when working out your international tax situation.

Schedule method
---------------

The schedule method is the default option when calculating lump sum amounts of your foreign superannuation.

Under this method you pay tax on a percentage of the lump sum. The percentage varies depending on how long you've been a New Zealand tax resident.

Formula method
--------------

The formula method is complex. To use it, we recommend getting advice from a tax professional.

Under this method, you are taxed on the actual gains of your foreign superannuation interest. This tax is between when your 4-year exemption expires and the date you get the lump sum.

Forfeiture of shares taxable under FIF regime
=============================================

2008 case note – Judge held that the forfeiture of shares operated as a purchase price adjustment but did not matter for the Foreign Investment Fund Rules.

Case

Govind Prasad Saha v CIR CIV 2007-485-701

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, FIF rules

### Summary

The Commissioner treated the forfeiture of shares as a disposal at market value. The plaintiff maintained that the shares were not disposed of for gain; rather there was an adjustment to the original purchase price. His Honour held that the forfeiture operated as a purchase price adjustment; however, he did not consider that the arrangement mattered in terms of the Foreign Investment Fund Rules (FIF).

### Facts

In 2000, Ernst and Young (E&Y) sold the consultancy arm of its business to Cap Gemini, an international company. After a parent agreement was reached, the partners of E&Y in each country where the business offered the consultancy service in issue had the option of joining the sale. The New Zealand office chose to do so. The sale involved the transfer of the relevant E&Y staff to the new business. Those staff members entered into employment agreements with the new company. In the case of partners such as the plaintiff, the agreements included a penalty formula if the partner left the new company within the term of the five-year employment agreement. The penalty formula involved the return of some shares which the partner had received as his or her share of the sale proceeds. It was a sliding scale formula where the amount liable to be returned decreased as the years went by. Rules were also put in place to prevent diminution of the share holdings during the five-year period. The plaintiff left the new company within the five-year term of his contract, and the sliding scale formula was applied. This meant he forfeited a number of shares he had received.

The share allocations and disposals were caught by the Foreign Investment Fund Rules (FIF). The FIF rules are designed to operate by attributing a pro-rata share of the foreign identity's income to the taxpayer. The value of the taxpayer's share in the FIF may be assessed by one of four methods - accounting profits, branch equivalent, comparative method and deemed rate of return.

The plaintiff elected to use the comparative value method in section CG 18 of the Income Tax Act 1994 as the route to which his interest was to be valued. Under this method, if the value of a person's holding has increased during the course of a tax year, that increase will be treated as income, and if it has decreased it will be treated as a deductible loss.

During the 2002 year, the plaintiff forfeited 2095 shares as he had left the employment of Cap Gemini. The Commissioner and the plaintiff disagreed as to the treatment of these shares in the CG 18 formula. The Commissioner treated the forfeiture of shares as a disposal of an interest in a fund which is deemed by section CG23(5) to be at market value. The plaintiff maintained that the shares were not disposed of for gain; rather there was an adjustment to the original purchase price reflecting that what the plaintiff had sold to Cap Gemini in 2001 had become less valuable. The plaintiff further argued that if it was too late to visit the 2001 assessment, then each income tax year should be treated separately.

### Decision

Simon France J set out the provisions of CG 23(5), regarding them as the crux of this dispute:

For the purposes of this Act, where at any time in an income year a Person disposes of any property which is, with respect to the period immediately before disposition, an interest of the person in a fund with respect to which the person uses the comparative value method or the deemed rate of return method, **for no consideration or for consideration which is less than the market value of the property at the time, the person shall be deemed to have derived from the disposition consideration equal to the market value of the property at the time**. (Emphasis added.)

His Honour held that the forfeiture operates as a purchase price adjustment. However he did not consider that the arrangement mattered in terms of the FIF rules; and stated:

\[50\] In tax year 2001 Dr Saha declared his interest in a foreign investment fund to be 7566 shares, such shares having been acquired by him at a cost of $3,497,552. For tax purposes, Dr Saha therefore had that degree of interest in the foreign company. Thereafter, any adjustments in the number of shares had to be reflected in the relevant tax year. Acquisition of further shares would be treated as a deductible cost but of course, the year end value would also reflect the greater number of shares. Disposition of shares would be treated as an assessable gain, but again the year end value would reflect the lesser number of shares now owned.

His Honour considered that there was no consideration for the disposal and it was therefore deemed by section CG23 (5) to amount to a disposal at market value:

\[51\] In tax year 2002 Cap Gemini has not paid anything for the shares. No consideration at the time of the disposal has passed from Cap Gemini to Dr Saha. Rather, it is, as the taxpayer contended, an adjustment to the original purchase price. Accordingly, I would see CG23 (5) as directly engaged, as the Commissioner contends.

Forgiveness of debt held to be a “monetary” gift
================================================

Nancy Lois Roberts challenged a decision of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue disallowing charitable tax credits for gifts she made to the Oasis Charitable Trust

Case

Nancy Lois Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2153

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007 ss LD 1 and LD 3

### Summary

Nancy Lois Roberts (“Mrs Roberts”) challenged a decision of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) disallowing charitable tax credits for gifts she made to the Oasis Charitable Trust (“the Trust”). At issue was the meaning of “a monetary gift of $5 or more that is paid…” under s LD 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) and whether Mrs Roberts’ forgiveness of debt of the Trust constituted “a monetary gift”. The Commissioner argued that forgiveness of a debt is not a charitable gift within the meaning of ss LD 1 and LD 3 of the Act, because “monetary” means the payment must be made in cash form only.

The Court found in favour of Mrs Roberts.

### Impact

The judgment clarifies that forgiveness of a debt owed by a qualifying entity can constitute a “monetary gift … paid” to such a trust.

The judgment further determines that in appropriate circumstances, taxpayers forgiving debt owed to them by charitable trusts can claim tax credits for such forgiveness.

### Facts

Mrs Roberts and her husband jointly established the Trust on 14 October 2007 and registered it with the Charities Commission in November 2007. The Trust’s charitable objects were to facilitate the growth of Christian faith within New Zealand by helping local churches, providing assistance to people in need of shelter, clothing and education, and by raising money for the benefit of the community.

On 16 October 2008, Mr and Mrs Roberts loaned $1,708,080.90 to the Trust in the form of a bank term deposit, with $500,000 to be invested in Telecom bonds and the remainder on a term deposit with interest to be reinvested in the name of the Trust.

In each income year ending 2011 to 2015, Mr and Mrs Roberts executed Deeds of Gift which released the Trust from liability to repay specified amounts of the loan. They then claimed a tax credit for each of those five years on the basis that the forgiveness of debt was a charitable gift. Those credits totalled $91,577.24, corresponding to $274,732 of forgiven debt.

The Commissioner wrote to Mrs Roberts on 1 December 2015 initiating a risk review with respect to her claimed tax credits. On 4 May 2016, as a result of the review, the tax credits were reversed and Mrs Roberts was requested to repay them.

### Decision

Interpreting the meaning of “monetary”, the Court first looked at the legislative history of ss LD 1 and LD 3. The predecessor of these sections in the Income Tax Act 2004 was s KC 5 which allowed rebates for gifts of “money of $5 or more…” The Court found that Parliament intentionally removed the word “money” when enacting ss LD 1 and LD 3 of the (2007) Act. The Court saw significance in the fact that Parliament later redressed questions raised about this removal by qualifying the gift with the phrase “monetary” on 27 February 2014 (Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014, ss 2 and 103), rather than restoring the previous wording of “money”. The Court said because Parliament chose to sue a broader phrase,, this suggested a broader scope to the provision. If Parliament sought to restrict tax credits to cases of cash donations only, it could have clearly amended the section to reflect that.

The Commissioner argued that potential mischief may arise from a finding that forgiveness of a debt can be charitable gift, including the fact that it could be difficult to verify the details of loans made many years prior, it would provide the opportunity for taxpayers to manipulate books of account to reflect loans that have in substance not been made, and valuation issues could arise in cases where a charitable trust becomes insolvent and the loan has been reduced to a lower sum than its face value.

The Court found that forgiveness of debt does not raise the same issues of valuation that arise for donations of chattels or property, which are outside the scope of s LD 3 (_Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2018\] NZHC 2153). It held that forgiving a debt places a charity in a better position than before, as well as in the same position as if a taxpayer had made a cash donation. Finally, the Court found that the administrative costs incurred by the Commissioner would be the same whether the donation was made in cash or in the form of forgiveness of debt, making the prospect of mischief minimal.

The Court held that “monetary” is a broader concept than “money” in the form of cash and did not accept that “monetary gifts” must be cash only. The value of the gift is the monetary figure that is credited to the recipient.

The Court found that Mrs Robert’s gifting programme, by which, each year the Trust’s debt was forgiven in portion, by Deeds of Gift, resulted in the Trust’s liability being reduced each year. The Trust was the recipient of a gift in the express amount of the relevant Deed of Gift, and such sums qualify as gifts.

The Court held that to require monetary gifts to be made in cash only, as the Commissioner submitted, artificially restricts the legislative language of the Act (at \[57\]).

Regarding the meaning of “paid” in s LD 3 of the Act, the Court noted case law authorities consistently recognise that payment can be effected by the reduction of a debt (see _Databank Systems Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1990\] 3 NZLR 385 (PC); _In re Harmony and Montague Tin and Copper Mining Co (Spargo’s Case)_ (1873) LR 8 Ch App 407 (EWCA); _North Sydney Investment and Tramway Co Ltd v Higgins_ \[1899\] AC 263 (PC); and _Healing Industries Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1988) 10 NZTC 5,115 (HC)), thus Mrs Roberts’ monetary gifts were “paid” to the Trust within the meaning of the Act.

The Court found that Mrs Roberts’ forgiveness of the Trust’s debts were monetary gifts of $5 or more paid to a charitable trust within the scope of s LD 3 of the Act, and therefore Mrs Roberts was entitled to claim tax credits for the years ending 2011 to 2015.

Former business man denies hardworking New Zealanders of essential services
===========================================================================

**07 August 2014**

A retired Whitianga property developer has been sentenced after pleading guilty to stealing taxpayers' money that he admitted he knew he was not entitled to.

Inland Revenue Group Manager for Investigations and Advice, Patrick Goggin said Michael Raymond Holmes was a tax cheat who deliberately tried to beat the system and deny hard-working New Zealanders.

"Holmes knew what he did was wrong but continued to use his companies to evade paying $775,000 of tax for four years. By stealing taxpayers' money from Inland Revenue he attempted to cheat those of us who abide by the rules. The money he claimed is used to pay for essential services like our schools and hospitals.

"Holmes registered three of his businesses for GST and used them to buy further commercial buildings and units. When some of his purchases did not go through, he still claimed the GST on them," said Mr Goggin.

One of Holmes' companies, Danyon Investment Limited entered into a purchase agreement on an Auckland property which resulted in him receiving a GST refund of $300,000. In June 1998, investigations by Inland Revenue found the purchase had not in fact gone ahead.

"Holmes stated he was aware the GST should have been returned but was struggling with financial difficulties," said Mr Goggin. "He also used another of his companies, Avila Property Investments Limited to buy ten units for which no GST was paid on the sale of these either," he said.

This pattern of offending continued and Holmes used his third company, Westvue Property Investments Limited to buy another Auckland property.

"Holmes knew this purchase never went through but instead of notifying Inland Revenue, he banked the cheque and spent the money," Mr Goggin said. "This was blatant tax evasion by Holmes who was fully aware that what he was doing was wrong.

"Our tax system is one of voluntary compliance and the majority of New Zealanders who pay their fair share can be confident that those who deliberately try and cheat will be caught and face the consequences," he said.

Holmes was sentenced to ten months home detention at at Hamilton District Court yesterday and ordered after pleading guilty to eight various charges in relation to tax evasion.

He was ordered to to pay reparation of $252,649.00. The remaining amount was not able to be ordered by the court as Holmes owned no assets in his own name or they were held in a Trust.

Former real estate agent sentenced, sector campaign continues
=============================================================

**11 May 2022**

A former Nelson real estate agent has been sentenced to home detention on tax fraud charges after overstating her expenses and under reporting her income.

Pauline Michelle Mere Johnstone plead guilty to a representative charge of knowingly providing altered, false, incomplete, or misleading GST returns to obtain more than $45,000 in GST refunds which she was not entitled to.

She was sentenced this month to 5 months home detention and ordered to pay $10,000 reparations.

Johnstone claimed expenses of $549,927.00 and reported income of $21,900.67 between 1 Oct 2016 and 31 January 2018. She received GST refunds of $45,105.16.

Johnstone’s actions are an example of the behaviour Inland Revenue highlighted last year when it started to focus on the real estate sector.

Inland Revenue started its campaign because a number of real estate agents appeared to be:

*   claiming private expenses against their business income and/or claiming expenses without supporting business records
*   using net versus gross values when reporting GST
*   ·not including wage subsidy payments received within their annual income tax return.

IRs Hidden Economy Lead, Trevor Jeffries, says analysis shows real estate agents commonly claim high levels of expenses relative to their income.

“Common errors include claims for gifts, personal clothing and grooming, meals and entertainment expenses, alongside issues such as calculation of home office and vehicle expenses, plus GST being understated.

“Inland Revenue believes the practices are widespread and we have to act. Some real estate agents are claiming private expenditure but not keeping logbooks or other business records to support the claim,” Trevor Jeffries says.

“Our approach has been to engage with the sector through targeted marketing and educational materials to make it easier for real estate agents to file correct returns. That’s been welcomed by real estate firms and tax agents.

“IR has also monitored and reviewed 2021 tax returns that fell outside industry norms.  Those reviews have reconfirmed our concerns and have led to many instances of real estate agents or their tax agent making voluntary disclosures to correct their returns. 

“Only a small number have been referred for audit action. Any resulting prosecutions will be an option of last resort.

“Inland Revenue will continue to use our data analytics to monitor 2022 returns as they are filed, and where necessary we will take the take appropriate enforcement action.  

“An additional important issue is the non or under-reporting of wage subsidy payments received.”

Trevor Jeffries says further information on how [wage subsidy payments](https://www.ird.govt.nz/updates/newsfolder/wage-subsidy-and-leave-payments-tax-returns.)
 are reported can be found on our website. There are also tax obligations from receiving [Covid Support](https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/covid-19-support-payment)
 and [Resurgence Support](https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/resurgence-support-payment)
 Payments.

“Tax pays for the essential things that make New Zealand a great place to live.  If we all pay our fair share there’ll be more money to help with things like the health and education systems,” Trevor Jeffries says.

[Child Support Amendment Act 2013](/new-legislation/act-articles/child-support-amendment-act-2013 "Child Support Amendment Act 2013")

Formula assessment of child support
===================================

2013 Amendment to Child Support Act replaces formula for assessing child support to recognize income levels of both parents and average cost of raising children.

The formula for assessing child support is being replaced to recognise the income levels and care levels of _both_ parents, and the estimated average expenditure of raising children in New Zealand. The current formula will be replaced, from 1 April 2014, by the following:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **(i% \- c%) x p** |     |
| where - |     |
| **i%** | is the parent's share of the combined child support income of the parents for a child |
| **c%** | is the care cost percentage based on the recognised care levels of the person |
| **p** | is the child expenditure amount for a qualifying child |

The liability is determined by the parent's income percentage minus the parent's care cost percentage, multiplied by the child expenditure amount for the child.

The cost of raising children is apportioned between parents according to the difference between their respective share of combined child support income as adjusted by their share of each child's care (if at least 28%). If their care cost percentage (where the care percentage is at least 28%) is the same as their income percentage, a parent is assumed to have met their financial contribution to costs for the child under the child support scheme, unless the Child Support Act 1991 says otherwise. For example, a minimum amount of child support may be payable.

_Income of both parents_

The child support income of the parents of a qualifying child is added together to determine the combined child support income. A parent's income percentage is derived by dividing their child support income amount by the combined child support income of all the parents of the child.

The child support income for a parent is determined by calculating the parent's adjusted taxable income and deducting:

*   a living allowance
*   any dependent child allowances, and
*   any multi-group allowance.

When a parent has other dependent children, or is paying or receiving child support (administered by Inland Revenue) for children in other relationships, that parent's income will be reduced for their assumed expenditure on those other children.

A negative amount is not allowed, so if the allowances are greater or equal to the adjusted taxable income then the child support income for the parent is treated as being nil. This could arise with parents who are solely reliant on social security benefits.

_Definition of Adjusted Taxable Income_

The income used to calculate child support will be more closely aligned to the definition of family scheme income used for Working for Families tax credits. A person's adjusted taxable income is defined in new section 35, as replaced by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. It is their taxable income adjusted as necessary to determine the person's family scheme income under subpart MB of the Income Tax Act 2007, with the following exceptions:

*   child support and spousal maintenance received will not be counted as income
*   income derived by a dependent child, such as interest, dividends, royalties and rent will not be counted, and
*   income of a spouse who is non-resident will not be counted.

This means that the definition of adjusted taxable income for calculating child support income will now include:

*   wages and salary that is exempt from income tax under a specified Act or regulation, such as the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1971
*   PIE income that is not "locked in"
*   overseas pensions that are tax exempt in New Zealand
*   business and investment losses, such as losses from rental property, which have been used to reduce net income for tax purposes
*   income retained in a close company where the person is a major shareholder
*   distributions from superannuation schemes and retirement savings schemes (other than KiwiSaver schemes) where the person is still employed and their employer had recently made contributions to the scheme
*   income derived by a trustee of a person's trust, where the person is a settlor of the trust
*   fringe benefits received where the person is a major shareholder-employee
*   deposits into main income equalisation accounts
*   tax exempt pensions and annuities, and
*   other payments received by the person and used to replace lost income or to meet their usual living expenses, where the total exceeds $5,000 a year. This can include distributions from a trust that the parent is not a settlor of.

A more extensive description of the adjustments under family scheme income can be found on Inland Revenue's website and in previous _Tax Information Bulletins_.

For the period between 1 April 2014 and 1 April 2015, a person's adjusted taxable income for a child support year will be their taxable income without any adjustments. This reflects that taxable income for a child support year usually relates to past tax year periods and the deferral of the use of adjustments for an extra year reduces the degree of effective retrospectivity that could arise from the change in definition.

If a person has no adjustments to their income, and their taxable income is solely derived from withholding income (wages, salary, interest or dividends), then a person's taxable income will be determined by their employment income in the calendar year immediately preceding the start of the child support year.

Otherwise, a person's taxable income in the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year will be used and inflated by the inflation percentage for the child support year. Likewise, the adjustments to the taxable income will be those relating to the tax year immediately preceding the most recent tax year.

_Living allowance_

A living allowance is provided for a parent based on the annual gross rate of various social security benefits. If the person has been granted a domestic purposes benefit (for care at home of the sick or infirm) at the sole parent rate or an invalid's benefit at the sole parent rate, then the appropriate rate is the living allowance for that parent. For everyone else the living allowance is set at the rate for a sole parent on the domestic purposes benefit. The living allowances will be updated annually in line with changes to the benefit rates.

The living allowances that apply to child support years will be available on Inland Revenue's website.

The names of the benefits have recently been changed by the Social Security (Benefit Categories and Work Focus) Amendment Act 2013. The name changes take effect in the Child Support Act 1991 in July 2013. The old benefit names will be reintroduced by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 on 1 April 2014. References to old benefit names in the child support legislation, however, can be read as a reference to the new benefit names, and likewise for section references. Names and references will be updated in the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 at a later date.

_Dependent child allowances_

A child allowance is provided for each dependent child of the parent. A dependent child is a child of whom:

*   the person is a parent under section 7 of the Child Support Act 1991, and
*   who is maintained as a member of the parent's family and for whom the parent provides at least 28% of the ongoing daily care, and
*   is not a child for whom child support is to be paid, and
*   meets the other requirements of a dependent child such as being under 19/18, not financially independent and not married, or in a civil union or a defacto relationship.

The allowance is based on the same method for calculating child support for a qualifying child. It is the parent's care cost percentage for the dependent child multiplied by the appropriate amount taken from the child expenditure table for that child based on the adjusted taxable income, less living allowance, of that parent alone.

The amount of a dependent child allowance is determined by the formula:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **c%  x** | **e** |
| **n** |
| where - |     |
| **c%** | is the care cost percentage of the parent in relation to the dependent child |
| **e** | is the amount determined by the child expenditure table in respect of the dependent child on the basis of:<br><br>*   the child support income amount of the parent alone, with that amount being treated as the adjusted taxable income of the parent, minus the parent's living allowance<br>*   the total number of the parent's dependent children, and<br>*   the age group of those children |
| **n** | is the total number of the parent's dependent children. |

_Multi-group allowance_

A liable parent may have child support liabilities for more than one group of children. This is referred to as multi-group. A multi-group allowance is calculated based on the same method of calculation for child support and the dependent child allowance. A multi-group allowance is the sum of the multi-group costs of each child of the parent who is not in the same child support group as the child being assessed. This recognises that the parent has financial responsibility for other children outside the child support group.

_Multi-child cap and multi-group cost_

The amount of child support liability of a parent can be capped where a parent has qualifying children in more than one child support group. This is referred to as the multi-group cap. The purpose of the multi-group cap is to avoid liable parents paying more in child support than they would pay if all the children for whom they are liable to pay child support were living together.

The multi-group cap for a child is the amount determined as:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| (100%  \-  c%)  x  m |     |
| where - |     |
| **c%** | is the parent's care cost percentage in relation to the child |
| **m** | is the multi-group cost of the child |

The multi-group cost of a child is the amount determined by the child support expenditure table in respect of that child divided by the number of all the children in all of the parent's child support groups. When determining the amount in the child expenditure table, the income amount is the income of that parent alone, the number of children is the total number of children of the parent in all child support groups, and as if all those children were the same age as the child being assessed.

_Care percentage_

The Commissioner must establish the proportion of ongoing daily care for a qualifying child. Shared care for child support purposes is currently set at a minimum of 40% of nights during the year. This has been replaced by a minimum of 28% of nights during the year. This equates to two nights per week on average. For this purpose a year is assumed to be 365 days. The proportion of care is set as a whole percentage figure, with figures rounded as set out in section 15 as replaced by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. 

The Commissioner must rely on the content of any care order or agreement relating to a qualifying child when establishing the proportion of ongoing care. This may be challenged by a parent or carer if they have evidence that the care order or agreement should not be relied upon. 

If there is no care order or agreement, the Commissioner must establish the proportion of care primarily on the basis of the number of nights that the child spends with a carer. If the number of nights is not a true reflection of the proportion of care actually provided by a carer, the Commissioner can use the amount of time that the carer is the person responsible for the daily care of the child.

To be a receiving carer, a person must have at least 35% of ongoing daily care. This means that there can be no more than two receiving carers for a qualifying child at the same time.

_Care cost percentage_

The care cost percentage reflects the amount of costs a parent incurs supporting the care of a child, relative to the amount of time that child is in their care. The care percentage is converted into a care cost percentage using a table in Schedule 2 as inserted by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. The table has a tiered series of thresholds determining the person's care cost percentage based on their level of ongoing recognised care. A proportion of care that is less than 28% results in a care cost percentage of 0% and a proportion of care of 73% or more results in a care cost percentage of 100%. Between 28% and 73% is a tiered level of care cost percentage. For example, if the proportion of ongoing daily care is 30% the care cost percentage is 24%. If a carer's proportion of ongoing daily care is 37% their care cost percentage is 29%.

_Child expenditure amount_

The amount of child support is based on the estimated average cost of children in New Zealand. The cost of children varies based on age, number of children in a child support group and the combined income of the parents. The new scale of costs reflects up to date information on the expenditure involved in raising children, after allowing for likely tax credits. The cost of children is set as a percentage of income and differs based on the level of income. Income levels are grouped in bands set relative to the annualised amount of the average weekly earnings as published by Statistics NZ. These bands will be updated annually.

As incomes rise the percentages in the table decline to reflect that the proportion of income spent on children declines as income rises. The new formula also has a cap on the amount of expenditure for a child when child support income is more than two and a half times the average weekly earnings.

The child expenditure table will be published by Inland Revenue and will be available on Inland Revenue's website.

The child expenditure amount for a qualifying child in a child support year is the relevant amount determined in the child expenditure table divided by the number of children in the same child support group as the child.

A child support group describes the qualifying children (where there is more than one) of a parent who all share the same other parent and in relation to whom child support for that time has been or is being assessed. A parent could have qualifying children in more than one child support group.

**Examples**

Calculators and examples will be available on Inland Revenue's website to help people understand how the new formula works and the potential impact of the new formula on their own situation. The following examples demonstrate how the new formula works in some different situations.

**Example 1: Paul and Ally's situation**

Paul and Ally have recently split up. They have two children, Dylan aged 10 and Nathan aged 6. Ally is the main carer for Dylan and Nathan and she is not in paid employment. She receives a benefit from Work and Income for herself and the children. When Work and Income granted Ally a benefit she was required to apply for a child support assessment.

Paul spends time looking after his children but this is not enough to be recognised for child support purposes. Ally receives a benefit of $17,429 a year before tax. Paul is currently in full time employment and earns $72,610.40 a year before tax.

| Calculation | Ally | Paul |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taxable income | $17,429.00 | $72,610.40 |
| Less living allowance | \-$17,429.00 | \-$17,429.00 |
| Child support income | 0   | $55,181.40 |
| **Ally and Paul's combined child support income is $55,181.40 and this will be used to calculate child support liability.** |     |     |
| Percentage share of combined child support income | 0%  | 100% |
| Care cost percentage | 100% | 0%  |
| Percentage of income less care cost percentage | \-100% | 100% |

Because Paul's income percentage less care cost percentage is positive, he is assessed as the liable parent, and is required to pay 100% of the annual cost of raising Dylan and Nathan. The annual cost of raising Dylan and Nathan based on Ally and Paul's combined child support income and using the expenditure on children table is $12,880.

Paul's liability $12,880 x 100% is $12,880

Paul is assessed to pay an annual amount of $12,880 or $1,073.35 per month, for the care of Dylan and Nathan. Because Ally receives a sole parent benefit this payment will be used to help cover the cost of this benefit.

**Example 2: Liam and Kirsty's situation - shared care**

Liam and Kirsty are separated. Together they have two children, Joshua aged 12 and Olivia aged 10.  They have always agreed to share the responsibility of caring for their children. Joshua and Olivia both spend alternate weeks (Monday to Friday) at each parent's house, but they spend every weekend and the school holidays with Liam.

Liam has care of the children for 65% of the time and Kirsty has them for the remaining 35%. Because both Kirsty and Liam look after their children for more than 28% of the time, these percentages will be used when working out the child support assessment.

| Calculation | Liam | Kirsty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taxable income | $53,152 | $50,292 |
| Less living allowance | \-$17,429 | \-$17,429 |
| Child support income | $35,723 | $32,863 |
| **Liam and Kirsty's combined child support income is $68,586.** |     |     |
| Percentage share of combined child support income | 52% | 48% |
| Care cost percentage | 75% | 25% |
| Percentage of income less care cost percentage | \-23% | 23% |

Because Kirsty's income percentage less care cost percentage is positive, she is assessed as the liable parent, and is required to pay 23% of the annual cost of raising Joshua and Olivia. The annual cost of raising Joshua and Olivia based on Liam and Kirsty's combined child support income and using the expenditure on children table is $15,561.

Kirsty's liability $15,561 x 23% is $3,579

Kirsty is assessed to pay an annual amount of $3,579 or $298.25 per month, for the care of Joshua and Olivia.

**Example 3: Valerie, Lee and Jan's situation: non-parent receiving carer**

Lee and Jan have one child together from their relationship, Sam aged 4. Lee and Jan have separated and they have asked Valerie, Sam's grandmother, to look after Sam. Valerie applies for child support for Sam. She must apply for it from both Lee and Jan.

Lee and Jan both work full-time and have no other children. Lee earns $35,212 a year before tax and Jan earns $45,092 a year before tax. Because Valerie isn't Sam's parent, her income is not used when working out the child support calculation.

| Calculation | Lee | Jan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taxable income | $35,212 | $45,092 |
| Less living allowance | \-$17,429 | \-$17,429 |
| Child support income | $17,783 | $27,663 |
| **Lee and Jan's combined child support income is $45,446.** |     |     |
| Percentage share of combined child support income | 39% | 61% |
| Care cost percentage | 0%  | 0%  |
| Percentage of income less care cost percentage | 39% | 61% |

Both Lee and Jan's income percentage less care cost percentage is positive, so they are both assessed as liable parents. Lee is required to pay 39% of the annual cost of raising Sam and Jan is required to pay 61%. The annual cost of raising Sam based on Lee and Jan's combined child support income and using the expenditure on children table is $7,343.90.

Lee's liability $7,343.90 x 39% is $2,864.10

Lee is assessed to pay an annual amount of $2,864.10 or $238.70 per month, for Sam's care.

Jan's liability $7,343.90 x 61% is $4,479.80

Jan is assessed to pay an annual amount of $4,479.80 or $373.30 per month, for Sam's care.

Valerie will receive the amounts that both Lee and Jan have been assessed to pay. Note that Valerie can ask for either of these amounts not to be collected.

**Example 4: John's situation - multi group allowance**

John has two children from a previous relationship, Jade aged 16 and Emma aged 11. John looks after Jade and Emma some of the time during the year, but not enough for it to be recognised for child support purposes. John earns $82,714 a year before tax.

Because John has children with more than one other parent, he is a multi-group child support customer, so is entitled to a "multi-group allowance" for Jade and Emma. The child support for each of his children is calculated separately, but must take into account that he has another child in a separate child support calculation.

**Note:** Before working out the child support formula for each of John's children, we must first work out his multi-group costs for each child. This is used for the multi group allowance.

**John's multi-group allowance**

John earns $82,714 a year before tax. After subtracting his living allowance, John's child support income for calculating the multi group allowance is $65,285.

We use the child expenditure table to work out the multi-group allowance based on $65,285.

**Annual cost of raising two children (aged 0 - 12):**

$14,901 divided by two children is $7,450.50  
Emma is 11 so John's multi-group allowance for Emma is $7,450.50.

**Annual cost of raising two children (aged 13 and older):**

$18,165 divided by two children is $9,082.50  
Jade is 16 so John's multi-group allowance for Jade is $9,082.50.

**Child support for Emma**

Emma's mother is Kim, she is Emma's main carer. Kim earns $65,000 a year before tax.

| Calculation | John | Kim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taxable income | $82,714 | $65,112 |
| Less living allowance | \-$17,429 | \-$17,429 |
| Sub-total | $65,285 | $47,683 |
| Multi-group child support | \-$9,082.50 | $0  |
| Child support income | $56,202.50 | $47,683 |
| **John and Kim's combined child support income is $103,885.50.** |     |     |
| Percentage share of combined child support income | 54% | 46% |
| Care cost percentage | 0%  | 100% |
| Percentage of income less care cost percentage | 54% | \-54% |

Because John's income percentage less care cost percentage is positive he is assessed as the liable parent, and should pay 54% of the annual cost of raising Emma. The annual cost of raising Emma based on John and Kim's combined child support income and using the child expenditure table is $14,076.45.

John's formula assessed child support for Emma $14,076.45 x 54% is $7,601.30  
John's liability for Emma will be the lesser of the amount we calculated in the formula, or the multi-group cap.

**Multi-group cap for Emma**

$7,450.50 x (100% minus 0%) is $7,450.50

John's annual liability for Emma is $7,450.50 because the multi-group cap is less than the formula amount calculated.

**Child support for Jade**

Jade's mother is Mary; she is Jade's main carer. Mary earns $45,092 a year before tax.

| Calculation | John | Mary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Taxable income | $82,714 | $45,092 |
| Less living allowance | \-$17,429 | \-$17,429 |
| Sub-total | $65,285 | $27,663 |
| Multi-group child support | \-$7,450.50 | $0  |
| Child support income | $57,834.50 | $27,663 |
| **John and Mary's combined child support income is $85,497.50.** |     |     |
| Percentage share of combined child support income | 68% | 32% |
| Care cost percentage | 0%  | 100% |
| Percentage of income less care cost percentage | 68% | \-68% |

Because John's income percentage less care cost percentage is positive, he is assessed as the liable parent and should pay 68% of the annual cost of raising Jade. The annual cost of raising Jade based on John and Mary's combined child support income and using the child expenditure table is $15,661.65.

John's formula assessed child support for Jade is $15,661.65 x 68% is $10,649.90

**Multi-group cap for Jade**

$9,082.50 x (100% minus 0%) is $9,082.50

John's annual liability for Jade is $9,082.50 because the multi-group cap is less than the formula amount calculated.

**Summary**

John's annual liability for both children is $16,533 or $1,377.75 per month.

 and [non-parent carers](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
 can apply to us for a formula assessment.

Based on each parent or non-parent carer's situation, we work out who pays child support and how much. Once we work out the details, we collect money from the [liable parent](/api/glossary/item?id={2BD1C350-B91A-4EA6-A784-C7C311502E33})
 and pass it on to the [receiving carer](/api/glossary/item?id={ECAE3AEF-DAB7-4A41-BB04-B4E94EFA1B55})
 or Government.

If you're getting the [Unsupported Child's Benefit](/api/glossary/item?id={85E0DDDD-CC2F-447C-AD88-1270C9B4CDCF})
, any child support paid for that child will go to the Government to help pay for your benefit. If the amount paid is more than your benefit, you'll receive the difference.

How the formula works
---------------------

If both people are parents, the formula is based on:

*   both parents' taxable incomes
*   an allowance for both parents' living costs
*   the amount of time the child is in each parent's care
*   the cost of raising a child
*   an allowance for other dependent children in their care.

If the [carer is not a parent](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
 of the child, their income is not included in the formula. 

How payments work
-----------------

After a parent or non-parent carer applies for child support, we make an assessment. Each person gets a letter saying how much they will receive or pay each month.

Child support payments are due from the liable parent on the 20th of the month and are paid to the receiving carer by the 23rd of the same month. We can only pass on payments if we receive them from the liable parent.

We’ll pay any overdue child support to the receiving carer as soon as we receive it. This could mean you get more than 1 payment in the same month.

Paying child support
--------------------

If you're the liable parent and you earn salary or wages or schedular payments, we’ll get in touch with your employer and ask them to deduct the payments from what you earn.

If you're getting a benefit or student allowance, we will ask Work and Income or Studylink to deduct your child support before they pay you.

When a formula assessment ends
------------------------------

A formula assessment ends when 1 of the following situations happen.

*   A child no longer qualifies, usually when they turn 18 and they are no longer at school.
*   You start living with the person you pay child support to, or receive child support from.
*   Both people agree to change to another type of agreement.
*   The person or people caring for the child choose to end the formula assessment.

You cannot cancel a formula assessment for a child or change to another type of child support agreement if you're getting the [Unsupported Child's Benefit](/api/glossary/item?id={85E0DDDD-CC2F-447C-AD88-1270C9B4CDCF})
 for that child.

[Cancelling my child support](/child-support/ending)

Applying for a formula assessment
---------------------------------

If you're a parent or a non-parent carer, you can apply for a formula assessment.

We'll need the details of any shared care arrangements for the child or children. These details will help us work out who will pay or receive child support and the amount.

### Proof of paternity

You'll need to provide proof of who the parents are, for example, a full birth certificate showing the names of the parents. If you do not have a document to prove you're the parent, you can acknowledge in writing you're the child's parent.

If a paternity order is made later, we can start your child support from the date you made your original application if both of the following apply.

*   You apply to the court for the paternity order no later than 60 days after we receive the application for child support.
*   We receive the paternity order no later than 60 days of it being made.

If you do not meet these timeframes, we'll start the child support from the date we get the paternity order, unless there was reasonable cause for the delay.

### Safety concerns

If you believe using your real name when applying for child support will cause safety concerns for you, a carer or your child, we may be able to leave your name out when communicating with the other parent. You can tell us when you apply for child support.

Ngā pāpātanga tāke painga tāpiri Fringe benefit tax rates
=========================================================

 There are 4 different options when calculating fringe benefit tax (FBT) rates: 

*   Single rate 
*   Short form alternate rate 
*   Full alternate rate
*   Pooled alternate rate.  

The rate you can choose depends on whether: 

*   the benefit must be attributed to a particular employee, and 
*   you want to calculate FBT every quarter or only once a year. 

You need to know your filing frequency so you can choose the available rate that best suits your business. 

[Filing frequency for fringe benefit tax](/employing-staff/deductions-from-other-payments/fringe-benefit-tax/filing-frequency-for-fringe-benefit-tax)

Rates for quarterly filers
--------------------------

If you are a quarterly filer, in quarters 1 to 3 you can use either the: 

*   single rate 63.93%  
*   alternate rate 49.25%.

In quarter 4, if: 

*   the alternate rate was used in any of the first 3 quarters, you must use the alternate rate calculation in the fourth quarter. 
*   only the single rate was used, you can use either the single rate or complete the alternate rate calculation. 

Rates for annual or income year filers 
---------------------------------------

Annual or income year filers can use either the:

*   Single rate 63.93% 
*   Alternate rate calculation

Alternate rate calculation
--------------------------

There are 3 alternate rate calculation options, the full alternate rate, short form alternate rate and pooled alternate rate. 

### Full alternate rate 

A separate calculation must be done for each employee who receives an attributed fringe benefit.

#### Please note

There are changes to how you calculate the full alternate rate from 1 April 2024. Our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 has these details.

Non-attributed benefits are pooled, and a flat rate is applied:

*   For shareholder employees 63.93% 
*   For all other employees 49.25% 

### Short form alternate rate 

*   For attributed benefits 63.93% 
*   For non-attributed benefits to shareholder employees 63.93% 
*   For non-attributed benefits to all other employees 49.25% 

### Pooled alternate rate

The pooled alternate rate applies from 1 April 2021. You can use it to file your income year or annual return, or your return for quarter 4 of the 2021 – 2022 tax year.

You might choose this option if you mostly provide attributed benefits to employees who earn within the safe harbour thresholds (up to $160,000 in gross equivalent pay and up to $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year). 

#### Attributed benefits

*   for employees who earn within the "safe harbour" thresholds of up to $160,000 in gross equivalent pay and up to $13,400 each in attributed benefits for the year 49.25%.
*   for employees earning above either of the "safe harbour" thresholds 63.93%, unless
*   you know that the employee has received less than $129,681 up to 1 April 2025 and $130,724 from 1 April 2025 in net pay plus attributed benefits (all-inclusive pay) for the year, then you can choose to use 49.25%.

If attributed benefits are taxed at 49.25% for some employees and 63.93% for others, two pools may be needed.

#### Non-attributed benefits

*   when one or more recipients are major shareholders 63.93%,
*   otherwise 49.25%.

Changing FBT rates
------------------

*   If you file quarterly you can change the rate options during the year.
*   If you file annually you can choose any of the 3 rate options. You can change rate options each year.
*   If you use the full or short form alternate rate option in any of the first 3 quarters, you must use the full or short form alternate rate option in the fourth quarter.

KOWHEORI-19 Tāke utu hemihemi (FBT) COVID-19 Fringe benefit tax (FBT)
=====================================================================

FBT and Motor Vehicles
----------------------

Inland Revenue has been asked to confirm whether FBT applies to motor vehicles during the Level 4 lockdown period (“Level 4”).

An FBT liability arises if a motor vehicle is “made available” to an employee for their private use. Some taxpayers have suggested that during Level 4, a motor vehicle is not “made available” for an employee’s private use because the only private use permitted is local travel to access essential services.

The Commissioner’s view is that a motor vehicle will attract FBT in the usual way during Level 4. The Commissioner acknowledges that opportunities for an employee to use a vehicle for private use have been restricted under Level 4, to accessing essential services or working in an essential business. However, the test is whether the vehicle has been “made available” for private use, not whether any private use has occurred. The case law confirms that a vehicle is “made available” to an employee when they have access to the vehicle and permission to use it for private purposes. Actual use is irrelevant for FBT purposes.

Therefore, if a vehicle is “made available” to an employee for their private use an FBT liability will arise and the Level 4 days must be included in the FBT calculation for the relevant period.

There is no legislative scope for the Commissioner to exercise her discretion in these circumstances. The Government has considered whether to introduce a temporary exemption to cover the Level 4 period but has decided against this. Consistent with our earlier advice, taxpayers should continue to file their FBT returns in the usual way, including any FBT payable on motor vehicles that were “made available” to employees for their private use during Level 4.

For further details on how the FBT rules apply to motor vehicles please refer to the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement IS 17/07: Fringe benefit tax – motor vehicles

[IS 17/07: Fringe benefit tax – motor vehicles](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/interpretation-statements/is-1707-fringe-benefit-tax-motor-vehicles)

### Pool vehicles

The Commissioner understands that some employees were required to take home pool vehicles during Level 4. If these vehicles are subject to a genuine private use restriction, no FBT is payable during Level 4. However, FBT is payable on the day the vehicle was brought home and the day it was returned to work. This is because travel between home and work is “private use” under sCX36. The position may be different if the employee’s home is also a workplace (see below).

### Home as a place of work

As mentioned above, travel between home and work will usually be “private use” of a motor vehicle. However, the courts have held that no private benefit arises from travel between home and work if the home is also used as a workplace. In these circumstances, travel between home and work is not “private use” of a motor vehicle.

The Commissioner understands that during Level 4, many employees have been required to work from home. This is because in many cases their place of work is closed. In the unique circumstances of Level 4, the Commissioner will accept that there are sound business reasons arising from the nature of the work for the work to be performed at home (and therefore the need to travel from work to home and back again). This means that home to work travel (such as driving the pool vehicle home before Level 4 and returning it when the employee can go back to work) is not subject to FBT. Taxpayers need to ensure that the facts of their case support this approach (for example, their employee must be actually working from home) before concluding that there is no FBT. There also needs to be a genuine private use restriction in place. If the employee is free to use the vehicle for private purposes, then FBT will be payable.

### Exemptions

There may be some days where an FBT liability does not arise because an exemption applies. For example, if the vehicle is used for an emergency call, or if the employee is absent from home with the vehicle for at least 24 hours. These exemptions are outlined in more detail in IS 17/07 and there are several requirements that must be satisfied before the exemptions apply.

Full throttle on compliance work
================================

**10 December 2024**

Inland Revenue (IR) has updated the tax community with an overview of the first three months of its increased compliance work.

Inland Revenue’s Segment Lead for Significant Enterprises, Tony Morris, spoke at a recent conference in Wellington about the work done between July to September using increased funding from this year’s budget.

Tony Morris says IR makes it easy for people to get things right; hard for people to get it wrong; and costly for the few who deliberately try to avoid their tax obligations.

“Most people do get things right without IR chasing them. Between July and September 97% of returns filed were on time, and 96% of the tax collected was paid on time,” Tony Morris says.

“But we also opened almost 2,000 audit cases in the first quarter, 55% more than the July to September quarter last year. IR has collected more than $1 billion of overdue debt in the three months.

“Between our audits, and our automated systems, we amended returns to the tune of almost $400 million.”

**Property data**

“We’ve received data for nearly a decade from Land Information New Zealand. The requirement for people to provide IRD numbers on the LINZ Tax Statement has given us an improved view of all New Zealand property and how it is held, including properties held by Individuals, Trusts, Companies and Partnerships.

“We use that data in various ways including reminding people about their bright-line obligations or identifying people who are trading in property or potentially getting rental income.

“We’ve started audits on people we know previously filed income tax returns which included rental income. We’re interested in why they’ve stopped including rental income in their returns when they still own multiple properties.

“Using property data is also proving very useful in debt collection. We’re finding that letting people know we’re aware of their property holdings gets debts paid faster.

**Trust and companies data**

“Property ownership isn’t the only way we use data from the Trust Disclosures, the Companies Office, and other sources. We also look at revenue flows between entities with the same or related ownership.

“We saw a definite shift to retaining more earnings in a company or trust as the 39% top personal tax rate came into force.

“IR is using the data from trusts’ disclosures to look for people receiving large distributions from while continuing to receive Working for Families payments.

“We’ve found 3,500 people with very large distributions who haven’t made any income adjustment to their Working for Families calculations. We believe that’s mostly unintentional, but we also consider it fairly obvious that if someone receives $100k from a trust on top of other income they probably shouldn’t be receiving Working for Families”, Tony Morris says.

**Payment Service Providers – GST**

“Inland Revenue receives data from payment service providers like EFTPOS. We’ve received it for some time but we’re now using it to target enforcement activity.

“We’re not collecting information on every transaction – we don’t know where someone buys their coffee or whether it was oat or regular milk. We collect the data in a monthly summarised form, and use it in small and manageable ways.

“We’re targeting audits at businesses that show a lot more sales in their payment service provider data than in their GST returns. We also find people that seem to be conducting a business who aren’t showing on our books at all.”

**Crypto data**

Tony Morris says IR has found 227,000 crypto users in New Zealand, making around 7 million transactions with a value of $7.8 billion.

“We're approaching the largest traders individually. But because there is still confusion about what the obligations are, we’re planning a wider campaign for smaller traders.

“And like property, we’re starting to target our debt collection at people who we know own enough crypto assets to pay their debts.

**Cash**

“With all this data collection, people may think businesses are running back to cash to avoid our scrutiny.

“But cash still leaves a trail, and we’ve got various ways to find businesses doing that. Cash needs to be spent or banked somewhere, and when it is it shows along the chain.

“If it’s spent to buy trade materials using a trade account for example, we can see that. If it’s banked, we have arrangements in place with banks to report anything suspicious.

**Anonymous information**

“Another way the use of cash comes to light is through anonymous tip-offs. We receive around 7,000 reports a year from people passing on information, usually about the use of cash to pay staff or suppliers.

“It can be diligent citizens doing the reporting, but often it’s disgruntled staff, customers, competitors, or even Ex’s. And the number of these tip-offs is growing.

“We use that information to identify areas that need attention and to initiate investigations wherever necessary" Tony Morris says.

“It’s always better though, for people to reach out to us to set things right first. A voluntary disclosure is a lot less costly for taxpayers than if they wait for us to come to them.

**Debt and liquidations**

Tony Morris says collecting overdue debt is still a focus for IR.

“In the first quarter we collected more than $1.2 billion dollars in overdue debt, 33% up on last year. And we started the liquidation process against around 500 customers this quarter, more than four times the same quarter last year.

“While we will do what we can to help solvent companies keep trading, it’s important for the economy that companies which simply aren’t viable are wound up.”

**Future work**

“Clearly the ongoing collection and use of data, from both public and private sector organisations, is not going away. In the short-term, we’ll continue to bring in new datasets that help us target specific risks we’re concerned about.

“We’ll continue to use data to get a complete picture of each customers’ ownership of entities and financial interests. 

“And we’ll continue to extend the use of the data we’re already gathering. Payment Service Provider data being an obvious example,” Tony Morris says.

[KiwiSaver](/new-legislation/act-articles/kiwisaver "KiwiSaver")

Further amendments
==================

2007 amendments to the KiwiSaver Act covering the use of PAYE intermediaries, late opt-out notices, master trust schemes, casual employees and more.

A number of other amendments have also been made to the KiwiSaver Act.

####  **The following amendments are treated as coming into force on 1 July 2007**

 **Use of PAYE intermediaries**

Amendments have been made so that PAYE intermediaries can:

*   accept KiwiSaver opt-out notices (section 17);
*   be treated as an employer for the purpose of the notice requirement provisions for people who start new employment (section 23A); and
*   be treated as an employer for the purpose of the opt-in rules (section 34).

**Late opt-out notices**

An amendment to section 18 ensures that the Commissioner can accept a late opt-out notice if it is received by the employer or the Commissioner in the period ending three months after the date on which the Commissioner received the first contribution for the person. Previously the opt-out could only be received by the Commissioner.

**Eligibility of employers who have schemes established under master trusts**

Section 28 has been amended so that an employer using a Master Trust scheme as a vehicle for an exemption can use any other evidence to demonstrate compliance with the exempt employer criteria.

**Information packs**

Section 40 has been amended to ensure that there is no inference that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would, on an ongoing basis, forecast the number of information packs employers would need and issue them automatically. The Commissioner will regularly remind employers of the need to ensure they have adequate information packs.

**Final allocation of members to a scheme**

Sections 48 and 51 have been amended so that final allocation to a KiwiSaver scheme does not occur when a dispute is underway and ensures that final allocation to a KiwiSaver scheme occurs "as soon as practicable" three months after the Commissioner received the first contribution for the person.

**Commissioner provisionally allocates certain people to default KiwiSaver schemes and sends investment statement**

Section 50 has been amended to clarify that the exemption for the Commissioner from sending an investment statement for a default scheme because an employer has a chosen scheme will apply only to employment that triggered the automatic enrolment rules.

**Involuntary transfers**

Section 57 has been amended so that an employer-chosen scheme does not apply in the case of involuntary transfers.

**Private domestic workers**

New sections 63A and 92A provide that private domestic workers, who choose to deduct their own PAYE and contribute to KiwiSaver from their salary or wages, can be both an employer and employee for the purposes of KiwiSaver.[**16**](#16)

**Permanent legislative authority for on-paying contributions received through section 73**

Section 73 has been amended so that a permanent legislative authority is established to allow Inland Revenue to on-pay deductions from salary or wages entered in the holding account. Because the relevant part of section 73 is also subject to the on-payment requirements of sections 75 (initial contributions) and 77 (small contributions), consistent amendments have been made to those sections as well.

**Crown contribution**

Section 75 has been amended so that the Commissioner holds contributions for a person in the Inland Revenue holding account for three months only after receiving the first contribution for the member or receiving notice that the person is a member of a KiwiSaver scheme.

**Refund by Commissioner of amounts paid in excess of required amount of deduction or if employee opts out**

Section 80 has been amended so that refunds of ad hoc contributions (contributions not deducted from salary or wages) are allowed.

**Pro rating of employer contributions when contributions short paid**

An amendment is being made to section 99 to allow the formula providing for the pro rating of employer contributions where the contribution is short paid to consider part payments. The amendment also clarifies that if an employer contribution is short paid, no more than 100 percent of the contribution recorded for an employee will be attributed to that person.

**Duty of Commissioner under section 50 modified in certain cases in which section 210 applies**

Section 211 has been amended to remedy drafting issues.

**KiwiSaver penalties**

An amendment has been made to section 215 to ensure that a KiwiSaver penalty will not be imposed if the Commissioner has not given the employer notice within the preceding 12 months that a penalty may be, or has been, imposed.

**Consent to electronic transactions**

Section 219 has been amended to exclude the Commissioner or any employee or officer of Inland Revenue from the deemed consent provided for in that section.

**Refunds made by employer by direct credit**

Section 221 has been amended to clarify that the requirement to give a refund by direct credit to a bank account applies only to the Commissioner.

 The following amendments to the KiwiSaver Act come into force on 1 April 2008

 **Application**

Section 6 has been amended so that:

*   the Act applies to people who, at the time they become subject to the automatic enrolment rules or opt in are, or normally are, living in New Zealand; and
*   non-resident employers with no fixed establishment in New Zealand are included within the scope of KiwiSaver if they so elect, either by deducting KiwiSaver contributions from an employee's salary or wages and/or making employer contributions. These employers are entitled to the employer tax credit in respect of employer contributions.

**Excluding casual employees from the automatic enrolment rules**

Section 12 has been amended to exclude casual employees from the automatic enrolment rules. "Casual employment" is defined by reference to the Holidays Act 2003 as employment that is "intermittent or irregular". The effect is that if employees are paid holiday pay regularly with their salary or wages they will be excluded from automatic enrolment. Those employees can continue to opt in to KiwiSaver, either by providing a deduction notice to their employer or by contracting directly with a scheme provider.

This section has also been amended so that the current rules will continue to apply to temporary fixed‑term employment. Employers are excluded from the automatic enrolment rules if their employment contract is for a period of 28 continuous days or less. If employment is extended beyond 28 days, on day 29 the employee becomes subject to the automatic enrolment rules.

**Interest**

Section 85 has been amended so that the start date for the calculation of interest on employer contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account is the first day of the month in which contributions were received by Inland Revenue. This also applies to contributions received to which the employer tax credit applies.

**Restrictions on transactions**

New section 117A imposes investment restrictions on KiwiSaver schemes with fewer than 20 members. For the purposes of determining the number of members, a person associated with a member under section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act will be treated as one person. This provision will:

*   require a transaction between the scheme provider and a person associated with either the provider or a member to be at market value;
*   limit to 5 percent of the scheme's assets, investments related to or managed by the provider (other than in their capacity as a provider), a member or a person associated with a provider or member; and
*   prevent a provider from lending money or providing financial assistance to a member or a person associated with the provider or member.

**Effect of registration of KiwiSaver scheme under section 150**

Section 153 has been amended so that KiwiSaver schemes registered under an umbrella superannuation scheme trust can be treated as separate for the purposes of the portfolio investment entity rules.

**Objections and appeals against decisions of Financial Markets Authority**

Section 186 has been amended, as part of introducing compulsory employer contributions. The amendment does not allow a person to appeal against an election made by the Financial Markets Authority relating to short payment of compulsory employer contributions to a CSF.

#### Amendments treated as coming into force on the date of assent

**Secondments**

Sections 10 and 11 have been amended so that employees who enter into a secondment arrangement whereby they are transferred from one employer to another but remain "employed" by the original employer are not subject to the automatic enrolment rules.

Employees under secondment arrangements will be subject to the automatic enrolment rules if, after entering into the arrangement, they terminate employment with the original employer and begin working for the employer they were seconded to.

**Effect of opting in by employees**

Section 36 has been amended to clarify that a person opting in via a provider must specify the name of their employer if that person is an employee (clarifying that deductions are required from salary and wages).

**Employer may choose scheme for employees**

Section 46 has been amended so that an employer can have a chosen KiwiSaver scheme for its employees only if the scheme is open to all permanent employees (new or existing).

**Notification of transfers and requirement to transfer funds and information**

Section 56 provides that when a member of a KiwiSaver scheme transfers to a new scheme, the provider of the old scheme must advise the new provider whether the Crown contribution (the $1,000 kick-start contribution) is part of the member's accumulated interest that is to be transferred.

**Refund by provider of amounts paid in excess of required amount of contribution**

Section 81 has been amended so that providers are required to refund to the Commissioner the amount of contribution that the Commissioner requests, up to the amount in excess of what was required to be paid under the Act.

**Interest**

Section 84 has been amended so that:

*   section 68(2) of the Public Finance Act 1989 does not apply to returns on the investment of holding account money and interest earned from 1 July 2007 is public money; and
*   a person can notify the Commissioner if they do not wish to be paid interest on contributions held by Inland Revenue or on a refund.

Section 86 has been amended so that interest calculations for money held in Inland Revenue's holding account and payable is limited to two decimal places.

**Refunds of employer contribution by provider**

Section 101 has been amended so that a provider of a KiwiSaver scheme must refund to the Commissioner any amount of employer contribution that the Commissioner requests when that amount has been paid in excess of the employer contribution required under the KiwiSaver Act.

**Who may apply for a contributions holiday**

Section 102 has been amended so that if a member transfers from a CSF to a KiwiSaver scheme, the time during which they have contributed to the complying fund counts towards the time for eligibility for a contributions holiday.

**Refund of initial contributions**

Section 113 has been amended so that for applications for a refund of initial contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account on the grounds of significant financial hardship, the Commissioner will have authority to consider whether alternative sources of funding have been explored and to limit the amount withdrawn.

**Further modifications to application of section 8 to 11 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989**

The reference to a "superannuation scheme" in section 121(3)(a) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 has been replaced with the term "KiwiSaver scheme".

**Requirement for annual report and annual personalised statement of contributions and accumulations for members**

New section 125A requires all KiwiSaver and complying superannuation scheme providers to supply members with a personalised statement of their investment holding, on at least an annual basis. At a minimum, all member statements should provide information on:

*   the level of contributions made by the member, employer and Crown in the period since the last member statement; and
*   the total value of the member's interest in the scheme.

New sections 128B, 128C and 128D ensure that legislative terms are implied into the existing trust deeds. These sections cover:

*   back-dated validation of enrolment (section 128B);
*   lump sum payment by a CSF (section 128C); and
*   compulsory employer contributions (section 128C).

In addition, section 128A has been amended to ensure that the legislative terms relating to the member tax credit are implied into existing trust deeds rather than thelaw.

 **Amendment of trust deed governing KiwiSaver scheme**

Section 129 has been amended to ensure that if trustees of a KiwiSaver scheme propose to make any changes to any participation agreement entered into between the scheme trustees and any employer, the solicitor of the scheme must provide certification that the amendment is consistent with the requirements of the KiwiSaver Act and the Superannuation Schemes Act.

**Certain sections of Securities Act 1978 modified in relation to KiwiSaver Scheme**

Section 210 has been amended so that if an involuntary transfer arises under KiwiSaver, the amount that is transferred is, at a minimum, the member's accumulation.

**Fee subsidies**

Section 225(2) has been amended to remove the ability for the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Economic Development to delegate authority for administration of the $1,000 Crown contribution.

**Crown contribution**

Section 226 has been amended to provide flexibility around when the Crown contribution (the $1,000 kick-start contribution) must be paid to employees and members transferring from a CSF to a KiwiSaver Scheme, and so that the Crown contribution is paid only into an account that is fully vested in the member.

**Regulations relating to a mortgage diversion facility**

Section 229 has been amended so that:

*   the mortgage diversion facility will apply for the remainder of the term of the loan after the diversion is made available, but only in relation to a mortgage over the person's principal residence; and
*   the amount that can be diverted under mortgage diversion is no more than half the member contribution received by a provider, including both member contributions paid via Inland Revenue and those received directly from the member.

Contributions to a CSF can be diverted and applied towards payments of the person's mortgage, provided the same conditions that apply to KiwiSaver mortgage diversion are met.

**Protection for non-compliance: Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007**

Section 234 was introduced as a transitional measure. This provisional measure ensures that if as a result of the amendments made in the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act there has been non-compliance with other Acts (for example, investment statements issued under the Securities Act 1978) before 1 February 2008, the non-compliance is ignored unless it continues on or after 1 February 2008.

**KiwiSaver Amendment Regulations 2008 (2008/6): exemption from regulation 7A(4) of Securities Regulations 1983**

These regulations, which came into force on 1 February 2008, exempt providers of KiwiSaver schemes from regulation 7A(4) of the Securities Regulations 1983 in relation to an investment statement first distributed before 1 April 2008. The providers are exempted in respect of information that must be disclosed in an investment statement because of changes to the scheme or the securities arising from any provision of the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007. The exemption expires on 31 July 2008.

The effect of the exemption is that investment statements first distributed before 1 April 2008 need not be set out as required by regulation 7A(4). This enables providers, until 31 July 2008, to indicate the changes or corrections to investment statements required because of the Taxation (KiwiSaver) Act 2007 by way of an insert or supplement distributed with investment statements. However, information provided in the inserts or supplements must be set out in a style or format consistent with the investment statement.

**KiwiSaver scheme rules**

Clauses 12(2) and (3) of the KiwiSaver scheme rules (Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act) have been amended to ensure that the serious illness withdrawal facility applies only when the member is permanently and totally disabled or when death is imminent. The member can then withdraw the $1,000 Crown contribution.

Clause 13 of the KiwiSaver scheme rules has been amended to ensure that applications for withdrawal on the grounds of serious illness can be made without the need to complete a statutory declaration of the assets and liabilities of the applicant. Accordingly, a statutory declaration of the member's assets and liabilities is only required for applications for withdrawal on the grounds of significant financial hardship.

**Fund withdrawal tax**

New section CS 10B of the Income Tax Act 2004 ensures that permitted KiwiSaver or CSF withdrawals are not subject to fund withdrawal tax.

#### KiwiSaver-related changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994

**Interpretation**

The definition of "tax" in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) has been amended to include compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or CSF from 1 April 2008.

**Construction of certain provisions**

Section 4A of the TAA has been amended so that a compulsory employer contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme or CSF is treated as if it were a deduction under the PAYE rules from 1 April 2008.

**Keeping of business records**

Section 22 of the TAA has been amended so that employers and PAYE intermediaries are required to keep records of amounts relating to employer tax credits from 1 April 2008.

**Tax credit relating to KiwiSaver and CSF members: member credit form**

Section 68 of the TAA has been amended from 1 April 2008 to:

*   provide that the claim form must contain the tax file number "if known"; and
*   allow providers to make a claim (including making a supplementary claim) to Inland Revenue for members who have had contributions deducted during the member credit year but which have not been received by providers.

**Persons excluded**

 Section 120B of the TAA has been amended so that a failure to pay a compulsory employer contribution does not result in a liability to pay use-of-money interest from 1 April 2008.

**Knowledge offences**

Section 143A (Knowledge offences) of the TAA applies when the employer fails to make compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver Scheme from 1 April 2009.

**Deduction of tax from payments due to defaulters**

Section 157 (Taxpayer default in payment of income tax) of the TAA applies where the employer fails to make compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver Scheme from 1 April 2008.

**Repeal of section 216 of the KiwiSaver Act**

The reference to section 216 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will be omitted in sections 138L(2)(ab), 183A(1)(h), 183ABA(3A) and 183D(1)(bc) of the TAA as a consequence of the repeal of that section from 1 April 2009

 **KiwiSaver-related changes to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989**

 **Interpretation**

The definition of "participation agreement" in section 2 of the Superannuation Schemes Act has been inserted to clarify that it has the meaning as defined in section 4(1) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. This amendment applies from the date of assent - 19 December 2007.

**Dealing with applications for CSFs**

Section 34 of the Superannuation Schemes Act has been amended to clarify that a person seeking approval to become a complying fund needs to provide the necessary information to satisfy the requirements set out in section35. This amendment is treated as coming into force on 1April 2007.

**Forms of notice under section 37**

Sections 37 and 38 have been amended to require notices to be sent to the Financial Markets Authority when there is a change in any information required to be specified in the register of CSFs. The amendments include changes to the name of the fund, changes to the trustees or changes to the financial year end of the fund. These amendments apply from 1 April 2008.

**Matters to be specified in annual reports**

Schedule 2 of the Superannuation Schemes Act has been amended so that a summary of amendments to the participation agreements relating to CSFs in any year must be included in the annual report. This amendment applies from 1 April 2009.

**SSCWT exemption and participation agreements**

An amendment has been made to section 35(1)(e) of the Superannuation Schemes Act to ensure that the CSF SSCWT exemption applies to participation agreements or schemes which replace those that were in place on 1 July 2007. However, the exemption does not apply if an employer enters into a participation agreement after 1 July 2007, if no agreement had been previously held.

 **Changes to the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006**

 The following changes came into force on the date of assent, 19 December 2007.

**Regulations 6 and 7 replaced**

Regulation 6 has been amended and Regulation 7 of the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 will be revoked, as they deal with the requirement to provide an annual report and will be redundant.

**Fee subsidy**

Regulation 20 has been amended from the date of assent to ensure that the fee subsidy is applied according to the current investment allocation instructions that the member has elected or been allocated to (if it is a default provider).

**Mortgage diversion facility**

The KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 have been amended to ensure that:

*   they extend to CSFs in respect of the mortgage diversion facility; and
*   include within the eligibility for the first home ownership withdrawal second-chance buyers that have a determination from Housing New Zealand that they are in the same financial situation as first home buyers.

**KiwiSaver-related changes to the Holidays Act 2003** 

The Holidays Act 2003 has been amended to explicitly exclude employer contributions to a superannuation scheme from the definition of "gross earnings", "relevant daily pay" and "ordinary weekly pay". These amendments are treated as coming into force on 17 May 2007.

* * *

**16** A definition of "private domestic worker" is included in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act.

Further changes to help businesses transition to the new GST rate
=================================================================

2010 legislation covering changes to help businesses transition to the new GST rate of 15%.

### Background

The Government has made a number of amendments as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010, designed to further help businesses transition to the new GST rate of 15%. These amendments follow from recommendations made by the GST Advisory Panel. They supplement the transitional rules already provided in the GST Act, including those that were introduced in Budget night legislation and outlined in the August 2010 _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol. 22, No. 7. Further background on the GST rate increase is provided in that _Tax Information Bulletin_.

### Detailed analysis

The amendments refer generically to the "rate change day" and the "original rate" (see section 78AA(1)) being, in the case of the recent GST rate increase to 15%, respectively 1 October 2010 and 12.5%. The explanation below primarily focuses on the impact of the amendments in relation to the 1 October 2010 increase.

#### Subrogation payments

A subrogation payment is the recovery income received by an insurer for the damages caused by a third party to their insured party. The GST Act deems the time of supply to be the day on which the insurer receives the payment. This would have meant subrogation payments received on or after 1 October 2010 would have been, in the absence of the transitional provision, subject to the 15% GST rate, even when the underlying claim to which the payment related was at 12.5%.

New sections 78AA(2) and (3) therefore allow the rate of GST to remain at 12.5% for subrogation payments received on or after 1 October 2010 to the extent that before 1 October 2010 the insurer has accepted the underlying claim and has paid the claim and/or agreed the recovered amount unconditionally.

#### Finance lease

In agreements to hire that are finance leases, GST is applied to the supply of the goods in question (a motor vehicle, for example) but not to the finance component of the transaction as financial services are GST-exempt. In such leases the interest and principal components may be calculated actuarially but, to ease compliance, GST can be accounted for on a straight-line approach over the term of the lease. This means that more GST is payable on the earlier lease payments than is actually required. A square-up adjustment is normally only done when the lease terminates, to reflect any difference between the actual and expected residual value of the leased asset.

With a rate change occurring during the contract term, and in the absence of the transitional provision, the new rate would have applied to the remaining payments under the finance lease contract. The subsequent reconciliation would have been complex, requiring systems changes to accommodate it. Most contracts are with GST-registered businesses who would be able to claim back the GST anyway.

New sections 78AA(4) and (5) allow certain finance leases to continue being accounted for at the 12.5% rate, if the lessor so elects. The lease agreements must be for a maximum term of five years and that term must have begun before 1 October 2010. A further requirement is that the lessor must advise GST-registered lessees within 30 days after the rate change day that their payments after the rate change day include GST at the original rate. This is intended to help ensure that lessees claim input tax at the 12.5% rate on such payments.

Only lease agreements for which part of the payment is consideration for the provision of credit under a credit contract, and for which that part payment decreases for each successive payment, qualify for the option.

#### Layby sales

For GST purposes, a layby sale (to which the Layby Sales Act 1971 applies) is recognised as taking place only when the goods are delivered, which is normally after the last instalment payment. Goods uplifted after 30September 2010, therefore, would normally attract the new 15% GST rate.

Although payment of all of the layby instalments and collecting the layby item before 1October would preserve the 12.5% GST rate, this may not always be possible because of the costs involved or the goods simply not being able to be delivered before that date. Transitional relief has therefore been provided.

New sections 78AA(6) and (7) apply to layby sales agreements made before the day on which the rate change was announced (20 May 2010). They allow suppliers to elect to apply the old 12.5% GST rate to any payments under the agreement that were received before 1 October 2010. Under this option, a supplier must account for these payments in their GST return that includes September 2010 as these payments are treated as a separate supply on 30 September. The balance of the agreement is treated as a further separate supply to which the normal layby time of supply rules apply, which means that the new 15% rate applies to payments made from 1 October 2010.

#### Aligning legislation and practice

There are several instances where further legislative flexibility has been needed so that GST practices adopted through systems or other commercial imperatives are not unduly affected by the rate increase.

##### The issuing of invoices dated on or before 30 September 2010

The first issue relates to goods or services for which an invoice is normally dated on or before the end of the month but for which an invoice may not be formally issued until early in the following month. Under the GST Act, it is the date when the invoice is issued that is relevant for determining the time of the supply, so in the absence of the transitional provision, invoices issued in early October 2010 but dated on or before 30 September 2010 could technically be considered to be subject to the higher rate.

Accordingly, for the GST rate transition, section 78AA(8) allows suppliers to treat invoices issued on or before 11 October 2010 as having been issued on the date of the invoice. This is provided that:

*   the invoice is dated on or before 30 September; and
*   the invoice is issued consistently with the supplier's practice of issuing invoices for such supplies; and
*   payment for the supply is due no later than 60 days after the invoice date.

The cut-off date of 11 October was chosen to provide two weekends to send out such invoices.

##### Option of general time of supply or successive supplies rule

The second instance arises because some suppliers of what are arguably successive supplies account for GST when the invoice is issued rather than when payment is due or received. Under section 9(3)(a) of the GST Act, the GST rate on a successive supply involving goods under an agreement to hire or services provided under any agreement that involves periodic payment, should be determined by when the payment is due or received rather than when the invoice is issued.

As an example, telecommunications companies will usually bill for calls made (a service provided by the company), and a line rental fee (a charge for a successive supply of access to the company's telephone lines). Technically the calls could be subject to a different time of supply rule than the line rental so a company may take a pragmatic approach and treat the date of the issue of the invoice as the time of supply, even though this may have advanced the date of payment of the GST in respect of the line rental.

Under normal circumstances this would make no difference, but the rate change has generated some uncertainty about whether a September invoice, for example, would need to be charged at 12.5% or at 15% as this could be dependent on whether the customer paid or was required to pay before 1 October.

To address this issue, suppliers may choose to use the transitional option provided in sections 78AA(8) and (9) that enables the supply to be recognised on the date of the invoice if they meet the requirements of that option, even though section 9(3)(a) might otherwise apply.

##### Replacement invoices

The third issue concerns the use of replacement tax invoices. Under the GST legislation, a supplier cannot issue two tax invoices for the same supply and should instead issue credit or debit notes when, for example, goods are returned or additional GST is due as a result of the GST rate increase. For the GST rate transition period the following options are available.

*   As an alternative to issuing a debit note, replacement tax invoices can be issued to replace pre-1 October 2010 invoiced supplies. This is envisaged to be primarily relevant to the case of successively supplied goods and services, to cover the amended GST payable on the remaining services provided from 1 October.
*   There is an option of issuing a new invoice at the previous GST rate of 12.5% if it relates to revising an invoice issued before 1October 2010, as an alternative to issuing a credit note. This is to ensure that the issuing of the replacement invoice instead of a credit note does not alter the applicable GST rate, as an invoice would alter the time of supply.

#### Certain contracts involving successive supplies

Many contracts, particularly in the general and health insurance area, are for a period of around one year or are at least reviewed annually. In some cases, the customer pays the premium in one upfront payment while in other cases it is paid progressively, say by monthly instalments. Most of these instalment arrangements straddle the GST rate change date of 1October 2010 so that, in the absence of legislative change, some instalments would have been at the new GST rate and some at the old.

Businesses may be able to seek additional payment from customers to cover the additional GST, but in many cases the compliance cost to them of doing so would be excessive relative to the amounts of GST involved, particularly when the contract has very little time to run.

New sections 78AA(10) and (11) allow insurers and others the option of applying the 12.5% rate for the rest of the relevant period provided certain criteria are satisfied.

*   The term of the agreement has to have commenced before 1 October 2010.
*   The relevant period is determined by the period for which the consideration for a supply under the agreement is set or reviewed. The period cannot be more than 396 days and it must include 30 September 2010. In practice, in some cases this period will run to the end of the contract, while in others it will run to the next review date. The maximum period extends to 396 days (one year and one month) to cover a small number of general insurance policies that extend slightly beyond one year.
*   The remaining GST has to be accounted for in the return period that includes 30 September 2010 as under the option this is the time of supply for the remaining supplies during the period. The supplier is also treated as issuing a tax invoice on that day. This will assist the recipient in claiming a deduction at that time if they return GST on an invoice basis, or need to make a section 78 transitional adjustment if returning GST on a payments basis.
*   Within 30 days of the rate change day, the supplier is required to provide a GST-registered recipient with notice that payments by the recipient made after the rate change day include GST at the 12.5% rate. This will ensure that input tax is claimed at the 12.5% rate.
*   If an insurance policy or other contract subject to the transitional rule is cancelled and, therefore the supply is not fully provided, businesses need to issue credit notes at 12.5% to adjust for the change in consideration and the GST incorrectly paid.

A business elects this option by making a tax return on this basis. The election need not cover all supplies. For example, an insurer may elect to include only certain types of insurance products.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| A policy for car insurance covers the period 28 April 2010 to 27 April 2011 and the customer chooses to pay by monthly instalments. The insurer normally pays GST when instalments are due or received but elects to apply the transitional rule and returns the remaining GST at 12.5% in its September GST return. |     |

#### Insurance receipts

When a GST-registered party receives an insurance payout from their insurer in relation to a loss incurred in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, they are required to account for GST on that payment. A deemed supply arises on the day the registered person receives the payment, under section 5(13) of the GST Act.

A payment may be made by the insurer in late September 2010 but be received by the insured party in October 2010. This would mean that the recipient has to pay GST at the rate of 15% on the payment, but because the payment by the insurer may only factor in GST at the old rate of 12.5%, the overall payment may not fully cover the loss.

New section 78AA(14) provides some leeway for payments in the pipeline. A payment under a contract of insurance received on or after 1 October 2010 is treated as being received on 30 September 2010 if the payment is made before 1 October 2010 and the registered person receives the payment on or before 11 October 2010.

The old 12.5% rate of GST therefore applies to payments received in these circumstances.

#### Private training establishments

Private training establishments (PTEs) are registered with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and are required to use a trust arrangement when students pay their course fees in full. This is to help protect students from the risk that their intended course provider does not deliver the course. As the courses are delivered, the trustee progressively pays out the funds to the PTE.

In the absence of any law change, any payments released by the trust to the PTE after 1October 2010 would be accounted for at the new 15% rate even if students paid the full course fees before 1 October 2010. This is because the services are considered to be supplied when the payments are released to the relevant PTEs. It would be impractical for the PTEs to seek additional payments from the students.

Accordingly, amendments to section 78B(2A) and a new section 78B(2B) allow a registered PTE the option of making an upfront adjustment in its GST return for September 2010 that would give it a credit to cover the additional GST payable when course fees held in trust as at 30 September 2010 are subsequently released to the PTE. This would apply irrespective of whether the PTE returned GST on an invoice, hybrid or payments basis.

The credit is based on the amount held in trust for the PTE as at 30 September 2010.

#### Extension of penalties and use-of-money interest remission

Budget legislation included an amendment to provide for automatic remission by Inland Revenue of the late payment and late filing penalties and use-of-money interest when:

*   the lateness in filing or paying could be reasonably attributed to the change in the GST rate increase; and
*   the registered person has made reasonable efforts to comply and, therefore, shortfall penalties such as lack of reasonable care, would not be applicable.

Initially, this relief, which is in section 183AA of the Tax Administration Act, applied only to return periods that included 1 October 2010 and, in some cases, later returns. For example, it covered returns that traverse 1 October 2010. GST return periods ending 30 September 2010 were, however, not covered.

Returns for periods ending 30 September 2010 can also be affected by the GST rate increase because in many cases they will include the section 78B adjustment that avoids the need, over the transition, for special time of supply rules when the GST-registered person is returning GST on a payments basis. Under the adjustment mechanism, all amounts that such registered persons pay or receive on or after 1 October 2010 are accounted for at the new rate but with an adjustment in the return covering 30 September 2010 to recognise the fact that the time of supply for some of the transactions would have been before the rate change day.

As GST returns for periods ending 30 September 2010 are due to be filed by 28 October, some may not, despite their best endeavours, be able to file the return by then, given the need to assemble the required information and calculate the adjustment. This is likely to be a particular issue for tax agents with many small business clients needing to calculate the transitional adjustment.

Accordingly, section 183AA has been extended to include returns ending on 30 September 2010 that include a section 78B transitional adjustment, on the same conditions as for other return periods that qualify - that is, the late filing or payment is reasonably attributable to the GST rate increase and the person has made reasonable efforts to comply.

#### Consequential change

Given that certain supplies can continue to be subject to a rate of 12.5%, a minor change has been made to section 78B(2A)(e) which relates to the transitional adjustment. The change ensures that such supplies are excluded from the adjustment when a recipient who could have made a section 78B adjustment in respect of those supplies, instead decides to account for the supply when the payment is made or received on or after 1 October at the rate of 12.5%.

### Application date

The changes apply from the date of Royal assent, being 7 September 2010.

Further IFRS amendments to the financial arrangements rules
===========================================================

2009 amendments reflect changes anticipated following the introduction of the original international financial reporting standards (IFRS) tax rules.

_**Sections EW 14, EW 15B, EW 15D to EW 15I, EW 21 to EW 23, EW 25B, EW 26, EW 29, EW 31, EZ 52BB and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections EW 15C to EW 15E, EW 21 to EW 23, EW 26, EW 29, EW 31 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004**_

The Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 introduced changes to the taxation of income and expenditure on financial arrangements (the accrual rules) for taxpayers who have adopted new international financial reporting standards (IFRSs). It was anticipated that further changes to those rules would be required once the full consequences of the new IFRS were better understood. The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 were largely introduced by Supplementary Order Paper. The first four bullet points below were included in the original bill. The amendments mostly reflect changes anticipated following introduction of the original IFRS tax rules.

### Key features

The amendments:

*   make IFRS GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) operating leases which are financial arrangements for tax purposes subject to the compulsory yield to maturity (YTM) treatment for tax purposes;
*   amend the anti-arbitrage provisions regarding the use of the Determination, expected value and modified fair value methods where IFRS hedging involving two financial arrangements occurs and the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method is used for one of the financial arrangements in the hedging relationship;
*   ensure that IFRS taxpayers who prepare financial statements in a functional currency other than New Zealand dollars are required to use New Zealand dollars for the four IFRS methods available for financial arrangements when filing the tax return;
*   for Determinations G27 and G29, replace the use of Determination G9A with Determination G9C, both changes applying from the 2009-10 income year;
*   introduce an option to allow the use of Determination G3 from the 2009-10 income year for New Zealand currency non-derivative financial arrangements;
*   allow the retrospective use of Determination G3 from the 2008-09 income year for financial arrangements of entities which are subject to a creditor workout. This change implements the policy change announced by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on 15 December 2008;
*   allow IFRS early adopters who used the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method in the 2005-06 income year to change to another method in either the 2006-07 or 2007-08 income years, with a base price adjustment being performed in the year of change;
*   clarify the deductibility of interest capitalised in terms of NZ IAS 23 so that, unless it was otherwise dealt with in a return filed by 30 June 2009, the interest is deducted for tax purposes as it is incurred;
*   reinstate on a retrospective basis the use of the pre-IFRS financial reporting method for those taxpayers who did not have to adopt IFRS GAAP;
*   clarify that the use of the IFRS financial reporting method is based on the IFRS GAAP rules used in the taxpayer’s financial statements;
*   allow taxpayers who use the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method for financial arrangements which are held for the business of dealing in such arrangements not to adjust for impaired credit adjustments included in the IFRS GAAP financial reporting values;
*   change the consistency requirements for group companies in respect of the expected value and modified fair value methods so that they do not apply to financial arrangements of group companies that do not have a business of a substantially similar nature to a business of another group company, unless the financial arrangement is with other members of the group. These provisions have also been amended to make it clear that there is both an election and a notification requirement to fulfil;
*   correct an error for use of the base price adjustment in respect of non-integral fees and consideration; and
*   provide for the use of the modified fair value method for taxpayers within an IFRS GAAP consolidated group in some circumstances, based on the hedge accounting adopted in the consolidated financial statements.

### Application date

Except where otherwise stated, the amendments set out above all apply from the application date of the original legislation, being 1 April 2007 for the Income Tax Act 2004 and 1 April 2008 for the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Detailed analysis

The amendments in this Act primarily clarify or amend provisions in the original legislation, based on further submissions and discussions with taxpayers and advisors. There are also some new general initiatives in the Act, being:

*   the use of the modified fair value method for taxpayers within an IFRS GAAP consolidated group in some circumstances, based on the hedge accounting adopted in the consolidated financial statements;
*   introduction of the general use of Determination G3 from the 2009-10 income year for New Zealand currency non-derivative financial arrangements;
*   changes to the consistency requirements for group companies in respect of the expected value and modified fair value methods, so that they do not apply to financial arrangements of group companies that do not have a business of a substantially similar nature to a business of another group company, unless the financial arrangement/s is/are with other members of the group; and
*   making IFRS GAAP operating leases which are financial arrangements for tax purposes subject to the compulsory YTM treatment for tax purposes.

These are discussed, along with all the other changes mentioned above, in the following commentary.

A summary of the spreading methods available to taxpayers under the amended financial arrangement rules is presented in Figure 1. An earlier version of this flowchart was included in _TIB_ Volume 20, No 3 April 2008.

##### _IFRS GAAP operating leases which are financial arrangements for tax_

Under the original legislation some financial arrangements for tax purposes were being classified as operating leases in IFRS GAAP financial statements. However, the IFRS tax methods available for such financial arrangements were not appropriate and, after consultation with taxpayers and advisors, these types of financial arrangements have been included in the compulsory use of the YTM method in section EW 15B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15I of the Income Tax Act 2007.

##### _Determination methods: inclusion of Determination G3 from the 2009-10 income year_

The use of Determination G3 has been included in section EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2007 for New Zealand currency non-derivative financial arrangements. Originally, it was considered that the IFRS financial reporting method would be the only method necessary for New Zealand currency non-derivative financial arrangements. However, after consideration and consultation, it is now considered that an alternative YTM method should be available for these financial arrangements.

Taxpayers will be able to use this method from 2009-10 by performing a base price adjustment or change of spreading method adjustment as appropriate. Section EZ 52B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides a one-off opportunity for taxpayers to change to Determination G3 in the 2009-10 income year to further allow the reduction of volatility. The tenor of Determination G26 can be used in conjunction with Determination G3 where appropriate (see the discussion below relating to creditor workouts).

It should be noted that Determination G30 was withdrawn from use on 1 October 2009. This determination was introduced as an interim measure for use with certain New Zealand currency financial arrangements which were either held or issued by IFRS taxpayers who were in the business of lending money. It is understood that only a few taxpayers applied Determination G30 to eliminate volatility on applicable financial arrangements following the introduction of the original legislation. The revised rules available from the 2009-10 income year mean that this determination was no longer required.

##### _Creditor workouts: use of Determination G3 from the 2008-09 income year_

A “creditor workout” has been defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The use of Determination G3 is permitted in the 2008-09 and subsequent income years in section EZ 52B for financial arrangements which are subject to a creditor workout. These changes give effect to the policy change announced by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue on 15 December 2008.

It is intended that the legislation will apply to creditor workouts which are legally binding on the parties to the relevant financial arrangements, including those which are legally binding on the parties to the financial arrangements as a result of a workout effected through changes to a trust deed and a trustee.

For financial arrangements affected by these changes, changing the tax method to the use of Determinations G3 will be accomplished by performing a change of spreading method adjustment in the income year in which the method is changed. Determination G25 is also relevant here.

#### _Further developments_

Inland Revenue has been made aware that the definition of “creditor workout” may not include some of the workouts which have been entered into and would qualify in terms of the policy objective announced by the Ministers in December 2008. Officials will discuss the situation with affected parties and any amending legislation necessary will be separately enacted on a retrospective basis.

It is also aware that some creditor workouts may involve a fixed-rate financial arrangement being rearranged as a floating rate financial arrangement. If the rearrangement causes a one-off fair value accounting gain for IFRS GAAP purposes, that amount can be spread on a YTM basis as per Determination G3, while the ongoing floating rate payments from that time in accordance with the tenor of Determination G26 will also form part of the YTM income/expenditure for those financial arrangements. Again, any amending legislation necessary will be separately enacted on a retrospective basis.

##### _Anti-arbitrage provisions in the Determinations, expected value and modified fair value methods_

The policy intent for the use of these three methods is that they cannot be used for a financial arrangement which is either a hedge of another financial arrangement or being hedged by another financial arrangement under IFRS GAAP if the other financial arrangement is using the fair value method (included in the IFRS method and the IFRS financial reporting method in the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 respectively).

This policy is to prevent tax arbitrage where there is IFRS GAAP hedging occurring. This was considered necessary because, as a result of many submissions on the original legislation, the three methods were introduced to allow taxpayers to elect out of volatility for tax purposes which may have resulted from the use of the IFRS method and the IFRS financial reporting methods in the respective acts.

Otherwise, the three methods can be used for financial arrangements that are not in an IFRS GAAP hedging situation, or when both financial arrangements in an IFRS GAAP hedging situation use any of the three methods or the IFRS financial reporting method which is not the fair value method.

It proved difficult to draft the appropriate clause in sections EW 15D and EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2004, and sections EW 15E to EW 15G of the Income Tax Act 2007 and taxpayers and the Inland Revenue became aware that the clauses inserted in the bill did not achieve the desired policy intent. There have been subsequent discussions with many taxpayers and advisors on the application of these sections and it has been Inland Revenue’s position that the clauses were to be amended to achieve the intended outcome as set out in the first paragraph of this item.

A table summarising the use of the various tax methods for financial arrangements (FAs) where IFRS GAAP hedging applies and does not apply is set out below.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |             Table: Anti-arbitrage - tax methods for financial arrangements and IFRS GAAP
| IFRS GAAP  <br>Hedging | FA 1 Tax  <br>Method | FA 2 Tax  <br>Method | Comments |
|     | (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method. | (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method. | Both must use (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method. |
|     | (IFRS financial reporting) not fair value, Determination, expected value or modified fair value methods. | (IFRS financial reporting) not fair value, Determination, expected value or modified fair value methods. | Both have to use a method that is not the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method. |
| Non-IFRS  <br>GAAP Hedging | Any applicable method. | Any applicable method. | A full choice of tax methods is available for these FAs. |

During the course of the drafting process it became obvious that, for the anti-arbitrage provisions to work properly, it was also necessary to insert a new subclause in sections EW 15C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15D of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the use of the IFRS financial reporting fair value method, in addition to amending the clauses relating to the anti-arbitrage provisions for the three methods above.

It has also been considered appropriate, as a result of submissions during the consultation stage of the bill, to include in the definition of “fair value method” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 reference to sections EW 15C and EW 15D respectively. This reference is not intended to change the meaning of the definition but merely to reinforce that the fair value method is a method included in those two sections, being the IFRS taxpayer method and the IFRS financial reporting method respectively.

It should also reinforce that the IFRS method/financial reporting fair value method does not include the modified fair value method, which is a separate method.

##### _FRS early adopters who used the (IFRS method) fair value method in the 2005-06 income year_

IFRS early adopters who filed their 2005-06 income year tax returns on the basis of using the (IFRS method) fair value method for financial arrangements have the choice of changing to another applicable method for those financial arrangements in either the 2006-07 or 2007-08 income years. They can make the change by performing a base price adjustment in the year they elect to change methods.

This transitional measure has been provided on the basis that the original legislation was not enacted until after early adopters were required to file their 2005-06 income year returns and were not fully aware of the final shape of the legislation. It is likely that very few taxpayers would be affected by this change.

##### _Interest capitalised for IFRS GAAP_

The policy on capitalised interest and other borrowing costs is that it is deductible when incurred for tax purposes. However, enactment of the 2007 tax legislation for IFRS created some doubt on this matter. There was no intention to change the longstanding policy as a result of the enactment of the original IFRS tax legislation.

Accordingly, section EW 15C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15D of the Income tax Act 2007 have been amended so that interest that has been capitalised in the IFRS GAAP financial statements is deducted for tax when it is incurred, which will be the same income year as it is capitalised for IFRS GAAP. However, if a taxpayer has taken the position of not deducting interest which has been capitalised for IFRS GAAP in a tax return filed before 30 June 2009, that position will be grandparented.

##### _Pre-IFRS GAAP financial reporting method_

The original 2007 IFRS legislation repealed the section allowing the use of pre-IFRS GAAP financial reporting methods as a method available for tax. For taxpayers who had adopted IFRS financial reporting, the repeal was understandable as the new IFRS tax rules specifically include methods based on IFRS financial reporting. However, its wider repeal failed to recognise that IFRS is not compulsory for all preparers of GAAP financial statements.

Sections EW 21 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 have therefore both been reinstated as they were previously, including consequential amendments to other relevant sections. These sections apply from the dates of the original IFRS legislation and are available to non-IFRS GAAP adopters for any income year since those application dates.

##### _IFRS financial reporting method - clarification_

Section EW 15B of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW15B of the Income Tax Act 2007 did not specify whether the allocation of an amount for tax must be the amount shown in a taxpayer’s financial statements or whether an allocation can be made by applying an accounting methodology available under IFRS but not used by the taxpayer.

The policy intent is that the taxpayer must be actually using the allocation method in its financial statements for it to be able to use it for tax purposes. It is not intended for a taxpayer to use any allocation method which IFRS accounting may generally permit without actually using the method for its own financial statements. It should be noted that the policy is based on considerations such as simplicity, ease of compliance and that the financial statements are almost certainly audited.

The sections have been amended to provide greater clarity.

##### _Impaired credit adjustments for financial arrangements using the IFRS financial reporting fair value method - dealers_

Section EW 15C of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section EW 15D of the Income tax Act 2007 required taxpayers using the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method to identify and adjust for credit impairments to financial arrangements accounted for at fair value.

Before the original IFRS legislation, dealers were permitted to use the mark to market value method with no adjustment for credit impairments.

It was subsequently submitted that the IFRS tax legislation changed the previous policy for dealers who now use the (IFRS financial reporting) fair value method, by making them identify and adjust for credit impairments to non-derivative financial arrangements.

This change restores the earlier position that existed for dealers before the original IFRS tax legislation, with retrospective effect.

##### _Financial arrangements held by non-New Zealand functional currency taxpayers_

An IFRS GAAP taxpayer can apply any relevant method of the four IFRS methods available under the IFRS tax legislation to financial arrangements denominated in a functional currency other than New Zealand dollars.

It was submitted at the consultation stage of the bill that there should be a rule requiring non-New Zealand dollar functional currency entities that apply IFRS GAAP to use New Zealand dollars, regardless of which of the four methods specified in section EW 15C(1) is adopted.

Section EW15B of the Income tax Act 2004 and section EW 15B of the Income Tax Act 2007 have both been amended to ensure that, when a taxpayer is using a non-New Zealand dollars functional currency for IFRS GAAP, the four IFRS tax methods are applied using New Zealand dollars.

##### _Methodology for calculating taxable income on swaps: Determination G9A_

Direct use of Determination G9A was denied in the original IFRS legislation. However, it was overlooked that Determination G27 included use of Determination G9A in some circumstances, and amendments eliminate that use via Determination G27 to ensure consistency with the original policy.

The original policy intent is considered to be still valid, to reduce volatility caused by the use of spot exchange rates unless the taxpayer is using the IFRS financial reporting method which accounts for volatility.

It is also considered that the other methods available in the legislation will allow taxpayers sufficient choice to reduce volatility for tax purposes in hedge situations.

However, it was agreed that the application dates as proposed were not equitable and that affected taxpayers should be given the choice of applying them from the next income year. As originally proposed, they would have been retrospective to the 2006 tax year if an IFRS early adopter taxpayer chose to use the new IFRS tax rules from 2006.

Officials also noted that Determination G29 allows the use of Determination G9A in some situations and that for IFRS taxpayers this is also inappropriate in terms of the original policy. This alternative has also been removed for IFRS taxpayers.

Sections EW 14E and EW 15H of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to effect these changes, with application from the 2009-10 income year. A change of spreading method adjustment may be necessary in that year.

##### _Consistency requirements for groups of companies: expected value and modified fair value methods_

The original IFRS legislation for these two methods included a consistency requirement which could have been interpreted as an election requirement. Section EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections EW 15F and EW 15G of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended to ensure that it is both an election condition and a consistency requirement, as originally intended.

Also, submissions were received about the general application of the consistency requirements for groups of companies’ using these two methods for financial arrangements.

As a result, the application of the consistency requirements for groups of companies and those two methods has been relaxed, and sections EW 15E of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections EW 15F and EW 15G of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been amended.

The resulting changes mean that the consistency requirements for the two methods do not apply to a company in a group of companies which does not have a business of a substantially similar nature to another company in the group, and the relevant financial arrangements are not with associated persons. However, if the arrangements are with associated persons, the two methods can be used by a company in a group of companies if the associated persons also use the same method for those arrangements (following the requirements in the legislation prescribing the use of those methods). This is illustrated in the following example.

##### Example

Company A in a group is the importer and distributor of electronic equipment, while Company B in the same group manages/operates computer systems for companies not associated with the group. Company A enters into FX contracts with a non-associated person for the purchase price of its imported electronic equipment, and Company B enters into FX contracts with non-associated persons for revenue it receives from overseas people it manages computer systems for. Company A and Company B, while being part of the same group, would not be regarded as having businesses of a substantially similar nature. Therefore, Company A could use either of the above two methods for its FX contracts if they are available in terms of the legislation, irrespective of the method chosen by Company B for its FX contracts. This applies because both companies’ FX contracts are with non-associated persons.

However, if either company’s FX contracts are with associated persons, the two methods cannot be used for the FX contracts for the relevant company unless the associated person also used the same method for its FX contracts.

It is noted that there is no intention to change the consistency requirements applying to a taxpayer in a group of companies for either the use of tax methods for the same/similar financial arrangements or for financial arrangements over time (i.e. from year to year) by the changes regarding group companies described above.

##### _Base price adjustment: non-integral fees_

The definition of “consideration” was changed by the original IFRS legislation in respect of “non-integral fees” for IFRS GAAP. The change was made for non-integral fees paid by a taxpayer but it should also have been made for non-integral fees paid to a taxpayer. This has been corrected by changes to sections EW 31 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007.

##### _Modified fair value method: IFRS GAAP hedging achieved only in the consolidated financial statements_

The original IFRS legislation did not provide an acceptable method for eliminating volatility of income/expenditure for financial arrangements in an individual company’s tax return where IFRS GAAP cashflow hedge accounting cannot be applied at an individual company level but is applied at an IFRS GAAP consolidated level. The hedge accounting in this situation therefore does not appear in the IFRS GAAP financial statements of any individual group company.

In practice the situation will arise where one company in a wholly owned group has a financial arrangement with a non-associated person which is hedged by a financial arrangement entered into by another group company, again with a non-associated person. These financial arrangements would be “related” for purposes of the legislation.

Where this occurs one of the individual companies in the group will have fair value amounts for financial arrangements in its profit and loss account which will produce volatility and may be unacceptable for tax purposes. However, when these amounts are offset for IFRS GAAP accounting by hedging entries at the consolidated level, an acceptable accounting result is achieved. This is achieved by removing the IFRS GAAP volatility in the individual company’s profit and loss account to equity reserve accounts at the consolidated level.

It must be emphasised that, in these limited situations, the affected taxpayers only want to achieve a position where volatility at the individual company level is removed for tax purposes, as it is for IFRS GAAP at the consolidated level. It should also be noted that, without an amendment, the issue is still relevant when individual companies file as part of a tax “consolidated” group in terms of tax legislation.

Where a taxpayer in a wholly owned group uses the modified fair value method in this manner, all members of the wholly owned group must use the modified fair value method for financial arrangements which have amounts allocated to equity reserves either in the taxpayer’s accounts or at the consolidated level.

Section EW 15G of the Income Tax Act 2007 has therefore been amended to achieve this outcome of removing the volatility in an individual company’s tax return which is otherwise removed for IFRS GAAP only at the consolidated level with application from the 2008-09 income year.

Further remedial changes to the taxation rules for life business
================================================================

Technical changes have been made to the recently enacted reforms for taxing life insurance business. Applies from 1 Jul 2010.

_Sections EY 24, EY 30 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Technical changes have been made to the recently enacted reforms for taxing life insurance business.

### Background

The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 significantly changed the taxation rules applicable to life insurance business. The new rules changed the basis of taxing life insurance business and contained a comprehensive set of transitional provisions that preserved the previous income tax treatment of life insurance policies sold before the application date.

Since the enactment of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, subsequent taxation bills have amended aspects of the transitional rules to remove uncertainties and deal with practical problems identified by life insurers.

In response to submissions received on the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill, the Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended a number of technical amendments to the life insurance taxation rules.

### Key features

The changes include:

*   Section EY 30(3)(e) has been amended and simplifies the application of the transitional rule for life reinsurance contracts sold before the start of the new taxation rules. Transitional relief should apply to life reinsurance contracts in place before the start date of the new life insurance rules to the extent that any life insurance policy covered by the life reinsurance contract is:
    *   also grandparented (this assumes the life reinsurer is able to use the information provided to it by the cedant life insurer about the underlying life policy); or
    *   would be grandparented but for the seller of the life policy not being a "life insurer" for income tax purposes, for example, this can occur if the seller of the life policy fully reinsures.The revision to section EY 30(3)(e) allows life reinsurers to grandparent existing reinsurance contracts to the extent that the underlying life policy is also grandparented and there are no material changes in the terms of the life reinsurance contract.
*   Section EY 30(8) has been amended and removes references to the Outstanding Claims Reserve and the Capital Guarantee Reserve from the transitional relief formula in section EY 30(7). The change ensures that the formula produces an amount which effectively taxes grandparented life insurance policies on a basis similar to the one that existed under the old life insurance taxation rules.
*   Section EY 24(2)(a)(ii) clarifies the method for calculating the opening balance of the Outstanding Claims Reserve for the first income year that the new life insurance rules have application. The change recognises that historically individual life insurers have for tax purposes used different accounting methods when calculating the opening balance of the Outstanding Claims Reserve for their mortality profit calculations. The example used in the section is for illustrative purposes and uses the acronym "IBNR" (which is commonly used by insurers for claims incurred but not reported) instead of the defined terms in section EY 24 for outstanding claims reserve.
*   Section YA 1 has been amended by narrowing the definition of "profit participation policy" to ensure that life reinsurance policies, multiple life policies, and workplace group policies are taxed as non-participating life insurance policies. Life reinsurance and group policies share the characteristics of pure risk policies and should not be treated as traditional profit participation policies when they contain no savings element.

### Application date

The changes apply from 1 July 2010. Life insurers have the option to apply the rules from the beginning of their income year, if that year includes 1 July 2010.

Further steps to combat tax evasion
===================================

**05 March 2019**

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash has announced New Zealand is expanding its global ability to combat tax evasion by joining forces with authorities in 30 countries and jurisdictions.

Cabinet has agreed to add another 30 territories to the current list of 60 jurisdictions where New Zealand has information-sharing agreements as part of a global standard known as the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI).

“The addition of 30 new territories reflects increased international cooperation by OECD and G20 countries to crack down on tax evasion,” says Mr Nash.

“It further increases our ability to ensure all New Zealanders pay their fair share of tax, including those who have financial interests in other countries. It shines a spotlight on those who try to evade tax obligations by hiding their assets offshore.

“New Zealand will send financial account information to these territories on an annual basis. These countries have enacted, or are expected to soon enact, legislation that enables them to send the same information to New Zealand.

“The 30 new countries are spread around the globe, from the Caribbean to Europe, Asia, the Pacific, Africa and the Middle East. The list includes jurisdictions such as Panama, Switzerland, Macao, the Cook Islands and Nigeria.

The AEOI enables information sharing about details of accounts at many institutions, including banks, private equity funds, investment advisors and some brokers and trusts.

“Inland Revenue will review the information and verify that correct tax is being paid on offshore investments. New Zealand taxpayers are strongly advised to check they have correctly accounted for their offshore investments. If not, they should make a voluntary disclosure to Inland Revenue without delay.

“The Coalition Government is determined that our tax system should be fair. We will ensure trans-national financial activity does not seek to evade tax obligations. In 2018 we passed legislation to make multinationals pay their fair share of tax, and have recently signalled our intention to ensure providers of digital services also meet their obligations.

“New Zealand supports the growing international consensus about the need to eliminate opportunities for tax evasion. The G20 and the OECD account for 88 percent of the world’s economic activity. We are determined that the tax system is fair,” Mr Nash said.

14 March 2018 - Future of Tax: Summary for Submitters
=====================================================

Background material

Issue date: 14 March 2018

Version note:

*   Issued by the Tax Working Group.
*   ISBN: 978-1-98-853495-4 (Online)

Copyright: © Crown Copyright, Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

This summary paper and the accompanying Submissions Background Paper call for public submissions on a range of issues that the Group considers important to its work. Public submissions will inform the Group's consideration of proposals for improving the tax system.

### The tax system matters to everybody

Few areas of public policy contribute as much to the welfare of New Zealanders as taxation. Taxes allow the Government to fund the vital public services - such as healthcare, education, justice, expenditure on healthy ecosystems, and defence - that underpin our living standards.

The calculation and payment of tax also imposes obligations on New Zealanders and the tax system affects different groups of people in different ways. As a consequence, tax is not just for 'experts' - all New Zealanders have a stake in the design of our tax system.

### About the Tax Working Group

The Government has established the Tax Working Group (the Group) to examine further improvements to the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. The Group has also been directed to apply a particular focus on the _future_ to its work, with a view to exploring the major challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system over the next decade and beyond.

The Group is chaired by Hon Sir Michael Cullen and is supported by a secretariat of officials from the Treasury and Inland Revenue. The Chair has also appointed an independent advisor to assist the Group with its deliberations and understanding of the issues.

### We want to hear your views

This summary paper and the accompanying _Submissions Background Paper_ call for public submissions on a range of issues that the Group considers important to its work. Public submissions will inform the Group's consideration of proposals for improving the tax system.

Submitters may submit on other issues, but should be aware of the exclusions in the Group's Terms of Reference. The Terms of Reference are published on the Group's website: [https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz](https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz)

To help submitters, the _Submissions Background Paper_ also provides information and context on New Zealand's current tax system and tax concepts.

The Group will provide an interim report on these proposals to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue in September 2018. There will be further opportunities for public comment following the report's publication.

In the spirit of openness and inclusion, the Group would now like to encourage all New Zealanders to share their own views about what is working - and what is not - in the current tax system.

### How to make a submission

Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for the Group and the secretariat to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required.

Submissions should be made by 30 April 2018 and can be emailed to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84f7f1e6e9edf7f7edebeaf7c4f0e5fcf3ebf6efedeae3e3f6ebf1f4aae3ebf2f0aaeafe)
 or submitted online at [https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz](/publications/2020/2020-tax-working-group)

Alternatively, submissions may be addressed to:

Tax Working Group Secretariat  
PO Box 3724  
Wellington 6140  
New Zealand

Submissions will be proactively released and only redacted or withheld on the grounds of privacy, commercial sensitivity, or any other reason under the Official Information Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this.

In addition to seeking written submissions, the Group intends to discuss the issues raised in this paper and the _Submissions Background Paper_ with key interested parties.

### Challenges, risks, and opportunities

Tax systems have always had to evolve alongside changing practices in business, technology, and society. However, technology today - particularly in the area of digital communications - is having a radical impact on the way businesses operate, both within and across national borders.

Within this context, the Group has identified eight broad challenges, risks, and opportunities that will affect the tax system over the coming decade and beyond:

*   changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring;
*   te ao Māori and the role of the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand's overall living standards;
*   the changing nature of work;
*   technological change and the different business models that will bring;
*   falling company tax rates around the world;
*   environmental challenges, including climate change and loss of ecosystem services and species;
*   growing concern about inequality; and
*   the impacts of globalisation and changes in its patterns.

Our tax system will need to be sufficiently robust to deal with these challenges, and sufficiently nimble to take advantage of the opportunities. There will also be other shocks and surprises that we have not considered and cannot foresee.

The Group would therefore like to hear your views on how these challenges and opportunities might affect the tax system, and, equally importantly, whether you consider there are any other key issues that policymakers will need to prepare for.

### The purposes and principles of a good tax system

Even as the tax system evolves in response to these risks and opportunities, it will still need to fulfil the central purpose of tax policy: to provide sufficient revenue to the Government to fund the provision of public goods, services and transfers.

But the design of the tax system will also have broader impacts on the wellbeing of New Zealanders across the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The Group intends to be mindful of these impacts as it develops recommendations for reform.

In recognition of the broad basis of wellbeing, the Treasury uses the _Living Standards Framework_ to incorporate a more comprehensive range of factors into its analysis. The Living Standards Framework identifies four 'capital stocks' that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing:

*   Financial and physical capital, such as roads, factories, and financial assets.
*   Human capital, such as skills and knowledge.
*   Social capital, such as trust, cultural achievements and community connections.
*   Natural capital, such as soil and water.

The Living Standards Framework encourages us to consider how policy change is likely to impact each of the four capitals, and broadens our assessment beyond strictly economic considerations.

The established criteria that have been used in past tax reviews (both domestically and overseas) are also useful when considering the costs and benefits of various reforms:

*   Efficiency: minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions (biases) to the use of resources.
*   Equity and fairness: achieve fairness including through 'horizontal equity' (the same treatment for people in the same circumstances) and 'vertical equity' (higher tax obligations on those with greater economic capacity to pay). Procedural fairness is also important for a tax system.
*   Revenue integrity: minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage.
*   Fiscal adequacy: raise sufficient revenue for the Government's requirements.
*   Compliance and administration costs: minimise the costs of compliance and administration, and give taxpayers as much certainty as possible.
*   Coherence: ensure that individual reform options make sense in the context of the entire tax system.

As you read this document, the Group would encourage you to consider which principles and frameworks are most important to you in evaluating the tax system, and to test your own ideas and proposals against them.

### The design of the current tax system

New Zealand currently has a 'broad-based, low-rate' tax system. The Government raises about 90% of its tax revenue from three tax bases:[\[1\]](#note1)

*   Individual income tax
*   Goods and services tax (GST)
*   Company income tax.

There are very few exemptions to these three taxes (which is why our tax system is described as 'broad-based'). The benefit of having a broad base is that it allows the Government to raise substantial revenue with relatively low rates of taxation. Overall, the current level of tax revenue, including local government rates, is equivalent to 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is slightly below the OECD average of 34% of GDP.

New Zealand's tax system is distinct in other ways. Unlike many other countries, New Zealand does not generally use the tax system to deliberately modify behaviour - with the notable exceptions of alcohol and tobacco excise taxes, which are intended to discourage drinking and smoking.

New Zealand's approach to the taxation of retirement savings is also distinct. The tax system does not offer large concessions for retirement savings; retirement savings contributions are taxed when they are made and as investment income is earned, rather than when the savings are drawn down in retirement.

The Group's work provides an opportunity to examine whether a broad-based, low rate system remains fit-for-purpose, and whether there is a case to depart from the internationally distinctive approaches to behavioural taxes and retirement savings. It is also an opportunity to explore whether there is a case to broaden the base further, for example with new taxes such as a comprehensive capital gains tax (excluding the family home).

### The results of the current tax system

#### Revenue outcomes

New Zealand's broad-based, low-rate system succeeds at raising relatively high amounts of revenue with relatively low rates. Compared with other OECD countries:

*   New Zealand has one of the lowest top personal tax rates, but the proportion of income tax to GDP is high.
*   New Zealand's company tax rate is relatively high, and the proportion of company tax revenue to GDP is high.
*   New Zealand's GST rate is relatively low, but the proportion of GST revenue to GDP is high.

New Zealand's GST is one of the simplest and most comprehensive in the world. There are two main exemptions - for financial services, and for low-value imported goods.[\[2\]](#note2)
 These exemptions reflect past judgements that it would be too administratively complex to include financial services and low-value imported goods in the tax.

#### Distributional outcomes

Higher-income households play an important role in funding the Government. According to established income measures, the share of all income tax paid increases as household income increases. Households in the top income decile (that is, the 10% of households with the highest incomes) pay around 35% of all income tax, whereas households in the lowest five income deciles (that is, 50% of households) collectively pay less than 20% of all income tax.

The tax and transfer system (_transfers_ are payments like Jobseeker Support and New Zealand Superannuation) reduces income inequality, although by less than most of our comparator countries. New Zealand's tax and transfer system provides a similar reduction in measured income inequality to the Canadian system, but a smaller reduction than Australia or the OECD average.

Income inequality in New Zealand rose rapidly in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, but has been broadly stable in New Zealand since then. Information about wealth is less comprehensive than for income, but the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income.

#### Savings

There is some debate about the influence of our tax settings on the rate and composition of saving in New Zealand. In a broad-based, low-rate tax system, there should ideally be no difference in marginal effective tax rates between different types of investments. Relative to other countries, New Zealand's marginal effective tax rates are quite uniform, but it may be possible to achieve more consistency in the treatment of different types of investments.

#### Overall outcomes

The Group is keen to hear public views on the overall performance of the tax system, and has a particular interest in assessments of the fairness and balance of our tax settings.

### Thinking outside the current system

New Zealand has reduced its use of other tax bases under the broad-based, low-rate tax system. Previous reforms have eliminated the sales tax, excess retention tax, land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift duty and cheque duty. New Zealand also does not levy financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes, or a general capital gains tax. The Group will examine whether there is a case to introduce any additional taxes, particularly in light of growing international debate about income and wealth inequality.

The Group also acknowledges public concerns about the tax practices of some multinational corporations, which exploit inconsistencies and mismatches in domestic tax rules in order pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. In this regard, New Zealand is currently implementing a suite of measures - developed in cooperation with other OECD countries - that will further strengthen the rules for taxing income from investment in New Zealand.

But we also need to consider the taxation of income from the digital economy. Internet-based firms can trade with customers over the internet without having a physical presence in the customer's country that is necessary for income tax to be charged under present rules. This issue is becoming increasingly important as the digital economy accounts for a greater proportion of business activity.

The Group invites comment on what the public sees as the most significant inconsistencies in the current tax system, and which of these should be addressed most urgently.

### Specific challenges

In addition to the issues discussed above, the Government has directed the Group to advise on a number of specific challenges:

*   How would a _capital gains tax_ (excluding the family home) or a _land tax_ (excluding the land under the family home) affect housing affordability, and would these taxes improve the current system for _capital income_ taxation? Relevant considerations will include: the impacts of these taxes on property-owners and renters; the ease of administering these taxes; the interaction of these taxes with the rest of the tax system; the extent to which the tax will incentivise productive investment as opposed to speculation; and the possibility of allowing for reductions in other taxes as a result of introducing them.
*   Is there a case to introduce a _progressive company tax_ (i.e. lower company tax rates for smaller businesses) in order to support small business?
*   Is there a case to make greater use of _environmental taxation_ to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base?
*   Could the Government assist low-income people by introducing _GST exemptions_ for certain goods and services?

The Group seeks public views on all of these matters. It also invites submissions on the question of which taxes should be lowered if new sources of tax revenue can be found (keeping in mind the guidance in the Terms of Reference for tax revenue to remain at approximately 30% of GDP).

### Concluding thoughts

New Zealand's tax system has many strengths, but it cannot stand still. We are living in an era of rapid technological change, rising economic uncertainty, and mounting environmental challenges. Our tax system must be robust to these challenges, even as it takes advantage of the administrative and other opportunities afforded by innovation.

However, it is important that we maintain the trust and confidence of all New Zealanders in the integrity of the tax system. In a democracy such as ours, the ability of the Government to raise revenue rests ultimately on the consent and acceptance of all New Zealanders.

In order to maintain this acceptance, and fulfil the trust of New Zealanders, we must ensure that the tax system is fair, balanced, and administered well. This is the goal the Group is working towards. Your submissions will help us achieve it.

### Notes

*   [\[1\]](#refNo1)
     This figure excludes local government rates, which are sometimes included in measures of total tax revenue for ease of comparison with other OECD countries.
*   [\[2\]](#refNo2)
     Long-term residential accommodation is also not subject to GST, but applying GST to rent would raise various practical and fairness issues.

1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] FX 20/01: Approval – foreign residential rental property amounts – currency conversion 1. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. Introduction 2. The Act requires foreign currency amounts to be converted to New Zealand dollars to calculate a taxpayer’s New Zealand income tax liability. 3. In some cases, the Act prescribes a currency conversion method or exchange rate source to use, but in most cases it does not. Where the Act does not prescribe a currency conversion method or exchange rate source the default method is the close of trading spot exchange rate on the date the amount is required to be measured or calculated (s YF 1(2)). However, the Commissioner can approve other methods and rates to use (s YF 1(5)) to minimise compliance costs. 4. This Approval approves an annual and a monthly currency conversion method and exchange rate sources that may be used instead of or in conjunction with the spot rate (s YF 1(5)). Application 5. This Approval only applies to: • individuals who own foreign residential rental property, which for the purposes of this Approval include: o an individual partner of a partnership who has an interest, as a partner, in a foreign rental property; o an individual acting in their capacity as trustee; • individuals who are: o New Zealand residents; or o non-resident trustees to whom s HC 25(2) applies (see Interpretation Statement “IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts – income tax” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 7 (August 2018): 17); and • foreign currency amounts derived from or incurred on residential rental property, including rent, premiums, inducements, early termination payments, rates, insurance, levies, repairs and maintenance costs, acquisition costs, sale proceeds, improvement costs and construction costs. 6. This Approval does not apply where the Act prescribes a currency conversion method or exchange rate source for a particular transaction or arrangement. For example, for financial arrangements, currency conversion methods and exchange rate sources specified in the financial arrangements rules must be used. Note that a foreign loan used to finance a foreign residential rental property may be a financial arrangement. 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Currency conversion methods and exchange rate sources approved 7. You may use one of the currency conversion methods or exchange rate sources in this Approval instead of the spot rate (s YF 1(5)). 8. An example showing the use of the methods and exchange rate sources is provided at the end of this Approval. 9. If you want to use a method or exchange rate source not outlined in this Approval, apply to the Commissioner for approval to use that method or source (email fxconversions@ird.govt.nz ). Currency conversion methods 10. The Commissioner approves the annual and the monthly currency conversion methods for converting foreign currency amounts related to foreign residential rental properties to New Zealand dollars. These methods are explained below. 11. Use of the annual and monthly methods is subject to the conditions outlined in \[24\] to \[27\]. The Commissioner approves the use of these methods in conjunction with amounts converted to New Zealand dollars during the year at the spot rate. Exchange rate sources 12. The Commissioner approves the following exchange rate sources under s YF 1(5): • the foreign exchange rates published by Inland Revenue on its website ( www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/overseas-currency-conversion-to-nz- dollars); • foreign exchange rates from another reputable source. 13. Use of these exchange rate sources is subject to conditions outlined in \[30\] to \[36\]. Currency conversion methods 14. You may use either the annual method or the monthly method for converting foreign currency amounts derived from, or incurred on, your foreign residential rental property. 15. If you choose to use the annual method or monthly method you must use it consistently. However, you may use it in conjunction with amounts converted to New Zealand dollars at the spot rate on the day of the relevant transaction. For example, the annual method or monthly method may be suitable for rental income streams and recurring rental expenditure. The spot rate may be suitable for one- off rental income and expense amounts, such as a gain derived on the sale of a residential rental property, annual tax payments, or the purchase of an item of depreciable property. Annual method 16. Under the annual method, instead of converting foreign currency amounts on a daily basis, amounts are aggregated and converted at the end of the income year using an annual rate. 17. If using the exchange rates published by Inland Revenue, and the relevant period is a period of 12 months, you can use the rolling 12-month average of mid-month rates provided by Inland Revenue as the annual rate. 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 18. Otherwise, the annual rate is calculated by adding together the exchange rates for the 15th day of each month in the relevant period (usually 12 months) and then dividing that total by the number of months in the relevant period (usually 12) to arrive at a single annual exchange rate. 19. If you are using an exchange rate source that does not provide exchange rates for the 15th day of each month, then an alternative monthly rate can be used, eg end- of-month or monthly average. Monthly method 20. Under the monthly method, instead of converting foreign currency amounts on a daily basis, amounts are aggregated and converted at the end of each month using a monthly rate. 21. The monthly rate is based on the exchange rate for the 15th day of the month. 22. If you are using an exchange rate source that does not provide exchange rates for the 15th day of each month, then an alternative monthly rate from the same exchange rate source can be used, eg end-of-month or monthly average. Amounts converted to New Zealand dollars during the year 23. You may use the annual method or monthly method in conjunction with amounts converted to New Zealand dollars during the income year using spot rates. For example: • If you paid foreign tax and converted the amount to New Zealand dollars using the spot rate on the day it was paid, you may use the converted amount; • If you purchased an item of depreciable property in foreign currency and converted the foreign currency amount using the spot rate on the day you paid it, you may use the converted amount; • If you used a New Zealand credit card to pay a foreign rental expense you may use the New Zealand dollar amount charged to your credit card. Conditions for use of currency conversion methods 24. You do not need to notify the Commissioner that you will be using the annual method or monthly method to convert your foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars. 25. If you choose to use the annual method or monthly method you must use it consistently. For example, if you choose the annual method and use it for residential rental income and recurring residential rental expenditure, you must use it every year for all such income and expenditure. If, in conjunction with the annual method, you use spot rates for residential rental property related tax payments and amounts paid for items of depreciable property, you must use spot rates every year for all such payments and amounts. 26. You must use the method you choose for all: • residential rental properties you may purchase in the future; • your foreign residential rental properties if you own more than one. 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 27. However, you can ask the Commissioner for approval to change to a different method (email fxconversions@ird.govt.nz ). Exchange rate sources Approval of exchange rate sources 28. For the purposes of this Approval, the Commissioner has approved the following foreign exchange rate sources under s YF 1(5): • Foreign exchange rates published by Inland Revenue on its website ( www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/overseas-currency-conversion-to-nz- dollars) which include mid-month and rolling 12-month average rates. • Foreign exchange rates from another reputable source. For example, exchange rates published on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand website (www.rbnz.govt.nz ) or rates obtained from a registered bank. Registered banks are listed on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand website ( www.rbnz.govt.nz/regulation-and-supervision/banks/register). Non-trading days 29. Some of the foreign exchange rate sources listed may provide rates for only trading days. If the relevant day of the month is not a trading day, you must use the foreign exchange rate on the preceding trading day. Conditions 30. Foreign exchange rates from another reputable source must be appropriate given the nature of your rental activity. For example, this will normally mean using retail rather than wholesale rates. 31. Cash and foreign cheque rates must not be used. 32. Where the other reputable source provides exchange rates in the form of buy and sell rates, the average of the corresponding buy and sell rates must be used. 33. You must keep sufficient records in case you later need to verify the exchange rates used. This is especially important where the source of rates is not published or readily available. 34. An exchange rate source must be applied consistently. This means that once you have chosen a source you must, if possible, use that source: • for all future conversions, including for properties you may purchase in the future. • for all of your foreign rental properties (if you own more than one). 35. If this is not possible (eg, if the exchange rate source you have been using ceases to be available), you can use a different source without notifying the Commissioner. However, you must keep a record of the change and the reasons for it. 36. In other cases, you can ask the Commissioner for approval to change to a different exchange rate source (email fxconversions@ird.govt.nz ). 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example Lucy is a New Zealand tax resident who is not a transitional resident. She has an apartment in France that she rents out. She has the following income and expenditure (excluding interest on the foreign loan she used to buy the apartment) for the property during the income year in Euro (EUR): Annual Income Rent (50 weeks) €400 a week €20,000 Expenses Rates €75 a month €900 Levies and insurance €300 a month €3,600 Repairs and maintenance €500 one-off €500 Total expenses €5,000 Net rental income (excluding interest and depreciation) €15,000 Lucy bought a new fridge for the apartment half-way through the year using her New Zealand credit card. The fridge cost EUR3,000 and NZD5,242.54 was charged to her credit card. Lucy chooses to use the annual method to convert the rental income and expenses (excluding interest and depreciation). She uses the rates published on Inland Revenue’s website, which include rates for converting Euro into New Zealand dollars. The average of the exchange rates for each month during the income year is NZD0.5714 to EUR1. This is already calculated in the rates published by Inland Revenue in the “Rolling 12-month average” table. Because she is using an annual method, Lucy can aggregate each income and expenditure type for the year and apply the annual rate to the aggregated amounts: Income: Lucy has EUR20,000 of rental income for the year: EUR20,000 divided by 0.5714 = NZD35,001.75. Expenses: Lucy has EUR5,000 of rental expenses for the year (excluding interest and depreciation): EUR5,000 divided by 0.5714 = NZD8,750.44. 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Lucy also needs to calculate the depreciation deduction on the fridge. Lucy chooses to do this using the actual conversion amount of NZD5,242.54 charged to her credit card instead of the annual method. Lucy claims a depreciation deduction for the fridge (for 6 months’ use) using a diminishing value rate of 25%: NZD5,242.54 multiplied by 6/12 multiplied by 25% = NZD655.32 Lucy also needs to calculate her interest deduction on the loan she used to buy the apartment. To do this Lucy needs to apply the financial arrangements rules, including the foreign exchange method and source required by those rules. Doing so, Lucy calculates she has an interest deduction of NZD12,513.56. Note that Lucy may also have a non-resident withholding tax obligation on the interest she pays to the lender. As a result, Lucy’s net rental income (NZD) is: Income $35,001.75 Expenses (other) $8,750.44 Depreciation $655.32 Interest $12,513.56 Net rental income $13,082.43 Lucy paid EUR2,370 tax in France on income derived from the rental property. She converts this using the spot rate on the day she paid the tax in France: EUR2,370 divided by 0.5732 = NZD4,134.68 Lucy may be allowed foreign tax credits for some or all of this amount under the provisions of the DTA with France and subpart LJ.

The Act requires foreign currency amounts to be converted to NZD to calculate a taxpayer’s New Zealand income tax liability. 2. In some cases, the Act prescribes a currency conversion method or a foreign exchange rate source to use, but in most cases it does not. Where the Act does not prescribe a currency conversion method or a foreign exchange rate source, the default method is to use the “close of trading spot exchange rate” on the date the amount is required to be measured or calculated (s YF 1(2)). 1 However, the Commissioner can also approve other rates and methods to help minimise compliance costs (s YF 1(5)) . 2 3. The Commissioner publishes foreign currency exchange rates for certain currencies on the Inland Revenue website at https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/overseas- currency-conversion-to-nz-dollars. The Commissioner publishes mid-month, end-of- month and rolling average rates for each currency. From 1 May 2021, the Commissioner changed the source from which she obtains the rates to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. As a result, the number of rates published has decreased. 4. This Approval approves three foreign currency exchange rate sources.  Rates published by the Commissioner.  Rates published by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.  Rates published by another country’s central bank. 5. This Approval also approves three currency conversion methods.  The mid-month rate.  The end-of-month rate.  The rolling average rate. 6. The currency conversion methods listed at \[5\] must use the rates published in, or calculated from, the sources listed at \[4\]. 7. This Approval does not apply where the Act or the Commissioner prescribe a source, method or rate for a particular transaction or arrangement. 1 “Close of trading spot exchange rate” is defined in s YA 1 and adopts some of the foreign exchange rate sources and currency conversion methods set out in Determination G6D. Determination G6D provides foreign exchange rate sources and methods for the financial arrangement rules. 2 See for example, FX 20/01 Approval - foreign residential rental property amounts - currency conversion, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 7 (August 2020): 28. The Commissioner can also approve specific foreign exchange rate sources and currency conversion methods for use by a particular person (s YF 1(6)). UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 8. You are not required to use the foreign exchange rates from the sources approved in this Approval. However, if you use a rate that is not from one of these sources (and you are not required to use a prescribed method or rate), you will need to ensure that the exchange rate you use is appropriate given the nature of your transaction. You must also keep sufficient records in case you later need to verify the exchange rates used. 9. Finally, this Approval provides guidance on cryptoassets and GST, and examples on how a foreign currency exchange rate should be used to convert foreign currency amounts to NZD. Conditions for using this Approval When the Approval applies 10. This Approval applies where a person is required to convert a foreign currency amount into NZD for the purpose of calculating their income tax liability. 11. This Approval does not apply where the Act or the Commissioner prescribe a source, currency conversion method or rate for a particular transaction or arrangement. For example, you must use the specified currency conversion methods and exchange rate sources for the financial arrangement rules, the foreign investment fund rules, and the controlled foreign company rules. Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) generally prescribes that the consideration for a supply should be converted to NZD at the time of supply. Obtaining a daily rate 12. If you need a rate for a particular day, but a rate is not quoted for that day in the foreign exchange rate source you are using (for example, because it is a weekend or a holiday), you may use the daily rate for the preceding day on which a daily rate was quoted. 13. Similarly, the Commissioner will take a practical approach where the foreign exchange rate source is situated in a different time zone from New Zealand. A daily rate quoted in the source time zone could arise on a different date based on New Zealand time. These timing mismatches can be disregarded, and a practical approach taken, when selecting a rate. UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Level of accuracy required 14. Exchange rates are typically quoted to four decimal places. This level of accuracy is required for rates you have sourced and for your mid-rate, cross rate, or rolling average rate calculations. If you need to round your figures, round to the nearest 4th decimal place. Records you must keep 15. You must keep sufficient records of the exchange rates you use including source, type and date of rate. You must also keep a record of any calculations you undertake (for example, if you calculate a rolling average or a cross rate). As noted at \[18\], if you change your foreign exchange rate source you should record the reasons for the change. Choosing your own rate sources and methods 16. Subject to \[11\], you are free to choose your own rates and methods when converting foreign amounts to NZD. You may continue to use exchange rates from other sources for reasons such as established practices, integration with accounting software or to reduce compliance costs. 17. However, if you use a different foreign exchange rate source you must ensure that the rate you use is appropriate given the nature of your transaction. For example, it is not appropriate to use cash or foreign cheque rates. 18. Further, you should use exchange rates consistently, both in terms of using the same source of rates for converting all your foreign currency amounts, and in doing this consistently over time. If this is not possible (for example, if you change your exchange rate source provider or you change accounting software with in-built exchange rates), you can use a different source without notifying the Commissioner. However, you must keep a record of the change and the reasons for it. Approval of foreign exchange rate sources 19. The Commissioner approves all the following foreign exchange rate sources under s YF 1(5) for converting foreign currency amounts to NZD, subject to the conditions at \[11\]. UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Foreign exchange rates published on the Inland Revenue website at https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/overseas-currency-conversion-to-nz- dollars.  Foreign exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  Foreign exchange rates published by another country’s central bank. 3 Approval of mid-month, end-of-month and rolling average rates 20. Daily rates published by Inland Revenue, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand or another country’s central bank (as approved at \[19\]) can be used where you need a rate for a particular day. 21. The Commissioner also approves the following currency conversion methods under s YF 1(5) for converting foreign currency amounts to NZD, subject to the conditions at \[11\].  The mid-month rate.  The end-of-month rate.  The rolling average rate. 22. These currency conversion methods are approved where their use would be appropriate for the transactions being converted to NZD. The Commissioner considers that where there is a large volume of repeated transactions, it will generally be appropriate to use a rolling average rate to reduce the compliance costs of making daily conversions. Where foreign income is derived and foreign expenditure is incurred regularly throughout a period, using mid-month, end-of-month or rolling average rates is likely to be appropriate. However, significant and one-off transactions should be converted at a daily rate, as shown in Example 1. Example 1: Appropriate rates Villem, a New Zealand tax resident, has an export/import business to and from Estonia. Estonia uses the Euro currency. 3 Although central bank rates are approved, for some countries the central bank rates might not accurately reflect the actual value of the foreign currency or might only be relevant for transactions with the government of that country. In those situations, a more appropriate rate should be used. UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] In the 2021 income year, Villem purchased a warehouse property in Estonia to use in his business. Settlement of the purchase was on 2 February 2021. In preparing Villem’s income tax return for the year, Villem’s accountant determines that because of the volume of regular income and expenditure amounts arising from the business each month, it is appropriate to use the end-of-month rates published by Inland Revenue to convert the foreign currency amounts to NZD. This reduces the compliance costs of converting each transaction at the daily rate. However, Villem’s accountant considers that as the purchase price of the warehouse sets the capital cost of the warehouse for ongoing depreciation purposes, it should be converted to NZD using the exchange rate published by the Reserve Bank for 2 February 2021. Villem pays tax in Estonia twice a year and is eligible to claim foreign tax credits. Villem’s accountant considers that because of the low volume of this type of transaction, it is also appropriate to convert these amounts using a daily rate (on the date that the tax was paid). 23. If your foreign exchange rate source does not publish the monthly and rolling average rates, these can be obtained as follows:  Mid-month rate: This is the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted.  End-of-month rate: This is the exchange rate for the last day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the preceding working day on which they were quoted.  Rolling average rate: This is the average of the mid-month exchange rate for the relevant month and the previous months in the relevant period. For example, a rolling 12-month average would be the mid-month exchange rate for the relevant month and the previous 11 months. The rolling average rate is calculated by adding together the mid-month rates for all the months in the period, and then dividing by the total number of months in the period. This calculation is illustrated in Example 2. UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 2: Rolling average rates Jamie needs to find the rolling 12-month average rate for the Samoan tala (SAT 4 ) for April 2021 because Inland Revenue no longer publishes it. She goes to the Central Bank of Samoa website and downloads the Historical Daily Rates schedule. From that schedule she identifies the mid-month SAT/NZD exchange rate for April 2021 and the preceding 11 months, as follows: Month Rate (for 1SAT) April 2021 0.5533 March 2021 0.5516 February 2021 0.5502 January 2021 0.5492 December 2020 0.5532 November 2020 0.5619 October 2020 0.5718 September 2020 0.5709 August 2020 0.5786 July 2020 0.5770 June 2020 0.5802 May 2020 0.6034 Total 6.8013 To calculate the rolling average rate for April 2021, Jamie adds together the rates for April 2021 and the preceding 11 months and then divides the total by 12 (6. 8013 ÷ 12). This gives a rolling 12-month average rate for April 2021 of 1SAT = 0.5668NZD. (Note this exchange rate is expressed with the Samoan Tala as the base currency. See from \[27\] about the two different ways exchange rates can be expressed.) Currency conversion calculations 24. The following discussion explains how foreign exchange rates should be used to convert foreign currency amounts to NZD. 4 Some publications use the abbreviation WST, which reflects the country’s earlier name of Western Samoa (used up to 1997). UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Finding the mid-rate 25. The Inland Revenue website quotes only one rate per currency, but other foreign exchange rate sources may quote two rates. These rates are:  a Bid Rate or Buy Rate, which is the exchange rate at which the service provider is willing to purchase the foreign currency; and  an Offer Rate or Sell Rate, which is the exchange rate at which the service provider is willing to sell the foreign currency. 26. Where a source quotes two rates, you need to calculate the mid-rate by adding the two rates together and then dividing that number by two. You then use the mid-rate in your currency conversion calculations. Base currency 27. Foreign exchange rates are expressed with one currency as the base currency. The way the foreign exchange rate is expressed affects how you convert the foreign currency amount to NZD. New Zealand Dollar as the base currency 28. Exchange rates can be quoted with the NZD as the base currency. This is the way Inland Revenue expresses its rates. It means the exchange rate is expressed based on the amount of foreign currency that it would take to purchase one NZD. For example, on 31 March 2021, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was quoting:  NZD/USD (United States Dollar) foreign exchange rate as 1NZD = 0.6989USD.  NZD/AUD (Australian Dollar) foreign exchange rate as 1NZD = 0.9182AUD. 29. Where the exchange rate is quoted in this way with NZD as the base currency, you need to divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate to calculate the NZD equivalent of the foreign currency amount. This is illustrated in Example 3. Example 3: Converting a United States dollar amount with the New Zealand dollar as the base currency On 1 April 2021, Madison enters into an USD100,000 term investment for one year with a United States bank. Madison needs to calculate the NZD opening balance amount of her investment. UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Madison goes to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s website www.rbnz.govt.nz, selects “Statistics”, “B1 Exchange rates and TWI” and downloads the spreadsheet “Exchange rates and TWI – B1 Daily (2018-current)”. In column C of that spreadsheet, Madison identifies the NZD/USD exchange rate of 0.6981 for 1 April 2021. The exchange rate is quoted with the NZD as the base currency (that is, it will take 1NZD to purchase 0.6981USD). Therefore, Madison must divide the opening balance by the exchange rate. Madison’s opening balance in NZD is calculated as: Opening balance = USD100,000/0.6981 = NZD143,245.95 Foreign currency as the base currency 30. Alternatively, exchange rates can be quoted with the foreign currency as the base currency. This means the exchange rates are expressed based on the amount of NZD it takes to purchase one unit of a foreign currency. This is likely to be the case on other central bank webpages where the local currency is expressed as the base currency. For example, on 31 March 2021 the Reserve Bank of Australia quoted the AUD/NZD exchange rate as 1AUD = 1.0893NZD. 31. Where the exchange rate is quoted in this way with the foreign currency as the base currency, you need to multiply the foreign currency amount by the relevant exchange rate to calculate the NZD equivalent of the foreign currency amount. This is illustrated in Example 4. Example 4: Converting an Australian dollar amount with the Australian dollar as the base currency On 1 April 2021, Jarli enters into an AUD100,000 term investment for one year with an Australian bank. Jarli needs to calculate the NZD opening balance amount of his investment. Because Jarli has previously used rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia for amounts he has needed to convert to NZD, he continues to use that bank’s website: www.rba.gov.au. He selects “Statistics”, then “Exchange Rates”, and then scrolls down to “Historical Data” and downloads the spreadsheet UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Exchange rates – Daily – 2018 to Current”. He identifies in column L of that spreadsheet an AUD/NZD exchange rate of 1.0849 for 1 April 2021. Jarli notes that the AUD/NZD exchange rate is quoted with the AUD as the base currency. Therefore, Jarli must multiply the opening balance by the exchange rate. Jarli’s opening balance in NZD is calculated as follows: Opening balance = AUD100,000 x 1.0849 = NZD108,490 Finding a rate where the New Zealand dollar is not quoted 32. For some currencies, a rate may not be quoted where the foreign currency is expressed against the NZD. In that case, you need to manually calculate the exchange rate for that currency against the NZD by using a third currency. The USD is usually used for this purpose. This is referred to as a cross-rate. The method for calculating the NZD exchange rate is as follows:  Step 1: Determine the NZD/USD exchange rate.  Step 2: Determine the exchange rate for the foreign currency against the USD.  Step 3: Use the two rates expressed against the USD to calculate the NZD rate against the foreign currency. The method for doing this will depend on whether the USD/foreign currency rate is expressed with the USD or the foreign currency as the base currency. 33. You should use this method only when no rate is quoted for the foreign currency in NZD. Most of New Zealand’s main trading partners quote a NZD exchange rate. Where that is not the case, the USD is usually expressed as the base currency. 34. Where the foreign currency is expressed against the USD with the USD as the base currency, you need to multiply this rate by the NZD/USD exchange rate on the same day (expressed with the NZD as the base currency) to determine the exchange rate against the NZD for that currency. Example 5 and Example 6 show how to calculate the exchange rate in these circumstances. Example 5: Calculating a New Zealand dollar cross rate with USD as the base currency On 31 May 2021, Yasmin needed to calculate the NZD amount of income she had received in Nigerian naira (NGN). She went to the Central Bank of Nigeria UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] website, but could not find an NGN exchange rate expressed against the NZD. However, the NGN was expressed against the USD as 409.50NGN=1USD as at 31 May 2021. As the NGN/USD rate was expressed with the USD as the base currency, Yasmin multiplied this rate against the NZD/USD foreign exchange rate of 0.7252 as at 31 May 2021 (note this rate is expressed with the NZD as the base currency). This calculation gave her a NZD/NGN exchange rate as at 31 May 2021 of 1NZD=296.97NGN (409.50/0.7252). Example 6: Calculating a New Zealand dollar cross rate with USD as the base currency On 30 June 2021, Claudio needed to calculate the NZD equivalent amount of expenditure he had incurred on a business transaction in Chile. Claudio went to the website of a US bank that he deals with, but he could not find an exchange rate showing the Chilean Peso (CLP) expressed against the NZD. However, he found the exchange rate of the Chilean Peso against the USD and the exchange rate of the USD against the NZD on that date. The rates were 735.28CLP=1USD and 1USD=1.4323NZD. As both the CLP/USD and the USD/NZD rates were expressed with the USD as the base currency, Claudio divided the CLP/USD rate by the USD/NZ rate. This calculation gave him a CLP/NZ cross rate of 513.3561CLP=1NZD (735.28/1.4323). Foreign exchange transactions involving cryptoassets 35. Cryptoassets are considered a form of property, rather than money. Therefore, foreign exchange transactions involving cryptoassets may require a two-step calculation. First, you may need to obtain a market value for the cryptoasset. On many exchanges, the market value is expressed in USD. Second, if the market value you have obtained is in USD or another foreign currency, you need to calculate the value in NZD. You may use the foreign exchange rate sources and methods in this Approval unless \[11\] applies to your transaction. 36. Some cryptoasset exchanges publish the value of cryptoassets in a choice of different currencies. To rely on these built-in currency conversions, you need to ensure the rates used by the exchange are appropriate for your transaction. UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 12 Approval FX 21/01 | 21 December 2021 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] GST and currency conversions 37. You may need to convert foreign currency amounts to NZD for GST purposes. Section 77 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) requires that all amounts of money must be expressed in NZD. Where an amount is consideration in money for a supply, the conversion to NZD must generally be performed at the time of supply (s 77(1)). This means the foreign currency amounts must be converted using daily rates. Monthly and rolling average rates cannot be used. 38. Specific rules in s 77(2) to (5) of the GST Act apply to non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods or remote services. These suppliers can elect to express foreign currency amounts in NZD at a choice of dates set out in s 77(3). For example, a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods can choose to convert foreign currency amounts into NZD on the last day of the relevant GST taxable period. 39. While the monthly and rolling average rates cannot be used for GST purposes, the daily rates from the foreign exchange rate sources approved at \[19\] may be appropriate for GST purposes.
