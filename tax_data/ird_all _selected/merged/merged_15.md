General permission (2)Subsection (1) is called the general permission. Origin:(1) BD 2(1)(b)(i), (ii). (2) new. Defined terms:amount, business, counted income, deduction, derived, general permission, incurred, person. Comment:As noted in the general commentary, the drafting of subsection (1) reflects the current section BD 2 (1)(b) and authorises a deduction only to the extent to which counted (formerly gross) income is derived. In view of the exempt income limitation in draft section DA 2 (3), it may not be necessary for the rewritten section to take this approach. It may be sufficient to authorise a deduction if there is a nexus with any income. Comment is sought on this suggestion. Subsection (1)(b) is, arguably, superfluous. DA 2 General limitations Capital limitation (1) A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 262 DA – General rules Private limitation (2)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature.

This rule is called the exempt income limitation. Employment limitation (4)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving income from employment. This rule is called the employment limitation. Withholding tax limitation (5)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving schedular income subject to final withholding. This rule is called the withholding tax limitation. Indemnity limitation (6)A person is not allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is recoverable under insurance or a right of indemnity. This rule is called the indemnity limitation. Relationship of general limitations to general permission (7)Each of the general limitations in this section overrides the general permission.

DA 4 Treatment of depreciation loss Depreciation loss subject to general rules (1)For the purposes of applying the general permission and general limitations, an amount of depreciation loss quantified under subpart EF (Depreciation) for an item of property is treated as if it were actually a loss. Capital limitation not applying automatically (2)However, the capital limitation does not apply to such an amount of depreciation loss merely because the item of property is itself of a capital nature. Origin:(1) BD 2(1)(a). (2) BD 2(1)(a). Defined terms:amount, capital limitation, depreciable property, depreciation loss, general limitation, general permission.

This subsection is overridden by subsection (2). Exceptions (2)Subsection (1) does not apply to expenditure that a person incurs in connection with the following matters: (a)a matter arising from a return of income or a return under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 that was fraudulent or wilfully misleading: (b)an offence under any of the Inland Revenue Acts: (c)a shortfall penalty assessed under this Act, the Tax Administration Act 1994, or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (but not an assessment that is later cancelled): (d)an objection, challenge, or appeal that is inconsequential or frivolous: (e)a matter arising under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to the extent to which it relates to a taxable activity that does not constitute a business for the purposes of this Act.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 270 DB – Specific rules for expenditure types Link with subpart DA (4)This section supplements the general permission and overrides the private limitation and the employment limitation. The other general limitations still apply. Origin:(1) DJ 5(1). (2) DJ 5(3). (3) DJ 5(4). (4) new. Defined terms:amount, business, deduction, employment limitation, general limitation, general permission, goods and services tax payable, income tax liability, income year, incurred, Inland Revenue Acts, person, private limitation, return of income, taxable activity, taxable period. Comment:Expenditure remains deductible in the income year in which it is incurred, even if the expenditure relates to another income year. However, the direct timing rule to that effect, contained in the opening words of current section DJ 5 (1), has been omitted, because the timing is sufficiently addressed by the general ‘incurred’ timing rule in draft section BD 4 (2) (Allocation of deductions to particular income years). Draft subsection (1)(a) now refers to the calculation of income tax liability as well as the determination of liability. This is consistent with the principles of self-assessment and brings the provision into line with the language already used in draft section BB 2 (1) (Principal obligations). Current section DJ 5 (2), which provides that reimbursements and recoveries of amounts previously allowed as a deduction under section DJ 5 are income, has been rewritten as section CG 4 (Recovered expenditure: determining tax liabilities). DB 4 Chatham Islands dues Expenditure on dues (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred on dues that are levied under the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 relating to goods that the person uses in connection with carrying on a business.

Cost of goods (3)Expenditure to which subsection (1) applies must not be taken into account in calculating the cost of the goods for the purpose of any deduction relating to the goods.

Comment:The reference in current section DJ 3 (1) to the Chatham Islands County Council Empowering Act 1980 is obsolete and has been omitted. The timing rule in current section DJ 3 (1), which allocates the deduction to the income year in which payment is made, has been isolated and is now expressed in a separate subsection (2).

DB 13 Payments for non-compliance with covenant for repair When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a)a lessee of land uses it to derive income; and (b)the lease contains a covenant requiring the lessee to maintain the land or to make repairs to improvements on the land, including painting and general maintenance; and (c)the lessee does not comply with the covenant; and (d)the lessee is, consequently, liable to make a payment to the lessor; and (e)either— (i) the lessee, during the term of the lease or after it ends, makes the payment to the lessor; or (ii)the lessor recovers the payment from the lessee during the term of the lease or after it ends. Cost of repairs (2)The lessee is allowed a deduction for the payment to the extent to which it relates to maintenance or repairs and to the extent to which the lessee would have been allowed a deduction for the expenditure had the lessee incurred it during the term of the lease.

Defined terms:capital limitation, deduction, derived, general limitation, general permission, income, income year, incurred, lease, lessee, lessor, term of the lease. Comment:Lessees who become liable to pay money to their lessors because of non- compliance with a covenant to maintain or repair land are allowed a deduction for any payments that they make and that relate to the maintenance and repairs by current section EO 5 (1). Current section EO 5 also directs that the deduction is allocated to the income year of payment, subject to a discretion for lessees to spread the deduction over the three preceding income years. The deduction is now allowed in this separate section in Part D (Deductions). This is consistent with Part B (Core provisions). The primary timing rule that the deduction is allocated to the income year in which the lessee makes payment is also included here. This is consistent with draft section BD 4 (2) (Allocation of deductions to particular income years). The timing rule allowing lessees to allocate the deduction to earlier income years is set out in a separate timing rule in Part E (Timing and quantifying rules). The rule is in draft section EK 18 (Payment by lessee for non- compliance with covenant for repair). DB 14 Lessors’ offsetting deduction: payments for non-compliance and change in use When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a)a lessor receives a payment for non-compliance with a covenant for repair that is counted income under section CC 2 (Payments for non-compliance with covenant for repair); and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DB – Specific rules for expenditure types 277 (b)in the income year in which the lessor receives the payment or in any of the following 4 income years,— (i)the lessor does not use the land to which the payment relates to derive counted income, but continues to own the land; and (ii)the lessor incurs expenditure in maintaining the land or in making repairs to improvements on the land, including painting and general maintenance; and (iii)the lessor would have been allowed a deduction if the land had been used for the purpose of deriving counted income; and (iv)a person is not allowed a deduction for the expenditure except under this section. Maintenance or repairs (2)The lessor is allowed a deduction in the income year in which the expenditure is incurred.

Current section EN 1 also identifies the payments for non-compliance as income, directs that the payments are recognised as income in the income year of receipt, and allows the spreading of the income. The deduction is now allowed in this separate section in Part D (Deductions). This is consistent with draft Part B (Core provisions).

The timing rule in current section EN 2 (3B), which directs that the deduction be spread when the corresponding income has been spread, has not been rewritten, as the income-spreading provision (the proviso to subsection (1) of current section EN 2) is itself obsolete and has not been rewritten.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DC – Employee or contractor expenditure 301 Eligibility (3)Employees must be eligible to participate equally in the scheme, that is, full-time permanent employees on an equal basis with every other full- time permanent employee, and, if the scheme applies to part-time employees and seasonal employees, part-time employees on an equal basis with every other part-time employee, and seasonal employees similarly with every other seasonal employee. Any minimum period of employment or service before employees are eligible to participate must not be more than 3 years’ full-time work or, for other employees, an accumulated period that is the equivalent of 3 years’ full-time work. Loans to employees (4)A loan to an employee to buy shares must be free of interest and other charges. If the loan is required to be a minimum amount, that amount must not be more than $624. Employees must be able to repay the loan by regular equal instalments at intervals of 1 month or less over a period of between 3 years and 5 years from the date of the loan, although they may choose to repay some or all of the loan before the due date for repayment. Shares held on trust (5)During the period of restriction, the trustee of the scheme must hold the shares in trust for the employee, and pay directly to the employee any dividends (which may not be put towards the repayment of any sum owed to the company or to the trustee). The dividends are treated as having been derived by the employee. The employee must not dispose of their rights or interests in the shares. When period of restriction ends (6)The following paragraphs apply when a period of restriction ends: (a)at the end of the period of restriction, the trustee must transfer the shares to the employee, unless the employee is no longer employed by the company.

Alternatively, at the option of the legal representative or former employee, the trustee must buy the shares at the market value on the date of purchase. The purchase is subject to the repayment of any outstanding loan under the scheme for the shares: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 302 DC – Employee or contractor expenditure (c)if the period of restriction ends because the employee ends their employment for any other reason, the trustee must buy the shares at the market value at the date on which the employee ended their employment, subject to the repayment of any outstanding loan under the scheme for the shares. Purchase price when trustee buys shares (7)If the trustee buys the shares in any of the circumstances in which employment is ended as described in subsection (6), the purchase price must not be more than the price paid for the shares by the employee. Withdrawal from scheme (8)An employee must be able to withdraw from the scheme on giving 3 months’ notice to the trustee. The employee is then treated for the purposes of the scheme as if they ended their employment with the company on the date the notice takes effect, and subsections (6)(c) and (7) apply. Hardship (9)With the employee’s agreement, a trustee may vary the terms of the repayment of a loan under the scheme, or may allow the employee to withdraw from the scheme as if they had ended their employment in the circumstances described in subsection (5), if the trustee is satisfied that the employee’s continued participation in the scheme would result in serious hardship.

Defined terms:amount, deduction, employee, employer, general limitation, general permission, superannuation scheme. Comment:Current section DF 1 ousts the general deductibility rule and, as a result, current section DF 2 is needed to permit the deduction specifically. Once the initial ouster is dispensed with for amounts that an employer pays to a fund, all that is required is a limitation preventing deduction if the employee’s rights are not secured. In contrast, however, a specific deduction provision is required for amounts that an employer sets aside as a fund because there is no expenditure (no amount passes from the employer to another person) and the general rules do not allow a deduction. In this case, a rule is required that the deduction is allowed provided the rights are secured.

DE 7 Logbook term When logbook term applies (1)A logbook term is a period to which the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle established by the logbook applies. The term lasts up to 3 years and starts and ends as described in subsections (2) and (3). Start of term (2)A logbook term starts on the date that is the latest of the following days: (a)the first day of the income year in which a person starts to keep a logbook: (b)the day that a person buys or acquires the motor vehicle (unless the vehicle is a replacement vehicle (see section DE 10)): (c)the day immediately after the last day of the previous logbook term: (d)a day that a person specifies. End of term (3)The logbook term ends on the date that is the earliest of the following days: (a)the day that a person disposes of the motor vehicle without replacing it: (b)the day that is 3 years after the first day of the income year in which the logbook term started: (c)a day that the Commissioner specifies under section DE 8: (d)a day that a person specifies.

DE 8 Inadequate logbook Non-representative logbook proportion (1)If the Commissioner considers that the proportion of business use recorded in a logbook does not, or does no longer, represent the average use of a motor vehicle for business purposes during an income year that falls within a logbook term, the Commissioner may,— (a) within the logbook term, direct a person to keep a further logbook and specify the period for keeping the logbook; or (b)if satisfied that the logbook is not representative, treat a person as not having kept a logbook that applies to the logbook term. Further logbook (2)If the Commissioner directs a person to keep a further logbook, and the proportion of business use calculated under that logbook is less by 20% (or more) than the proportion under the first logbook, the Commissioner may find that the first logbook either— (a)represented the average use of the motor vehicle for business purposes for only part of the logbook term; or (b)did not represent that use at all. First case: partly representative logbook (3)If subsection (2)(a) applies, the Commissioner may determine a date on which the application of the first logbook ended, and the further logbook applies to a new logbook term that starts on the day after that date. Second case: non-representative logbook (4)If subsection (2)(b) applies, the Commissioner may direct that the further logbook should apply for the logbook term to which the first logbook originally applied.

Origin:DH 3(4). Defined terms:business purposes, business use, motor vehicle. DE 10 Replacement vehicles For the purpose of establishing the proportion of business use of a motor vehicle, a replacement vehicle is treated in the same way as the vehicle it replaced if— (a)the logbook is likely to be representative of the average travel for business purposes and other purposes for the remainder of the logbook term; and (b)from the date of replacement, a person keeps a record of the total distance travelled by the replacement vehicle for each income year (or part of an income year) of the remaining logbook term.

Mileage rates DE 11 Mileage rate method Using mileage rates (1) If a person’s business travel is not more than 5,000 kilometres in an income year, they may use the mileage rate method to calculate the expenditure or loss on a motor vehicle that represents the proportion of business use of the motor vehicle. Calculating the mileage (2)Under the mileage rate method, the person must keep details of the business use of the motor vehicle, and calculate the mileage travelled for business purposes for the income year. The amount of the deduction under this method is found by multiplying the mileage rate by the distance that reflects the proportion of business use to total use of the vehicle for the income year.

No deduction (2)A person who uses a limited recourse loan in acquiring, producing, or marketing a film or a right in a film is not allowed a deduction under any section of this Act for revenue film expenditure or capital film expenditure under sections DS 6 to DS 9. Origin:(1) new. (2) new. Defined terms:capital film expenditure, deduction, feature film, film, film production expenditure, film reimbursement scheme, incurred, limited recourse loan, New Zealand, person, revenue film expenditure, right in a film. Comment:Current section GD 12 appears in a rewritten form in the consequential amendments in volume 3 together with draft section GC 11A (Non-market transactions to acquire rights in films), draft section GC 11B (Manipulation of arrangements to acquire rights in films), draft section GD 12A (Film production expenditure if payments postponed or contingent), and draft section GD 12B (Manipulation of arrangements to incur film production expenditure). DS 2 Acquiring rights in films Expenditure incurred in acquiring film right (1)A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure that they incur in acquiring a right in a film, if the film is completed (whether it is completed before, when, or after the film right is acquired). This section is overridden by sections DS 3 to DS 9. Allocation of deduction (2)The deduction is allocated under section EK 4 (Expenditure incurred in acquiring rights in feature films) or section EK 5 (Expenditure incurred in acquiring rights in films other than feature films). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DS – Film industry expenditure 353 Certain expenditure excluded (3)This section does not apply to expenditure that a person incurs in acquiring a right in a film if— (a) the person operates a television station, a network, or a cable television system, and the film right is mainly acquired to enable the film to be broadcast in New Zealand; or (b) the film is intended to be shown as an advertisement; or (c)the expenditure is film production expenditure. No other deductions (4)A person is not allowed a deduction if the film is not completed. Link with subpart DA (5)Subsection (1) overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. For subsection (1) amounts, subsection (4) overrides the general permission. Origin:(1) EO 3(1), (4), (5), (7). (2) new. (3) EO 3(1), (2), (9). (4) EO 3(1), (3). (5) new. Defined terms:amount, capital limitation, completed, deduction, film, film production expenditure, film right, general limitation, general permission, incurred, New Zealand, person, right in a film. Comment:The main change in this rewritten provision, compared with current section EO 3, is the removal of the cost of production element. This allows for the drafting of the provision to be significantly simplified. For example, the depreciation recovery provision in current section EO 3 (8), which relates only to film production, does not need to be retained in draft section DS 5, which now deals exclusively with the acquisition of film rights. DS 3 Film production expenditure Film production expenditure (1)A person is allowed a deduction for film production expenditure that they incur if the film is completed and the person has a right in the film on or before the film is completed. This section is overridden by sections DS 4 to DS 9. Reimbursed expenditure (2)If, before the film is completed, a person (person A) reimburses another person (person B) for film production expenditure that person B incurs, the reimbursement is treated as film production expenditure incurred by person A for the purposes of subsection (1). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 354 DS – Film industry expenditure Allocation of deduction (3)The deduction is allocated under section EK 6 (Film production expenditure for New Zealand films) or section EK 8 (Film production expenditure for films other than New Zealand films).

Defined terms:amount, capital limitation, completed, deduction, film, film production expenditure, general limitation, general permission, incurred, New Zealand, person, right in a film. Comment:The depreciation recovery provision in current section EO 4 (8) has been omitted, with reliance being placed instead on the general depreciation recovery provisions in subpart EF (Depreciation). This is preferable to the stand-alone approach in current section EO 4 (8). Also, current section EO 4 (8) is not consistent with self-assessment. DS 4 Clawback of deductions for film reimbursement schemes General rule (1)A person who disposes of property under a film reimbursement scheme must reduce the total deductions that they are or have been allowed under section DS 2 or section DS 3, or would have been allowed if this section did not exist, using the formula in section DS 5. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DS – Film industry expenditure 355 When rule does not apply (2)Subsection (1) does not apply to a deduction for expenditure excluded under section DZ 3 (Film reimbursement scheme: when clawback rule does not apply).

Defined terms:Commissioner, deduction, film reimbursement scheme, person, time bar. Comment:The incorporation of paragraph (b) of the current definition of ‘right’ in section OB 1 into the film expenditure provisions in draft section DS 5 and draft section DZ 3 (Film reimbursement scheme: when clawback rule does not apply) allows the drafting of this provision to be simplified—for example, there is no need for a provision equivalent to current section EO 4A (2)(a)(ii). The definition of ‘film reimbursement scheme’ now appears in section OB 1 (see the amendments to section OB 1 (Definitions) in volume 3). DS 5 Calculation of clawback amounts on film reimbursement schemes Formula (1)When section DS 4 (1) applies, the total deductions must be reduced to the amount calculated using the formula— total deductions – total consideration. Definition of items in formula (2)In the formula,— (a) total deductions is the total amount of deductions that the person is or has been allowed under section DS 2 or section DS 3 or would have been allowed if section DS 4 did not exist: (b) total consideration is the total amount of consideration for the disposal of the property that the person derives and that is not film income. Order of reduced deductions for previous income years (3)In subsection (1), deductions must be reduced in the same order as they would have been allowed. Origin:(1) EO 4A(3), (4). (2) EO 4A(3). (3) EO 4A(5). Defined terms:amount, deduction, derived, film income, film reimbursement scheme, income year, person. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 356 DS – Film industry expenditure Comment:The calculation of the clawback amount has been simplified. It applies to the total amount of the deductions allowed at any time. DS 6 Deductions for film expenditure if amount not at risk Amount of deduction (1)A person who uses a limited recourse loan in acquiring, producing, or marketing a film or a right in a film must subtract, under section DS 7, the amount of the loan from the deductions for revenue film expenditure and for capital film expenditure that the person would be allowed under this Act if this section did not exist. Amount of deduction on repayment of loan (2)The person is allowed, under section DS 8, a deduction that is equal to the amount of any repayment by them of part or all of the limited recourse loan, but not more than the total amount subtracted under subsection (1). Link with subpart DA (3)Subsection (1) overrides the general permission Subsection (2) supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation. The other general limitations still apply to subsection (2) amounts. Origin:(1) DK 1(2), (3). (2) DK 1(5). (3) new. Defined terms:amount, capital film expenditure, capital limitation, deduction, film, general limitation, general permission, limited recourse loan, person, revenue film expenditure, right in a film. Comment:This section now explicitly applies to revenue-type losses (that is, losses covered by current section BD 2 (1)(b)). This would seem to be sensible given that section DS 3 also includes such losses and that section DS 3 is subject to section DS 6. It may be argued that the limited recourse loan provisions constitute a timing rule rather than a deductions rule. However, our view is that, because these provisions artificially subtract and allow deductions (rather than simply defer deductions for actual expenditure), their primary function is to limit deductions (unless the limited recourse loan is repaid) and the allocation function is secondary. DS 7 Method of subtracting loan amounts from deductions Order in which loan amounts subtracted from deductions (1)When section DS 6 (1) applies, the amount of the loan made in an income year must be subtracted from the deductions that the person would otherwise be allowed for expenditure of the following type and in the following order: (a)from deductions for revenue film expenditure that the person incurred in a previous income year and did not pay on or before Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions DS – Film industry expenditure 357 the start of the income year, if the loan was borrowed to pay for the expenditure: (b)from the deductions for capital film expenditure that the person incurred in a previous income year and did not pay on or before the start of the income year, if the loan was borrowed to pay for the expenditure: (c)from deductions for revenue film expenditure that the person incurred in the income year: (d)from deductions for capital film expenditure that the person incurred in the income year. Cumulative subtractions (2)The application of section DS 6 (1) is cumulative, so that— (a)the loan amount must be subtracted in each case from the total amount of the deductions that the person would otherwise have been allowed for each type of expenditure reduced by any previous subtractions under that section; and (b)the order in subsection (1) applies accordingly. Origin:(1) DK 1(4). (2) DK 1(4). Defined terms:amount, capital film expenditure, deduction, income year, incurred, person, revenue film expenditure. DS 8 Deductions for repayments Order of deductions for repayment (1)When section DS 6 (2) applies, the deduction that the person is allowed in relation to the repayment must be for expenditure of the same type and deductions must be in the same order as that for which the person was not allowed a deduction under section DS 6 (1) in any previous income year. Cumulative application (2)The application of section DS 6 (2) is cumulative, so that— (a)the amount of the deduction that the person may be allowed under that subsection for each type of expenditure is the total amount that the person was not allowed for that type under section DS 6 (1) in any previous income year, reduced by any amounts that the person was allowed as deductions under section DS 6 (2) in any previous income year; and (b)the order in subsection (1) applies accordingly. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part D: Deductions 358 DS – Film industry expenditure Repayment of a loan with another limited recourse loan (3)A loan is treated as not having been repaid for the purposes of section DS 6 (2) to the extent to which a limited recourse loan is used directly or indirectly to repay the loan.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part B: Core provisions B – Core provisions12 Origin:BC 4. Defined terms:corresponding income year, counted income, gross income, person, tax year. Comment:Note the replacement of the term ‘annual gross income’ with ‘gross income’ and the introduction of the term ‘counted income’ to cross refer to the rules in draft section BD 1. The use of the term ‘gross’, together with the use of the term ‘gross deduction’, the use in the operative income- defining provisions of appropriate references to ‘gross amounts' (if necessary), and the scheme of the core provisions should be sufficient to eliminate any arguments that the global/gross model is being reversed. Note also the proposed use of ‘person’, rather than ‘taxpayer’, as a general rule, to eliminate the apparently random use of each term and because, sometimes, the relevant ‘person’ is not literally a ‘taxpayer’. However, in conjunction with any review of, or adoption of comprehensive rules to deal with, joint ownership situations, it will be necessary to consider the detailed content of the current definitions of ‘person’ and ‘taxpayer’ and to clarify the extent to which the Act applies to unincorporated bodies. BC 3 Gross deduction A person’s gross deduction for a tax year is the total of their deductions that are allocated to the corresponding income year. Origin:BC 5. Defined terms:corresponding income year, deduction, gross deduction, person, tax year. Comment:‘Gross deduction’ replaces ‘annual allowable deductions’ for the purposes of symmetry.

Income equals deductions (2)If, for a tax year, a person’s gross income equals their gross deduction, their net income for the year is zero. Deductions more than income (3)If, for a tax year, a person’s gross deduction is more than their gross income, the difference is their net loss for the year, and their net income for the year is zero.

Comment:Payments for non-performance of covenants to maintain or repair under leases of land are identified as income in current section EN 1 (2) (Payments received for non-compliance with covenant to repair). Current section EN 1 also directs that such amounts are recognised as income in the income year of receipt, but allows recipients to spread the income over the subsequent 5 income years. Payments for non-performance with maintenance and repair covenants are now identified as income in this separate section in Part C (Income). This is consistent with the core provisions. The timing rule which allows recipients to allocate the income to subsequent income years is set out in separate timing rules in draft Part E (Timing and quantifying rules).

CD 3 Transfers of value generally Transfer of value (1)A transfer of value from a company to a person is a dividend if— (a)the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company, under the rules in section CD 5; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 62 CD – Income from equity (b)none of the exclusions in sections CD 12 to CD 24 apply to the transfer. Calculation rules (2)The rules in sections CD 25 to CD 29 apply for the purposes of calculating the amount of the dividend. Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (1A), (3), (10). (2) new. Defined terms:company, dividend, person, transfer of value. Comment:This broad conceptual approach reflects the wording in the discussion document Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Parts C, D and E. It operates in conjunction with the rules to define a transfer of value, in draft section CD 4, and to define when a transfer is caused by a shareholding relationship, in draft section CD 5. Also, see the expanded definitions of ‘company’, ‘share’, and ‘shareholder’ in section OB 1 (Definitions) dealing with such matters as unit trusts and group investment funds. There is scope for debate about whether the shareholding should be ‘a’ cause or ‘the’ cause. CD 4 What is a transfer of value? General test (1) A transfer of value from a company to a person occurs when— (a)the company provides money or money’s worth to the person; and (b)if the person provides any money or money’s worth to the company under the same arrangement, the market value of what the company provides is more than the market value of what the person provides. Release of debt (2)A transfer of value from a company to a person also occurs if the person is released from an obligation to pay money to the company, either by agreement or by operation of law. Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (1A), (3), (10). (2) CF 2(1)(b). Defined terms:company, person, transfer of value. Comment:This broad conceptual approach sets aside a lot of the historical complexity of the Act’s current wording. Particular points to note are— (a)The reference to credits and so on in current section CF 2 (1)(a) is intended to be covered by the term ‘provides’ in draft subsection (1). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 63 (b)The making available by a shareholder of property to a company at an over-value is covered, whereas arguably it was not under current section CF 2 (1) (unless covered by current section CF 2 (1)(a) or (d)). (c) The inclusion of the provision of services under the new concept of transfer of value is also arguably a law change but any other approach would be illogical in policy terms. (Provision by a person of services to the company at an over-value may be covered by current section CF 2 (1)(a), in any event.). CD 5 When is a transfer caused by a shareholding relationship? General test (1)A transfer of value from a company to a person (the recipient) is caused by a shareholding in the company if— (a)the recipient— (i)holds shares in the company; or (ii)is associated with a shareholder; or (iii)is the trustee of a trust, and a beneficiary of the trust is either a shareholder or the spouse of a shareholder; and (b)the company makes the transfer because those shares are held by the relevant shareholder. One indication that test met (2)One indication that a transfer is caused by a shareholding is if the terms of the arrangement that results in the transfer are different from the terms on which the company would enter into a similar arrangement if no shareholding were involved. Past or future shareholding (3)When subsection (1) is applied, it does not matter whether the shares are held before or after the transfer of value occurs. Deductible distributions of producer boards (4)Despite subsection (1), a transfer of value by a statutory producer board to a member is not caused by a shareholding if— (a)the transfer is a cash distribution; and (b)the distribution is a deduction under section HF 1 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) or another provision of this Act; and (c)the board does not choose to treat the distribution as a dividend under section ME 30 (Statutory producer board may determine to attach imputation credit to certain distributions). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 64 CD – Income from equity Deductible distributions of cooperative companies (5)Despite subsection (1), a transfer of value by a cooperative company to a shareholder is not caused by a shareholding if— (a)the transfer is a cash distribution; and (b)the distribution is a deduction under section HF 1 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) or another provision of this Act; and (c)the company does not choose to treat the distribution as a dividend under section ME 35 (Cooperative company may make annual determination to attach imputation credit to certain distributions). Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(k); new. (2) CF 2(2). (3) CF 2(1)(g). (4) CF 2(1)(l). (5) CF 2(1)(l). Defined terms:associated person, company, person, share, shareholder, statutory producer board, transfer of value, trustee. Comment:Draft subsection (1) incorporates the associated person tests in the current section CF 2 (1)(k). Draft subsections (4) and (5) appear to be necessary clarifications, given that both producer boards and cooperative companies are companies for all purposes of the Act, and it is currently only by implication that the section HF 1 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) deduction overrides current section CF 2. CD 6 Bonus issues in lieu of dividend Bonus issue in lieu (1)A bonus issue in lieu is a dividend. Amount of dividend (2)The amount of the dividend is the money or money’s worth offered as an alternative, minus any resident withholding tax payable in relation to the dividend. Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(f). (2) CF 2(6)(a). Defined terms:amount, bonus issue in lieu, dividend, pay, resident withholding tax. CD 7 Elections to make bonus issue a dividend Bonus issue dividend if election made (1)A bonus issue is a dividend if the company chooses under this section to treat the bonus issue as a dividend. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 65 Form of election (2)A company chooses to treat a bonus issue as a dividend by— (a)resolving, when it makes the bonus issue, that it is a dividend; and (b)resolving, when it makes the bonus issue, the amount to be treated as a dividend, which must be more than zero; and (c)giving notice to the Commissioner under section 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 of the election and the amount. Amount of dividend (3)The amount of the dividend is the amount chosen by the company. Origin:(1) CF 2(1)(f). (2) CF 8. (3) CF 2(6)(b). Defined terms:amount, bonus issue, Commissioner, company, dividend, notice. Comment:Section 63 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 may need to be reviewed, as it seems unlikely that it applies in practice to all non-taxable bonus issues. CD 8 Notional distributions of producer boards and cooperative companies Notional distribution of producer board (1)A notional distribution of a statutory producer board is a dividend if the board determines to attach an imputation credit to the notional distribution under section ME 30 (Statutory producer board may determine to attach imputation credit to certain distributions). Amount of dividend (2)The amount of the dividend is calculated under section ME 33 (Notional distribution deemed to be dividend). Notional distribution of cooperative company (3)A notional distribution of a cooperative company is a dividend if the company determines to attach an imputation credit to the notional distribution under section ME 35 (Cooperative company may make annual determination to attach imputation credit to certain distributions). Amount of dividend (4)The amount of the dividend is calculated under section ME 38 (Notional distribution deemed to be dividend).

CD 9 Tax credits linked to dividends Imputation and dividend withholding payment credits (1)The amount of a dividend is increased by— (a)an imputation credit attached to the dividend; or (b)a dividend withholding payment credit attached to the dividend. Limit to application of subsection (1) (2)Subsection (1) does not apply in— (a)Part L (Credits), except for subpart LE (Non-resident investors); or (b)Part M (Tax payments); or (c)Part N (Withholding taxes, and taxes on income of others). Foreign tax credits (3)If a person is entitled to a tax credit under a double tax agreement when they derive a dividend, the amount of the dividend is increased by the tax credit. Notional foreign tax credits (4)If a person derives a dividend and the company fails to deduct from it the tax that must be deducted under the law of a foreign country, the dividend is increased by a notional foreign tax credit amount under section LC 7 (Dividend paid without deduction in full of foreign tax). Foreign tax refunds (5)When a person who has derived a dividend from outside New Zealand also derives a refund of income tax of a foreign country, the dividend is increased by the amount of the refund if— (a)the company paying the dividend was entitled to deduct the tax from the dividend; and (b)the person was not personally liable to pay the tax.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 67 Defined terms:amount, company, dividend, dividend withholding payment credit, double tax agreement, foreign tax, imputation credit, income tax, New Zealand, person, tax. Comment:Generally, current sections CF 6, CF 7, and parts of subpart LC seem to involve repetition, overlap, and anachronistic language. There is a need to revisit a significant part of the existing language. Draft subsection (2) attempts to clarify the places in the Act where the ‘dividend’ does not include the credit. It needs, ideally, to be made more specific. Draft subsection (3) aims to cover current section CF 6 (2) and (3). The reference specifically to the United Kingdom in current section CF 6 (2)(a) is omitted as the United Kingdom double tax agreement now covers the situation. Current section CF 6 (3) is omitted as it duplicates, but in a narrower form, current section CF 6 (2)(b). It is suggested that section LC 6 should also be reviewed for consistency with this section and the general tax credit rules in the Act. There is a query as to whether draft subsection (3) should apply only to credits that are not standard withholding tax credits. The latter would seem already to be included in the taxable dividend under general principles as income dealt with on a person’s behalf. Arguably, in any event, draft subsection (3) should apply only to amounts that are in fact either withholdings or refunds actually received from the foreign country. Draft subsection (4) is an acknowledgment that section LC 7 can apply to increase a dividend amount. However, it is suggested that section LC 7 be repealed as being obsolete and not applied in practice. Does draft subsection (5) overlap with draft subsection (3)? Current section CF 6 (5) is shifted to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (see the consequential amendments in volume 3). CD 10 Non-cash benefits of shareholder-employees or directors Election under section CX 22: residual category fringe benefits (1)A non-cash benefit provided by a company to an employee is a dividend if— (a)the benefit is an unclassified benefit under section CX 23 (Unclassified benefits); and (b)the employee is a shareholder in the company; and (c)the company chooses to treat the benefit as a dividend under section CX 22 (2) (Benefits provided to employees who are shareholders or investors). Non-executive directors’ specific fringe benefits (2)A non-cash benefit provided by a company to a non-executive director of the company is a dividend if— (a)the benefit is not an unclassified benefit under section CX 23 (Unclassified benefits) but instead is one of the specified fringe benefits under sections CX 8 to CX 20; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 68 CD – Income from equity (b)the director is a shareholder in the company; and (c)the benefit is provided solely because the director is a non- executive director of the company. Other shareholder-employee benefits not dividends (3)In any other case of a non-cash benefit provided by a company to a person who is both an employee and a shareholder, the benefit is not a dividend if— (a)the application of section CX 22 (1) (Benefits provided to employees who are shareholders or investors) means it is a fringe benefit; and (b)section CD 20 accordingly excludes it from being a dividend. ‘Non-executive director’ defined (4)In this section, non-executive director means a person whose only services to the company as an employee are the formal occupation of the role of director and compliance with the associated statutory obligations. Origin:(1) CI 2A(2). (2) CF 2(1A); CI 2A(1). (3) new. (4) OB 1 ‘non-executive director shareholder’. Defined terms:company, director, dividend, non-executive director, person, shareholder, unclassified benefit. Comment:This section tries to clarify the way in which current sections CF 2 (1A), CF 3 (1)(g), CI 2 (1) to (3), and CI 2A interact to ‘tie-break’ the potential circularity between fringe benefit treatment and dividend treatment. There may need to be a similar ‘tie-break’ for cash benefits. The proposed definition of ‘employee’ (see the amendments to section OB 1 (Definitions) in volume 3) may need amending to specify that draft paragraph (d) applies for this purpose. CD 11 Attributed repatriations from controlled foreign companies Attributed repatriation is a dividend (1)Attributed repatriation of a person who has an income interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC) is a dividend. Amount of dividend (2)The amount of the dividend is calculated under sections CD 32 to CD 39. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 69 Allocation of dividend (3)The dividend is treated as having been paid by the CFC to the person, and as having been derived by the person,— (a)six months after the end of the relevant accounting period of the CFC if the person is a company for which the dividend is exempt income under section CW 9 (Dividend derived by company from offshore); and (b) at the end of the accounting period in any other case. Dividend treated as derived while person New Zealand resident (4)The dividend of a person who has ceased to be a New Zealand resident is treated as being derived while the person is a New Zealand resident. Origin:(1) CF 2(16)(a). (2) new. (3) CF 2(16)(b). (4) CG 8(13).

CD 12 Returns of capital: off-market share cancellations When this section applies (1)This section applies if a company pays an amount to a shareholder because of the off-market cancellation of a share in the company (other than on liquidation of the company). Ordering rule if bright line test met (2)The amount is not a dividend to the extent to which it is less than or equal to the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the ordering rule, if— (a)one of the bright line tests in subsection (3) is met; and (b)the company is not an unlisted trust that has chosen the slice rule for the share under subsection (4); and (c)the anti-avoidance rule in subsection (6) does not apply. Bright line tests (3)The bright line tests referred to in subsection (2)(a) are as follows: (a)the cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation that results in a fifteen percent capital reduction for the company: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 70 CD – Income from equity (b)the cancellation is part of a pro rata cancellation that involves a ten percent capital reduction and the Commissioner has given a clearance notice under subsection (8): (c)the cancellation is not part of a pro rata cancellation and results in the shareholder suffering a fifteen percent interest reduction: (d)the company is an unlisted trust and the cancellation is not part of a pro rata cancellation: (e)the share is a non-participating redeemable share. Unlisted trust choosing slice rule (4)If the company is an unlisted trust, it may issue a share on terms that the ordering rule does not apply and that instead the slice rule applies to the cancellation. If this happens, the amount paid is not a dividend to the extent to which it is less than or equal to the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the slice rule (but still subject to the anti- avoidance rule in subsection (6)). Calculation concession for foreign unlisted widely-held trusts (5)If a company is an unlisted widely-held trust not resident in New Zealand and a shareholder cannot obtain sufficient information to calculate the available subscribed capital per share under the ordering rule, the share is treated as if it were issued under subsection (4) on terms that the slice rule applies and the available subscribed capital under the slice rule is equal to the amount paid for the issue of the share. Overriding anti-avoidance rule (6)Neither subsection (2) nor subsection (4) excludes an amount paid by a company on cancellation of a share from being a dividend if any part of the payment is in lieu of the payment of a dividend. Factors relevant in applying anti-avoidance rule (7)For the purposes of applying subsection (6), the following factors must be considered: (a)the nature and amount of dividends paid by the company before or after the cancellation; and (b)the issue of shares in the company after the cancellation; and (c)the expressed purpose or purposes of the cancellation; and (d)any other relevant factor. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 71 Commissioner notifying view (8)If the Commissioner is satisfied that no part of a payment on cancellation of a share is in lieu of the payment of a dividend, the Commissioner may give notice to the company that the Commissioner does not regard subsection (6) as applicable to the cancellation. Definitions for this section (9)In this section,— counted associate means — (a)a person associated with the shareholder other than merely by virtue of being a relative; or (b)a person associated with the shareholder merely by virtue of being a spouse or minor child of the shareholder, or a trustee for a spouse or minor child of the shareholder fifteen percent capital reduction means the circumstance in which the total amount paid by the company on account of the cancellation (or on account of any other pro rata cancellation of participating shares in the company occurring at the same time) is at least 15% of the market value of all participating shares in the company at the time the company first gave notice to shareholders of the cancellation fifteen percent interest reduction means the circumstance in which, immediately after and as a result of the cancellation (together with any other cancellation of participating shares in the company occurring at the same time),— (a)the total direct voting interests in the company of the shareholder and any counted associates is not more than 85% of their total direct voting interests in the company immediately before the cancellation; and (b)if at the time of the cancellation a market value circumstance exists, the total direct market value interests in the company of the shareholder and any counted associates is not more than 85% of their total direct market value interests immediately before the cancellation non-participating redeemable share means a share that meets the following conditions: (a)the share is issued, under the company’s constitution or establishing legislation, on terms that involve the share being required or allowed to be redeemed or repaid before the company is liquidated; and Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 72 CD – Income from equity (b)the share is— (i)a redeemable share under section 66 of the Companies Act 1955, section 68 of the Companies Act 1993, or an equivalent provision of foreign law; or (ii)issued under Part 1A of the Dairy Board Act 1961 or one of New Zealand’s Acts relating to cooperative companies; or (iii)subject to section FC 1 (Floating rate of interest on debentures) or section FC 2 (Interest on debentures issued in substitution for shares); or (iv)a unit in a unit trust that is not a widely-held trust; and (c)the share is either a fixed rate share or a share for which the amount payable on cancellation is not more than the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the slice rule; and (d)the shareholder does not have shareholder decision-making rights in relation to the share except— (i)a protective right; or (ii)if the company is the New Zealand Dairy Board or is subject to one of New Zealand’s Acts relating to cooperative companies participating share means a share that is not a non-participating redeemable share protective right means a shareholder decision-making right that— (a)arises only if the shareholder’s position may be altered to the shareholder’s detriment or if the company defaults on its obligations under the terms of the share; and (b)is granted to the shareholder only to assist the shareholder to prevent the alteration or to remedy the default; and (c)when the share issued, is not expected to arise ten percent capital reduction means the circumstance in which the total amount paid by the company on account of the cancellation (or paid on account of any other pro rata cancellation of participating shares in the company occurring at the same time) is at least 10% of the market value of all participating shares in the company at the time the company first gave notice to shareholders of the cancellation unlisted trust means a unit trust or group investment fund, the units or interests in which are not quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange.

Comment:Including non-participating redeemable shares as one of the bright line tests in draft subsection (3) is done to simplify the drafting. It seems debatable whether the additional requirements in draft subsection (3)(a) to (c) for there to be or not be a pro rata cancellation are necessary. CD 13 Ordering rule and slice rule Ordering rule (1) Under the ordering rule, the available subscribed capital per share is calculated for a share using the formula— available subscribed capital of class shares being cancelled of class. Definition of items in formula (2)In the ordering rule formula,— (a) available subscribed capital of class is the available subscribed capital, of all shares of the same class as the share, at the relevant time for the calculation: (b) shares being cancelled of class is the number of shares of the same class as the share (including the share) being cancelled at the time.

CD 26 Calculation of dividend amount of property made available How section applies (1)This section applies to determine the amount of a dividend that arises under section CD 3 because a company makes property available to a person. Amount calculated quarterly (2)The amount of the dividend is calculated for each quarter during which the property is made available. Date when amount is treated as paid (3)The amount of the dividend calculated for a quarter is treated as being paid by the company to the person and as being derived by the person 6 months after the end of the company’s income year. However, if the company gives notice to the shareholder on an earlier date of the amount of the dividend for that quarter, the amount is treated as being paid and derived on that earlier date instead. Using FBT rules (4)Unless the property made available is a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter is the value of the fringe benefit for that quarter calculated under the FBT rules as if— (a)making the property available were the provision of a fringe benefit by the company to an employee in relation to employment, despite anything in sections CX 8 to CX 34; and (b)the company were not to choose to pay fringe benefit tax on an income year basis under section ND 14 (Payment of fringe benefit tax on income year basis for shareholder-employees). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 85 Using difference from benchmark rate (5)If the property made available is a loan, the amount of the dividend for each quarter is the excess (if any) of interest, calculated for the quarter on the basis of the daily balance of the loan and the benchmark rate specified in subsections (6) to (8), over the actual amount of interest accruing on the loan in the quarter. However, the company may choose instead to calculate the dividend as the excess of the benchmark interest rate amount over the amount of income accruing to the company in the quarter calculated under the yield to maturity method. Benchmark rate: FBT rate for certain loans (6)For the purposes of subsection (5), the benchmark rate of interest is the prescribed rate of interest (the rate generally applicable under the FBT rules) if— (a)all amounts payable to the company for the loan are expressed in New Zealand dollars; and (b)either the borrower is not a company or, if the borrower is another company, the company making the loan notifies the Commissioner that this subsection is to apply to the loan and the quarter. Setting benchmark rate (7)For the purposes of subsection (5), the benchmark rate is the rate set by the Commissioner if— (a)all amounts payable to the company in relation to the loan are payable in a single currency other than New Zealand dollars; and (b)the Commissioner has set a benchmark rate for that currency; and (c)either the borrower is not a company or, if the borrower is another company, the company making the loan notifies the Commissioner that this subsection is to apply to the loan and the quarter. Default benchmark rate (8)For the purposes of subsection (5), if neither subsection (6) nor subsection (7) applies, the benchmark rate of interest is a market rate determined at the end of the quarter for a loan made on the same terms between persons at arm’s length. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 86 CD – Income from equity Daily loan balance: certain repayments backdated (9)For the purposes of subsection (5), in determining the daily balance of a loan during an income year, an amount repaid during the year is treated as having been applied in repayment of the loan at the start of the company’s income year or, if later, the day the loan was made, if— (a)the amount is repaid by applying any salary, wages, extra pay, dividends, or interest payable by the company to the borrower; and (b)the amount payable by the company is income of the borrower for the income year or a previous year; and (c)the amount payable by the company is payable without any tax deduction under the PAYE rules, the RWT rules, or the NRWT rules. Daily loan balance: company nominating amount (10)Subject to subsection (9), for the purposes of subsection (5), the daily balance of the loan for an income year is treated as being equal to the notional balance chosen under subsection (11) by the company making the loan if— (a)the borrower is a company; and (b)the loan is a variable principal debt instrument; and (c)the company making the loan notifies the Commissioner that this subsection applies for the loan and the income year; and (d)the amount of the dividend calculated as a result for the loan, the borrower, and the income year is not more than 30% greater or less than the amount that would be calculated if this section did not apply. Notional balance options (11)The notional balance referred to in subsection (10) is whichever of the following is chosen by the company making the loan and notified to the Commissioner: (a)the average of the outstanding balances of the loan at the end of each month in the company’s income year: (b)the average of— (i)the outstanding balance of the loan at the start of the income year or the first time during the year at which the loan exists, whichever is later; and (ii)the outstanding balance of the loan at the end of the income year or the last time during the income year at which the loan exists, whichever is earlier. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 87 Notice generally made by tax return (12)Reference in this section to a company notifying the Commissioner is a reference to either— (a) a notice given to the Commissioner with the company’s return of income for the relevant income year; or (b) if no return is filed, a notice given by the date on which a return would be required to be filed for the income year if a return had been required. No double counting of attributed repatriation dividends (13)No amount of dividend arises under section CD 3 as a result of any difference between the interest (if any) payable by a person to a controlled foreign company (CFC) in an accounting period of the CFC under a loan and the benchmark rate of interest specified in subsections (6) to (8) if— (a)the outstanding balance of the loan at the end of the account period is taken into account under sections CD 33 to CD 39 in calculating the New Zealand repatriation amount of the CFC for the accounting period; and (b)as a result, the person derives a dividend under section CD 11. Subsection (13) does not apply if loan disregarded (14)Subsection (13) does not apply to the extent to which the loan is a loan to which: (a)section CD 37 (11) applies, meaning that the loan is disregarded for the accounting period; or (b)section CZ 10 (4) (Transitional relief for calculation of attributed repatriation dividends) applies, meaning that the loan is effectively disregarded for the accounting period.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 96 CD – Income from equity Returns amount: shares cancelled on amalgamation (22)If shares in an amalgamated company held by an amalgamating company are cancelled on the amalgamation, the returns amount included in calculating the available subscribed capital amount of a share in the amalgamated company that is of the same class as the cancelled shares is increased by the amount calculated using the formula— cancelled shares x asc per share. Definition of items in formula (23)In the formula,— (a) cancelled shares is the number of cancelled shares: (b) asc per share is the available subscribed capital per share calculated under the slice rule of each cancelled share immediately before the amalgamation.

Comment:Various related definitions from current sections OB 1 and CF 3 (14) are reunited. These provisions include several corrections. In draft subsection (13)(d), the words ‘in addition to issuing shares in the acquiring company’ replace the current section CF 3(14) reference to ‘which is not in the form of shares in the acquired company’. The latter words seem not to make any logical sense and appear to have been an error made in 1994. To rectify another error made in 1994, draft subsection (24) now applies for the purposes of defining available subscribed capital, whereas it does not in current section CF 3 (14). In draft subsection (26), the current reference to crediting the amount in the books of another company has been omitted as it seems unnecessary.

Capital gains amount: amalgamated company inheriting gain of amalgamating company (8)An amalgamated company is treated as deriving a capital gain amount at the time of the amalgamation equal to a capital gain amount of an amalgamating company to the extent to which— (a)the amalgamating company ceases to exist on the amalgamation; and (b)the amalgamating company’s capital gain amount was available for distribution at the time and was not distributed to anyone other than the amalgamated company. Capital losses amount: when a capital loss arises (9)For the purposes of this section, a company incurs a capital loss if it disposes of capital property for an amount of consideration less than the cost of the property to the company. The capital loss amount is the deficit. No gains or losses in related party transactions (10)Subject to subsection (11), no capital gain amount is derived or capital loss amount is incurred by a company after 31 March 1988 on disposing of property under an arrangement with a related person. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income CD – Income from equity 101 Close companies liquidations not subject to subsection (10) (11)Subsection (10) does not apply if— (a)the company is a close company; and (b)the related person is not a company; and (c)the disposal is on liquidation of the company. Reinvested exempt dividends (12)When a capital gain amount, a capital loss amount, or the cost of capital property is determined, the cost of any shares subscribed for by the company in another company does not include any consideration for the subscribed shares that is excluded from the available subscribed capital of the other company under section CD 30 (7)(b) or (8) (which relate to reinvestment of tax exempt dividends).

Look-through interposed companies (16)For the purposes of subsection (14)(e), if shares or voting rights in a company are owned or controlled by another company, a look-through approach must be applied, meaning that— (a)the shares or voting rights are treated as if owned or controlled by the shareholders in the other company; and (b)if a shareholder in the other company is a company, that shareholder’s portion of the shares or voting rights are treated as if owned or controlled by the shareholders in the shareholder company. The look-through approach must be applied in the same way to any chain of companies, whatever the length of the chain. ‘Capital property’ defined (17)In this section, capital property means property of the company that is not revenue account property.

Comment:With regard to draft subsection (2)(c), as recognised at the time of the 1994 company law reforms, the concept of ‘available for distribution’ is vague and places reliance on a company’s accounting procedures (if any) for distinguishing capital gain amounts and identifying when they may previously have been distributed. However, the only obvious alternative is to have a detailed set of ordering rules. The formula in the current definition of excess return amount has been made much longer and uses more variables. However, this simply reflects the fact that the current definition includes some necessary calculation steps in the narrative. Draft subsection (3) is intended to prevent a negative amount arising if the available subscribed capital exceeds the amount received. Currently, this is achieved by the opening words of the definition which refer only to the ‘excess’. However, note that it would be possible for (capital asset – cost) to be negative, whereas currently item e of the formula cannot be as it is only the excess of capital asset over cost and losses. Arguably, a negative result is not inappropriate, that is, if there are unrealised undistributed capital losses, these should offset realised capital gains. With regard to draft subsection (5), it would be preferable to have one simple set of rules for offset of capital loss amounts which could fit into the formula, rather than two separate rules in this subsection and in item ‘capital losses’ of the formula. The only reason for separate specialised rules is that both current section CF 3 (10) and item (e)(ii) of the definition of ‘excess return amount’ apply only to certain specified preceding income years. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 104 CD – Income from equity Draft subsection (7) replicates old section 3 (7) and the definition of ‘capital gain amount’ in section OB 1. It links into the ‘capital property’ definition – see draft subsection (17). Arguably, these provisions need to be rewritten fully anyway, ideally adopting a ‘gross-gross’ format. It would be preferable to omit the reference to 31 March 1988 and make draft subsection (7)(a) and (b) generally applicable. The reference in draft subsection (7) to the Income Tax Amendment Act 2002 is a reference to the Act that will implement the rewrite of Parts A to E. Ideally, draft subsection (14), and the following two related subsections, should be repealed. Instead of draft subsection (10) referring to a ‘related person’ of the company, there should just be a reference to ‘associated person’, probably just using the standard definition of associated person in the Act. The current concept of ‘related person’ was introduced in 1982 as an anti-avoidance measure.

Comment:Current section CB 2 (1)(c) exempts personal services income earned by visitors to New Zealand if the visit ‘does not exceed a period of 92 days’. This draft section makes clear that the day of arrival and the day of departure each counts as a whole day for the purpose of calculating the 92-day period. The change makes the provision consistent with current section OE 1 (4) (Determination of residence of person other than a company), which directs part days to be included when calculating the 183-day period for residency, and is a clarification proposed in issues paper 1, page 6.

Defined terms:amount, company, derived, employer, exempt income, New Zealand, non- resident, non-resident entertainer, person. Comment:Current section CB 2 (1)(a)(ii) denies exempt status to a visiting non- resident entertainer if the activity or performance occurs under the programme of an overseas foundation, trust, or other organisation that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder. However, the policy underlying that wording is defeated if any person, not just a proprietor, member, or shareholder, is able to obtain a private pecuniary profit. The class ‘any proprietor, member or shareholder’ has therefore been widened to ‘any person’ in draft Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part C: Income 204 CW – Exempt income subsection (1)(b)(ii). This change was proposed in issues paper 1, page 5. The qualifier ‘directly or indirectly’ has also been added, as this is also consistent with the underlying policy.

The draft provision makes clear that the amounts intended to be exempted are amounts which a local authority receives as a trustee. This clarification was proposed in issues paper 2, page 2. A reference to airport companies in current section CB 3 (b)(ii)(B) has been obsolete since July 2000, when section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974 ceased to exclude airport companies from the definition of 'local authority trading enterprise' in that section.

However, the policy underlying that wording is defeated if any person, not just a proprietor, member, or shareholder, is able to obtain a private pecuniary profit.

Adjustment to deduction (3) When the opening value of trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements in total for an income year is more than the closing value, the deduction that a person is allowed is adjusted by an amount equal to the total of the amounts calculated separately for trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements using the formula— opening value – closing value.

Comment:This provision adds all the valuations of various forms of stock, including excepted financial arrangements, from subparts EC, ED, and EE. The resulting net change in value is treated as either income or a deduction depending on whether the aggregate closing value exceeds the aggregate opening value, or vice versa. EB 2 Other revenue account property When this section applies (1) This section applies to revenue account property that is not— (a) trading stock valued under subpart EC (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock)): (b) livestock valued under subpart ED (Valuation of livestock): (c) an excepted financial arrangement valued under subpart EE (Valuation of excepted financial arrangements): (d) a financial arrangement valued under subpart EH (Financial arrangements rules): Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EB – Matching rules: revenue account property and prepayments 417 (e)a specified lease or a lease to which section EK 17 (Payment by lessee under personal property and operating leases) applies: (f)a film or a right in a film: (g)property that arises as a result of petroleum development expenditure or petroleum exploration expenditure.

Defined terms:amount, deduction, derived, excepted financial arrangement, film, financial arrangement, income, income year, lease, person, petroleum development expenditure, petroleum exploration expenditure, revenue account property, right in a film, specified lease, trading stock. Comment:Livestock and excepted financial arrangements have been added to the items included in subsection (1) as they have been separated from trading stock. Accordingly, current section EF 2 (1A), relating to excepted financial arrangements, has not been replicated. To clarify the relationship between the current sections EF 1 and EF 2, draft section EB 2 (which is the equivalent of current section EF 2) will take precedence, and draft section EB 3 (the equivalent of current section EF 1) will apply only to goods that are not revenue account property. The draft section makes it explicit that draft section EB 2 does not cover operating leases as they have their own timing rule (current section EO 2A). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 418 EB – Matching rules: revenue account property and prepayments It may be necessary to provide that section EB 2 does not apply (and instead section EB 3 applies) to consumable aids. Further work is being undertaken on the definition of ‘revenue account property’. There is currently an element of circularity with the definition of ‘depreciable property’. There may be a need to define ‘revenue account property’ by reference to specific categories of property.

Expenditure not subject to this section (2)This section does not apply to expenditure on— (a) trading stock valued under subpart EC (Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock)): (b) livestock valued under subpart ED (Valuation of livestock): (c) an excepted financial arrangement valued under subpart EE (Valuation of excepted financial arrangements): (d) a financial arrangement valued under subpart EH (Financial arrangements rules): (e)a specified lease or a lease to which section EK 17 (Payment by lessee under personal property and operating leases) applies: (f)a film or a right in a film: (g) property that arises as a result of petroleum development expenditure or petroleum exploration expenditure. (h)revenue account property to which section EB 2 applies. Adjustment for unexpired portion (3)The unexpired portion of a person’s expenditure at the end of an income year is income of the person in the income year under section CG 11 (Prepayments for services and some goods and deferred payments) and is allowed as a deduction in the following income year under section DB 38 (Adjustment for prepayments and deferred payments). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EB – Matching rules: revenue account property and prepayments 419 Unexpired portion: expenditure on goods (4)An amount of expenditure on goods is unexpired at the end of an income year if the person has not used up the goods by the end of the income year in deriving income. Unexpired portion: expenditure on services (5)An amount of expenditure on services is unexpired at the end of an income year if the services have not been performed by the end of the income year. But the special rule in subsection (7) for expenditure on employment income overrides this subsection. Unexpired portion: expenditure on chose in action (6)An amount of expenditure on a chose in action is unexpired at the end of an income year if the amount relates to a period of enforceability of the chose in action falling after the income year. Unexpired portion: expenditure on employment income (7)An amount of expenditure on employment income under section CE 1 (Amounts derived in connection with employment) is unexpired at the end of an income year, even though the services have been performed during the income year, if the amount is still unpaid 63 days after the end of the income year. Extension of payment period: shareholder-employee income (8)In the case of employment income paid to a shareholder-employee, the 63-day payment period for a payment in subsection (7) is extended until the last date by which the person could file a return of income for the income year if the maximum extension of time were allowed under section 37 (5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Allowances reimbursing employees: related to anticipated timing (9)In the case of expenditure subject to section CW 13 (Reimbursement of employees and expenditure for their benefit) and section CW 14 (Allowance for additional transport costs), this section applies on the basis that the relevant services were performed in the year in which the employee’s expenditure is expected to occur. Commissioner’s discretionary relief (10)The Commissioner may allow a person not to comply with the rules in this section under section 91AJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Likewise, the link with a purpose of sale or exchange has been retained. The usual tests would apply to establish whether a business was being undertaken. The phrase ‘owns or carries on a business’ has been retained. The words ‘carries on’ were added in 1951 to cover a situation in which a business was on-sold after hours (see S Trustees v Commissioner of Taxes (NZ) (1950) 5 AITR 31 at 43). This instance is not directly relevant in the case of ongoing ownership of a business as envisaged by the trading stock valuation provisions, but can be relevant when a business is being sold. EC 2 ‘Trading stock’ defined Property held in business (1) Trading stock means property that a person who owns or carries on a business holds for the purpose of selling or exchanging in the ordinary course of the business. What is included in ‘trading stock’ (2) Trading stock includes— (a) partly completed work that would, if completed, be trading stock under subsection (1): (b) property that the person holds for use in producing trading stock: (c) property on which the person has incurred expenditure, when the property would, if they held it, be trading stock under subsection (1) or paragraph (a) or paragraph (b): (d)property leased under a hire purchase agreement when the property— (i) is treated as having been acquired by the lessor under section FC 10 (2) (Taxation of hire purchase agreements); and (ii)is an asset of a business that the lessor carries on. What is excluded from ‘trading stock’ (3)Trading stock does not include— (a) land: (b) depreciable property: (c) a financial arrangement: (d) an excepted financial arrangement: (e) livestock not used in dealing operations: (f) a consumable item to be used in the process of producing trading stock: (g)a spare part not held for sale or exchange. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) 423 Origin:(1) OB 1 ‘trading stock’. (2) OB 1 ‘trading stock’. (3) OB 1 ‘trading stock’. Defined terms:business, depreciable property, excepted financial arrangement, financial arrangement, hire purchase agreement, land, lessor, person, trading stock. Comment:The components of the current definition of ‘trading stock’ have been incorporated into the body of draft subsections (1) and (2). The current definition of ‘trading stock’ builds upon the common law notion of trading stock, which in turn draws upon commercial use. As such, the definition is not exhaustive. This inclusive approach to defining trading stock has not been changed in the rewrite process. The equivalent term in Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (FRS 4) is ‘inventories’. But there are differences between ‘inventories’ and ‘trading stock’. Notably, consumable aids (items such as fuel oil that are used in the production process but do not form part of the finished product) are inventories but are excluded from the definition of ‘trading stock’. Instead, consumable aids are dealt with under the accrual expenditure provisions (current section EF 1, draft section EB 3). Similarly, spare parts held for maintaining plant are either dealt with under the accrual expenditure provisions or are depreciated. The other key difference is the inclusion of services in FRS 4. As noted in the general commentary, livestock, including bloodstock, used in a business and excepted financial arrangements have been removed from the definition of ‘trading stock’ but remain revenue account property. This change has no practical effect as livestock on hand at year end will continue to be valued annually (see separate subparts for livestock and excepted financial arrangements). Depreciable property has been explicitly included in the list of exclusions from trading stock to save the reader having to trace through other definitions. Depreciable property cannot be trading stock under the definition of ‘depreciable property’. The exclusion of excepted financial arrangements implicitly subsumes the intent of current section DK 3E, which excludes excepted financial arrangements held by life insurers from being trading stock. As a result, current section DK 3E is no longer needed. EC 3 Valuation of trading stock Taking into account closing values (1)A person who carries on a business must determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year by a method that is available under this subpart for them to use. The value of that closing stock is the closing value to be taken into account in section EB 1 (Stock and excepted financial arrangements). Opening value (2)The opening value of trading stock is the value of the person’s closing stock at the end of the previous income year. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 424 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) Origin:(1) EE 2(1), (3), (4). (2) EE 2(2), (4). Defined terms:business, closing stock, closing value, income year, opening value, person, trading stock. Comment:The draft section makes explicit that these rules are applied at the end of the income year. This is not a change in the law. The other instance when the rules are relevant is when part-year accounts have to be prepared (for part-year loss purposes), in which case section IF 1 (4) requires the rules to be applied as if it were an income year. EC 4 Summary of valuation methods Standard valuation (1) The standard valuation methods for trading stock are— (a) cost, determined using generally accepted accounting principles: (b) discounted selling price, if used for financial reporting purposes: (c) replacement price, if used for financial reporting purposes: (d)market selling value, if this value is lower than cost. Valuation by low-turnover trader (2)A person who is a low-turnover trader may choose to value closing stock using a standard valuation method or a low-turnover valuation method (see section EC 12). Transfers of trading stock within wholly-owned group (3)Special rules apply when trading stock is transferred between companies in a wholly-owned group of companies (see section EC 21). Origin:(1) EE 3(1). (2) EE 3(2). (3) new. Defined terms:closing stock, company, cost, generally accepted accounting principles, low-turnover trader, person, trading stock, wholly-owned group of companies. Comment:The draft brings together the provisions scattered through current subpart EE dealing with small taxpayers. The term ‘small taxpayer’ is replaced by ‘low-turnover trader’, defined in draft section EC 12. A low-turnover trader has the option of applying the rules specific to low- turnover traders or the general rules, regardless of whether financial statements have been prepared. However, should a low-turnover trader decide to comply with generally accepted accounting principles, they must comply with the consistency and disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No 1. Other low-turnover traders are subject to different consistency requirements (see draft section EC 20). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) 425 Standard valuation EC 5 Cost of trading stock Valuation at cost (1)A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at cost. If the person chooses this method, they must include and allocate costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the valuation must be substantially correct. Materially correct valuation (2) In subsection (1), if the value of closing stock is substantially different from the value obtained by applying the reporting standard to that closing stock, then the person has not complied with generally accepted accounting principles. The standard is Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (Accounting for Inventories) approved under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, or an equivalent standard issued in its place. Allocation of costs for manufactured or produced stock (3)This subsection applies to a person (other than a low-turnover trader) who determines the value of closing stock at cost, using a budgeted method or a standard cost method of cost allocation in a business of manufacturing or producing trading stock. If any difference arises between the estimated costs of production that are included in the financial statements of the business for the income year and the actual costs of production, the person must apportion this variance between the cost of trading stock sold during the income year and the closing stock. Origin:(1) EE 5(1). (2) EE 5(2). (3) EE 5(3). Defined terms:business, closing stock, cost, financial statements, generally accepted accounting principles, income year, low-turnover trader, person, trading stock. EC 6 Identifying trading stock When items of trading stock are not separately identifiable, a person must use a cost-flow method to identify those items of trading stock that are included in closing stock, and the cost of those items. A person may also use a cost-flow method to calculate the cost of trading stock that can be separately identified. Origin:EE 5(5), (6). Defined terms:closing stock, cost, person, trading stock. Comment:The use of ‘separately’ and ‘specifically’ has been standardised by using ‘separately’. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 426 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) EC 7 Cost-flow methods of assigning costs Cost-flow methods (1)The cost-flow methods of assigning costs are— (a) the first-in first-out (FIFO) method: (b)the weighted average cost method. Consistent use (2)When calculating the value of closing stock at cost, a person must adopt the same cost-flow method of assigning costs as they use in their financial statements for that income year. Origin:(1) EE 6(1). (2) EE 6(2). Defined terms:closing stock, cost, financial statements, income year, person. EC 8 Discounted selling price Valuation by discounted selling price (1)A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at its discounted selling price. But they may use this valuation method only if they use discounted selling price for the trading stock in their financial statements. Establishing discounted selling price for retailers (2)If the person is a retailer, the discounted selling price for each department or category of goods is the sum of retail selling prices of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the department or category of goods. For a modification of this valuation method for retailers whose turnover is less than $1,000,000, see section EC 17. Establishing discounted selling price for others (3)If the person is not a retailer, the discounted selling price for each category of goods is the total market selling value of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the category of goods. ‘Normal gross profit margin’ defined (4)In this section, normal gross profit margin means the proportion of the selling price that is the normal gross profit margin of the relevant goods. The person must calculate the normal gross profit margin for each income year for each department or category of goods. In calculating the total cost of the goods, they must comply with generally accepted accounting principles, and must include all costs as required under Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (Accounting for Inventories) approved under the Financial Reporting Act 1983, or an equivalent standard issued in its place.

EC 9 Replacement price Valuation by replacement price (1)A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at its replacement price. But they may use this valuation method only if they use replacement price for the trading stock in their financial statements. Establishing replacement price (2)The replacement price is the market price of acquiring the equivalent trading stock on the last day of the income year. If there is no such market price, the replacement price is the last price that the person paid during the income year in acquiring equivalent trading stock. Origin:(1) EE 11(1). (2) EE 11(2), (3). Defined terms:financial statements, income year, person, trading stock. EC 10 Market selling value Valuation by market selling value (1) A person may determine the value of their trading stock at the end of an income year at its market selling value. But they may use this valuation method only if the market selling value is less than the cost of the trading stock. Establishing market selling value (2) The market selling value of trading stock is found by taking the amount that the person would normally expect to receive in the ordinary course of business at the end of an income year from the sale of the trading stock, and subtracting the following costs: (a) the usual costs of completing production of the trading stock; and (b)the expected costs of selling the trading stock. Expected costs of selling the trading stock (3) In subsection (2)(b), the expected costs of selling the trading stock are the costs that the person usually incurs for the following: (a) transportation: (b) insurance: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 428 EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) (c) sales commissions: (d)discounts to buyers. If the person prepares financial statements, the costs must have been taken into account in the statements in calculating net realisable value. Substantiating market selling value (4)If the person uses market selling value to value closing stock, they must be able to substantiate that value. If they cannot substantiate that value, to value their closing stock they must use— (a) cost (see section EC 5 or section EC 13); or (b) discounted selling price (see section EC 8 or section EC 17); or (c)replacement price (see section EC 9 or section EC 18).

Origin:EE 16(1). Defined terms:closing stock, cost, person. Low-turnover valuation EC 12 Low-turnover valuation Option to use a standard method or a low-turnover method (1)A person who is a low-turnover trader may value closing stock by a standard valuation method as described in sections EC 5 to EC 11, or by a low-turnover valuation method as described in sections EC 12 to EC 20. Low-turnover valuation methods (2)The low-turnover valuation methods are— (a) cost for low-turnover traders (see section EC 13); or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EC – Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) 429 (b) discounted selling price for low-turnover traders (see section EC 17); or (c) replacement price for low-turnover traders (see section EC 18); or (d) market selling value for low-turnover traders (see section EC 19). ‘Low-turnover trader’ defined (3)In this subpart, low-turnover trader means a person who carries on a business when, in an income year, the total of the turnover of the business and the turnover of associated persons (as defined in section OD 8 (1)(a) or (b)) is not more than the greater of— (a) $3,000,000; and (b) the amount set by the Governor-General by Order in Council.

A low-turnover trader who prepares financial statements may use this method only if they use discounted selling price for the trading stock in their financial statements. Establishing discounted selling price for retailers (2)If the low-turnover trader is a retailer, the discounted selling price for each department or category of goods is the total of the retail selling prices of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the department or category of goods. For retailers whose turnover is less than $1,000,000, see subsection (5). Establishing discounted selling price for others (3)If the low-turnover trader is not a retailer, the discounted selling price for each category of goods is the total market selling value of the goods minus the normal gross profit margin for the category of goods. ‘Normal gross profit margin’ defined (4) In subsections (2) and (3), normal gross profit margin means the proportion of the selling price that is the normal gross profit margin for the relevant goods calculated under Financial Reporting Standard No 4 (Accounting for Inventories) or an equivalent standard issued in its place.

Group company transfers EC 21 Transfers of trading stock within wholly-owned groups When this section applies (1) This section applies in an income year to trading stock held by companies that are members of the same wholly-owned group of companies when all the following paragraphs apply: (a) one group company (group company A) originally acquires and holds the trading stock; and (b) from the time it is acquired to the end of the income year, the trading stock is held within the group by a company or companies that are resident in New Zealand; and (c) through transfers within the group, another group company (group company B) holds the trading stock at the end of the income year; and (d) group company A and group company B remain members of the group at the end of the income year; and (e)either— (i) the income years of group company A and group company B end on the same date; or (ii)if they end on different dates, the Commissioner has approved both dates as corresponding to the end of a business cycle and as necessary to avoid material distortion of net income that would occur if the income years ended on the same date. Choice of treatment (2) When subsection (1) applies, group company B may choose to value the closing stock at the value of the trading stock to group company A. When company stops being member of group (3)Despite subsection (2), if group company B stops being a member of the wholly-owned group, the company is treated as disposing of and reacquiring the trading stock at its market value at the time the company stops being a member of the group. If the market value of the trading stock cannot be determined separately from other property, the value of the trading stock is taken to be its market value at the time group company B acquired it.

Comment:This adjustment does not apply if company B chooses to value at market value from the initial transfer. The Commissioner’s approval of different income years has been retained because the requirement is for anti-avoidance reasons. Its retention is consistent with self-assessment. The inclusion in current section EE 15 (2) of a liquidation of the company as a means of the company ceasing to be a member of the group has not been replicated as it was there merely to remove any doubt. Definitions EC 22 Definitions for this subpart In this subpart,— generally accepted accounting principles means the accounting practice that is generally accepted for inventories, as it applies to trading stock turnover — (a)means the total income that a business derives in an income year from the sale or exchange of trading stock; and (b)does not include the value of closing stock. Origin:EE 20(1), (2); OB 1 ‘generally accepted accounting principles’, ‘turnover’. Defined terms:business, closing stock, derived, generally accepted accounting principles, income, income year, trading stock. Comment:The definition of ‘turnover’ has been amended to make it clear that it relates only to the sale of trading stock, so that foreign exchange or depreciation gains or losses are not generally taken into account.

For this purpose, livestock is divided into four groups: listed livestock, other livestock, high-priced livestock, and bloodstock. Dealing operations excluded (2) This subpart applies only to livestock held for use in a business, but not to livestock used in dealing operations.

Defined terms:bloodstock, business, high-priced livestock, listed livestock, livestock, other livestock. Comment:The provision refers to livestock having to be used in a business to qualify. This is not a change as the test is implicit in the current legislation through the general trading stock rules referring to ‘a taxpayer who carries on or owns a business’. ED 2 General rule for the valuation of livestock A person must determine the value of their livestock at the end of an income year by a method that is available for them to use. The value determined is the livestock’s closing value to be taken into account in section EB 1 (Stock and excepted financial arrangements). Origin:EL 1(1). Defined terms:closing value, income year, livestock, person. ED 3 Summary of valuation methods Listed livestock (1)Listed livestock are sheep, beef cattle, dairy cattle, deer, goats, and pigs, and any other livestock types listed in schedule 8, column 1. High- priced animals of these livestock types have separate valuation rules (see subsection (3)). Four methods are available to determine the value of listed livestock. The methods are described in sections ED 9 to ED 26. Other livestock (2)Other livestock are livestock other than listed livestock, high-priced livestock, and bloodstock. The methods available to determine the value of other livestock are standard value, cost price, replacement price, or market value, as described in sections ED 28 to ED 30. High-priced livestock (3)High-priced livestock are animals that are listed livestock, that are bought at a premium price, and that are capable (or are expected to be capable) of being used for breeding. The value of high-priced livestock is determined under sections ED 31 to ED 35. Bloodstock (4)Bloodstock is any horse that is a standardbred or a thoroughbred horse, and a reference to bloodstock includes a property interest in a standardbred or a thoroughbred horse. The value of bloodstock is determined under sections ED 36 to ED 43. Movement between valuation methods (5)Restrictions apply to movements between valuation methods for listed livestock (see section ED 25).

Defined terms:bloodstock, cost price, high-priced livestock, listed livestock, livestock, market value, other livestock, price, replacement price, standard value, type. Comment:This section is a summary of the subpart and the subsections are not intended to be definitions of the categories. Two terms have been renamed: ‘specified livestock’ becomes ‘listed livestock’ and ‘non-specified livestock’ becomes ‘other livestock’. Otherwise, terms are the same as in current subpart EL. The reference to current section EE 2 has been deleted as livestock has been separated from the definition of ‘trading stock’. Both livestock and trading stock remain revenue account property and both subparts set out valuation methods that feed into the valuation adjustment rule that is in current section EE 2. ED 4 Interests in livestock Joint election of valuation method (1) When listed livestock is owned jointly by 2 or more persons, those owners must choose a valuation method. For it to be effective, the election must be made jointly by all the owners. When election ineffective (2) If there is not an effective election, listed livestock owned jointly is valued as follows: (a) if the owners bail or lease the livestock to another person during the income year, at market value: (b) if the owners enter into a profit-sharing arrangement for the livestock, at market value: (c)in any other case, under the national standard cost scheme. Partnerships and other interests (3)For the purposes of an election under this section, a person’s interest in a partnership that owns livestock is treated separately from any other interest that the person has in livestock. Separate elections are required for the person’s partnership interest and for their other livestock interests. But the person is not required to choose the same valuation method in both cases.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 440 ED – Valuation of livestock Comment:Draft subsection (3) has been added to clarify that a person’s partnership interest is to be treated separately from other interests for election purposes. The intention has always been that, despite the standard rule that an election applies to all of a person’s livestock, the person could make a separate election for the partnership interest from their individual interests. Therefore, a farmer who owns their own farm and is also a partner in another farming venture does not have to apply the same valuation method chosen for the partnership to livestock on their own farm. Current section EL 2 (6)(c) has not been replicated as it is inconsistent with self-assessment. ED 5 Changes in partnership interests Related interests (1) A new partnership that owns listed livestock is subject to a rule about related interests that applies in the income year in which the change in partnership interests occurs. When the rule applies (2) The rule applies when, at the end of the income year, more than 50% of the property of the new partnership is owned by persons who, during that income year or in the previous income year, owned all the property of another partnership that— (a) was formed before the new partnership; and (b)derived income in either income year from listed livestock of the same type as that owned by the new partnership. Valuation in the income year of change (3) When the rule applies, the value of listed livestock owned by the new partnership must be taken into account in the way the other partnership determines the value of livestock of the particular type at the end of the income year of change. If the other partnership has no listed livestock of the type on hand at the end of that income year, the value is taken into account as that partnership would have determined it, had it owned listed livestock of that type.

ED 6 Value of livestock on death of person Market value (1)On the death of a person who was deriving income from livestock, the value of livestock on hand at the date of death is its market value at that time. This section overrides both the person’s chosen valuation method and the general provisions of section ED 2. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 441 Death of partner (2) On the death of a partner in a partnership that is deriving income from livestock, the partner’s share of the livestock of the partnership is its market value at the date of death. Livestock in herd scheme (3)If a person who is deriving income from herd livestock dies before 1 February in an income year, and their return of income to the date of death is filed before the national average market values for the income year are set, the value of the livestock is its herd value for the previous income year. If the person has elected to use a herd value factor, the value of the livestock is its herd value multiplied by the factor applying in the previous income year. Origin:(1) EL 1(3). (2) EL 1(4).

Comment:Current section EL 5 (6) has been divided into two, with the relevant provisions relating to the disposal of livestock as a result of a person’s ceasing business now being located in draft section ED 15. ED 7 Transfers of livestock within wholly-owned groups When this section applies (1)This section applies in an income year to livestock held by companies that are members of the same wholly-owned group of companies when all the following paragraphs apply: (a)one group company (group company A) originally acquires and holds the livestock; and (b)from the time it is acquired to the end of the income year, the livestock is held within the group by a company or companies that are resident in New Zealand; and (c)through transfers within the group, another group company (group company B) holds the livestock at the end of the income year; and (d)group company A and group company B remain members of the group at the end of the income year; and (e)either— (i)the income years of group company A and group company B end on the same date; or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 442 ED – Valuation of livestock (ii)if they end on different dates, the Commissioner has approved both dates as corresponding to the end of a business cycle and as necessary to avoid material distortion of net income that would occur if the income years ended on the same date. Choice of treatment (2)When subsection (1) applies, group company B may choose to value the closing stock at the value of the livestock to group company A. When company stops being member of group (3)Despite subsection (2), if group company B stops being a member of the wholly-owned group, the company is treated as disposing of and reacquiring the livestock at its market value at the time the company stops being a member of the group. If the market value of the livestock cannot be determined separately from other property, the value of the livestock is taken to be its market value at the time group company B acquired it.

Valuation of listed livestock ED 8 Valuation of listed livestock Sections ED 9 to ED 26 set out the rules for valuing listed livestock. Listed livestock are sheep, beef cattle, dairy cattle, deer, goats, and pigs, and any other livestock of the types listed in schedule 8, column 1 but not high-priced livestock. Origin:EL 1(1)(d). Defined terms:high-priced livestock, listed livestock, livestock, type. ED 9 Valuation methods for listed livestock Election (1)Four methods are available for valuing listed livestock. A person must choose 1 method, making their election by using the method chosen in their return of income for an income year. The methods are: (a) the herd scheme described in sections ED 10 to ED 16: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 443 (b) the national standard cost scheme described in sections ED 17 to ED 19: (c) one of the cost price, market value, or replacement price options described in section ED 20: (d)as applicable, one of the bailment options described in sections ED 21 to ED 24. When the election applies (2)When a person chooses a valuation method, that method continues to apply in following income years unless they choose another method that is available to them. Commissioner’s determination (3)If a person chooses a valuation method that is not available to them and they later make no valid election, the Commissioner must determine the method to be used. In doing so, the Commissioner must consult with the person. Restrictions (4) Restrictions apply to the use of valuation methods and the making of elections (see section ED 25). Origin:(1) EL 2(1). (2) EL 2(1). (3) EL 2(8). (4) new. Defined terms:Commissioner, cost price, herd scheme, income year, listed livestock, market value, national standard cost scheme, person, replacement price, return of income. Comment:Current section EL 2 (3) and (4) have been relocated to a general section on election notice requirements (see draft section ED 26). Herd scheme ED 10 Herd scheme Election to use herd scheme (1) A person may choose to value listed livestock of any type and class under the herd scheme. But, subject to the two restrictions described in subsections (3) and (4), a person who has chosen to value livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme may nevertheless value any or all livestock of that type by another method. The alternative valuation options are national standard cost, cost price, market value, and replacement price. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 444 ED – Valuation of livestock Election to leave herd scheme (2)A person who wishes to stop valuing livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme must give 2 years’ notice to the Commissioner in the way described in section ED 26. However, notice is not required if the person values livestock of that type by another method (being one that is available for use in conjunction with the herd scheme). Restriction: reduced numbers in herd scheme (3)The first restriction on the use of an alternative valuation option occurs when livestock of a particular class are valued under the herd scheme. The numbers of livestock in that class must not be reduced below the number valued in that class under the herd scheme at the end of the previous income year. Restriction: male breeding stock (4)The second restriction on the use of an alternative valuation option occurs when livestock of a particular type are valued both under the herd scheme and under a cost option (being the national standard cost scheme or cost price). All male breeding stock of that type must be valued under the herd scheme in that income year. Former elections (5)A notice of election under former section 85A (3) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (as in force before its repeal by section 21 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1993) to value livestock previously valued under the herd scheme is treated as notice of election under this section to cease to value livestock of that type under the herd scheme.

Comment:See the comment on draft section ED 21. ED 11 Valuation under herd scheme Closing value of herd livestock (1)The value of herd livestock to be taken into account at the end of an income year is either its herd value based on the national average Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 445 market values set for each class for that year or, if a herd value factor is adopted, its herd value multiplied by its herd value factor. Opening value of herd livestock (2)Despite section ED 2, the opening value of herd livestock in an income year is taken into account when a person— (a) has livestock on hand at the start of an income year; and (b) has valued the livestock under the herd scheme in the previous income year; and (c)has not chosen for that income year to value the livestock by a different method. Value taken into account (3)The value of herd livestock to be taken into account at the start of the income year is either its herd value for the income year or, if the person has adopted a herd value factor, its herd value for that income year multiplied by its herd value factor for the previous income year.

ED 12 Herd value factor Adoption of herd value factor (1) A herd value factor is available for a person to use in calculating the value of listed livestock in the herd scheme. A person may adopt a herd value factor for herd livestock of a particular type by giving notice in the way described in section ED 26. A person may also adopt a recalculated factor by giving notice in the same way. Chatham Islands livestock (2) Herd value factors calculated under subsection (5) do not apply to livestock on the Chatham Islands. For the Chatham Islands adjustment to the herd value factor, see section ED 14. When the herd value factor applies (3) When a person adopts a herd value factor for livestock of a particular type, the factor applies in the income year specified in the notice and in later income years until— (a) the income year in which it is superseded by a recalculation of the factor; or (b) the income year in which the person stops valuing livestock of that type under the herd scheme; or Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 446 ED – Valuation of livestock (c)the income year following 2 consecutive income years in which the person has not valued livestock of that type under the herd scheme. Assessment of average value (4)For the purpose of calculating a herd value factor, a person must obtain from a recognised livestock valuer an assessment of the value of an average animal of that person in each applicable class of livestock. The value is determined as at the 30 April that is closest to the day on which the national average market values are set. Calculation of herd value factor (5) The herd value factor for livestock of a particular type is calculated using the formula— Σ\[average value x number\] Σ\[herd value x number\]. The result of the calculation is rounded to the nearest of the following figures: 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. Definition of items in formula (6) In the formula,— (a) Σ ΣΣ Σ is the total of the individual calculations for all applicable classes of livestock type valued under the herd scheme: (b) average value is the average value of an animal in a class (see subsection (4)): (c) number is the number of all livestock of that class on hand at the end of the income year (including livestock that are not in the herd scheme, but not including high-priced livestock): (d) herd value is the herd value of livestock for a class.

ED 14 Chatham Islands adjustment to herd value Adjustment for herd livestock on Chatham Islands (1) A person may adopt an adjustment for herd livestock on the Chatham Islands by giving notice in the way described in section ED 26. When the adjustment applies (2) When a person adopts a Chatham Islands adjustment as a herd value factor, it applies as a herd value factor to a particular type of livestock on the Chatham Islands at the end of the income year specified in the notice and in later income years until— (a)the income year in which the person stops valuing livestock of that type in the herd scheme; or (b)the income year following 2 consecutive income years in which the person has not valued livestock of that type on the Chatham Islands under the herd scheme. Setting the Chatham Islands adjustment (3) The Commissioner must set and may vary from time to time the level of Chatham Islands adjustment to the herd value factor that applies in an income year.

Under the national standard cost scheme, livestock are grouped by category. The categories are listed in schedule 9. Restriction: bailed or leased livestock (2) The first restriction occurs when a person has bailed or leased listed livestock to another person under a long-term bailment. The national standard cost scheme is not available to the person to value the livestock in that income year. But this restriction does not apply if the person makes the livestock available under a profit-sharing arrangement. For the treatment of livestock under a bailment, lease, or other arrangement, see sections ED 21 to ED 24. Restriction: determination (3)The second restriction occurs when a determination made under section ED 19 precludes the use of the national standard cost scheme for any livestock. The scheme is not available to a person to value the livestock. Restriction: cost price (4)The third restriction occurs when a person values any listed livestock in an income year at cost price. The option to value livestock under the national standard cost scheme is not available for that income year. Closing value (5)When a person chooses to value listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme, the closing value of the livestock at the end of an income year is the cost of that livestock calculated under the determination issued by the Commissioner under section ED 19.

The subsections set the timing requirements for publishing a determination, the time from which a replacement determination applies, and the matters that may be included in a determination. ED 19 Methods for determining costs using national standard cost scheme Determination of methods for calculation of cost (1) The Commissioner must determine the methods for calculating the cost of livestock listed in schedule 9, column 2. The costs determined in this way apply to the calculation of the value of listed livestock under section ED 17. Average cost (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the determination must establish a process for finding an average cost to be applied to all listed livestock valued under the national standard cost scheme. The process must take into account— (a) the number of homebred livestock that a person has on hand at the end of the year, applying to that number the relevant national standard costs determined under section ED 18: (b)in addition to paragraph (a), the number in each category of livestock listed in schedule 9, column 2 that a person has on hand at the end of the year, applying to that number the relevant national standard costs determined under section ED 18: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 451 (c)the number of bought livestock that a person has on hand, applying to that number the purchase costs associated with that livestock.

Cost price, market value, and replacement price options ED 20 Cost price, market value, or replacement price Election (1) A person may choose to value listed livestock at its cost price subject to the two restrictions described in subsections (2) and (3), or at its market value, or at its replacement price. Restriction: bailed or leased livestock (2) The first restriction on the use of the cost price option occurs when a person has bailed or leased their listed livestock to another person. The first person must not value that livestock in an income year at cost price unless— (a) the livestock is bailed or leased under a short-term bailment (see section ED 22); or (b)the livestock is bailed or leased under a profit-sharing arrangement (see section ED 23). Restriction: national standard cost scheme (3)The second restriction on the use of the cost price option occurs when a person values any listed livestock in an income year under the national standard cost scheme. The option to value livestock at cost price is not available for that income year. Changing to the cost price option (4)If a person chooses in an income year to change to the cost price option from another valuation method, the opening value of the affected livestock is the closing value of that livestock at the end of the previous income year determined under the method used in that previous year.

Defined terms:closing value, cost price, cost price option, income year, lease, listed livestock, market value, national standard cost scheme, opening value, person, profit-sharing arrangement, replacement price, short-term bailment. Comment:No attempt has been made to define what is meant by ‘cost price’, ‘market value’, or ‘replacement price’ beyond the definitions that exist in section OB 1. These terms have been left to general practice and case law. Outside the legislation some guidance on costs is provided in relation to one cost option (the self-assessed cost option). The replacement price option has been retained, given that it was retained for trading stock when the trading stock provisions were reviewed in 1999. Listed livestock under bailment, lease, or other arrangements ED 21 Bailee’s treatment of livestock When this section applies (1)This section applies when a bailment, lease, or agreement to use listed livestock or high-priced livestock exists, and the terms require a person who has the use of the livestock either to return the livestock to the person who made it available, or to pay full compensation for the livestock. Closing value of livestock: formula (2)A person who has the use of livestock under a bailment, lease, or agreement described in subsection (1) must take into account at the end of an income year the total amount for all classes calculated using the formula— total livestock – bailed livestock. Definition of items in formula (3)In the formula,— (a) total livestock is all the livestock that the person has on hand in each class at the end of the income year, including the livestock that the person owns, and the livestock that the person has the use of under the bailment, lease, or agreement: (b) bailed livestock is all the livestock in a class that a person has been given the use of under a bailment, lease, or agreement that remains in force at the end of the income year.

Restriction on use of national standard cost scheme (2)The national standard cost scheme is not available to the person who makes listed livestock available for use under a long-term bailment. But this restriction does not apply to profit-sharing arrangements (see section ED 23). Restriction on use of cost price option (3)The cost price option is available to the person only when they make listed livestock available for use under a short-term bailment or a profit- sharing arrangement. If the short-term bailment is made between associated persons, the consideration paid by the person to the bailee or lessee must be the market value. Origin:(1) new. (2) EL 7(4). (3) EL 7(4).

Single venture (2)Under a profit-sharing arrangement for listed livestock, if the method used to calculate the value of listed livestock in an income year is either the national standard cost scheme or the cost price option, then the venture is treated as one venture, and all the following are treated as the single owner of the livestock: (a) the person who owns the livestock; and (b) the person who has the use of the livestock; and (c)any other person who has made livestock of the same type available to the person referred to in paragraph (b) under a profit-sharing arrangement. Profit-sharing arrangement: national standard cost scheme (3)Under a profit-sharing arrangement for listed livestock, the national standard cost scheme is not available to a person to value the livestock if the person who has the use of the livestock has valued livestock of the same type at cost price. This restriction also applies when another person has made livestock of that type available to the person under a profit-sharing arrangement and values them at cost price. Profit-sharing arrangement: cost price option (4)Under a profit-sharing arrangement for listed livestock, the cost price option is not available to a person to value the livestock if the person who has the use of the livestock has valued livestock of the same type under the national standard cost scheme.

General provisions for listed livestock ED 25 Restrictions and limitations on the use of valuation methods Restrictions and limitations (1)This section sets out the circumstances in which certain valuation methods are either not available to a person for the purpose of valuing listed livestock, or are limited in their application. National standard cost (2)The national standard cost scheme is not available to a person to value listed livestock if— (a) in an income year they value other listed livestock at cost price: (b) in the income year before the year in which the election is to apply, they have valued listed livestock at cost price and have not given at least 2 years’ notice to the Commissioner of their election to value listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme: (c) they have made the livestock available for use under a long- term bailment: Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 456 ED – Valuation of livestock (d)they have the use of livestock under a profit-sharing arrangement and, in an income year, they (or another person who has made livestock available to that person under a profit- sharing arrangement) have valued livestock of that type at cost price. Cost price (3)The cost price option is not available to a person to value listed livestock if— (a) in an income year they value other listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme: (b) in the income year before the year in which the election is to apply, they have valued listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme and have not given 2 years’ notice to the Commissioner of their election to value listed livestock at cost price: (c) they have made the livestock available for use under a long- term bailment, but this rule does not apply to a short-term bailment: (d)they have the use of livestock under a profit-sharing arrangement and, in an income year, they (or another person who has made livestock available to that person under a profit- sharing arrangement) have valued livestock of that type under the national standard cost scheme. Reduced numbers under herd scheme (4)A person who values livestock of a particular class under the herd scheme must not use an alternative valuation option for that class if doing so would reduce the number of livestock in that class below the number valued in that class in the herd scheme at the end of the previous income year. Male breeding stock (5)A person who values livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme must value all male breeding stock of that type under the herd scheme if in an income year they also value any livestock of that type under the national standard cost scheme or at cost price. Bailed or leased livestock (6)A person must value listed livestock that is bailed or leased in accordance with sections ED 21 to ED 24. Determination (7)A person must not value listed livestock of the same type, class, or category using both the national standard cost scheme and another Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 457 valuation method if doing so would be contrary to a determination made under section ED 18.

Comment:Draft subsection (2) is not explicit in the current legislation but is implicit given that the cost option is not available to those who value any stock under national standard cost (current section EL 3 (3)). ED 26 Notices of election Forms of notice (1)This section specifies the 2 forms of notice that a person must give to the Commissioner, and when each must be used. When a person notifies the Commissioner of an election under this section, the election is irrevocable in the first year in which it applies. When notice in same year required (2)For the elections described in this subsection, a person must give notice by the date of filing their return of income for the income year in which the election is first to apply. Notice in the same year is required for an election— (a) to value livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme, as described in section ED 10: (b)to adopt a herd value factor or the Chatham Islands adjustment to the herd value factor for livestock of any type when the income year is the first income year in which the particular livestock is valued under the herd scheme, as described in sections ED 12 to ED 14.

Two years’ notice is required for an election— (a) to stop valuing listed livestock of a particular type under the herd scheme (but not when the person continues to value some livestock of that type under the herd scheme or when another valuation method is available (see section ED 10)): (b) to value listed livestock under the national standard cost scheme when the person has, in the year before the application of the new election, valued the same livestock at cost price in the way described in section ED 17 (4): (c) to value listed livestock at cost price when the person has, in the year before the application of the new election, valued the same livestock under the national standard cost scheme in the way described in section ED 20 (3): (d)after having adopted the herd scheme, to adopt a herd value factor or recalculated herd value factor or the Chatham Islands adjustment for any livestock type, as described in sections ED 12 to ED 14. Information for notices of election (4)Notices of election must state— (a) the income year in which the election is first to apply: (b) the type, class, or other description of the applicable livestock: (c) the existing and proposed methods of valuing the applicable livestock: (d) for an election to use a herd value factor or recalculated herd value factor under section ED 12,— (i)the value assessed under section ED 12 (4) of an average animal of each applicable class of livestock: (ii)the date on which the valuation of each animal was made: (iii)the name and address of the valuer.

Defined terms:bloodstock, high-priced livestock, listed livestock, livestock, matrimonial agreement, other livestock. ED 28 Closing value options A person may choose to value other livestock on hand at the end of an income year using one of the following options: (a) its cost price: (b) its market value: (c) the price at which it can be replaced: (d) if the Commissioner agrees, its standard value. Origin:EL 1(1)(c); EL 9(1). Defined terms:closing value, Commissioner, cost price, income year, market value, other livestock, person, price, standard value. Comment:The replacement price option has been retained because it was kept for trading stock following the review of the trading stock provisions in 1999. ED 29 Enhanced production When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person who derives income from other livestock enhances production in an income year. Enhanced production occurs when the person— (a) starts (or restarts) to derive income from other livestock; or (b)brings land into production (or substantially increased production) for the purpose of deriving income from other livestock, or acquires additional land for that purpose. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 460 ED – Valuation of livestock Adjustment (2) If a person enhances their production and as a result, in an income year or over the following 3 income years, buys more other livestock that is valued at its standard value, the value of the additional livestock is— (a) for the income year in which the livestock was bought, its standard value plus two-thirds of the difference between the cost price of the livestock and that standard value: (b) for the following income year, its standard value plus one-third of the difference between the cost price of the livestock and that standard value: (c)for other years, its standard value. For this purpose, the additional livestock must not be replacement livestock. Origin:(1) EL 9(4). (2) EL 9(2). Defined terms:cost price, derived, income, income year, other livestock, person, standard value. Comment:The definition of ‘deductible excess’ has been deleted from these provisions and, instead, its intent has been incorporated into the simplified text. A similar simplification may also be possible in the other place where the definition currently appears, section FF 10. ED 30 Setting standard values The Commissioner may set standard values for an income year for any type or category of other livestock. The standard values set apply to that income year, whether or not that income year began before, on, or after the date on which the standard values were set. Origin:EL 9(3); OB 1 ‘standard value’. Defined terms:Commissioner, income year, other livestock, standard value, type. Valuation of high-priced livestock ED 31 High-priced livestock When sections ED 31 to ED 35 apply (1) Sections ED 31 to ED 35 apply to listed livestock that a person buys at a price above the minimum set out in subsection (2) when, at the time it is bought, the livestock is capable of being used for breeding, or is expected to be so when it reaches maturity. But section ED 32 does not apply to livestock that, under sections ED 33 and ED 34, have ceased to be treated as high-priced livestock. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 461 Minimum price (2) For the purposes of this section, the purchase price must be at least— (a) $500; and (b)five times the national average market value for the applicable class either in the income year of purchase or in the previous income year, whichever is greater. For the valuation of high-priced livestock that is transferred under a matrimonial agreement, see section FF 11 (High-priced livestock). Valuation method (3)To value high-priced livestock, a person may choose to use either the straight-line method or the diminishing value method. If a person chooses to use the diminishing value method, they must give notice to the Commissioner that they are using the method at the time of filing their return of income for the first income year in which the value of the high-priced livestock is calculated under section ED 32. A person cannot then revoke the election to use the diminishing value method for the livestock. Origin:(1) OB 1 ‘high-priced livestock’. (2) OB 1 ‘high-priced livestock’. (3) EL 10(6). Defined terms:class, Commissioner, diminishing value method, high-priced livestock, income year, listed livestock, matrimonial agreement, national average market value, notice, person, price, return of income, straight-line method. Comment:Draft subsection (1) incorporates the contents of the definition of ‘high- priced livestock’ save for one modification. The reference to pre-1992-93 livestock has been deleted as current section EL 10 (7) has been removed on the basis that it is no longer relevant. That subsection set out the methods for valuing livestock that was classified as high-priced livestock before 1992-93. Our expectation is that none of that livestock will still be on hand by the time the rewritten legislation comes into effect. ED 32 Closing value of high-priced livestock Value in year of purchase and later years (1)The closing value of high-priced livestock at the end of the income year in which it is bought is its cost price minus the reduction applying in that year. In a later income year, the value is its opening value minus the reduction applying in that year until the value reaches or falls below the national average market value of the relevant class. Straight-line method (2)Unless a person has chosen to use the diminishing value method, the reduction is calculated using the formula— cost price x depreciation percentage. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 462 ED – Valuation of livestock Diminishing value method (3)When a person has chosen to use the diminishing value method, the reduction is calculated as follows: (a) in the first income year in which the election applies, the cost price multiplied by the diminishing value equivalent of the depreciation percentage for that year: (b)in later income years, the opening value of the livestock multiplied by the diminishing value equivalent of the depreciation percentage for that year. Immature livestock excluded (4)When high-priced livestock is less than 1 year old at the end of the income year in which it is bought, its closing value at the end of that income year is its cost price. Recently bought livestock excluded (5)If high-priced livestock is bought within 6 months of the end of an income year, and during that time is not used for insemination or collection of semen (in the case of male livestock), or does not give birth and does not have ova removed, the closing value of the livestock is its cost price. ‘Diminishing value equivalent’ defined (6)For the purposes of this section, diminishing value equivalent means the amount set out in schedule 11, column 1, that is the diminishing value depreciation rate to which the amount set out in schedule 11, column 2 is equal to the depreciation percentage expressed as the straight-line equivalent. If no such amount is equal to the depreciation percentage, the amount closest rounded down to that percentage is taken. Origin:(1) EL 10(1). (2) OB 1 ‘specified writedown’.

Comment:As with the other valuation methods, the closing value feeds into the valuation adjustment rule (current section EE 2). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 463 ED 33 Livestock reaching national average market value Valuation in initial income year (1)In the income year in which high-priced livestock reaches or falls below the national average market value for livestock of that class, the closing value is determined as follows: (a) when the person values any listed livestock of that type under the herd scheme in that year, the value of the animal under the herd scheme: (b) when the person values all listed livestock of that type that is older than 1 year under a cost option (being the national standard cost scheme or the cost price option), the national average market value for the relevant class in that income year: (c)when the person values all listed livestock of that type that is older than 1 year at market value or replacement price, the market value or replacement price of the animal at the end of that income year. Valuation in later years (2)In later income years, the animal that was high-priced livestock is treated as the person’s listed livestock, and is valued according to the valuation method chosen for that listed livestock. Entry into herd scheme in later years (3)If, in a later income year, the person values the animal under the herd scheme and, in the income year before that income year, has valued any listed livestock of the same type under the herd scheme, the animal is treated as if it were valued under the herd scheme at the end of that previous income year. Origin:(1) EL 10(3). (2) EL 10(4). (3) EL 10(4). Defined terms:closing value, cost price, cost price option, herd scheme, high-priced livestock, income year, listed livestock, market value, national average market value, national standard cost scheme, person, replacement price, type. Comment:The purpose of draft subsection (3) is to provide an opening value for high-priced livestock that has been written down to the NAMV and will now be valued in the herd scheme. Calculation of the opening value is required by current section EL 5 (2).

Origin:EL 10(3)(b), (4)(a). Defined terms:class, high-priced livestock, income year, national average market value, person. ED 35 Setting depreciation percentages For the purpose of valuing high-priced livestock, the Commissioner must set depreciation percentages for types, classes, or categories of livestock for an income year. The percentages represent the average percentage decline in the value of livestock of that type, class, or category, and the Commissioner must take into account the following criteria: (a) the average cost of livestock of that type, class, or category: (b) the estimated useful life of that livestock: (c)the average estimated residual market value of that livestock.

Valuation of bloodstock ED 36 Bloodstock Application of sections ED 36 to ED 43 (1)Sections ED 36 to ED 43 apply to a property interest in a standardbred or a thoroughbred horse. ‘Bloodstock owner’ defined (2)In this subpart, bloodstock owner means a person who has a property interest in a standardbred or a thoroughbred horse. Origin:(1) OB 1 ‘bloodstock’. (2) new. Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, person. Comment:The reference to ‘property interest’ is to recognise the possibility of joint ownership. In such cases, each person with an interest in the bloodstock is still an owner of the bloodstock. Removing livestock from the definition of ‘trading stock’ also automatically takes bloodstock out of the same definition. Nevertheless, both bloodstock and livestock more generally remain revenue account property. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 465 ED 37 Closing value of bloodstock Valuation of bloodstock (1) This section specifies the methods that a bloodstock owner must use to determine the closing value of bloodstock. First income year in breeding business (2) This subsection applies to bloodstock that is 2 years of age or older at the end of the first income year in which a bloodstock owner— (a) uses the bloodstock for breeding purposes in their stud business; or (b) buys the bloodstock, intending to use it for breeding purposes in their stud business; or (c)owns the bloodstock in their stud business, intending to use it for breeding purposes. The closing value of the bloodstock at the end of the first income year is its cost price minus the reduction applying in that year. To determine the reduction that applies, see section ED 38. Later income years in breeding business (3) In the income years that follow the year specified in subsection (2), the closing value of bloodstock used for breeding purposes is the opening value of the bloodstock minus the reduction applying in that year. If a bloodstock owner has not taken a closing value of the bloodstock into account in the previous income year, the closing value is the cost price of the bloodstock minus the reduction applying in the income year in which they make the calculation. To determine the reduction that applies, see sections ED 38 and ED 39. Other bloodstock (4)If subsections (2) and (3) do not apply, the closing value of the bloodstock is its cost price. But, in cases where section ED 40 applies, the closing value of the bloodstock is its market value. Residual value of bloodstock (5)When, if this subsection did not exist, the closing value of bloodstock would be less than $1, the value to be taken into account is $1. Origin:(1) new.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 466 ED – Valuation of livestock ED 38 Reduction: bloodstock not previously used for breeding When this section applies (1)This section applies when bloodstock— (a) has not been used for breeding purposes in New Zealand before 16 December 1991; and (b) before it was acquired by the bloodstock owner, has not been used for breeding purposes in New Zealand by any other person, unless— (i) the other person transferred the bloodstock under a matrimonial agreement to which section FF 12 (Bloodstock) applies; or (ii) the other person and the bloodstock owner were companies in the same wholly-owned group at the time the bloodstock owner acquired the bloodstock from the other person. Stallion (2)The reduction applying to the valuation of a stallion is 25% of the cost price of the bloodstock unless the bloodstock owner chooses to value the stallion by the diminishing value method. Stallion valued by diminishing value method (3)When a bloodstock owner chooses to value the stallion by the diminishing value method, the reduction applying to the valuation of the stallion is 37.5% of its cost price in the first income year, and 37.5% of its opening value in each later income year. The bloodstock owner must give notice to the Commissioner of their election in their return of income for the first income year. Broodmare (4)The reduction applying to the value of a broodmare is calculated using the formula— 1.25 x cost price of the broodmare \[15 – age of broodmare\]. For this purpose, the age of the broodmare is taken as 12 unless, for a broodmare to which section ED 37 (2) applies, the age is 11 or less at the end of the income year, in which case the actual age is used in the formula.

Broodmare (2)The reduction applying to the value of a broodmare to which section ED 38 (4) does not apply is calculated using the formula— cost price of the broodmare \[15 – age of the broodmare\]. For this purpose, the age of the broodmare is taken as 12 unless, for a broodmare to which section ED 37 (2) applies, the age is 11 or less at the end of the income year, in which case the actual age is used in the formula. Origin:(1) EM 1(4), (5). (2) EM 1(4), (5). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, cost price, income year. Comment:This section is considered still to be relevant even though most of the breeding stock will not have been used for breeding purposes until after 15 December 1991. The provision also covers breeding stock that has been previously used and sold within New Zealand, which falls outside the criteria in draft section ED 38 (1). ED 40 Infertility, birth deformity, or accident If because of infertility, birth deformity, or accident the market value of bloodstock on hand at the end of an income year is less than 50% of what would otherwise be the market value, the bloodstock owner may value the bloodstock at its market value. The value of that bloodstock in later income years is its market value in the applicable income year. Origin:EM 1(2). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, income year, market value. ED 41 Use of bloodstock for racing General treatment (1) If in an income year a bloodstock owner uses bloodstock for racing, and they are in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale, the use of the bloodstock for racing is treated as use in the course of that business. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 468 ED – Valuation of livestock Bloodstock not used in business (2) When bloodstock that is used in an income year for racing is not actually used in the course of a business of breeding bloodstock for sale, the bloodstock owner may apply to the Commissioner to have the use of the bloodstock treated otherwise than in accordance with subsection (1). Non-breeding bloodstock (3) If a bloodstock owner expects that bloodstock is not able to be used for future breeding purposes, the use in an income year of the bloodstock for racing is not treated as use in the course of a business of breeding bloodstock for sale. But if the bloodstock owner uses the bloodstock in the course of their business of breeding bloodstock for sale, they may apply to the Commissioner to have the use of the bloodstock treated as use in the course of that business. Applications to the Commissioner (4)For the purposes of applications made under this section, the bloodstock owner must apply in writing with the supporting information that the Commissioner requires within 1 month after the day on which the horse is first prepared for racing, or the day on which it is first raced, whichever is earlier. Origin:(1) EM 2(3). (2) EM 2(2). (3) EM 2(1), (4). (4) EM 2(3), (5). Defined terms:bloodstock, bloodstock owner, business, Commissioner, income year. Comment:In line with self-assessment, the reference to the Commissioner having to be otherwise satisfied has been removed. However, the requirement to apply to the Commissioner has been retained (see current section EM 2 (3) and (4)). The second sentence in draft subsection (3) covers situations where, even though a horse is not itself used for breeding purposes, it can add value, such as through winning races, thereby increasing the value of related progeny. ED 42 Change of use of bloodstock in course of business Use outside business (1) If a bloodstock owner who is in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale starts to use bloodstock otherwise than in the course of that business, they are treated as having disposed of that bloodstock. The disposal is treated as having occurred at market value on the day on which they changed the use of the bloodstock. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules ED – Valuation of livestock 469 Use in business (2)If a bloodstock owner who is in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale has been using bloodstock for other purposes, and they start to use the bloodstock in the course of the business, the bloodstock is treated as having been bought by the bloodstock owner. The purchase is treated as having occurred at market value on the day on which the bloodstock owner changed the use of the bloodstock. Origin:(1) EM 2(6). (2) EM 2(7).

In this section, the bloodstock is called breeding stock. Reduction: disposing of breeding stock (2) When subsection (1)(a) applies, a bloodstock owner may request the Commissioner to determine the amount by which their income is reduced to reflect the disposal of the breeding stock. The maximum amount that the Commissioner may determine is the net gain realised on the disposal. Reduction: replacing breeding stock (3) When subsection (1)(b) applies, a bloodstock owner may request the Commissioner to determine the amount by which their income is reduced to reflect the cost of replacing breeding stock. The maximum amount that the Commissioner may determine is the net gain. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 470 ED – Valuation of livestock Application (4) An application under subsection (2) or subsection (3) must be made in writing within 6 months after the end of the income year in which the amount would otherwise be income (or, if the Commissioner approves in a case or in a class of cases, a longer period). The application must relate only to breeding stock bought before the application is made. Delay in replacing breeding stock (5) In the case of lost, dead, or permanently injured breeding stock, the Commissioner may extend the time limit under subsection (4). But valid commercial reasons must exist for the delay in replacing the breeding stock, and the replacement breeding stock must have been acquired before the end of the second income year following the income year in which the loss, death, or permanent injury occurred. Refund (6) When subsection (1)(b) applies and the conditions in subsection (5) are met, the Commissioner may refund an amount equal to the bloodstock owner’s income tax liability on the net gain (that is, the gross proceeds minus the value of the breeding stock) and apply the net gain to reduce the cost of replacing the breeding stock. Definitions for this section (7)In this section,— gross proceeds means, as applicable, the amount of the proceeds of disposing of the breeding stock, or the amount paid by way of insurance or other compensation for the breeding stock net gain means an amount equal to the gross proceeds minus the value of breeding stock value of breeding stock means the closing value of the breeding stock in the income year before the breeding stock, as applicable, was disposed of, or was lost, or died, or was permanently injured.

(2) EG 19(8). Defined terms:depreciable property, person. Comment:The owner’s interest in property need not be legal ownership. Equitable ownership can also qualify, depending on whether the item is used or available for use. Other instances are a lessee making an improvement (current section EG 1A) and purchasers who have not settled but have taken possession of the item (current section EG 1B). The concept of shared ownership encompasses current section EG 19 (8) but is not confined to that provision only. The concept applies across all the depreciation provisions. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 478 EF – Depreciation EF 3 Ownership of goods subject to reservation of title When this section applies (1)This section applies when— (a)a person (the buyer) enters into an unconditional contract to buy an item of depreciable property; and (b)the contract is not a hire purchase agreement and the item is not a hire purchase asset that is the subject of a hire purchase agreement; and (c)the contract is subject to the Sale of Goods Act 1908; and (d)title to the item does not pass until the purchase price is paid in full; and (e)the buyer takes possession of the item before title to it passes. Buyer treated as owning (2)For the purposes of section EF 1, the buyer is treated as owning, and the seller is treated as not owning, the item from the later of the following times: (a)the time at which the buyer enters into the contract; and (b)the time at which the buyer takes possession of the item. Buyer ceases to be treated as owner (3)Subsection (2) ceases to apply when one of the following occurs: (a)title to the item passes to the buyer; or (b)the seller repossesses the item. Origin:(1) EG 1B(1), (3). (2) EG 1B(2). (3) EG 1B(2). Defined terms:depreciable property, hire purchase agreement, hire purchase asset, person. Comment:Current section EG 1B is considered still to be necessary because under the Sale of Goods Act 1908 the timing of transfer of legal ownership depends on the intention of the parties. This issue is discussed further in Rulings Exposure Draft IS3817. EF 4 Ownership of lessee’s improvements: lessee When this section applies (1)This section applies when— (a)a lessee of land incurs expenditure during the term of the lease in erecting a fixture on the land or making an improvement to the land; and (b)the lessor owns the fixture or improvement. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EF – Depreciation 479 Lessee treated as owner (2)For the purposes of section EF 1, the lessee is treated as owning the fixture or improvement for the term of the lease. Origin:(1) EG 1A(1). (2) EG 1A(1). Defined terms:improvement, lessee, lessor, term of the lease. Comment:Neither current section EG 1A (2) nor current section EG 1A (3) has been replicated, on the basis that they are unnecessary. In the case of current section EG 1A (2), if somebody else incurs the cost, the owner of the land has no cost to depreciate. If the owner of the land incurs a cost, the owner is able to depreciate the cost. EF 5 Ownership of lessee’s improvements: other person When this section applies: first case (1)This section applies when— (a)a lessee of land incurs expenditure during the term of the lease in erecting a fixture on the land or making an improvement to the land; and (b)the lessee has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the fixture or improvement; and (c)the lessee disposes of their interest in the lease to another person; and (d)the other person pays the lessee for the fixture or improvement. When this section applies: second case (2)This section also applies when— (a)a lessee of land has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for a fixture on the land, or an improvement to the land, that a previous lessee erected or made; and (b)the lessee disposes of their interest in the lease to another person; and (c)the other person pays the lessee for the fixture or improvement. Other person treated as owner (3)For the purposes of section EF 1, the other person is treated as owning the fixture or improvement from the time at which they pay the lessee for it.

Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 480 EF – Depreciation What is and is not depreciable property EF 6 What is depreciable property Description (1)For the purposes of section EF 1, depreciable property is property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use— (a)in deriving counted income; or (b)in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving counted income. Subsections (2) and (3) expand on this subsection. Property: tangible (2)An item of tangible property is depreciable property if— (a)it is described by subsection (1); and (b)it is not described by section EF 7. Property: intangible (3)An item of intangible property is depreciable property if— (a)it is within the definition of ‘depreciable intangible property’; and (b)it is described by subsection (1); and (c)it is not described by section EF 7. Origin:(1) OB 1 ‘depreciable property’. (2) new. (3) new. Defined terms:business, counted income, depreciable intangible property, depreciable property, derived, property. Comment:The current legislation does not require ‘depreciable intangible property’ to be ‘depreciable property’. However, this is the intent, and it is also the intent that the exclusions from ‘depreciable property’ apply, if relevant, to ‘depreciable intangible property’. The rewritten section makes that clear (see draft subsection (3)). Current section DE 1 affects the definition of depreciable property. However, it has not been replicated because its replication would duplicate the employment limitation in draft section DA 2 (4). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EF – Depreciation 481 EF 7 What is not depreciable property For the purposes of section EF 1, the following property is not depreciable property: (a)land, although buildings, fixtures, and the improvements listed in schedule 16 are depreciable property if they are described by section EF 6 (1): (b)trading stock: (c)livestock to which subpart EE applies: (d)financial arrangements: (e)excepted financial arrangements: (f)property that will not decline in value, as far as its owner is concerned, because, when they dispose of it, they have a right to be compensated for any decline in its value: (g)property that its owner chooses, under section EF 8, to treat as not depreciable: (h)property that its owner chooses, under section EF 31, to deal with under that section: (i)property for whose cost a person other than the property’s owner is allowed a deduction: (j)property for whose cost a person is allowed a deduction under a provision of this Act outside this subpart or under the Income Tax Act 1976 or under the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. Origin: OB 1 ‘depreciable property’. Defined terms:deduction, depreciable property, excepted financial arrangement, financial arrangement, person, property, trading stock. Comment:Draft paragraph (e) makes a separate reference to excepted financial arrangements because draft section EC 2 (‘Trading stock’ defined) takes them out of the definition of ‘trading stock’. For reasons of simplification, draft paragraph (j) differs in presentation from the current subparagraphs (vi) and (viii) of the definition of ‘depreciable property’ in that it does not specifically name the relevant sections. However, the principle remains the same, namely, that costs that have been allowed as a deduction elsewhere are not depreciable. This includes revenue account property that is allowed as a deduction under current section BD 2 (1)(b)(i) and (ii) (and then timed under current section EF 2). EF 8 Election that property not be depreciable Item acquired (1)A person may choose that an item of property they acquire not be depreciable property even though, in the absence of the election, it would be depreciable property. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 482 EF – Depreciation Item changing use (2)A person may choose that an item of property they own ceases to be depreciable property if— (a)the use of the item changes; and (b)before the use changes, the person did not have an amount of depreciation loss for the item; and (c)after the use changes, in the absence of the election, the person would have an amount of depreciation loss for the item. Retrospective election (3)A person who has not deducted all the amounts of depreciation loss for which they were allowed a deduction for an item of property, in the income year in which they acquired it and in each later year, may retrospectively choose that the item not be depreciable property. How elections made (4)An election under this section is made as follows: (a)a person makes an election under subsection (1) by giving the Commissioner notice of it in their return of income for the income year in which they acquire the item: (b)a person makes an election under subsection (2) by giving the Commissioner notice of it in their return of income for the income year in which the item’s use changes: (c)a person makes an election under subsection (3) by giving the Commissioner notice of it in their return of income for any income year after they acquire the item, including an income year after they dispose of the item. Effect of election (5)An election under this section has effect for the person for— (a)the income year for which they make the election; and (b)all later income years until— (i)the item is disposed of, although this reference to disposal does not include the disposal of an item of intangible property as part of an arrangement to replace it with an item of the same kind; or (ii)an event described in section EF 39 occurs involving the item.

It is one of the following: (a)if the same rate applies to all items depreciated in the pool in the income year, that rate; or (b)if different rates apply to items depreciated in the pool in the income year,— (i)the lower of the rates, if there are 2 items in the pool; or (ii)the lowest of the rates, if there are 3 or more items in the pool. Starting adjusted tax value (5) Starting adjusted tax value is— (a)the pool’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; or (b)zero, if the pool did not exist at the start of the income year. An adjustment to starting adjusted tax value is in section EF 22 (2)(b). Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 492 EF – Depreciation Ending adjusted tax value (6) Ending adjusted tax value is the pool’s adjusted tax value at the end of the income year before the deduction of an amount of depreciation loss for the pool for the income year. Months: income year of normal length or shorter (7) Months , for a person whose income year contains 365 days or fewer (or 366 days or fewer in a leap year), is the lesser of the following: (a)12; and (b)the number of whole or part calendar months in the income year in which— (i)the person owns the item; and (ii)the person uses the item or has it available for use for any purpose. Months: income year of longer than normal length (8) Months , for a person whose income year contains more than 365 days (or more than 366 days in a leap year) is the number of whole or part calendar months in the income year in which— (a)the person owns the item; and (b)the person uses the item or has it available for use for any purpose.

Comment:The use of calendar months in current section EG 11 (1) can produce a year with 13 months if the taxpayer has a balance date that is not at the end of the month. The definition of ‘months’ in draft subsection (8) removes this possibility. EF 22 Cases affecting pool Acquired item included (1)If a person chooses in an income year to include in a pool an item of poolable property that they acquire in the income year, the pool’s adjusted tax value is increased by the item’s cost. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EF – Depreciation 493 Separately depreciated item included (2)If a person chooses in an income year to include in a pool an item of poolable property that they depreciated separately in the previous income year,— (a)the pool’s adjusted tax value is increased by the item’s adjusted tax value on the date it is included in the pool; and (b)the item’s adjusted tax value at the end of the previous income year is included in starting adjusted tax value in section EF 21 (5). Item disposed of (3)If a person disposes of an item included in a pool, any consideration they derive from the disposal is subtracted from the adjusted tax value of the pool in which the item was included on the date of the disposal. All items disposed of (4)If, on the last day of an income year, the adjusted tax value of a person’s pool is positive but the person has disposed of all items that were in the pool,— (a)the pool’s adjusted tax value is the amount of depreciation loss that the person has for the pool for the income year; and (b)on the first day of the following income year, the pool’s adjusted tax value is zero. Negative adjusted tax value (5)If, on the last day of an income year, the adjusted tax value of a person’s pool is negative,— (a)the amount by which the adjusted tax value is negative is depreciation recovery income of the person derived in the income year; and (b)on the first day of the following income year the pool’s adjusted tax value is zero.

Comment: The reference in current section EG 11 (4)(b)(i) to income being ‘as if it were \[...\] income derived by virtue of section EG 19 (2)’ has not been carried over because it appears to be superfluous (see draft subsection (5)(a)). EF 23 Combined pools Combining pools allowed (1)A person using the pool method may at any time combine any number of pools to form a single pool. Consequences (2)When a person combines pools,— (a)the new pool’s adjusted tax value is the same as the sum of the adjusted tax values of the constituent pools; and (b)the adjusted tax value of each of the constituent pools at the end of the income year in which the pools are combined is zero; and (c)each of the constituent pools ceases to exist.

Comment:Draft subsection (1), current section EG 19 (10)(b), applies to any depreciable property, not just software (see ‘Questions We Have Been Asked’, Tax Information Bulletin vol 7, no 13 (May 1996)). EF 38 Items for purposes of section EF 36 Items to which sections EF 40 to EF 43 apply (1)For the purposes of section EF 36, an item of property to which sections EF 40 to EF 43 apply is an item of depreciable property that a person owns, including an item for which the person has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss they have had under section EF 32. This subsection is overridden by subsection (2). Items to which sections EF 40 to EF 43 do not apply (2)Sections EF 40 to EF 43 do not apply to— (a)an item of property that, on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, is accounted for in a pool; or (b)an item of petroleum-related depreciable property; or (c)an item of intangible property that is excluded depreciable property; or (d)a land improvement that is excluded depreciable property of a kind for which no depreciation deduction was allowed under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

Defined terms:amount, deduction, depreciable property, depreciation loss, excluded depreciable property, person, petroleum-related depreciable property, pool, property. Comment:The draft section no longer deals separately with the depreciation of software. Current law refers to the taxpayer having claimed any deduction for the purchase or creation of software (current section EG 19 (1)(a)(ii)). This means it covers software before and after 1 April 1993 even though the pre-1 April 1993 software is not depreciable property. The draft tries to make this more explicit by separating out disposals of pre-1 April 1993 software and including them as part of recoveries (see draft section CZ 1). This does not result in any change in the law’s effect as, under draft section CZ 1, the disposal of software purchased or created before 1 April 1993 is treated as if it were a disposal of depreciable property covered by draft sections EF 40 to EF 43.

Item leaving New Zealand permanently (2)The first event is the cessation of use in New Zealand, and the taking out of New Zealand for use outside New Zealand, of an item of property for which a first-year allowance has been granted under section 112 (1) to (7) of the Income Tax Act 1976, except when the item— (a)has been taken out of New Zealand temporarily; and (b)will, after its return to New Zealand, be used in or for the purpose of a business in New Zealand. Change of use or location of use (3)The second event is the change of use, or change of location of use, of an item of property, as a result of which a person does not have an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the next income year. The event is treated as occurring on the first day of the next income year. Loss or theft (4)The third event is the loss or theft of an item of property, if the item is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Irreparable damage (5)The fourth event is the irreparable damage of an item of property. Repossession (6)The fifth event is the seller’s repossession of an item of property to which section EF 3 applies because the buyer wholly or partly fails to pay the consideration. The event is treated as occurring on the date on which the item is repossessed. Statutory acquisition (7)The sixth event is the acquisition of an item of property by a person acting under statutory authority. Distribution (8)The seventh event is the distribution of an item of property. Cessation of ownership under section EF 4 or section EF 5 (9)The eighth event is the cessation of ownership of a fixture or improvement— (a)that a lessee is treated as having under section EF 4 (2); or (b)that a person is treated as having under section EF 5 (3).

EF 40 Effect of disposal or event Depreciation recovery income (1)For the purposes of section EF 36, if the consideration is more than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, the lesser of the following amounts is depreciation recovery income derived by the person for the income year in which the disposal or the event occurs: (a)the amount by which the consideration is more than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs; and (b)the total of the amounts of depreciation loss for which the person has been allowed deductions under this Act for the item and depreciation deductions that the person has been allowed under the Income Tax Act 1976 for the item. Depreciation loss (2)For the purposes of section EF 36, if the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, the person has an amount of depreciation loss, for the income year in which the disposal or the event occurs, that is the amount by which the consideration is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on that date.

Income (2)If the consideration referred to in section EF 36 is less than or equal to the cost of the item to the person, the depreciation recovery amount that is income of the person is calculated using the formula in subsection (4). Depreciation loss (3)If the consideration referred to in section EF 36 is less than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, an amount calculated using the formula in subsection (4) is the amount of depreciation loss that the person has. This subsection does not apply if the item is a building. Formula (4)The formula is— all deductions (base value – adjusted tax value) x depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss. Definition of items in formula (5)The items in the formula are defined in subsections (6) to (9). All deductions (6) All deductions is all amounts of depreciation loss that the person has had under this Act for the item and all depreciation deductions that the person has been allowed under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 for the item, in each of the income years in which the person owns the item. Base value (7) Base value has the applicable one of the meanings in sections EF 47 to EF 50. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules EF – Depreciation 513 Adjusted tax value (8) Adjusted tax value is the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs. In the case of disposal by a life insurer, adjusted tax value is calculated on the basis that the value to which the item has or would have been reduced by the amounts of depreciation loss for which the person has or would have been allowed a deduction is the same as the item’s acquisition value or cost minus all amounts of depreciation loss. Depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss (9) Depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss is the amount described in section EF 40 (1) or section EF 40 (2), as applicable.

Defined terms:adjusted tax value, amount, business, deduction, depreciation loss, depreciation recovery income, income, income year, life insurer, person, property. Comment:As signalled in issues paper 2 (June 1998), item ‘b’ of the formula has been amended from ‘cost’ to ‘base value’ to reflect the intent of the formula to apportion the gain or loss on disposal in the same business/private use proportion as the depreciation deductions were apportioned. EF 42 Depreciation recovery income when lost or stolen items recovered When this section applies (1)This section applies when an item of property to which section EF 39 (4) applies— (a)is recovered in a later income year; and (b)is still owned by the person; and (c)is still used or available for use by the person. Person treated as acquiring item (2)The person is treated as having acquired the item, on the date of recovery, for its adjusted tax value at the start of the income year in which it was lost or stolen. Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Exposure Draft Part E: Timing and quantifying rules 514 EF – Depreciation Person treated as deriving income: amount (3)The person is treated as deriving depreciation recovery income equal to the amount of depreciation loss that the person has under section EF 40 (2) for which they have been allowed a deduction. Person treated as deriving income: income year (4)The income year in which the person derives the income is— (a)the income year in which the item is lost or stolen, if the person chooses that year; or (b)the income year in which the item is recovered, in any other case.

EF 43 Depreciation recovery income when compensation received When this section applies (1)This section applies when a person receives compensation for an item of property to which this section applies (see section EF 38), other than compensation for an item that is lost, stolen, or irreparably damaged. Compensation subtracted (2)An amount must be subtracted from the item’s adjusted tax value. The amount is the amount by which the compensation that the person receives is more than the expenditure that the person incurs because of the event for which the person receives the compensation. Income (3)If the item’s adjusted tax value becomes negative in an income year through the application of subsection (2), the negative amount is depreciation recovery income derived by the person in the income year.

Cost reduced: input tax (2)The item’s cost is reduced by subtracting the amount (if any) of input tax applying to the supply of the item to the person. This subsection is overridden by subsection (3). Cost reduced: input tax (3)This subsection applies to an item that was not acquired or produced for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies but is applied in an income year principally for that purpose. The item’s cost is reduced by subtracting a proportion of the amount (if any) calculated under sections 21F and 21G, and deductible under section 20 (3)(e), of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The proportion is the proportion of the amount that arises from the application of the item in the income year principally for the purpose of making taxable supplies. Cost increased: output tax (4)This subsection applies to an item that was acquired or produced for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies but is applied in an income year other than for that purpose. The item’s cost is increased by adding the amount (if any) of output tax charged in the income year for the supply of the item because section 21 (1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 applies to the supply.

Premium loading formula (active annuities) (2)The premium loading formula (active annuities) is— 0.01 x claim probability x opening actuarial reserves. Definition of items in formulas (3)The items in the formulas are defined in subsections (4) to (6). Claim probability (4) Claim probability is the probability of a claim arising under the policy for the life insured’s death in the income year. It is determined at the start of the income year using the same mortality assumptions as are used to calculate the life insurer’s actuarial reserves for the income year. It is expressed as a decimal. Adjustments to claim probability are in sections EG 16 (2) and EG 17 (2). Opening sum assured (5) Opening sum assured is the claim that would be payable under the policy for the life insured’s death in the income year, and is payable only for death, or, if no such claim would be payable, the claim that would be payable under the policy for the life insured’s survival to the relevant date or age specified in the policy. It is determined at the start of the income year. It may be zero. Adjustments to opening sum assured are in sections EG 16 (3), EG 18 (2), EG 19 (3), and EG 20 (2). Opening actuarial reserves (6) Opening actuarial reserves is the amount in the life insurer’s actuarial reserves for the life insured under the policy. It is determined at the start of the income year. An adjustment to opening actuarial reserves is in section EG 16 (4).

Comment:The definition of ‘opening sum assured’ in draft subsection (5) contains the phrase ‘and is payable only for death’ but the definition of ‘opening sum assured’ in draft section EG 25 (4) does not. The difference replicates current law – compare item s0 in current section CM 6 (1), which contains the word ‘only’, with item s0 in current section CM 5 (1), which does not. The question arises as to whether it is necessary to preserve this difference.
