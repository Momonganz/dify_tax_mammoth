GST guide Working with GST IR375 November 2023 blank Important changes ‘Tax invoice’ requirements replaced by ‘taxable supply information’ From 1 April 2023, the requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as taxable supply information. Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. For more information about taxable supply information go to page 8 of this guide, or ird.govt.nz/gst ‘Debit note’ and ‘credit note’ requirements replaced by ‘supply correction information’ From 1 April 2023, debit and credit note requirements to correct previously issued tax invoices, have been replaced with requirements to provide and keep supply correction information. Supply correction information must be provided when the taxable supply information (for example, invoice) included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a taxable supply they have made. For more information about supply correction information go to page 18 or ird.govt.nz/gst GST adjustments for business, private or exempt use From 1 April 2023, • • When you acquire goods or services for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you can choose to use the principal purpose method or the apportionment method for claiming GST. • • The number and the value of the adjustment periods have changed. Fewer adjustments are required for land, as well as goods and services $20,000 or less. • • You can elect to treat goods as non-taxable supplies when their principal purpose is not for use in your taxable activity. 3 Contents Introduction 4 Non-resident GST rules 4 GST registration 4 Filing in myIR 4 Filing in accounting software 4 Part 1 - Explaining GST 5 What GST is charged on 5 Understanding your basic GST requirements 6 What GST is not charged on 7 Record keeping 8 Taxable supply information 8 Part 2 - How to complete and file GST returns 11 The GST return 11 Completing your return 11 Which paper form do I use? 11 GST 101A 12 GST 103 14 Supply correction information 18 Details supply correction information must include 18 Supply correction information for price changes 18 Reduction of the agreed price 18 Increase of the agreed price 18 Filing your GST return 19 If you do not file your return, or file it late 19 If you do not make your payment, or pay late 20 Correcting an error in your GST return 20 Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration 21 Should I deregister from GST? 21 Part 4 - Adjustments 23 Other adjustments 32 Part 5 - Supplies 37 Exempt supplies 37 Zero-rated supplies 37 Not eligible for zero-rating 38 Special supplies 38 Part 6 - Services you may need 44 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE4 Introduction This guide tells you how GST works and how businesses manage their GST obligations. Our GST Plus - IR546 guide has more information on some less frequent and/or complex GST issues. Non-resident GST rules The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. If you’re a non-resident business that does not carry out activity in New Zealand, but you receive goods or services here, you may be able to register for and claim GST. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/gst/gst-for-overseas-businesses GST registration You must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities), including certain imported services you receive: • • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. A business must have a taxable activity to register for GST. A 'taxable activity' is an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods or services to another person for consideration. If you have a taxable activity, you can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? You can register for GST in myIR. The GST registration confirmation we send you includes your: • • GST number (this may be the same as your IRD number) • • registration start date • • accounting basis (the way you claim and pay your GST) • • taxable period and filing frequency (how often you need to file returns). If you register voluntarily for GST, and later decide this was a mistake, you can cancel your registration. See Part 3 of this guide for more information about cancelling your GST registration. Filing in myIR You can file your GST returns in myIR. myIR provides instant confirmation you’ve filed and faster processing of your returns. Register for myIR myIR is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Filing in accounting software You can file GST returns using accounting software. Accounting software benefits include: • • your GST return is pre-populated, so you do not need to copy figures into your myIR or paper return • • instant confirmation your return is filed. Confirm with your software provider if this filing feature is available as part of their software package. 5 What GST is charged on GST is a tax, usually 15%, charged by GST registered businesses on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Some examples of taxable activities undertaken and where GST may be charged are businesses that supply: • • services such as graphic design, hairdressing, mechanical building, painting • • products such as clothing or cars, fish and chips • • experiences such as bungee jumping, skiing, kayaking, going to the movies • • professional services such as legal advice. Adding GST to your goods or services When adding GST to the price of goods and services, multiply the amount by 15% (or 0.15) to get the GST-inclusive price. If the price already includes GST, multiply it by 3 then divide by 23 to find out the GST amount. Subtract this to get the GST-exclusive amount. Example Adding GSTSubtracting GST Product$ 100 × 15% Product $ 115 x 3 ÷ 23 GST amount$ 15GST amount $ 15 Product Plus GST amount $ 100 $15 Product Less GST amount $ 115 $ 15 GST-inclusive total$ 115GST-exclusive amount $ 100 You can also calculate the GST component by dividing the GST- inclusive price by 7.66666666. You must use at least 8 decimal places to calculate the correct GST component as using fewer decimal places can result in an incorrect answer. Using the fraction method (multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 23) will always provide you with an accurate answer. Part 1 - Explaining GST What happens to GST collected from your customers and paid on your purchases? • • You collect GST through the sale of goods and services. • • You pay GST through purchases and business expenses. When you file your GST return, you work out the difference between the amount of GST you've collected and the amount of GST you've paid. • • If you've paid out more GST than you've collected, you'll receive a GST refund. • • If you've collected more GST than you've paid, you'll need to pay the difference to us by the due date. You can only charge GST on your sales and income or claim it back on purchases and expenses if you're registered. When you receive GST from your customers, you hold this money to pass on to us. GST is not income for the business and needs to be paid to us when you file your GST return. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE6 Understanding basic GST requirements Filing GST returns You're required to file regular GST returns. You can choose your GST return filing frequency (how often you file) – monthly, 2-monthly or 6-monthly. Your taxable period for 2 or 6 monthly returns must align to your balance date. If you did not choose a taxable period when you registered, we'll put you on the 2-monthly option matching your balance date. You can apply to change your taxable period if this does not suit. Send a message in myIR telling us which taxable period and filing frequency you prefer. If we approve the change, we'll tell you when to start using your new taxable period - do not change until we confirm this with you. Your GST taxable period must align with your balance date. For example, if you file your GST returns 2-monthly and have a March balance date your taxable periods are April-May, June-July, August-September, October- November, December-January, February-March. Monthly • • You must file monthly returns if your sales are over $24 million in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. Anyone can choose to file monthly GST returns. Monthly returns may suit you if you're entitled to frequent GST refunds. 2-monthly • • Anyone with sales under $24 million in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. You can choose to file your returns in odd or even months aligned to your balance date. Filing returns every 2 months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements and in touch with your business's progress. 6-monthly • • Anyone with sales under $500,000 in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $500,000 applies to the group as a whole. If you use this option, you will only need to file 2 GST returns a year. This can be a big job for 6 months’ worth of trading in one go. This option is more suitable if your business does not have a large volume of transactions. When to file your returns We’ll send you a reminder in myIR, when your GST return is ready for you to file. The reminder includes the due date for filing and making any payment. The due date is usually the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period, except for return periods ending: • • 30 November – the due date is 15 January of the following year • • 31 March – the due date is 7 May of the same year. If the due date for your GST return falls on a weekend or public holiday, it will be due the next working day. Remember, file and pay on time to avoid late filing penalties, late payment penalties and interest. What are my options for claiming and paying GST? There are 3 ways of accounting for GST; payments, invoice or hybrid. You should choose the accounting basis that best suits your business. If you do not choose an accounting basis when you register, we’ll put you on the invoice basis. If you want to change your accounting basis after you've registered, you can do this in myIR. 7 Accounting basisWho is eligibleWhat you need to do Payments basisIf your total sales are: • • $2 million or less in the last 12 months • • likely to be $2 million or less in any 12-month period, beginning on the first day of a month. In your GST return for the period include: • • amounts you've been paid by customers • • amounts you've paid to suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Invoice basisAnyoneIn your GST return for the period include: • • amounts you’ve notified customers to pay by invoice, even if you have not been paid yet • • the full sale price if customers have paid any amount before you’ve invoiced them • • amounts you’ve been invoiced by suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Even if you have not paid them yet. Hybrid basisAnyone Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. In your GST return: • • use the invoice basis for your sales • • use the payments basis for your expenses. What GST is not charged on Some goods and services do not have GST added to them. These are: • • sales by an unregistered person • • sales of private property (for example, a car or home not used for business) • • exempt supplies. Exempt supplies GST is not charged on exempt supplies, and they're not included in your GST return. These include: • • financial services such as interest payments on loans or bank fees • • donated products and services which are sold by not-for- profit organisations • • rent paid on a private home • • penalty interest. You cannot claim expenses relating to exempt supplies. You do not show income from the exempt supply in your GST return. Zero-rated supplies Some goods and services are not exempt supplies, but GST is charged at 0%. For example: • • exported goods • • sales of going concerns (selling or buying a business that will continue to run as the same type of business) • • sale of land (where certain criteria are met). If you have zero-rated supplies you can claim GST on your expenses. Payments basis Under the payments basis, account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps manage cash flow because you only pay us GST after you've received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you've paid for. You are only entitled to claim GST for purchases and expenses for which you hold taxable supply information. Invoice basis Using the invoice basis, you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you issued an invoice to your customers or received an invoice and hold taxable supply information from your supplier. Hybrid basis Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE8 In myIR include all zero-rated supplies with your total sales and income and just the zero-rated supplies amount in the next field. These are Box 5 and Box 6 for paper returns Example Joe's taxable activity is growing and selling apples. He exports some to America. Joe can claim the full cost of fertilisers and sprays used in the business. GST is not charged on the apples Joe sells to America. He enters the income as part of his sales in his GST return and then separates the amounts between the zero-rated supplies and taxable supplies. Record keeping Records must be in English or Māori unless Inland Revenue has approved keeping your records in another language. For tax records kept in Māori numerals must be 1, 2, 3 etc. Key points • • Keep all the documents supporting and explaining your GST figures. • • Keep business records for 7 years. • • Complete records save you time. • • Provide your GST number to customers as part of your taxable supply information. Good record keeping helps you complete and file your GST returns. You must: • • keep records of all your sales and income including taxable supply information and supply correction information • • keep taxable supply information and supply correction information for your purchases and expenses, such as invoices, receipts, or other documents. Decide on a record keeping system to suit your needs. For example: • • a software programme you can enter all your financial information electronically and apply formulas to calculate your GST • • a cashbook to develop your own records for your income, expenses, and GST. Make sure you have all the relevant taxable supply information (invoices, receipts or other documents), supply correction information, and bank statements for your business. This will help you find items quickly. You could set up a system by: • • date order • • supplier • • taxable period • • accounting basis for example, if you use the payments basis, file your paperwork in the month you made the payment. At some stage we may audit your business. During an audit we look at your GST records and systems. How you document and maintain your GST records is very important. For example, keeping your zero-rated invoices separate from your other invoices is a good idea because they go in a separate box on your GST return. Taxable supply information The requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as ‘taxable supply information’. Taxable supply information refers to the minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice, credit note, or debit note. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. Taxable supply information includes invoices, but it can also include information held in other forms, such as supplier agreements, contracts, and bank statements. Sellers can provide taxable supply information to a customer using an automated direct exchange between the buyer's and seller's software, for example PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online) eInvoicing. You need to keep taxable supply information to claim GST on your supply purchases and expenses relating to your taxable activity. You should provide taxable supply information such as an invoice, receipt or other documentation when you sell goods or services. If the sale is $200 or less (including GST), you do not need to provide taxable supply information to the buyer but both you and a registered buyer must keep your own records of the transaction for GST record keeping requirements. 9 Taxable supply information buyers and sellers must keep Taxable supply amounts $200 or less More than $200 and up to $1,000More than $1,000 Seller’s details• Name or trade name of the seller • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number Buyer’s details• Not required• Not required• Name, and 1 or more of the following: - address (physical or postal) - contact phone number - email address - trading name if different to the buyer’s name - New Zealand business number or website URL address.

An unconditional gift paid to a not-for-profit organisation is not consideration for a supply. Either: • GST exclusive amount, • GST amount, and • GST inclusive amount Or • GST inclusive amount and • a statement GST is included, charged at the standard rate for all the goods and services listed.

Consideration can be a • payment • act • holding back from using a legal right - for example, forgiving debt instead of enforcing payment. An unconditional gift paid to a not-for-profit organisation is not consideration for a supply. • The supply amount. Taxable supply information must be provided to GST registered buyers within 28 days of a request (or by an alternative date agreed to by the parties) for supplies over $200. Amounts of money must be expressed in New Zealand currency. Taxable supply information should only be provided once. If the buyer loses theirs, you can provide a copy. You do not need to mark it as a copy. 11 The GST return To complete your return work out the difference between: • • the GST you've added to goods or services you sell, and • • the GST you can claim back from business expenses and purchases. Remember, your business sales represent your income and your business purchases represent some of your expenses. Completing your return The following information will help you complete your return. The steps are the same whether you're completing your return in myIR or on paper.

It does not matter whether the buyer has already paid for the goods or services. Examples of when corrections may be required: • • the supply is cancelled, • • all or some of the goods are returned to the seller, • • some of the goods were not delivered to the buyer, • • there is an incorrect description of the goods or services, • • incorrect seller information included, • • incorrect buyer details included, • • the date is incorrect, • • GST is calculated at the wrong rate, or • • an incorrect GST amount is charged. You can include supply correction information for a previous supply in the same document as taxable supply information, for a new supply. The seller must include the supply correction information in the GST return for the period it was provided in. Details supply correction information must include Supply correction information must include all the following details: • • the seller’s name (or trade name) and GST number • • the date the correction was provided • • details identifying the taxable supply information • • the correction to the taxable supply information including, if relevant, a correction to the amount of tax charged for the supply. Sufficient information must be provided for both parties to identify the taxable supply information being corrected. An example might be an invoice number or other details. Both buyer and seller must keep supply correction information for their records. Supply correction information for price changes Sometimes the price of goods or services will change after an invoice has been provided or a payment made. Reduction of the agreed price If you supply goods and services and reduce the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the reduction in the return period it was made in. This is usually the return when the supply correction information was provided. If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information. If you’re the buyer, you must include the reduction shown on the supply correction information in the return period covering the time of reduction. This is usually the period the supply correction information was received. Increase of the agreed price If you supply goods or services and increase the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the increase in the return for the period it was made. This is usually the return for the period you provided the supply correction information. If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information for any increase in price. The buyer, must include the supply correction information in the return covering the time the increase was made. This is usually the return for the period the supply correction information was received. Examples Kevin's cleaning goods In July, Kevin sells cleaning goods to Maria for $1,000. Maria pays Kevin $900 as some goods were damaged. In his next GST return period, Kevin issues supply correction information for $100. Both Maria and Kevin use the invoice basis. Kevin includes $1,000 in his total sales in the return he sold the goods. Kevin then claims $100 in his purchases and expenses in his return covering when the reduction was made. Maria claims $1,000 in purchases in the return she received the goods and later includes $100 in the total sales in the return covering the time when the reduction for damage was made. If the taxable supply information and supply correction information were issued in the same return period, Kevin could have shown the net amount of $900 in his total sales instead. Maria could claim the net purchase of $900. This example of how adjustments are made also applies to an increase in price. 19 GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372 If you’re filing a paper return the IR372 helps you calculate your GST adjustments.

What are some common mistakes? • • poor record keeping • • calculation errors • • not filing nil returns • • incorrect adjustments • • incorrect claiming of personal adjustments • • not informing us if your business ceases. If you do not file your return, or file it late Key points • • Late returns may get a late filing penalty. • • You may have to pay a default assessment if you do not file your return. Late filing penalties If you do not file your return by the due date you may have to pay a late filing penalty. These are: • • $50 for each return filed on the payments basis • • $250 for each return filed on the invoice or hybrid basis. Late payment penalties and interest are charged on late filing penalties not paid by the due date. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE20 Default assessments If you do not send us a return, we estimate the amount of tax we think you should pay - a default assessment. In most cases, this amount will be higher than what you actually owe. You still have to file the overdue return, even if you pay the default assessment. When we get your completed return, we'll calculate the actual amount you need to pay, plus any penalties and interest. If you make a combined payment for GST and provisional tax but do not file your return, we'll use it to pay any GST default assessment and late filing penalty first. If you do not make your payment, or pay late Key points • • Late payments may be charged late payment penalties and interest. Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Correcting an error in your GST return If you realise you've made an error or errors in a GST return you've filed that results in an under or overstatement of your tax liability, you may be able to correct it in: • • a later taxable period and calculate the adjustment, or • • the same taxable period by amending your return in myIR. But, if you've chosen a particular tax position and then change your mind about it, you cannot correct it. Instead, you must use our disputes process. This means completing a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770. You must send this to us no later than 4 months after the due date of the GST return it relates to. For more information How the taxpayer-initiated disputes process works Making the correction in a later taxable period Option 1 The error or errors can be corrected in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, when: • • you provided the return which contains one or more errors in the assessment of their liability for GST, and • • the total discrepancy in the assessment caused by the error is $1,000 or less. Option 2 You can correct a mistake in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, provided the purpose is not to delay the payment of tax, and the total discrepancy is equal to or less than the lower of: • • $10,000, and • • 2% of the GST collected. Option 3 You can include an unclaimed GST input tax deduction in a later return if it is within 2 years of when the claim was left out, or the error relates to: • • an inability of the registered person to get an invoice • • a dispute over the proper payment amount for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates • • a mistaken understanding on the part of the registered person, the supply the deduction relates to was not a taxable supply • • a clear mistake or simple oversight of the registered person. Record keeping You must keep these details in your GST records and make the information available to us if we ask for it: • • what GST return period the error occurred in • • the GST amount involved • • the type of error • • which GST return period you made the correction in. Interest If the reassessed GST is an amount to pay and it's over $100 we'll charge you use-of-money interest. If the amount of reassessed GST is a refund over $100, we'll pay you use-of-money interest. Penalties We may ask for more information to decide whether we'll charge a shortfall penalty. 21 If your taxable activity is stopping or slowing down, you can cancel your GST registration. If you stop your taxable activity, you must cancel your registration. Cancelling your GST registration will not close your business or organisation. You can cancel your GST registration if: • • you're closing down or selling your business • • you expect your turnover to drop below $60,000 - and stay there for a while • • you realise you are not required to be registered. If you’re going to continue your taxable activity you may still choose to cancel your registration. If you do decide to cancel, you can no longer: • • charge GST on your sales • • claim GST on your expenses. If you're considering cancelling your GST registration, you'll need to know the situations where you must cancel or have a choice in cancelling. Use our handy online tool to help you decide what’s best for your situation - Should I cancel my GST registration Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration NoNo Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye s Have you stopped trading or closed your business? We recommend you stay registered for GST. Are you planning to restart your business or start a new business within the next 12 months? Your GST registration is not compulsory. Do you want to cancel your registration? You must cancel your GST registration within 21 days. You can cancel your registration in myIR or fill out and send us. If you stay GST registered, you must keep filing GST returns even if they are nil. You can cancel your registration in myIR or fill out and send us an IR315 form.

Or you can fill out a Business Cessation - IR315 form and send it to us. We'll contact you if we need more information. Otherwise, we'll send you confirmation your registration has been cancelled within 5 working days. Filing your final return You will need to file your final GST return up to your date of cancellation (this may not be the end of your normal taxable period). The date you need to do this by depends on your filing frequency. Your final return needs to cover your taxable activity between the first date of your taxable period up until your registration cancellation date. For example, if you file 2-monthly and you cancel your GST on 15 October, your final return needs to cover the period from 1 September to 15 October and needs to be filed by 28 November. You will need to account for GST on any business assets you keep. For more information about your obligations go to ird.govt.nz/gst You may need to complete the ‘debit adjustments’ or ‘credit adjustment’ sections if: • • you are keeping any assets the business owns • • the business owes money to a creditor • • any debtors owe you money. Use the open (current) market value of assets you are keeping. For assets bought before 1 October 1986, the value will be the lesser of the cost price and the open market value. For assets bought on or after 1 October 1986, work out the GST on the asset using this formula: (open market value x 3) ÷ 23 The open market value is the value of the asset as if you sold it today. You need to return the GST of the value of the asset in your final GST return, regardless of the accounting basis you use. When you’re part of a GST group There are different criteria and processes to cancel a GST group registration. For more information go to Cancelling a GST group Businesses with separate branches or divisions If you are the parent body of a business with separately registered branches or divisions you can cancel any of those registrations at any time. You will need to take over the GST responsibilities of any of the branches or divisions which are no longer separately registered for GST. If a parent body cancels its own GST registration, all the separate registrations of its branches or divisions are automatically cancelled. Note If you're liable to pay provisional tax the due dates will change if you were registered on a six-monthly basis or you use the GST ratio method to calculate your provisional tax. For more information see our Provisional tax guide - IR289. 23 Key points • • Electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies - you can elect to treat some goods such as land, dwellings and vehicles, as non-taxable supplies when their principal purpose is not for use in your taxable activity. • • When you acquire a good or service you may need to apportion GST between your business (taxable activity), and your private or exempt use. You can claim a percentage portion of the GST for the taxable use only. • • You may need to make change in use adjustments for the goods or services more than $10,000 (exclusive of GST), if the percentage of business to private or exempt use changes. • • Change in use adjustments are not required if: – the GST exclusive cost is $10,000 or less – the change in taxable use is less than 10% and the value of the adjustment is $1,000 or less. • • Change in use adjustments are made annually and the number of adjustment periods depends on the value and if the goods are land. • • Special wash-up rules need to be applied if you later sell a good or service where you’ve previously apportioned the GST, or you cancel your GST registration (deregister). • • Special rules apply to the concurrent use of land for taxable and non-taxable purposes. More detailed information and examples are contained in this adjustment section. Many small businesses get help from their accountant/tax agent with apportioning and making GST adjustments. Electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies You can choose to treat some goods as non-taxable supplies. This only applies to goods such as land, dwellings and vehicles when the principal purpose for acquiring and use of the good is not for making taxable supplies. If you choose to treat a good as a non-taxable supply, you do not have to add GST to any future sale of the good. To qualify, the following criteria must be met: • • you have not previously claimed a GST deduction for the goods • • the goods were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies • • the goods were not acquired as zero-rated supplies (see below for the exception). Once applied, you do not need to monitor the use of the good at the end of each GST adjustment period. Part 4 - Adjustments Example Rebecca has a small farming business. Her farmhouse is used to help run her GST business, but the principal purpose is for her private residence. When Rebecca bought the farmhouse, the seller was not registered for GST, so the purchase was not zero-rated. Rebecca chose not to claim any GST on the purchase, and any capital improvements she makes relating to the farmhouse. Rebecca can elect to treat a future sale of the farmhouse as a non-taxable supply for GST purposes. This means if the use does not change, Rebecca will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the farmhouse. The land used for farming would still be subject to GST. Rebecca can still claim part of her operating costs costs such as rates, insurance, and utilities, based on the percentage of the farmhouse used for making taxable supplies. Output adjustment for zero-rated supplies There might be situations where you acquire zero-rated goods, but the principal purpose of the goods is not for making taxable supplies. To treat the goods as non-taxable, you can make a debit adjustment for the GST you would have been charged, if the goods were not zero-rated (nominal GST amount). Example Gavin is GST-registered. He buys a holiday home for $1 million from another GST-registered person. The sale was zero-rated for GST purposes. The principal purpose for buying the house is for a family holiday home. However, Gavin also intends to rent out the property for short term accommodation. Gavin can choose to make the future disposal (sale) of this property a non-taxable supply, by returning output tax of $150,000 in his next GST return (the nominal GST amount that would have been charged, had the purchase not been zero-rated). If the property use does not change, Gavin will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the holiday home. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE24 Transitional rule for goods acquired before 1 April 2023 You may want to apply a transitional rule to goods acquired before 1 April 2023, if the principal purpose for acquiring the good was not for use in making taxable supplies. The transitional rule allows you to make a debit adjustment for the percentage of GST already claimed. This means any future disposal or sale of those goods can be treated as a non-taxable supply. If you choose to use the transitional rule, you need to: • • return any GST you have previously claimed by making a debit adjustment in your GST return • • notify Inland Revenue by sending a message in myIR, before 1 April 2025. When the transitional rule is applied, future disposal of those goods can be treated as a non-taxable supply. Once applied, future adjustments may only be required if the use of the goods changes to principally making taxable supplies. Example Mary is registered for GST. She bought a lifestyle block next to her beef farm in March 2022, for $1.15 million dollars from a non-GST registered seller. Mary’s principal purpose for buying the property was for long-term residential rental. The property included some land which Mary uses in her beef farming business. Only 25% of the total property value relates to her farming activity. Mary claimed GST of $37,500 in her March 2022 GST return. In September 2023, Mary decides to use the transitional rule for the lifestyle block and sends Inland Revenue notice of the change. Mary also makes a debit adjustment of $37,500 in her September 2023 GST return to pay back the percentage of GST she claimed in March 2022. If the property use does not change, Mary will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of this property. Apportioning GST for business, private or exempt use You acquire a good or service when you either purchase it or introduce it into your business (taxable activity). When you acquire a good or service used in your business, and used privately, or to make exempt supplies, you may need to apportion the GST amount you can claim. This is based on the percentage estimate it will be used in your business, and the value of the good or service. Examples of goods commonly used in a business and privately, include: • • your home when you have a home office • • vehicles • • cell phones • • laptops. Example of a taxable and exempt supply A retirement village providing independent style accommodation and rest home/hospital style units must apportion costs relating to the rest home/hospital activity (taxable) and the independent unit activity (exempt). GST can only be claimed on the taxable portion. Home office expense If you are using your home as part of your business, GST can be claimed on the portion of the running costs relating to your taxable activity. You must keep full records of all expenses, and how you’ve apportioned your business and private use. Your apportionment must take into account: • • time spent on income-earning activities • • the percentage area used in your taxable activity (either exclusively or mixed business and private use). You cannot claim GST on any private or domestic expenses. Please note any claims for the purchase of the property itself or any capital improvements made to your home may make a future sale of the property subject to GST on the full sale amount. You can elect to treat principally private assets as non-taxable. Read our section on Electing to treat goods as non- taxable supplies on page 23 for more information. 25 Goods and services $10,000 or less When you acquire a good or services for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you can choose to use the principal purpose method or the apportionment method for claiming GST. 1. Principal purpose method You need to determine whether the principal purpose is for making taxable supplies. This test determines if the GST on the good or service is claimable or not claimable. When the principal purpose is for making taxable supplies: • • you can claim the full amount of GST • • you do not need to make a GST adjustment if the principal purpose changes later. Example Phil is a GST registered contractor. He buys a laptop for $3,000 plus GST of $450, to use in his business for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Phil will also use it occasionally for private use. Phil can claim the full amount of GST charged ($450) as an expense in his next GST return because the principal purpose of the laptop is for business use. When the principal purpose is not for making taxable supplies: • • you cannot claim the GST • • you cannot later make any GST adjustments if the principal purpose of the good or service changes. 2. Apportionment method - $10,000 or less You can choose to claim the business percentage of goods and services, using the apportionment method (regardless of the principal purpose for acquiring the good or service). Change in use adjustments in future periods are not required for goods and services $10,000 or less. If you choose the apportionment method, you’ll need to use this for all goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less for a minimum of 24 months. You cannot change to using the principal purpose method for future purchases during this time. Example Amy has a GST registered business. She buys a car for $9,000 plus GST of $1,350, principally for private use but will sometimes use it in her business. Amy estimates her business use at 20%. If Amy chooses to use the principal purpose method, she cannot claim any GST as the GST exclusive price is $10,000 or less and the principal purpose of the car is not to make taxable supplies. Using the apportionment method, Amy can claim 20% of the GST in her next return. Amy needs to apply the apportionment method to all goods and services for a minimum of 24 months. Goods and services over $10,000 When goods or services over $10,000 (GST exclusive) are acquired for business and private use, or to make exempt supplies, you must apportion the amount of GST you can claim based on your business use. You cannot use the principal purpose method for goods and services over $10,000. You will need to work out your business use based on how the good or service will be used, or is available to use, then calculate a percentage estimate of the GST amount you can claim in your next return. You can choose how you work out the percentage of business use, as long as it gives a fair and reasonable result. This can be based on past records, experience, business plans or another suitable method. For example, if the asset is a car replacing an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of working out the intended use of the replacement car, provided the patterns of use will be relatively unchanged. After the initial GST claim for goods and services over $10,000: • • You must review the business use each year for any change affecting the apportionment between business, private or exempt use. The number of adjustment periods depends on the GST exclusive value and if it is land. • • You may need to make a change-in-use adjustment for the GST claimed if the actual use is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. • • Adjustments can only be made annually, in the GST return aligning with your balance date. More information about the number of adjustment periods is on page 26. When adjustments are not required You do not need to make an adjustment if the GST exclusive cost of the good or service is $10,000 or less. For goods and services over $10,000 you do not need to make an adjustment if: • • the change in taxable use is less than 10% and the value of the adjustment is $1,000 or less • • you make taxable and exempt supplies, and the total value of exempt supplies in the adjustment period is less than both: ·· $90,000, and ·· 5% of total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE26 Example A dairy spends $16,000 (exclusive of GST) on renovations. A major part of the dairy's business involves making taxable supplies. However, the dairy also runs a debtors' account and charges interest on any late payments (exempt supplies). Since the total value of the interest charged (exempt supplies) in the first adjustment period is expected to be less than both $90,000 and 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies made, the dairy is not required to apportion the input tax in relation to the renovations. Annual review and adjustments for change in use You must keep track of goods and services used in your business and for private or exempt supplies. Adjustments may be required when there is a change from your original estimate and the GST amount claimed. Change in use adjustments are accounted for annually, in your GST return aligning to your balance date. A method applied to determine taxable 'use' must be fair and reasonable. Examples • • 31 March balance date and a 2-monthly GST filing, the adjustment is included in February/March GST return aligning with the balance date. • • 30 June balance date and a 6-monthly GST filing, the adjustment is included in the January/June GST return aligning with the balance date. Choosing your adjustment period You can choose your first adjustment period to be from the date you acquire the good or service, until the end of either: • • the income year of acquisition (balance date) • • the income year (balance date) at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. Each adjustment period after this is the same as your income year. You cannot make change in use adjustments in other GST periods. Number of adjustment review periods The number of adjustment periods depends on the GST exclusive cost of the good or service: GST exclusive cost Adjustment periods $10,000 or lessNot required $10,001 - $20,0002 $20,001 - $500,0005 Over $500,000 or land (of any value)10 You may also choose the maximum number of adjustments based on the estimated useful life of the asset. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/rate-finder Example - Ben Ben operates a business and files 6-monthly GST returns in September and March. Ben has a 31 March balance date. In May he buys a car to use in his business for $28,750 including GST of $3,750. Ben estimates the car will be used 80% for business use and claims $3,000 GST in his September GST return. $3,750 × 80% = $3,000 Because the GST exclusive cost is $25,000, Ben needs to keep track of his business and private use for 5 adjustment periods. Adjustment period 1 At the end of the income year, Ben’s actual business use of the car is 100%. Ben makes a change in use adjustment to claim the remaining 20% of the GST ($750) in his October - March GST return (as this is the period aligning to his balance date). Ben needs to keep track of his car’s business use for 4 more adjustment periods as the GST exclusive cost is between $20,001 and $500,000. Change in use adjustments less than 10% and $1,000 or less in value You cannot make a change in use adjustment if the percentage of actual taxable use is less than a 10 % change from either the original intended use, or previous actual taxable use if you’ve already made an adjustment, and the adjustment amount is $1,000 or less. Example – less than 10% and $1,000 or less (Ben) Ben’s been keeping track of his business and private use for the car he bought the previous year for any more change in use. He’s already made one adjustment at the end of the income year he bought the car. During adjustment period 2, Ben’s wife Carly uses his business car for 19 days while her car is being repaired. At the end of the adjustment period, Ben’s worked out the difference for private use was less than 10% and $1,000 or less. He does not need to make an adjustment in period 2 but he still needs to check for changes in business use for 3 more adjustment periods. Example - Miriama Miriama bought a car for $34,500 including GST of $4,500 12 months ago to use in her taxable activity. She estimated her business use at 50% and claimed half of the GST ($2,250). 27 At the end of her first adjustment period, she has used the car 59% of the time in her business activity (9% more than she estimated). Because the difference is less than 10% and the change in GST value is $1,000 or less, ($450) Miriama cannot make any adjustment this period. If her business use of the car increases in a future adjustment period by 10% or more from her original estimate or the value is over $1,000, she can make an adjustment for the difference. Calculating actual use Actual use is always measured from original acquisition of the good or service. You must compare the percentage actual use of goods and services with: • • the percentage intended taxable use of the goods and services (if no previous adjustment has been made), or • • the previous actual taxable use (if you have made a previous adjustment for the goods and services). Example • Identifying percentage actual use and percentage intended/ previous use Peter has a 31 March balance date and files 2-monthly GST returns. Peter acquires a luxury boat on 1 October for $575,000 including GST of $75,000. He intends to use the boat 100% in his charter business and claims the full input tax deduction of $75,000 GST in his October/November GST return. Based on the GST exclusive value of the boat ($500,000), Peter monitors his business use for 5 adjustment periods. Peter’s actual taxable use of the boat during each adjustment period is: – Adjustment period 1 - 100% – Adjustment period 2 - 80% – Adjustment period 3 - 83% – Adjustment period 4 - 50% – Adjustment period 5 - 90% Adjustment period 1 is the income year ending 31 March, 6 months after Peter bought the boat. All other adjustment periods are 12 months. Peter makes the required adjustments in his February/March GST return at the end of each adjustment period. The following calculations work out the actual taxable use over the 5-year period, compared to Peter’s original estimate of intended taxable use, and adjust the GST originally claimed on acquisition for any non-taxable use. Adjustment period Intended use/Previous actual use % Percentage use in this adjustment period % To t a l months since acquisition Calculation details % Percentage actual use since acquisition % Change from previous adjustment period +/- % GST adjustment ($75,000 x % difference Pay back/claim) Acquisition100($75,000) 1100 1006100 x 6/61001000$0.00 2100 8018100 x 6/18 80 x 12/18 33.3 53.3 86.6-13.4$10,050 386.6 8330100 x 6/30 80 x 12/30 83 x 12/30 20.0 32.0 33.2 85.2-1.4$1,050 485.2 5042100 x 6/42 80 x 12/42 83 x 12/42 50 x 12/42 14.3 22.9 23.7 14.3 75.2-10.0$7,500 575.29054100 x 6/54 80 x 12/54 83 x 12/54 50 x 12/54 90 x 12/54 11.1 17.8 18.4 11.1 20.0 78.4+3.2($2,400) Overall result 78.4When Peter acquired the boat, he estimated it would be used 100% for making taxable supplies. Over the 5 adjustment periods the boat’s actual use in making taxable supplies was 78.4% ($75,000 x 78.4% = $58,800). Peter accounted for the changes in actual use at the end of each adjustment period. The total of annual adjustments is $16,200 (the difference between $75,000 and $58,800). Total GST adjustment $16,200 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE28 Adjustment period 1 (6 months from acquisition to the end of the income year) Peter does not need to make an adjustment for this period as his actual business use did not change. Adjustment period 2 Peter must make a debit adjustment for his non business use for the difference in GST he claimed when he bought the boat. This is calculated as 13.4% of $75,000. He includes $10,050 as a debit adjustment in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 2. Adjustment period 3 The difference in use from adjustment period 2 and 3 is a decrease in overall business use of 1.4%. The percentage is less than 10% but the value is $1,050, so Peter makes another debit adjustment for $1,050 in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 3. Adjustment period 4 The difference in business use from adjustment period 3 and 4 is a decrease in business use of 10%. Peter makes another debit adjustment for $7,500 in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 4. Adjustment period 5 The difference in business use from adjustment period 4 is an increase in business use of 20%. This time Peter makes a credit adjustment in his GST return for $2,400 at the end of adjustment period 5. After adjustment period 5 Peter no longer needs to make any further adjustments. If he sells the boat later, he will need to account for GST on the sale. Wash-up rule A wash-up adjustment is used when the business, exempt or private use of good or service changes and you do not expect it to change again. Work out the adjustment using this calculation: (full GST amount x new percentage) – actual deduction = wash-up adjustment • • The full GST amount of the good or service. For a zero-rated land transaction, this would be 15% of the purchase price. • • New percentage is the percentage of intended taxable use. • • Actual deduction is the GST previously claimed, including adjustments. If you make a wash-up adjustment and there is no change to the new percentage, you'll no longer have to make annual adjustments. The wash-up adjustment is made in the adjustment period (aligned to your balance date) after the permanent change in use is made. If your good or service changes in use later, you’ll need to make another adjustment. This adjustment needs to be made when the use changes and remains unchanged for a full adjustment period, even if the change is within the 10% or $1,000 threshold. Example – permanent change in use Tōtara Ltd is registered for GST. The company acquires an apartment building for $23m from an unregistered person. Tōtara uses 80% of the building to make exempt supplies of rental accommodation and leases the remaining 20% to Rimu Ltd who are also registered for GST. Rimu uses these apartments to supply commercial hotel accommodation units and serviced apartments. The 20% portion is a taxable supply. Tōtara claims a $600,000 deduction in the GST return period they acquire the building (3/23 x $23m = $3m potential secondhand goods input tax claim on total building, $600,000 is 20% of $3m). After 24 months, Tōtara negotiates a long-term commercial lease with Rimu to supply 50% of the building for Rimu’s commercial accommodation business. The long-term lease is a permanent change from 20% to 50%. Tōtara makes an adjustment to claim $900,000 being the difference in taxable use of 30% (additional 30% of the $3m input tax) at the end of their next adjustment period. Final adjustment on disposal of an asset used in a taxable activity You need to make a final adjustment when you dispose of the asset, to allow for any GST which has not been claimed. Use the following calculation to work out the final adjustment: Tax fraction x Consideration x (1 – Previous use) • • Where the tax fraction is 15% of the GST exclusive amount or 3/23rds of the GST inclusive amount. • • The consideration is the amount received, or treated as received, for the supply. • • Previous use is the percentage intended taxable use (if sold in the first adjustment period) or the previous actual taxable use at the end of the last adjustment period before disposal. Example Melissa buys a car for $46,000 (inclusive of $6,000 GST). She claims 70% input tax of $4,200. The car is later sold for $34,500 (GST inclusive). The sale of the car is in the course of her taxable activity, so the full sale amount is subject to GST. Melissa returns $4,500 as output tax (sales). Melissa’s final use of the car on sale is 100% taxable. As Melissa had not claimed for full business use of the car, she makes a final adjustment, calculated as follows: 29 Melissa works out the tax fraction of $34,500 (3/23) as $4,500 and multiples this by her private use (30% or 0.3). Melissa can claim an additional adjustment for $1,350. 3/23 x $34,500 x (1 – 0.7) = $1,350. Melissa includes the full $34,500 as sales and income in her GST return, and in her purchases and expenses, she includes a credit adjustment for $1,350. Example – Peter Peter sells his boat on 30 September, 6 years after acquisition for $460,000 including $60,000 GST. The sale of the boat is in the course of his taxable activity, so the full sale amount is subject to GST. Peter’s final use of the boat on sale is 100% taxable. Because the boat had some non-taxable use, Peter makes a final adjustment on disposal. In our earlier example for Peter, his last recorded taxable use adjustment was 78.4%. Peter makes a final adjustment on disposal as follows: 3/23 × $460,000 × (1 – 0.784) = $12,960 Peter includes both the output tax of $60,000 and credit adjustment of $12,960 in his August/September GST return. Maximum adjustment for property developers If you’re a property developer, your final adjustment cannot exceed the tax fraction of the purchase price when you first acquired the asset. Example: Property developer Emily, a property developer bought an apartment to renovate and rent. The input tax on the cost of the property plus renovations was $60,000. Emily claimed 64.8% of the total input tax - $38,880 because the property had a mix of taxable and exempt use. Emily sold the apartment for $640,000. As Emily has not claimed the full input tax for the purchase and renovation cost she makes a final adjustment of the input tax: 3/23 × $640,000 × (1 – 0.648) = $29,384 When Emily adds $29,384 to the deduction already claimed ($38,880), this is more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply ($60,000). As Emily is a property developer selling land, her adjustment is limited to $21,120. Special rule for concurrent use of land The portion of a deduction you should be entitled to claim must correspond with the extent to which you use the asset for taxable purposes. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one particular time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking your children to school - but usually not both at the same time. In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same time, for example, a property developer may supply a house as a dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. For the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income). The following formula will help you in apportioning between concurrent uses of land: consideration for taxable supply × 100% = (percentage of taxable use) total consideration for supply The 'consideration for taxable supply' is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The 'total consideration for supply' is the sum of the amount of the 'consideration for taxable supply' described above, and: • • the amount of all rental income derived from the supply of a dwelling since the land was acquired, and • • if no rental income is paid or payable in relation to the non- taxable use of land, the market value of rental income that would have been derived from the time of acquisition of the land if rental had been charged. You may apply for an alternative approach if this formula does not fit your circumstances. The market value must be used in determining consideration for taxable supply and/or total consideration for supply if amounts derived under those definitions are by associated persons or are not arm's-length amounts. If the market value of the land or rental income is not readily identifiable, the person may use another method to provide a fair and reasonable estimate of the market value. Example Sandy, a property developer, built 2 similar residential houses, house A and house B, next to each other. The construction cost of each house is $230,000 (including GST of $30,000). Sandy intends to sell both properties on completion (a taxable use) and claims a full deduction on the GST incurred on construction. Sandy is unable to sell the properties immediately on completion. So, while still advertising the houses for sale, she: • • rents out house A and receives rental income of $26,000 in the first adjustment period, and • • moves into house B and lives there rent free. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE30 Just after the end of the first adjustment period, Sandy sells house B for $360,000. House A - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and exempt purposes (supplying a residential dwelling), she needs to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. Sandy has not disposed of house A, but ascertains the market value of the house is approximately the same as for house B ($360,000). The total consideration for supply is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the amount of all rental income ($26,000) derived from the supply of the dwelling since the land was acquired ($386,000). Sandy's taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 As Sandy had originally claimed 100% on acquisition, she has therefore claimed 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 House B - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Because Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and private purposes (residential), she has to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is the amount derived, or would be derived, on a disposal of the house ($360,000). Because Sandy did not rent out house B, but still used it for non-taxable purposes, the total consideration for supply, is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the market value of the rental income she would have derived if she had rented out the property. Sandy estimates she would have received $26,000 of rental income. Her taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 Sandy has deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this amount to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 In both cases, Sandy may be able to recover some or all of the unclaimed input tax if she later disposes of the houses in the course of her taxable activity. An additional formula estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. The formula is: months × result total months • • 'Months' is defined as the number of months since acquisition in which all or part of the land is used to some extent for making taxable supplies. • • 'Total months' is defined as the total number of months since acquisition. • • 'Result' from calculation to establish the percentage of taxable use. Example The facts are the same as in the previous example and the length of the first adjustment period was 12 months. In the second adjustment period, Sandy continues both letting out house A and advertising it for sale. However, 6 months after the start of the second adjustment period, Sandy stops advertising house A for sale because she decides to permanently rent it out. In the second adjustment period, she receives rental income of $30,000. The market value of house A at the time of the adjustment is still $360,000. At the end of the second adjustment period, Sandy identifies the taxable use of the house. For the purposes of the second adjustment period, the total consideration for the supply is the sum of the market value of the house and all rental income received since the land was acquired: (360,000 + 26,000 + 30,000 = $416,000). $360,000 × 100% = 86.5% $416,000 However, because the house has been used for 6 months solely for making non-taxable supplies, she has to calculate the percentage actual use: 18 × 86.5% = 64.8% 24 Sandy's percentage actual use of house A in the second adjustment period is 64.8%. The percentage actual use must be compared with the 'previous actual use', with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For Sandy, the previous actual use will be 93%. So Sandy has deducted 28.2% (93% − 64.8% = 28.2%) more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 28.2% = $8,460 31 Special rule for calculating use of some assets Until 31 March 2024, special rules may apply to purchases of the following assets costing $50,000 or more and related expenses: • • land for example, holiday home • • ships/boats • • aircraft. If you purchase one of these assets you must use a specified formula to calculate 'use' if the asset is: • • used partly to earn income and partly for private use; and • • not in use for 62 days in the income year (or 62 working days if the asset is typically only used on working days). The rule does not apply to assets of a company (unless it is a close company). They also do not apply if any private use is minor and subject to FBT and the main business use for the asset is not a rental or charter business. You can claim a deduction when mixed-use assets are acquired, and when you acquire goods and services that relate to both income-earning and private use of a mixed-use asset (mixed- use expenses), to the extent that they will be used for making taxable supplies. The estimate of how you intend to use the goods and services should take into account the formula for the adjustment for mixed-use expenses below. Then, for the first adjustment period and subsequent adjustment periods, an adjustment is required for mixed-use expenses if the actual use of the mixed-use asset is different from the intended use. The formula used to calculate the adjustment for mixed-use expenses is similar to the calculation used to determine your deduction for income tax, and is based on income-earning days and private use days of the asset. The formula to calculate the adjustment is: total amount of input tax × income-earning days income-earning days + private days Formula definitions • • 'Input tax' is the total input tax for the mixed-use expenses, including the cost of the asset (excludes input tax relating solely to non-taxable and taxable use) • • 'Income-earning days' is the total number of days when rent or a fee is paid for the use of the asset, regardless of the amount paid. Includes consideration received from family, non-associated persons, and when the asset is being repaired or relocated • • 'Private days' is the total number of days the asset is used with no amount of rent or fee paid. Using alternatives to 'days' You can use other measures in the formula if they reflect the time use of the asset more accurately. For example: • • flying hours for an aircraft • • nights for a holiday home. Example Regan purchases a charter boat on 1 April 2017 for $450,000 (GST inclusive) which is used both to earn income and for private use. He accounts for GST input tax for the year as follows: Fully deductible expenses Annual Maritime NZ survey fees $700 Charter advertising $400 Food/drinks (charter guests only) $500 Regan claims the full input tax and no adjustment is made as the expenses relate solely to income-earning. Not deductible $250 for family fishing licenses is a private expense, so no GST input tax is claimed. Apportioned (mixed-use) expenses There are apportioned (mixed-use) expenses that relate to both income-earning and private use, so Regan needs to work out how much GST he can claim. Mooring fees $2,000 Fuel $1,200 Insurance $2,450 General repairs $300 Total expenses $5,950 When Regan acquired the boat, he estimated that the taxable use would be 50%. He claimed input tax on the mixed-use expenses of $29,735.86 (credit) as follows: ExpenseCostGST value50% input tax claimed Purchase of boat $450,000$58,695.65$29,347.82 Mooring fees, insurance, fuel $5,950$776.09$388.04 Total input tax $29,735.86 Income-earnings days Days fully chartered to the public 102 Days chartered at 50% market rate 20 to Regan's local fishing club Total 122 Private days Days the family used the charter boat 30 without making any payment income-earning + private days = 152 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE32 Total input tax (boat $58,695.65 + mixed-expenses $776.09) = $59,471.74 The calculation is: $59,471.74× 122 =$47,733.90 input tax 152 Regan claimed input tax of $29,735.86 during the year. He is entitled to claim a further amount of $17,998.04 (credit) as an adjustment for input tax in Box 13 of his final GST return of the year. The calculation is: $47,733.90− $29,735.86=$17,998.04 If the amount of input tax calculated for the actual use of the asset was less than the input tax claimed during the year, the difference would be a debit adjustment added in Box 9 of the GST return for further GST to pay. Other adjustments Barters You can also exchange goods and services for other goods or services, or a combination of goods, services and money - this is b ar ter. If the exchange is for other goods and services, you must account for 3/23 of the open (current) market value of whatever you received in return for your supply. When part of the exchange is money, you must include: • • 3/23 of the open (current) market value of the goods and services you received, as a debit adjustment in your GST return, and • • the money received in the total sales box of your GST return. Use this rule whichever accounting basis you're on. You might also receive goods and services in full (or part- exchange) for your supplies from another person. Between you, work out a dollar value for the exchange, for example a trade-in. You must include this agreed value, plus any money involved, in Box 5 of your GST return. Insurance payments received If you receive an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, include 3/23 as an adjustment in the GST return that covers the time you received the payment. For example, an insurance company makes a payment to cover equipment damaged in a fire. GST shown on New Zealand Customs documents The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) collects GST when: • • goods are imported into New Zealand. Customs charges GST on the landed value (including insurance , freight and duties) for the goods. • • excisable goods (alcohol, fuel and tobacco) manufactured in New Zealand are removed from a licensed manufacturing area for home consumption. Customs collects any applicable levies and any GST on those levies. Documents issued by Customs (such as a Customs import entry form C4, a Deferred payment of duty statement or Broker account statement) can be used to support a claim for a GST credit. Remember, you must hold these supporting documents to make a claim. Do not include imported goods under purchases on your GST return. When to account for GST paid to Customs The table below explains when to account for GST paid to Customs, depending on your accounting basis. For more information about GST on imported goods go to the New Zealand Customs Service customs.govt.nz (search keyword: importers) or call 0800 428 786. If you use theyou invoice basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document as a credit adjustment or in Box 13 of the paper GST return for the period you receive the invoice or make a payment, whichever is earlier. payments or hybrid basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document as a credit adjustment or in Box 13 of the paper GST return for the period you make the GST payment. 33 StepWhat to do 1Take the total taxable value of all fringe benefits from your FBT return. (This is the amount of the benefits, not the FBT itself.) 2Subtract the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST. The most common ones are: • • low-interest loans • • other financial services • • international travel • • contributions to employee superannuation and life insurance policies. The result is the fringe benefits liable for GST. 3Multiply the result from step 2 by 3 then divide by 23. This is the GST adjustment to include in your FBT return. Include this adjustment in: • • Box 7 of the quarterly FBT return (IR420) for quarterly filers • • Box 6 of the annual FBT return (IR422) for annual filers • • Box 6 of the income year FBT return (IR421) for income year filers. Example: Taxable benefits for FBT quarter ended 31 March 2021 Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Low-interest loans $ 425 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Subsidy on employee's honeymoon trip $ 600 Total $ 3,682 Benefits liable for GST are: Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Total $ 2,657 The low-interest loan and subsidy for the honeymoon are not included because loans are exempt supplies and international travel is a zero-rated supply. The amount of the GST adjustment is $346.57 ($2,657 × 3 ÷ 23). Enter this in Box 7 for the FBT return for the quarter ended 31 March 2021. Pay the adjustment when your FBT for the March quarter is due. If an employee makes a payment direct to the employer towards a fringe benefit, this is a separate supply and is liable for GST. Include this payment as income in Box 5 of the GST return. The time of supply is the same as for any other sale by the business. Example An employee has paid $100 cash direct to the employer. Add the $100 to the sales in Box 5 of the GST return. The GST to pay on the $100 is $13.04. FBT (fringe benefit tax) Companies and employers registered for FBT do not need to make a private use adjustment. But, they will need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Sole traders, partnerships and trusts registered for FBT may still have to make a private use adjustment if the owner, partners, trust members or associated persons use business assets privately. They also need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Make the adjustment in the FBT return period you provide the benefits in. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE34 If you...you make the adjustment in the GST return that covers... do not have a tax agentthe date your income tax return is due or filed, whichever is the earlier date. Example If your 2023 income tax return is due on 7 July 2023 and you do not have a tax agent, you need to make your GST adjustment in the GST return which includes that date. have a tax agentthe earlier of: •• the date your income tax return is filed, or •• 31 March after the due date for your income tax return. have a tax agent who has an extension of time to file your income tax return the date your income tax return is actually filed. If an employee contributes to the expense, treat this as a separate supply for GST. Include the total expense amount in Box 11 on your GST return as usual and show the employee contribution in Box 5. Because the GST adjustment is based on the amount which is not deductible for income tax, organisations that are not liable for income tax, for example, not-for-profit organisations and charities, do not need to make this adjustment. Calculating the adjustment for entertainment expenses The table below explains how to calculate the adjustment for an entertainment expense using the example on the right. StepWhat to doExample 1To work out the GST, multiply the expense by 3 then divide by 23.$230 × 3 ÷ 23 = $30 2Subtract GST from the entertainment expense. $230 − $30 = $200 3Work out the amount that is not deductible for income tax (50%).$200 × 50% = $100 4Multiply the non-deductible amount by 15% (or 0.15). This is your GST adjustment. Show this GST adjustment on your GST adjustment calculation sheet - IR372 under 'Entertainment expenses'. Transfer the total amount to Box 9 of your GST return for the period ending 31 October. $100 × 15% = $15.00 Before 1 April 2018 the GST component was calculated by multiplying by 3 and dividing by 23 (for example, $100 × 3 ÷ 23 = $13.04) at step 4. Example XYZ Ltd's only entertainment expense in the tax year was a business lunch for clients. The lunch cost $230 including GST. The income tax return for the year ending 31 March is filed on 7 July, and the company files six-monthly GST returns for the periods April and October. XYZ makes the adjustment in the GST return for the 6 months ending 31 October. The full $230 would have been included in Box 11 of an earlier GST return to claim the GST credit. Entertainment expenses Business entertainment expenses are related to taxable income and are incurred in the course of running a business. Usually, only 50% of business entertainment expenses are deductible for income tax. Read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide for details. You'll need to make a GST adjustment of 15% of the GST-exclusive non-deductible amount once a year. You cannot claim GST on private entertainment expenses, for example, a restaurant lunch with friends. During the year, keep showing your total business entertainment expenses on your GST return. The table below explains exactly when to make the adjustment depending on whether a tax agent prepares your income tax return. 35 Telephone expenses Cellphones If you have a business cellphone, you can claim GST on the total set-up cost. If you use the same cellphone for private use, you can claim GST on these running costs: • • total fixed cost of running the phone • • business calls. How to claim for telephone line rental See the table below. If you...you... have a commercial and domestic line rentalcan claim the GST on the full cost of the commercial line. Include the commercial rental cost in Box 11 on your GST return. You cannot claim any part of the domestic rental. have only one telephone line rental and use it for business and private purposes can claim GST on 50% of the cost. Show 50% of the rental in Box 11 on your GST return. The line can be commercial or domestic. want to claim more than 50% of your rentalmust show that the actual business use of your telephone is greater than 50%. The proportion of business toll calls to private toll calls may be one factor in working out the overall business use. You'll need to consider other factors, for example, your type of business and how many people live in the house. are a farmermay claim the full cost of telephone rental used for business and private purposes. Include the full rental in Box 11 on your GST return. make business-related callsmay claim the full amount of GST on these calls. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE36 Bad debts written off If you supply goods or services services and return GST on an invoice basis, but later write off all or part of the consideration as a bad debt, you can make a credit adjustment in the period you write it off. How you do this depends on your accounting basis - see the table below. If you use the...you... invoice or hybrid basisaccount for a sale when you issue an invoice. If you've already included the GST on the sale in a previous return, and then later write off the debt, you'll use this adjustment. payments basiswill not account for the GST on a sale until you actually receive it. If you do not receive payment and write the debt off, you cannot claim a deduction, because you have not included the GST on the sale in any previous GST return. You may make an adjustment for door-to-door sales and hire purchase agreements if you use the payments basis. Calculating a credit adjustment Show 3 / 23 of the full amount you've written off on the calculation sheet and include it in Box 13 of your GST return. You do not need to send in any documents supporting the write-off, but you do need to keep a record of the steps you took to recover the debt. For example: • • a debtor's ledger showing the date you issued the invoice • • letters from a solicitor/debt collector trying to recover the debt • • a bad debts ledger showing the write-off. You must write off the debt(s). You cannot claim for provision for bad debts. Example Brent, who uses the invoice basis, issues Chris with an invoice dated 26 October for electrical goods worth $115 including GST. Brent accounts for the sale in the return for the period ending 31 October. In the following March, Brent gives up hope of receiving payment from Chris and writes off $115 as a bad debt. Brent shows $115 × 3 ÷ 23 on his IR372 under 'Bad debts written off' and includes it in Box 13 of his GST return for the taxable period ending 30 April. GST not charged on the full price If the bad debt was for goods or services where GST was not charged on the full price (for example, the fifth week of a hotel stay, or a hire purchase sale), the GST adjustment is not simply 3 / 23 of the bad debt. Use this formula to calculate the adjustment: bad debt written off ÷ total consideration × GST included in consideration = GST adjustment Example Sue stayed at the Holiday Hotel for 6 weeks. Her total bill was $6,005.57. Sue leaves, still owing $1,000. After some time, the hotel writes off the $1,000 as a bad debt. The amount of GST included in the total bill is $602.57. The hotel must make an adjustment in its return which covers the period of the write-off: $1,000 ÷ $6,005.57 × $602.57 = $100.33 Bad debts recovered If you've had a GST deduction for a bad debt written off and you later recover all or part of the debt, you must make an adjustment for the amount recovered. Include 3/23 of the amount recovered as a debit adjustment in your GST return. Example Manu, who uses the invoice basis, wrote off a bad debt of $2,500 and later recovered $1,600. He must make an adjustment of $208.70 ($1,600 × 3 ÷ 23) at the time of recovery, even if he's changed his accounting basis since then. 37 Exempt supplies Some goods and services are exempt from GST so you do not include them in your GST return. These include: • • financial services • • penalty interest • • renting a dwelling for use as a private home • • residential accommodation under a head lease. Financial services These include: • • paying or collecting any amount of interest • • mortgages and other loans • • bank fees • • securities such as stocks and shares • • providing credit under a credit contract • • exchanging currency (for example, changing US$ into NZ$) • • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (for example, mortgage broking) • • financial options • • provision or transfer of ownership of a financial option • • deliverable future contracts • • non-deliverable future contracts. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Penalty interest Interest charges on overdue accounts are treated as exempt supplies. Example If you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90-day account basis, and the account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return. You do not pay GST on fines and penalties you get for a statutory offence, for example, parking penalties or infringement fees issued by courts or local authorities. Renting a residential dwelling The rent for a residential dwelling is exempt from GST. A landlord cannot claim GST on any expenses, such as maintenance, rates, and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least 5 years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents the property out, a change of use adjustment may be required. Residential accommodation under a head lease In most cases, if a property is leased as residential accommodation under a head lease, both the supply of the head lease and the sub-lease are exempt supplies. Zero-rated supplies Some supplies are zero-rated for GST and taxed at 0%. Restraint of trade Any payment you receive in return for not conducting a taxable activity outside New Zealand is zero-rated. Internet sales A registered New Zealand-owned entity selling goods or services through the internet to customers in New Zealand must charge GST at the usual rate. But, a New Zealand-owned entity selling goods or services through the internet to overseas buyers will generally charge GST at 0%. We expect sellers to take reasonable steps to check where the customer lives and where the goods or services are going. Sale of a going concern A going concern is a business sold 'lock, stock and barrel' or is part of a business that can operate independently. The business must be a going concern at the time of sale, right up to the time of the transfer to the buyer. A supply of goods or services must meet these criteria to be a going concern: • • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • • It must be the supply of all the necessary goods and services for the activity to continue. • • Both parties must agree in writing there is a supply of a going concern. • • Both parties must intend the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the buyer. The sale is zero-rated for GST if it meets all these criteria. Example Pat, a dairy farmer, sells his dairy farm (including land, herd, all buildings and all machinery) to another GST-registered farmer. This qualifies as the sale of a going concern if both parties agree. If Pat had sold the land and buildings but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not qualify as a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated, see land transactions in this guide. Part 5 - Supplies GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE38 But, if he'd sold parts of the farm that could have been operated separately as a going concern, the sale would be zero-rated. Land transactions A GST-registered person must zero rate a supply, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • • is made to another registered person, and • • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies, and • • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. To be a zero-rated supply, the above conditions for zero-rating must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of these conditions are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply will be taxed at 15%. Refer to ird.govt.nz/gst/charging-gst Not eligible for zero-rating Services performed in New Zealand for a third party Services performed under contract to a non-resident who lives outside New Zealand, delivered to a third party in New Zealand, and where it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract is entered into the services will not be received by the third party in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies, are not eligible for zero-rating. GST is charged at the standard rate of 15% if supplied to non- residents, but the supply is received in New Zealand. Example A Singaporean family wants their child to receive a year's education in New Zealand. The parents contract a New Zealand school to supply the tuition. The supply of the tuition is not zero-rated because the child will receive the tuition in New Zealand, and it was reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into, the child will not receive the tuition in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Example A non-resident tour operator buys accommodation from New Zealand hotels and puts them into travel packages for tours of New Zealand. The travel packages are then sold to non-resident tourists. The supply of accommodation contracted between New Zealand hotels and the non-resident tour operator is not zero-rated because it's reasonably foreseeable another person (the non-resident tourist) will receive the services in New Zealand and will not receive the accommodation in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Special supplies Special supplies are different from the normal business sales or purchases. Accommodation The supply of residential accommodation in a dwelling is exempt from GST. However, GST may be included for accommodation in a commercial dwelling. Commercial dwellings include: • • hotels, motels, homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast establishments, inns, hostels or boarding houses • • some serviced apartments • • convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes or hospice • • camping grounds • • other commercial dwellings. A commercial dwelling does not include a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when it is supplied with the right to occupy. If your taxable activity is running a commercial dwelling, you can calculate the GST on the accommodation in 2 ways. 4-week rule Commercial dwellings - residential establishments, for example boarding hostels or rest homes For the first 4 weeks' stay, charge GST on the full value of accommodation in the dwellings. After 4 weeks, charge GST only on 60% of the value of the domestic goods or services, usually the right to occupy the premises. This may include any of the following: • • cleaning and maintenance • • electricity, gas, air-conditioning or heating • • telephone (not tolls), television, internet, radio or similar chattels. Example Lauren stays for 6 weeks at the Comedy Hotel. The GST- exclusive costs are: 42 nights at $104 per night $4,368 Food and laundry $1,035 39 Comedy Hotel INVOICE Lauren Hardie GST No. 987-654-321 71 John Street Christchurch 08 April 20 XX 28 days (first 4 weeks) at $104 per night$2,912.00 GST (15% of $2,912.00)$436.80 $3,348.80 14 days (after 4 weeks) at $104 per night$1,456.00 60% of $1,456.00$873.60 GST at 15%$131.04$131.04 $1,587.04 Food and laundry$1,035.00 GST at 15% $155.25 $1,190.25 Total due$6,126.09 Main Street PO Box 36 363 Phone: (04) 333 6666 WELLINGTON WELLINGTON comedyhotel@hotmail.com This is how they calculate the amount for their GST return: first 28 days $ 436.80 next 14 days $ 131.04 food and laundry $ 155.25 total GST charged $ 723.09 $723.09 × 23 ÷ 3 = $5,543.69 is included for sales and income. If a joint charge covers all supplies for bed and breakfast, the fully taxable supplies (breakfast) must be identified separately from the domestic goods or services (bed). Residential establishment, - boarding hostels, resthomes If you and the guest agree the stay is for longer than 4 weeks, you must charge GST on 60% of the value of domestic goods or services from the beginning of their stay. Advance payments A supplier who receives advance or progress payments must account for the GST on the payments. These are inducements for a supply of goods, not financial services (which are exempt supplies). Example Tina is a fruit grower. She receives an advance payment from her marketing board and accounts for it like this: She includes the advance payment in total sales and income in the same period she receives it. If, for some reason, Tina has to pay back all or part of the advance she received from the marketing board it will be treated as a loan. As a loan, the advance will be exempt from GST because it's a financial service. The marketing board may claim a GST credit for the advance payment made, as long as they hold the necessary taxable supply information (such as an invoice or other documents). If the advance is later repaid, it must be included in total sales and income. Any interest is exempt because it's a financial service. A GST-registered agent who is involved in the transaction must account for GST on any commission or fee they charge. Auctions and auctioneers Ownership of goods under auction never passes to the auctioneer. Auctioneers sell goods on behalf of others (principals). An auctioneer may not know whether the principals are registered for GST, or whether to charge GST on a particular lot. The sale of goods on behalf of a non-registered principal is not taxable. The sale of a registered person's private assets is generally not taxable. The auctioneer can charge and account for GST as though making the taxable supply, as long as both the principal and the auctioneer agree to this arrangement. If the principal is registered, the GST-inclusive sale price, less commission, is passed on to the principal who must account for GST. If the principal is not registered, the auctioneer will pass the GST-exclusive sale price, less commission, on to the principal. An auctioneer who is registered for GST must account for the GST on fees or commissions. Auctions may be held on either a GST-inclusive or a GST-exclusive basis. The auctioneer should state this clearly at the beginning of the auction, so the bidders know whether or not their bids include GST. Delayed settlement transactions A vendor registered for GST on a payments basis who enters into a property transaction with a delayed settlement date must account for GST when an invoice is issued or when payment is received, whichever happens earlier, when the price of the property exceeds $225,000 including GST. This does not apply if: • • the supply is made under a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property - under one year • • the supplier is a not-for-profit organisation and at the time of supply, the recipient is not a registered person and is either:  not intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity, or  intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity but only after the full amount for the supply is paid to the supplier. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE40 Door-to-door sales The time of supply is the first day after the period in which the purchaser may cancel the sale. If you're a door-to-door salesperson, your buyers have either 7 days or 1 month to cancel the sale depending on the cancellation period. You account for the supply in the taxable period covering the day after the final date for cancellation. Example Selena Wares, a door-to-door salesperson, sells an item on 31 May, the last day of the taxable period. Day 8 after the sale is 8 June. She includes the full price for the supply in the taxable period covering 8 June. If you purchase from a door-to-door salesperson, you can claim a credit in the taxable period covering the first day after the cancellation period (provided you hold an invoice). This applies even if you get an invoice or make payment before that date. Full price not known at the time of supply Sometimes, a final price is not settled until after the goods or services are physically supplied. If you're supplying goods or services like this and you use the invoice or hybrid basis you include GST on the known component of the price in the earliest period of when you: • • issued an invoice for any part of this supply, or • • have a payment due, or • • received a payment. If you use the payments basis, you will account for the supply when you receive payments. Example Andy sells produce to an exporter for a down payment plus an end-of-season catch-up, based on export prices. Andy accounts for the down payment immediately. He accounts for the catch-up payment when it's due, received, or when an invoice is issued - whichever is earlier. However, if you buy goods or services when you do not know the full price and you use the invoice basis, you claim a credit in the earliest taxable period you: • • receive an invoice, or • • make a payment, or • • have a payment due. You must hold taxable supply information to support any claim. For purchases under the payments or hybrid basis, claim a credit when you make a payment. Gaming machines Gaming machine operators must register for and pay gaming machine duty. They must also pay GST on the value of the gaming machine revenue. This is the difference between: • • the increase in metered turnover • • less the increase in metered total wins during a return period. The amount of any jackpots won during that return period is also deducted from total turnover if the jackpot figure is not included in the metered total wins. When accounting for GST, gaming machine revenue is calculated from the records you're required to keep for the Department of Internal Affairs. Where your monthly machine analysis reports or cashless gaming machine analysis reports are prepared to coincide with the last day of your taxable periods, you can use them to calculate the gaming machine revenue. You also pay problem gambling levy (PGL) on gaming machine profits. You can claim back the GST on PGL. For more information read our Gaming machine duty guide - IR180 guide. Grants and subsidies Any grant or subsidy you receive in relation to your taxable activity from the Crown or a public authority, is considered to include GST if you're registered for GST. Include the full grant or subsidy with total sales and income in your return. Example Helen employs 10 staff. She gets a $200 wage subsidy each week for 8 weeks. The GST content is $208.69. $200 × 8 (weeks) $ 1,600.00 $1,600 × 3 ÷ 23 $ 208.69 Helen includes $1,600 as sales in her return. There is an exception for grants intended for international overseas development. You have to return GST on the portion of the grant allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand. If you receive a government grant or subsidy, you do not normally need to provide taxable supply information. However, if you receive a grant or subsidy, for example, a research grant, from another registered person, they will probably ask you for taxable supply information. If you pay a grant or subsidy in exchange for taxable supplies, you may request taxable supply information and claim a GST credit. Hire purchase agreements You must account for all hire purchase sales in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever accounting basis you use. If you buy goods on hire purchase, you may claim a deduction in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever accounting basis you use. 41 Insurance If you get an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, you are usually required to include the GST content as a debit adjustment in the return which covers the time you received the payment. Example Damien's distilling equipment was damaged by fire on 20 January. An insurance company paid the claim on 18 March for $4,500 to cover the damage. Damien includes $586.95 ($4,500 × 3 ÷ 23) as a debit adjustment in his return for the taxable period covering 18 March. You do not account for any payment received under a life insurance contract, because the insurer cannot charge GST on the premiums. Some types of insurance premiums are liable for GST (for example, fire and general insurance). A registered insurer may claim deductions for payments to policy holders when they are made. An invoice is not needed. The insurer will need taxable supply information to deduct any other payments for claims on policies, for example, a payment to a panelbeater for repairs to an insured vehicle. Insurers cannot claim for payments made under life insurance policies. Lay-by sales The time of supply is the date the buyer gets legal possession of the goods. If the sale is cancelled and the seller keeps part of the money, the time of supply is the cancellation. Include the full cost of a lay-by sale in the taxable period in which the buyer takes ownership of the goods. This is the time of the final payment. Do not account for the lay-by payments as you receive each one, but wait until you receive the final payment, even if you use the payments basis. Example Sue buys a chair on lay-by from a furniture shop in January. The full price is $560. Sue pays $160 as a deposit, and instalments of $200 in February and March. The chair is delivered in April. The furniture shop accounts for GST in the taxable period covering March, because that's when Sue became the owner. If a lay-by sale is cancelled and the retailer keeps some of the payments already made (or receives any later payments), they account for this amount in the taxable period which the sale was cancelled in. GST is calculated on the full amount kept, or received later, and it must be included in the return. Example Sue cancels the agreement with the furniture shop in February and gets a $300 refund. She loses $60 for doing this, which the furniture shop accounts for in the taxable period covering February. If you buy goods on lay-by, you may claim a deduction when you have fully paid for them, and you have taxable supply information. When you cancel a lay-by sale, you may claim 3 / 23 of any cancellation charge made by the supplier, in the same period you cancel the sale, as long as you have taxable supply information. Local authority rates Local authorities are the only GST-registered organisations which charge rates. The time of supply for rates is on the earlier of: • • the date of an instalment notice for a single payment, or • • the due date for payment, or • • the date when payment is received. Registered people may claim GST for rates payments for premises used in a taxable activity. If you use the invoice basis and you pay your rates in one lump sum, you may claim for GST when you make the payment or receive an invoice, whichever comes first. If you pay rates in instalments, you may claim the GST when each instalment is due or paid, whichever comes first. For the payments and hybrid basis, you claim GST for rates when you make payment, if you hold taxable supply information. Periodic payments and hire agreements Periodic payments and hire agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. The time of supply is the date payment is due or received, whichever is earlier. Private dwellings as part of taxable activity If a registered person buys a taxable activity that includes a dwelling, it may be treated as a separate supply (exempt). If the dwelling is treated as a separate supply, to claim a GST credit, the purchaser must prove how the dwelling will be used as part of the taxable activity. Repossessions When a buyer does not keep up their payments in a hire purchase arrangement (debtor), the seller will usually repossess the goods and resell them. The original buyer (not the repossessor) is considered to supply the goods to the new purchaser if there is a forced sale. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE42 If the goods sold are used in a taxable activity, the repossessor must account for GST on goods sold after repossession, unless the repossessor has: • • a written statement from the debtor, or • • reliable information, for example, from the debtor's accountant or solicitor, that the goods would not be a taxable supply if the debtor sold them. The repossessor will need to file a GST return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt - IR373. Example Brett sells a $1,200 fridge on hire purchase to Maria for her restaurant. Brett accounts for GST of $156.52 ($1,200 × 3 ÷ 23) in the return covering the period in which the agreement was made. Maria does not keep up the payments. Brett repossesses the fridge and sells it again. He then files an IR373. The sale after repossession, and the GST to be accounted for on it, is considered to be made by Maria. Sale of interest in a taxable activity In an unincorporated body, for example, a partnership, joint venture or trust, the body is the registered person, not the individual members. So, if a member sells an interest in the unincorporated body, it's a private transaction between 2 people and not a taxable supply and there's no GST to account for. Secondhand goods For GST, secondhand goods are goods previously used and paid for by someone else. Secondhand goods do not include: • • new goods • • primary produce - unless previously used • • goods supplied under a lease or rental agreement • • livestock • • secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal of any degree of purity (except to the extent the goods are composed of gold, silver, or platinum manufactured for sale to the public). Land is secondhand goods. The same rules for GST and record keeping apply to secondhand goods as for all other goods liable for GST. Secondhand goods if seller is not GST-registered If the seller is not registered for GST or the goods are private (exempt), there is no GST charged. If the purchaser is GST- registered they can claim a credit. To do this the purchaser must record: • • the name and address of the supplier • • the date of the purchase • • a description of the goods • • the quantity of the goods • • the price paid. You'll also need to keep details of the transaction if you're going to make a claim for income tax purposes. It does not matter which accounting basis you use; you must make a payment before you can claim the credit for the purchase. Successive supplies and progress payments The 'time of supply' is when a progress payment is made or when an invoice is provided, whichever comes first. Goods or services must be either: • • supplied progressively or periodically, and paid for in the same way, or • • supplied directly in constructing, manufacturing, or extending a building, or civil engineering work, with payments made periodically as the work progresses. If you get progress payments and you use the invoice or hybrid basis, account for the GST in the earliest taxable period a payment is due or received, or when you provide an invoice for that payment only. For the payments basis, account for GST when you receive payments. If you're making progress payments under the invoice basis, you may claim a GST credit in the earliest taxable period a payment is due, when you make a payment, or when you get an invoice for that instalment. You must have taxable supply information to support any claim. You claim a credit in the taxable period you make a payment in if you're using the payments or hybrid basis. Supplies to associated persons Special rules apply if you make certain supplies to people closely associated with you, for example, relatives, closely connected associated companies or trusts. See definition of associated persons. Supply to registered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can claim a GST credit for the purchase, you account for GST on the amount received. Example Jones, Smith and Brown, a GST-registered partnership, sells a piano to Lee, a sister of one of the partners. Lee is registered for GST and can claim GST on the purchase. The open (current) market value of the piano is $2,000, but the sale goes through for $1,500. The partnership accounts for GST of $195.65 ($1,500 × 3 ÷ 23). 43 Supply to unregistered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who cannot claim a deduction, you must determine the open (current) market value of the supply and account for the market value, or the amount you charged, whichever is the larger amount. In the previous example, if Lee was not registered for GST, the partnership would account for GST of $260.87. This is the $2,000 market value multiplied by 3 then divided by 23. Include transactions with associated persons in the return for the taxable period when the supply was made. If you get a payment or issue an invoice before the last date for filing the return, use either the payment date or invoice to work out which taxable period the supply falls in, depending on your accounting basis. Example A partnership has a 2-month taxable period. The return for the period ended 30 April is due on 28 May. The partnership supplies goods with an open (current) market value of $135 to a non-registered brother of one of the partners on 24 April and receives payment of $100 on 16 June. The partnership will account for $17.61 GST (on the market value of $135) in the return for the taxable period ended 30 April, because this is the period when the supply was made. If the partnership had issued an invoice or received payment during May (before the April return was due to be filed), the $17.61 GST would be included in the return for the taxable period ended 30 June because the invoice or payment would fall in the June period. Time of supply between associated persons Claim a deduction in your return for the taxable period when the supply is made available, removed, or performed and you hold taxable supply information. However, if you make a payment or receive an invoice before the last date for filing the return for that taxable period you should instead claim the deduction in the taxable period: • • you make any payment or an invoice is issued (whichever is the earlier), if you are an invoice basis taxpayer; or • • you make payment, if you are on payments or hybrid basis. Telecommunications – mobile roaming services Outbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used outside New Zealand by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device and their usual network is in New Zealand. These services are subject to GST of 15% Inbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used by a non-resident who is in New Zealand and their usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. These services are zero-rated for GST if supplied by a resident or treated as being made outside New Zealand (and so not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. Tenders A GST-registered person may call tenders for a future supply of goods or services. The advertisement should state whether the tenders need to include GST. Occasionally, the person making a tender will have to pay a deposit. There is not usually any GST on a deposit unless all or part of it is kept for some reason. Tokens, stamps and vouchers There are special rules for the sale of tokens, postage stamps and gift vouchers. The supplier should treat tokens, stamps and vouchers as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer buys them. GST can be accounted for when the customer actually exchanges the voucher for the monetary value of the goods or services bought, if both suppliers agree. Example A petrol station owner sells an oil company's $20 petrol voucher to a customer. The petrol station owner collects the $20 for the oil company and forwards it to them. The customer gives the voucher to a friend who buys petrol at another petrol station. Because there's an agreement between the petrol stations to return the GST on redemption of the voucher, the second petrol station tells the oil company they have sold petrol (goods) in exchange for a $20 petrol voucher. The oil company reimburses the second petrol station owner for the sale, who accounts for the GST on the $20 by including the total amount of the sale in their GST return. This option does not apply to postage stamps and vouchers sold to a non-resident for services performed in New Zealand. The supplier has to account for GST on these items when the customer buys them. Buying tokens, stamps and vouchers Where GST applies on the supply, you can claim tokens, stamps, and vouchers as an expense when you buy them, according to your accounting basis if you hold taxable supply information.

Taxable supply information Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and does not need to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Taxable activity Any activity carried out continuously or regularly by a business, trade, manufacturer, professional person, association or club. It includes any activity that supplies or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration but not necessarily for profit. It does not include: working for salary and wages, being a company director, hobby activities or any private recreation pursuit, private transactions such as the occasional sale of household or domestic items, or making exempt supplies. Taxable supplies Any goods or services you provide while carrying on your taxable activity. Turnover The total value of the taxable supplies in all your taxable activity, including grants and subsidies you receive or barter transactions, excluding any GST. This is not your profit because your expenses are not deducted when determining your turnover.
GST guide Working with GST IR375 April 2024 blank Important changes ‘Tax invoice’ requirements replaced by ‘taxable supply information’ From 1 April 2023, the requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as taxable supply information. Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. For more information about taxable supply information go to page 8 of this guide, or ird.govt.nz/gst ‘Debit note’ and ‘credit note’ requirements replaced by ‘supply correction information’ From 1 April 2023, debit and credit note requirements to correct previously issued tax invoices, have been replaced with requirements to provide and keep supply correction information. Supply correction information must be provided when the taxable supply information (for example, invoice) included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a taxable supply they have made. For more information about supply correction information go to page 18 or ird.govt.nz/gst GST adjustments for business, private or exempt use From 1 April 2023, • • When you acquire goods or services for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you can choose to use the principal purpose method or the apportionment method for claiming GST. • • The number and the value of the adjustment periods have changed. Fewer adjustments are required for land, as well as goods and services $20,000 or less. • • You can elect to treat goods as non-taxable supplies when their principal purpose is not for use in your taxable activity. 3 Contents Introduction 4 Non-resident GST rules 4 GST registration 4 Filing in myIR 4 Filing in accounting software 4 Part 1 - Explaining GST 5 What GST is charged on 5 Understanding your basic GST requirements 6 What GST is not charged on 7 Record keeping 8 Taxable supply information 8 Part 2 - How to complete and file GST returns 11 The GST return 11 Completing your return 11 Which paper form do I use? 11 GST 101A 12 GST 103 14 Supply correction information 18 Details supply correction information must include 18 Supply correction information for price changes 18 Reduction of the agreed price 18 Increase of the agreed price 18 Filing your GST return 19 If you do not file your return, or file it late 19 If you do not make your payment, or pay late 20 Correcting an error in your GST return 20 Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration 21 Should I deregister from GST? 21 Part 4 - Adjustments 23 Other adjustments 32 Part 5 - Supplies 37 Exempt supplies 37 Zero-rated supplies 37 Not eligible for zero-rating 38 Special supplies 38 Part 6 - Services you may need 44 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE4 Introduction This guide tells you how GST works and how businesses manage their GST obligations. Our GST Plus - IR546 guide has more information on some less frequent and/or complex GST issues. Non-resident GST rules The GST rules for non-residents depend on the circumstances of the business. If you’re a non-resident business that does not carry out activity in New Zealand, but you receive goods or services here, you may be able to register for and claim GST. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/gst/gst-for-overseas-businesses GST registration You must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities), including certain imported services you receive: • • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. A business must have a taxable activity to register for GST. A 'taxable activity' is an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods or services to another person for consideration. If you have a taxable activity, you can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? You can register for GST in myIR. The GST registration confirmation we send you includes your: • • GST number (this may be the same as your IRD number) • • registration start date • • accounting basis (the way you claim and pay your GST) • • taxable period and filing frequency (how often you need to file returns). If you register voluntarily for GST, and later decide this was a mistake, you can cancel your registration. See Part 3 of this guide for more information about cancelling your GST registration. Filing in myIR You can file your GST returns in myIR. myIR provides instant confirmation you’ve filed and faster processing of your returns. Register for myIR myIR is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Filing in accounting software You can file GST returns using accounting software. Accounting software benefits include: • • your GST return is pre-populated, so you do not need to copy figures into your myIR or paper return • • instant confirmation your return is filed. Confirm with your software provider if this filing feature is available as part of their software package. 5 What GST is charged on GST is a tax, usually 15%, charged by GST registered businesses on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Some examples of taxable activities undertaken and where GST may be charged are businesses that supply: • • services such as graphic design, hairdressing, mechanical building, painting • • products such as clothing or cars, fish and chips • • experiences such as bungee jumping, skiing, kayaking, going to the movies • • professional services such as legal advice. Adding GST to your goods or services When adding GST to the price of goods and services, multiply the amount by 15% (or 0.15) to get the GST-inclusive price. If the price already includes GST, multiply it by 3 then divide by 23 to find out the GST amount. Subtract this to get the GST-exclusive amount. Example Adding GSTSubtracting GST Product$ 100 × 15% Product $ 115 x 3 ÷ 23 GST amount$ 15GST amount $ 15 Product Plus GST amount $ 100 $15 Product Less GST amount $ 115 $ 15 GST-inclusive total$ 115GST-exclusive amount $ 100 You can also calculate the GST component by dividing the GST- inclusive price by 7.66666666. You must use at least 8 decimal places to calculate the correct GST component as using fewer decimal places can result in an incorrect answer. Using the fraction method (multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 23) will always provide you with an accurate answer. Part 1 - Explaining GST What happens to GST collected from your customers and paid on your purchases? • • You collect GST through the sale of goods and services. • • You pay GST through purchases and business expenses. When you file your GST return, you work out the difference between the amount of GST you've collected and the amount of GST you've paid. • • If you've paid out more GST than you've collected, you'll receive a GST refund. • • If you've collected more GST than you've paid, you'll need to pay the difference to us by the due date. You can only charge GST on your sales and income or claim it back on purchases and expenses if you're registered. When you receive GST from your customers, you hold this money to pass on to us. GST is not income for the business and needs to be paid to us when you file your GST return. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE6 Understanding basic GST requirements Filing GST returns You're required to file regular GST returns. You can choose your GST return filing frequency (how often you file) – monthly, 2-monthly or 6-monthly. Your taxable period for 2 or 6 monthly returns must align to your balance date. If you did not choose a taxable period when you registered, we'll put you on the 2-monthly option matching your balance date. You can apply to change your taxable period if this does not suit. Send a message in myIR telling us which taxable period and filing frequency you prefer. If we approve the change, we'll tell you when to start using your new taxable period - do not change until we confirm this with you. Your GST taxable period must align with your balance date. For example, if you file your GST returns 2-monthly and have a March balance date your taxable periods are April-May, June-July, August-September, October- November, December-January, February-March. Monthly • • You must file monthly returns if your sales are over $24 million in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. Anyone can choose to file monthly GST returns. Monthly returns may suit you if you're entitled to frequent GST refunds. 2-monthly • • Anyone with sales under $24 million in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. You can choose to file your returns in odd or even months aligned to your balance date. Filing returns every 2 months helps keep you on top of your GST requirements and in touch with your business's progress. 6-monthly • • Anyone with sales under $500,000 in any 12-month period. • • For a GST group the $500,000 applies to the group as a whole. If you use this option, you will only need to file 2 GST returns a year. This can be a big job for 6 months’ worth of trading in one go. This option is more suitable if your business does not have a large volume of transactions. When to file your returns We’ll send you a reminder in myIR, when your GST return is ready for you to file. The reminder includes the due date for filing and making any payment. The due date is usually the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period, except for return periods ending: • • 30 November – the due date is 15 January of the following year • • 31 March – the due date is 7 May of the same year. If the due date for your GST return falls on a weekend or public holiday, it will be due the next working day. Remember, file and pay on time to avoid late filing penalties, late payment penalties and interest. What are my options for claiming and paying GST? There are 3 ways of accounting for GST; payments, invoice or hybrid. You should choose the accounting basis that best suits your business. If you do not choose an accounting basis when you register, we’ll put you on the invoice basis. If you want to change your accounting basis after you've registered, you can do this in myIR. 7 Accounting basisWho is eligibleWhat you need to do Payments basisIf your total sales are: • • $2 million or less in the last 12 months • • likely to be $2 million or less in any 12-month period, beginning on the first day of a month. In your GST return for the period include: • • amounts you've been paid by customers • • amounts you've paid to suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Invoice basisAnyoneIn your GST return for the period include: • • amounts you’ve notified customers to pay by invoice, even if you have not been paid yet • • the full sale price if customers have paid any amount before you’ve invoiced them • • amounts you’ve been invoiced by suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. Even if you have not paid them yet. Hybrid basisAnyone Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. In your GST return: • • use the invoice basis for your sales • • use the payments basis for your expenses. What GST is not charged on Some goods and services do not have GST added to them. These are: • • sales by an unregistered person • • sales of private property (for example, a car or home not used for business) • • exempt supplies. Exempt supplies GST is not charged on exempt supplies, and they're not included in your GST return. These include: • • financial services such as interest payments on loans or bank fees • • donated products and services which are sold by not-for- profit organisations • • rent paid on a private home • • penalty interest. You cannot claim expenses relating to exempt supplies. You do not show income from the exempt supply in your GST return. Zero-rated supplies Some goods and services are not exempt supplies, but GST is charged at 0%. For example: • • exported goods • • sales of going concerns (selling or buying a business that will continue to run as the same type of business) • • sale of land (where certain criteria are met). If you have zero-rated supplies you can claim GST on your expenses. Payments basis Under the payments basis, account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps manage cash flow because you only pay us GST after you've received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you've paid for. You are only entitled to claim GST for purchases and expenses for which you hold taxable supply information. Invoice basis Using the invoice basis, you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you issued an invoice to your customers or received an invoice and hold taxable supply information from your supplier. Hybrid basis Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE8 In myIR include all zero-rated supplies with your total sales and income and just the zero-rated supplies amount in the next field. These are Box 5 and Box 6 for paper returns Example Joe's taxable activity is growing and selling apples. He exports some to America. Joe can claim the full cost of fertilisers and sprays used in the business. GST is not charged on the apples Joe sells to America. He enters the income as part of his sales in his GST return and then separates the amounts between the zero-rated supplies and taxable supplies. Record keeping Records must be in English or Māori unless Inland Revenue has approved keeping your records in another language. For tax records kept in Māori numerals must be 1, 2, 3 etc. Key points • • Keep all the documents supporting and explaining your GST figures. • • Keep business records for 7 years. • • Complete records save you time. • • Provide your GST number to customers as part of your taxable supply information. Good record keeping helps you complete and file your GST returns. You must: • • keep records of all your sales and income including taxable supply information and supply correction information • • keep taxable supply information and supply correction information for your purchases and expenses, such as invoices, receipts, or other documents. Decide on a record keeping system to suit your needs. For example: • • a software programme you can enter all your financial information electronically and apply formulas to calculate your GST • • a cashbook to develop your own records for your income, expenses, and GST. Make sure you have all the relevant taxable supply information (invoices, receipts or other documents), supply correction information, and bank statements for your business. This will help you find items quickly. You could set up a system by: • • date order • • supplier • • taxable period • • accounting basis for example, if you use the payments basis, file your paperwork in the month you made the payment. At some stage we may audit your business. During an audit we look at your GST records and systems. How you document and maintain your GST records is very important. For example, keeping your zero-rated invoices separate from your other invoices is a good idea because they go in a separate box on your GST return. Taxable supply information The requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as ‘taxable supply information’. Taxable supply information refers to the minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice, credit note, or debit note. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. Taxable supply information includes invoices, but it can also include information held in other forms, such as supplier agreements, contracts, and bank statements. Sellers can provide taxable supply information to a customer using an automated direct exchange between the buyer's and seller's software, for example PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement Online) eInvoicing. You need to keep taxable supply information to claim GST on your supply purchases and expenses relating to your taxable activity. You should provide taxable supply information such as an invoice, receipt or other documentation when you sell goods or services. If the sale is $200 or less (including GST), you do not need to provide taxable supply information to the buyer but both you and a registered buyer must keep your own records of the transaction for GST record keeping requirements. 9 Taxable supply information buyers and sellers must keep Taxable supply amounts $200 or less More than $200 and up to $1,000More than $1,000 Seller’s details• Name or trade name of the seller • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number Buyer’s details• Not required• Not required• Name, and 1 or more of the following: - address (physical or postal) - contact phone number - email address - trading name if different to the buyer’s name - New Zealand business number or website URL address.

Consideration can be a • payment • act • holding back from using a legal right - for example, forgiving debt instead of enforcing payment. An unconditional gift paid to a not-for-profit organisation is not consideration for a supply. • The supply amount. Taxable supply information must be provided to GST registered buyers within 28 days of a request (or by an alternative date agreed to by the parties) for supplies over $200. Amounts of money must be expressed in New Zealand currency. Taxable supply information should only be provided once. If the buyer loses theirs, you can provide a copy. You do not need to mark it as a copy. 11 The GST return To complete your return work out the difference between: • • the GST you've added to goods or services you sell, and • • the GST you can claim back from business expenses and purchases. Remember, your business sales represent your income and your business purchases represent some of your expenses. Completing your return The following information will help you complete your return. The steps are the same whether you're completing your return in myIR or on paper.

It does not matter whether the buyer has already paid for the goods or services. Examples of when corrections may be required: • • the supply is cancelled, • • all or some of the goods are returned to the seller, • • some of the goods were not delivered to the buyer, • • there is an incorrect description of the goods or services, • • incorrect seller information included, • • incorrect buyer details included, • • the date is incorrect, • • GST is calculated at the wrong rate, or • • an incorrect GST amount is charged. You can include supply correction information for a previous supply in the same document as taxable supply information, for a new supply. The seller must include the supply correction information in the GST return for the period it was provided in. Details supply correction information must include Supply correction information must include all the following details: • • the seller’s name (or trade name) and GST number • • the date the correction was provided • • details identifying the taxable supply information • • the correction to the taxable supply information including, if relevant, a correction to the amount of tax charged for the supply. Sufficient information must be provided for both parties to identify the taxable supply information being corrected. An example might be an invoice number or other details. Both buyer and seller must keep supply correction information for their records. Supply correction information for price changes Sometimes the price of goods or services will change after an invoice has been provided or a payment made. Reduction of the agreed price If you supply goods and services and reduce the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the reduction in the return period it was made in. This is usually the return when the supply correction information was provided. If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information. If you’re the buyer, you must include the reduction shown on the supply correction information in the return period covering the time of reduction. This is usually the period the supply correction information was received. Increase of the agreed price If you supply goods or services and increase the price of the supply after providing taxable supply information or receiving payment, you must include the amount of the increase in the return for the period it was made. This is usually the return for the period you provided the supply correction information. If you have already provided taxable supply information, you must also provide supply correction information for any increase in price. The buyer, must include the supply correction information in the return covering the time the increase was made. This is usually the return for the period the supply correction information was received. Examples Kevin's cleaning goods In July, Kevin sells cleaning goods to Maria for $1,000. Maria pays Kevin $900 as some goods were damaged. In his next GST return period, Kevin issues supply correction information for $100. Both Maria and Kevin use the invoice basis. Kevin includes $1,000 in his total sales in the return he sold the goods. Kevin then claims $100 in his purchases and expenses in his return covering when the reduction was made. Maria claims $1,000 in purchases in the return she received the goods and later includes $100 in the total sales in the return covering the time when the reduction for damage was made. If the taxable supply information and supply correction information were issued in the same return period, Kevin could have shown the net amount of $900 in his total sales instead. Maria could claim the net purchase of $900. This example of how adjustments are made also applies to an increase in price. 19 GST adjustments calculation sheet - IR372 If you’re filing a paper return the IR372 helps you calculate your GST adjustments. It lists the items which you need to make an adjustment for. Use the sheet to record the adjustments you need to make, then: • • transfer the figures to your GST return • • attach the sheet to your copy of the GST return • • keep full details on how you calculated the items. Filing your GST return Key points • • File your GST return in myIR at ird.govt.nz or through your accounting software. • • You're personally responsible for the accuracy of the information on your GST return. • • If you're having difficulty completing your GST return you should contact your tax agent/accountant. • • If you’re filing in myIR you can pay by direct debit when you file your return.

Yes - there are no exceptions. You must always file your GST return by the due date. If I cannot pay my GST amount what should I do? File your GST return, then you can set up a payment arrangement. Can I get an extension to the GST return due date? You cannot get an extension of time to file a GST return. If you're unable to file by the due date, you can delegate your tax agent or an employee to file for you. What are the most common items businesses can claim GST on? • • power - electricity, gas • • telecommunications - mobile phones, telephone, internet service • • motor vehicle expenses - petrol, repairs, warrant of fitness, registration • • stationery, office supplies • • repairs to business assets • • consumables, packaging • • capital, fixed assets - cars, trucks, equipment • • rent of business premises. What are the most common items businesses cannot claim GST on? • • salary and wages • • interest on a loan • • bank fees • • drawings taken from the till or stock taken from the shelf for personal use. What are some common mistakes? • • poor record keeping • • calculation errors • • not filing nil returns • • incorrect adjustments • • incorrect claiming of personal adjustments • • not informing us if your business ceases. If you do not file your return, or file it late Key points • • Late returns may get a late filing penalty. • • You may have to pay a default assessment if you do not file your return. Late filing penalties If you do not file your return by the due date you may have to pay a late filing penalty. These are: • • $50 for each return filed on the payments basis • • $250 for each return filed on the invoice or hybrid basis. Late payment penalties and interest are charged on late filing penalties not paid by the due date. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE20 Default assessments If you do not send us a return, we estimate the amount of tax we think you should pay - a default assessment. In most cases, this amount will be higher than what you actually owe. You still have to file the overdue return, even if you pay the default assessment. When we get your completed return, we'll calculate the actual amount you need to pay, plus any penalties and interest. If you make a combined payment for GST and provisional tax but do not file your return, we'll use it to pay any GST default assessment and late filing penalty first. If you do not make your payment, or pay late Key points • • Late payments may be charged late payment penalties and interest. Late payment If you do not pay a bill on time, you may have to pay penalties and interest. Contact us if you are not able to pay on time. We'll look at your payment options, which may include an instalment arrangement. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/penalties Correcting an error in your GST return If you realise you've made an error or errors in a GST return you've filed that results in an under or overstatement of your tax liability, you may be able to correct it in: • • a later taxable period and calculate the adjustment, or • • the same taxable period by amending your return in myIR. But, if you've chosen a particular tax position and then change your mind about it, you cannot correct it. Instead, you must use our disputes process. This means completing a Notice of proposed adjustment - IR770. You must send this to us no later than 4 months after the due date of the GST return it relates to. For more information How the taxpayer-initiated disputes process works Making the correction in a later taxable period Option 1 The error or errors can be corrected in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, when: • • you provided the return which contains one or more errors in the assessment of their liability for GST, and • • the total discrepancy in the assessment caused by the error is $1,000 or less. Option 2 You can correct a mistake in the taxable period following the discovery of the error, provided the purpose is not to delay the payment of tax, and the total discrepancy is equal to or less than the lower of: • • $10,000, and • • 2% of the GST collected. Option 3 You can include an unclaimed GST input tax deduction in a later return if it is within 2 years of when the claim was left out, or the error relates to: • • an inability of the registered person to get an invoice • • a dispute over the proper payment amount for the taxable supply to which the deduction relates • • a mistaken understanding on the part of the registered person, the supply the deduction relates to was not a taxable supply • • a clear mistake or simple oversight of the registered person. Record keeping You must keep these details in your GST records and make the information available to us if we ask for it: • • what GST return period the error occurred in • • the GST amount involved • • the type of error • • which GST return period you made the correction in. Interest If the reassessed GST is an amount to pay and it's over $100 we'll charge you use-of-money interest. If the amount of reassessed GST is a refund over $100, we'll pay you use-of-money interest. Penalties We may ask for more information to decide whether we'll charge a shortfall penalty. 21 If your taxable activity is stopping or slowing down, you can cancel your GST registration. If you stop your taxable activity, you must cancel your registration. Cancelling your GST registration will not close your business or organisation. You can cancel your GST registration if: • • you're closing down or selling your business • • you expect your turnover to drop below $60,000 - and stay there for a while • • you realise you are not required to be registered. If you’re going to continue your taxable activity you may still choose to cancel your registration. If you do decide to cancel, you can no longer: • • charge GST on your sales • • claim GST on your expenses. If you're considering cancelling your GST registration, you'll need to know the situations where you must cancel or have a choice in cancelling. Use our handy online tool to help you decide what’s best for your situation - Should I cancel my GST registration Part 3 - Cancelling your GST registration NoNo Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye s Have you stopped trading or closed your business? We recommend you stay registered for GST. Are you planning to restart your business or start a new business within the next 12 months? Your GST registration is not compulsory. Do you want to cancel your registration? You must cancel your GST registration within 21 days. You can cancel your registration in myIR or fill out and send us. If you stay GST registered, you must keep filing GST returns even if they are nil. You can cancel your registration in myIR or fill out and send us an IR315 form.

GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE22 When you cannot cancel If GST cannot be excluded from your prices, you cannot cancel your GST registration, even when your annual turnover is under $60,000. When you must cancel You must cancel your GST registration within 21 days if you stop your taxable activity and do not intend to start a new one within 12 months. What you need to do if you decide to cancel If you’re closing down or selling your business, you must cancel your GST registration within 21 days of doing this.

Or you can fill out a Business Cessation - IR315 form and send it to us. We'll contact you if we need more information. Otherwise, we'll send you confirmation your registration has been cancelled within 5 working days. Filing your final return You will need to file your final GST return up to your date of cancellation (this may not be the end of your normal taxable period). The date you need to do this by depends on your filing frequency. Your final return needs to cover your taxable activity between the first date of your taxable period up until your registration cancellation date. For example, if you file 2-monthly and you cancel your GST on 15 October, your final return needs to cover the period from 1 September to 15 October and needs to be filed by 28 November. You will need to account for GST on any business assets you keep. For more information about your obligations go to ird.govt.nz/gst You may need to complete the ‘debit adjustments’ or ‘credit adjustment’ sections if: • • you are keeping any assets the business owns • • the business owes money to a creditor • • any debtors owe you money. Use the open (current) market value of assets you are keeping. For assets bought before 1 October 1986, the value will be the lesser of the cost price and the open market value. For assets bought on or after 1 October 1986, work out the GST on the asset using this formula: (open market value x 3) ÷ 23 The open market value is the value of the asset as if you sold it today. You need to return the GST of the value of the asset in your final GST return, regardless of the accounting basis you use. When you’re part of a GST group There are different criteria and processes to cancel a GST group registration. For more information go to Cancelling a GST group Businesses with separate branches or divisions If you are the parent body of a business with separately registered branches or divisions you can cancel any of those registrations at any time. You will need to take over the GST responsibilities of any of the branches or divisions which are no longer separately registered for GST. If a parent body cancels its own GST registration, all the separate registrations of its branches or divisions are automatically cancelled. Note If you're liable to pay provisional tax the due dates will change if you were registered on a six-monthly basis or you use the GST ratio method to calculate your provisional tax. For more information see our Provisional tax guide - IR289. 23 Key points • • Electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies - you can elect to treat some goods such as land, dwellings and vehicles, as non-taxable supplies when their principal purpose is not for use in your taxable activity. • • When you acquire a good or service you may need to apportion GST between your business (taxable activity), and your private or exempt use. You can claim a percentage portion of the GST for the taxable use only. • • You may need to make change in use adjustments for the goods or services more than $10,000 (exclusive of GST), if the percentage of business to private or exempt use changes. • • Change in use adjustments are not required if: – the GST exclusive cost is $10,000 or less – the change in taxable use is less than 10% and the value of the adjustment is $1,000 or less. • • Change in use adjustments are made annually and the number of adjustment periods depends on the value and if the goods are land. • • Special wash-up rules need to be applied if you later sell a good or service where you’ve previously apportioned the GST, or you cancel your GST registration (deregister). • • Special rules apply to the concurrent use of land for taxable and non-taxable purposes. More detailed information and examples are contained in this adjustment section. Many small businesses get help from their accountant/tax agent with apportioning and making GST adjustments. Electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies You can choose to treat some goods as non-taxable supplies. This only applies to goods such as land, dwellings and vehicles when the principal purpose for acquiring and use of the good is not for making taxable supplies. If you choose to treat a good as a non-taxable supply, you do not have to add GST to any future sale of the good. To qualify, the following criteria must be met: • • you have not previously claimed a GST deduction for the goods • • the goods were not acquired or used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies • • the goods were not acquired as zero-rated supplies (see below for the exception). Once applied, you do not need to monitor the use of the good at the end of each GST adjustment period. Part 4 - Adjustments Example Rebecca has a small farming business. Her farmhouse is used to help run her GST business, but the principal purpose is for her private residence. When Rebecca bought the farmhouse, the seller was not registered for GST, so the purchase was not zero-rated. Rebecca chose not to claim any GST on the purchase, and any capital improvements she makes relating to the farmhouse. Rebecca can elect to treat a future sale of the farmhouse as a non-taxable supply for GST purposes. This means if the use does not change, Rebecca will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the farmhouse. The land used for farming would still be subject to GST. Rebecca can still claim part of her operating costs costs such as rates, insurance, and utilities, based on the percentage of the farmhouse used for making taxable supplies. Output adjustment for zero-rated supplies There might be situations where you acquire zero-rated goods, but the principal purpose of the goods is not for making taxable supplies. To treat the goods as non-taxable, you can make a debit adjustment for the GST you would have been charged, if the goods were not zero-rated (nominal GST amount). Example Gavin is GST-registered. He buys a holiday home for $1 million from another GST-registered person. The sale was zero-rated for GST purposes. The principal purpose for buying the house is for a family holiday home. However, Gavin also intends to rent out the property for short term accommodation. Gavin can choose to make the future disposal (sale) of this property a non-taxable supply, by returning output tax of $150,000 in his next GST return (the nominal GST amount that would have been charged, had the purchase not been zero-rated). If the property use does not change, Gavin will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of the holiday home. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE24 Transitional rule for goods acquired before 1 April 2023 You may want to apply a transitional rule to goods acquired before 1 April 2023, if the principal purpose for acquiring the good was not for use in making taxable supplies. The transitional rule allows you to make a debit adjustment for the percentage of GST already claimed. This means any future disposal or sale of those goods can be treated as a non-taxable supply. If you choose to use the transitional rule, you need to: • • return any GST you have previously claimed by making a debit adjustment in your GST return • • notify Inland Revenue by sending a message in myIR, before 1 April 2025. When the transitional rule is applied, future disposal of those goods can be treated as a non-taxable supply. Once applied, future adjustments may only be required if the use of the goods changes to principally making taxable supplies. Example Mary is registered for GST. She bought a lifestyle block next to her beef farm in March 2022, for $1.15 million dollars from a non-GST registered seller. Mary’s principal purpose for buying the property was for long-term residential rental. The property included some land which Mary uses in her beef farming business. Only 25% of the total property value relates to her farming activity. Mary claimed GST of $37,500 in her March 2022 GST return. In September 2023, Mary decides to use the transitional rule for the lifestyle block and sends Inland Revenue notice of the change. Mary also makes a debit adjustment of $37,500 in her September 2023 GST return to pay back the percentage of GST she claimed in March 2022. If the property use does not change, Mary will not have to charge GST on a future sale or disposal of this property. Apportioning GST for business, private or exempt use You acquire a good or service when you either purchase it or introduce it into your business (taxable activity). When you acquire a good or service used in your business, and used privately, or to make exempt supplies, you may need to apportion the GST amount you can claim. This is based on the percentage estimate it will be used in your business, and the value of the good or service. Examples of goods commonly used in a business and privately, include: • • your home when you have a home office • • vehicles • • cell phones • • laptops. Example of a taxable and exempt supply A retirement village providing independent style accommodation and rest home/hospital style units must apportion costs relating to the rest home/hospital activity (taxable) and the independent unit activity (exempt). GST can only be claimed on the taxable portion. Home office expense If you are using your home as part of your business, GST can be claimed on the portion of the running costs relating to your taxable activity. You must keep full records of all expenses, and how you’ve apportioned your business and private use. Your apportionment must take into account: • • time spent on income-earning activities • • the percentage area used in your taxable activity (either exclusively or mixed business and private use). You cannot claim GST on any private or domestic expenses. Please note any claims for the purchase of the property itself or any capital improvements made to your home may make a future sale of the property subject to GST on the full sale amount. You can elect to treat principally private assets as non-taxable. Read our section on Electing to treat goods as non- taxable supplies on page 23 for more information. 25 Goods and services $10,000 or less When you acquire a good or services for $10,000 or less (excluding GST), you can choose to use the principal purpose method or the apportionment method for claiming GST. 1. Principal purpose method You need to determine whether the principal purpose is for making taxable supplies. This test determines if the GST on the good or service is claimable or not claimable. When the principal purpose is for making taxable supplies: • • you can claim the full amount of GST • • you do not need to make a GST adjustment if the principal purpose changes later. Example Phil is a GST registered contractor. He buys a laptop for $3,000 plus GST of $450, to use in his business for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Phil will also use it occasionally for private use. Phil can claim the full amount of GST charged ($450) as an expense in his next GST return because the principal purpose of the laptop is for business use. When the principal purpose is not for making taxable supplies: • • you cannot claim the GST • • you cannot later make any GST adjustments if the principal purpose of the good or service changes. 2. Apportionment method - $10,000 or less You can choose to claim the business percentage of goods and services, using the apportionment method (regardless of the principal purpose for acquiring the good or service). Change in use adjustments in future periods are not required for goods and services $10,000 or less. If you choose the apportionment method, you’ll need to use this for all goods and services acquired for $10,000 or less for a minimum of 24 months. You cannot change to using the principal purpose method for future purchases during this time. Example Amy has a GST registered business. She buys a car for $9,000 plus GST of $1,350, principally for private use but will sometimes use it in her business. Amy estimates her business use at 20%. If Amy chooses to use the principal purpose method, she cannot claim any GST as the GST exclusive price is $10,000 or less and the principal purpose of the car is not to make taxable supplies. Using the apportionment method, Amy can claim 20% of the GST in her next return. Amy needs to apply the apportionment method to all goods and services for a minimum of 24 months. Goods and services over $10,000 When goods or services over $10,000 (GST exclusive) are acquired for business and private use, or to make exempt supplies, you must apportion the amount of GST you can claim based on your business use. You cannot use the principal purpose method for goods and services over $10,000. You will need to work out your business use based on how the good or service will be used, or is available to use, then calculate a percentage estimate of the GST amount you can claim in your next return. You can choose how you work out the percentage of business use, as long as it gives a fair and reasonable result. This can be based on past records, experience, business plans or another suitable method. For example, if the asset is a car replacing an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of working out the intended use of the replacement car, provided the patterns of use will be relatively unchanged. After the initial GST claim for goods and services over $10,000: • • You must review the business use each year for any change affecting the apportionment between business, private or exempt use. The number of adjustment periods depends on the GST exclusive value and if it is land. • • You may need to make a change-in-use adjustment for the GST claimed if the actual use is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. • • Adjustments can only be made annually, in the GST return aligning with your balance date. More information about the number of adjustment periods is on page 26. When adjustments are not required You do not need to make an adjustment if the GST exclusive cost of the good or service is $10,000 or less. For goods and services over $10,000 you do not need to make an adjustment if: • • the change in taxable use is less than 10% and the value of the adjustment is $1,000 or less • • you make taxable and exempt supplies, and the total value of exempt supplies in the adjustment period is less than both: ·· $90,000, and ·· 5% of total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE26 Example A dairy spends $16,000 (exclusive of GST) on renovations. A major part of the dairy's business involves making taxable supplies. However, the dairy also runs a debtors' account and charges interest on any late payments (exempt supplies). Since the total value of the interest charged (exempt supplies) in the first adjustment period is expected to be less than both $90,000 and 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies made, the dairy is not required to apportion the input tax in relation to the renovations. Annual review and adjustments for change in use You must keep track of goods and services used in your business and for private or exempt supplies. Adjustments may be required when there is a change from your original estimate and the GST amount claimed. Change in use adjustments are accounted for annually, in your GST return aligning to your balance date. A method applied to determine taxable 'use' must be fair and reasonable. Examples • • 31 March balance date and a 2-monthly GST filing, the adjustment is included in February/March GST return aligning with the balance date. • • 30 June balance date and a 6-monthly GST filing, the adjustment is included in the January/June GST return aligning with the balance date. Choosing your adjustment period You can choose your first adjustment period to be from the date you acquire the good or service, until the end of either: • • the income year of acquisition (balance date) • • the income year (balance date) at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. Each adjustment period after this is the same as your income year. You cannot make change in use adjustments in other GST periods. Number of adjustment review periods The number of adjustment periods depends on the GST exclusive cost of the good or service: GST exclusive cost Adjustment periods $10,000 or lessNot required $10,001 - $20,0002 $20,001 - $500,0005 Over $500,000 or land (of any value)10 You may also choose the maximum number of adjustments based on the estimated useful life of the asset. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/rate-finder Example - Ben Ben operates a business and files 6-monthly GST returns in September and March. Ben has a 31 March balance date. In May he buys a car to use in his business for $28,750 including GST of $3,750. Ben estimates the car will be used 80% for business use and claims $3,000 GST in his September GST return. $3,750 × 80% = $3,000 Because the GST exclusive cost is $25,000, Ben needs to keep track of his business and private use for 5 adjustment periods. Adjustment period 1 At the end of the income year, Ben’s actual business use of the car is 100%. Ben makes a change in use adjustment to claim the remaining 20% of the GST ($750) in his October - March GST return (as this is the period aligning to his balance date). Ben needs to keep track of his car’s business use for 4 more adjustment periods as the GST exclusive cost is between $20,001 and $500,000. Change in use adjustments less than 10% and $1,000 or less in value You cannot make a change in use adjustment if the percentage of actual taxable use is less than a 10 % change from either the original intended use, or previous actual taxable use if you’ve already made an adjustment, and the adjustment amount is $1,000 or less. Example – less than 10% and $1,000 or less (Ben) Ben’s been keeping track of his business and private use for the car he bought the previous year for any more change in use. He’s already made one adjustment at the end of the income year he bought the car. During adjustment period 2, Ben’s wife Carly uses his business car for 19 days while her car is being repaired. At the end of the adjustment period, Ben’s worked out the difference for private use was less than 10% and $1,000 or less. He does not need to make an adjustment in period 2 but he still needs to check for changes in business use for 3 more adjustment periods. Example - Miriama Miriama bought a car for $34,500 including GST of $4,500 12 months ago to use in her taxable activity. She estimated her business use at 50% and claimed half of the GST ($2,250). 27 At the end of her first adjustment period, she has used the car 59% of the time in her business activity (9% more than she estimated). Because the difference is less than 10% and the change in GST value is $1,000 or less, ($450) Miriama cannot make any adjustment this period. If her business use of the car increases in a future adjustment period by 10% or more from her original estimate or the value is over $1,000, she can make an adjustment for the difference. Calculating actual use Actual use is always measured from original acquisition of the good or service. You must compare the percentage actual use of goods and services with: • • the percentage intended taxable use of the goods and services (if no previous adjustment has been made), or • • the previous actual taxable use (if you have made a previous adjustment for the goods and services). Example • Identifying percentage actual use and percentage intended/ previous use Peter has a 31 March balance date and files 2-monthly GST returns. Peter acquires a luxury boat on 1 October for $575,000 including GST of $75,000. He intends to use the boat 100% in his charter business and claims the full input tax deduction of $75,000 GST in his October/November GST return. Based on the GST exclusive value of the boat ($500,000), Peter monitors his business use for 5 adjustment periods. Peter’s actual taxable use of the boat during each adjustment period is: – Adjustment period 1 - 100% – Adjustment period 2 - 80% – Adjustment period 3 - 83% – Adjustment period 4 - 50% – Adjustment period 5 - 90% Adjustment period 1 is the income year ending 31 March, 6 months after Peter bought the boat. All other adjustment periods are 12 months. Peter makes the required adjustments in his February/March GST return at the end of each adjustment period. The following calculations work out the actual taxable use over the 5-year period, compared to Peter’s original estimate of intended taxable use, and adjust the GST originally claimed on acquisition for any non-taxable use. Adjustment period Intended use/Previous actual use % Percentage use in this adjustment period % To t a l months since acquisition Calculation details % Percentage actual use since acquisition % Change from previous adjustment period +/- % GST adjustment ($75,000 x % difference Pay back/claim) Acquisition100($75,000) 1100 1006100 x 6/61001000$0.00 2100 8018100 x 6/18 80 x 12/18 33.3 53.3 86.6-13.4$10,050 386.6 8330100 x 6/30 80 x 12/30 83 x 12/30 20.0 32.0 33.2 85.2-1.4$1,050 485.2 5042100 x 6/42 80 x 12/42 83 x 12/42 50 x 12/42 14.3 22.9 23.7 14.3 75.2-10.0$7,500 575.29054100 x 6/54 80 x 12/54 83 x 12/54 50 x 12/54 90 x 12/54 11.1 17.8 18.4 11.1 20.0 78.4+3.2($2,400) Overall result 78.4When Peter acquired the boat, he estimated it would be used 100% for making taxable supplies. Over the 5 adjustment periods the boat’s actual use in making taxable supplies was 78.4% ($75,000 x 78.4% = $58,800). Peter accounted for the changes in actual use at the end of each adjustment period. The total of annual adjustments is $16,200 (the difference between $75,000 and $58,800). Total GST adjustment $16,200 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE28 Adjustment period 1 (6 months from acquisition to the end of the income year) Peter does not need to make an adjustment for this period as his actual business use did not change. Adjustment period 2 Peter must make a debit adjustment for his non business use for the difference in GST he claimed when he bought the boat. This is calculated as 13.4% of $75,000. He includes $10,050 as a debit adjustment in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 2. Adjustment period 3 The difference in use from adjustment period 2 and 3 is a decrease in overall business use of 1.4%. The percentage is less than 10% but the value is $1,050, so Peter makes another debit adjustment for $1,050 in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 3. Adjustment period 4 The difference in business use from adjustment period 3 and 4 is a decrease in business use of 10%. Peter makes another debit adjustment for $7,500 in his GST return at the end of adjustment period 4. Adjustment period 5 The difference in business use from adjustment period 4 is an increase in business use of 20%. This time Peter makes a credit adjustment in his GST return for $2,400 at the end of adjustment period 5. After adjustment period 5 Peter no longer needs to make any further adjustments. If he sells the boat later, he will need to account for GST on the sale. Wash-up rule A wash-up adjustment is used when the business, exempt or private use of good or service changes and you do not expect it to change again. Work out the adjustment using this calculation: (full GST amount x new percentage) – actual deduction = wash-up adjustment • • The full GST amount of the good or service. For a zero-rated land transaction, this would be 15% of the purchase price. • • New percentage is the percentage of intended taxable use. • • Actual deduction is the GST previously claimed, including adjustments. If you make a wash-up adjustment and there is no change to the new percentage, you'll no longer have to make annual adjustments. The wash-up adjustment is made in the adjustment period (aligned to your balance date) after the permanent change in use is made. If your good or service changes in use later, you’ll need to make another adjustment. This adjustment needs to be made when the use changes and remains unchanged for a full adjustment period, even if the change is within the 10% or $1,000 threshold. Example – permanent change in use Tōtara Ltd is registered for GST. The company acquires an apartment building for $23m from an unregistered person. Tōtara uses 80% of the building to make exempt supplies of rental accommodation and leases the remaining 20% to Rimu Ltd who are also registered for GST. Rimu uses these apartments to supply commercial hotel accommodation units and serviced apartments. The 20% portion is a taxable supply. Tōtara claims a $600,000 deduction in the GST return period they acquire the building (3/23 x $23m = $3m potential secondhand goods input tax claim on total building, $600,000 is 20% of $3m). After 24 months, Tōtara negotiates a long-term commercial lease with Rimu to supply 50% of the building for Rimu’s commercial accommodation business. The long-term lease is a permanent change from 20% to 50%. Tōtara makes an adjustment to claim $900,000 being the difference in taxable use of 30% (additional 30% of the $3m input tax) at the end of their next adjustment period. Final adjustment on disposal of an asset used in a taxable activity You need to make a final adjustment when you dispose of the asset, to allow for any GST which has not been claimed. Use the following calculation to work out the final adjustment: Tax fraction x Consideration x (1 – Previous use) • • Where the tax fraction is 15% of the GST exclusive amount or 3/23rds of the GST inclusive amount. • • The consideration is the amount received, or treated as received, for the supply. • • Previous use is the percentage intended taxable use (if sold in the first adjustment period) or the previous actual taxable use at the end of the last adjustment period before disposal. Example Melissa buys a car for $46,000 (inclusive of $6,000 GST). She claims 70% input tax of $4,200. The car is later sold for $34,500 (GST inclusive). The sale of the car is in the course of her taxable activity, so the full sale amount is subject to GST. Melissa returns $4,500 as output tax (sales). Melissa’s final use of the car on sale is 100% taxable. As Melissa had not claimed for full business use of the car, she makes a final adjustment, calculated as follows: 29 Melissa works out the tax fraction of $34,500 (3/23) as $4,500 and multiples this by her private use (30% or 0.3). Melissa can claim an additional adjustment for $1,350. 3/23 x $34,500 x (1 – 0.7) = $1,350. Melissa includes the full $34,500 as sales and income in her GST return, and in her purchases and expenses, she includes a credit adjustment for $1,350. Example – Peter Peter sells his boat on 30 September, 6 years after acquisition for $460,000 including $60,000 GST. The sale of the boat is in the course of his taxable activity, so the full sale amount is subject to GST. Peter’s final use of the boat on sale is 100% taxable. Because the boat had some non-taxable use, Peter makes a final adjustment on disposal. In our earlier example for Peter, his last recorded taxable use adjustment was 78.4%. Peter makes a final adjustment on disposal as follows: 3/23 × $460,000 × (1 – 0.784) = $12,960 Peter includes both the output tax of $60,000 and credit adjustment of $12,960 in his August/September GST return. Maximum adjustment for property developers If you’re a property developer, your final adjustment cannot exceed the tax fraction of the purchase price when you first acquired the asset. Example: Property developer Emily, a property developer bought an apartment to renovate and rent. The input tax on the cost of the property plus renovations was $60,000. Emily claimed 64.8% of the total input tax - $38,880 because the property had a mix of taxable and exempt use. Emily sold the apartment for $640,000. As Emily has not claimed the full input tax for the purchase and renovation cost she makes a final adjustment of the input tax: 3/23 × $640,000 × (1 – 0.648) = $29,384 When Emily adds $29,384 to the deduction already claimed ($38,880), this is more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply ($60,000). As Emily is a property developer selling land, her adjustment is limited to $21,120. Special rule for concurrent use of land The portion of a deduction you should be entitled to claim must correspond with the extent to which you use the asset for taxable purposes. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one particular time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking your children to school - but usually not both at the same time. In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same time, for example, a property developer may supply a house as a dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. For the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income). The following formula will help you in apportioning between concurrent uses of land: consideration for taxable supply × 100% = (percentage of taxable use) total consideration for supply The 'consideration for taxable supply' is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The 'total consideration for supply' is the sum of the amount of the 'consideration for taxable supply' described above, and: • • the amount of all rental income derived from the supply of a dwelling since the land was acquired, and • • if no rental income is paid or payable in relation to the non- taxable use of land, the market value of rental income that would have been derived from the time of acquisition of the land if rental had been charged. You may apply for an alternative approach if this formula does not fit your circumstances. The market value must be used in determining consideration for taxable supply and/or total consideration for supply if amounts derived under those definitions are by associated persons or are not arm's-length amounts. If the market value of the land or rental income is not readily identifiable, the person may use another method to provide a fair and reasonable estimate of the market value. Example Sandy, a property developer, built 2 similar residential houses, house A and house B, next to each other. The construction cost of each house is $230,000 (including GST of $30,000). Sandy intends to sell both properties on completion (a taxable use) and claims a full deduction on the GST incurred on construction. Sandy is unable to sell the properties immediately on completion. So, while still advertising the houses for sale, she: • • rents out house A and receives rental income of $26,000 in the first adjustment period, and • • moves into house B and lives there rent free. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE30 Just after the end of the first adjustment period, Sandy sells house B for $360,000. House A - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and exempt purposes (supplying a residential dwelling), she needs to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is either the amount derived on disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. Sandy has not disposed of house A, but ascertains the market value of the house is approximately the same as for house B ($360,000). The total consideration for supply is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the amount of all rental income ($26,000) derived from the supply of the dwelling since the land was acquired ($386,000). Sandy's taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 As Sandy had originally claimed 100% on acquisition, she has therefore claimed 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 House B - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period Because Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable purposes (advertising for sale) and private purposes (residential), she has to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The consideration for taxable supply is the amount derived, or would be derived, on a disposal of the house ($360,000). Because Sandy did not rent out house B, but still used it for non-taxable purposes, the total consideration for supply, is the amount of the consideration for taxable supply ($360,000) and the market value of the rental income she would have derived if she had rented out the property. Sandy estimates she would have received $26,000 of rental income. Her taxable use of the house is: $360,000 ×100% = 93% $386,000 Sandy has deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this amount to us: $30,000 × 7% = $2,100 In both cases, Sandy may be able to recover some or all of the unclaimed input tax if she later disposes of the houses in the course of her taxable activity. An additional formula estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. The formula is: months × result total months • • 'Months' is defined as the number of months since acquisition in which all or part of the land is used to some extent for making taxable supplies. • • 'Total months' is defined as the total number of months since acquisition. • • 'Result' from calculation to establish the percentage of taxable use. Example The facts are the same as in the previous example and the length of the first adjustment period was 12 months. In the second adjustment period, Sandy continues both letting out house A and advertising it for sale. However, 6 months after the start of the second adjustment period, Sandy stops advertising house A for sale because she decides to permanently rent it out. In the second adjustment period, she receives rental income of $30,000. The market value of house A at the time of the adjustment is still $360,000. At the end of the second adjustment period, Sandy identifies the taxable use of the house. For the purposes of the second adjustment period, the total consideration for the supply is the sum of the market value of the house and all rental income received since the land was acquired: (360,000 + 26,000 + 30,000 = $416,000). $360,000 × 100% = 86.5% $416,000 However, because the house has been used for 6 months solely for making non-taxable supplies, she has to calculate the percentage actual use: 18 × 86.5% = 64.8% 24 Sandy's percentage actual use of house A in the second adjustment period is 64.8%. The percentage actual use must be compared with the 'previous actual use', with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For Sandy, the previous actual use will be 93%. So Sandy has deducted 28.2% (93% − 64.8% = 28.2%) more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to us: $30,000 × 28.2% = $8,460 31 Special rule for calculating use of some assets Periods from 1 April 2024 The specific mixed-use asset rules are being repealed for periods from 1 April 2024. The general GST apportionment rules requiring a fair and reasonable apportionment method should be applied. While no longer compulsory, the mixed-use asset apportionment method can be used or continue to be used as a fair and reasonable method. You do not need to apply for Commissioner approval to use or continue to use the mixed-use asset method. For more information on general apportionments and adjustments refer to Part 4 – Adjustments on page 23. Periods prior to 1 April 2024 Until 31 March 2024, special rules may apply to purchases of the following assets costing $50,000 or more and related expenses: • • land for example, holiday home • • ships/boats • • aircraft. If you purchase one of these assets you must use a specified formula to calculate 'use' if the asset is: • • used partly to earn income and partly for private use; and • • not in use for 62 days in the income year (or 62 working days if the asset is typically only used on working days). The rule does not apply to assets of a company (unless it is a close company). They also do not apply if any private use is minor and subject to FBT and the main business use for the asset is not a rental or charter business. You can claim a deduction when mixed-use assets are acquired, and when you acquire goods and services that relate to both income-earning and private use of a mixed-use asset (mixed- use expenses), to the extent that they will be used for making taxable supplies. The estimate of how you intend to use the goods and services should take into account the formula for the adjustment for mixed-use expenses below. Then, for the first adjustment period and subsequent adjustment periods, an adjustment is required for mixed-use expenses if the actual use of the mixed-use asset is different from the intended use. The formula used to calculate the adjustment for mixed-use expenses is similar to the calculation used to determine your deduction for income tax, and is based on income-earning days and private use days of the asset. The formula to calculate the adjustment is: total amount of input tax × income-earning days income-earning days + private days Formula definitions • • 'Input tax' is the total input tax for the mixed-use expenses, including the cost of the asset (excludes input tax relating solely to non-taxable and taxable use) • • 'Income-earning days' is the total number of days when rent or a fee is paid for the use of the asset, regardless of the amount paid. Includes consideration received from family, non-associated persons, and when the asset is being repaired or relocated • • 'Private days' is the total number of days the asset is used with no amount of rent or fee paid. Using alternatives to 'days' You can use other measures in the formula if they reflect the time use of the asset more accurately. For example: • • flying hours for an aircraft • • nights for a holiday home. Example Regan purchases a charter boat on 1 April 2017 for $450,000 (GST inclusive) which is used both to earn income and for private use. He accounts for GST input tax for the year as follows: Fully deductible expenses Annual Maritime NZ survey fees $700 Charter advertising $400 Food/drinks (charter guests only) $500 Regan claims the full input tax and no adjustment is made as the expenses relate solely to income-earning. Not deductible $250 for family fishing licenses is a private expense, so no GST input tax is claimed. Apportioned (mixed-use) expenses There are apportioned (mixed-use) expenses that relate to both income-earning and private use, so Regan needs to work out how much GST he can claim. Mooring fees $2,000 Fuel $1,200 Insurance $2,450 General repairs $300 Total expenses $5,950 GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE32 When Regan acquired the boat, he estimated that the taxable use would be 50%. He claimed input tax on the mixed-use expenses of $29,735.86 (credit) as follows: ExpenseCostGST value50% input tax claimed Purchase of boat $450,000$58,695.65$29,347.82 Mooring fees, insurance, fuel $5,950$776.09$388.04 Total input tax $29,735.86 Income-earnings days Days fully chartered to the public 102 Days chartered at 50% market rate 20 to Regan's local fishing club Total 122 Private days Days the family used the charter boat 30 without making any payment income-earning + private days = 152 Total input tax (boat $58,695.65 + mixed-expenses $776.09) = $59,471.74 The calculation is: $59,471.74× 122 =$47,733.90 input tax 152 Regan claimed input tax of $29,735.86 during the year. He is entitled to claim a further amount of $17,998.04 (credit) as an adjustment for input tax in Box 13 of his final GST return of the year. The calculation is: $47,733.90− $29,735.86=$17,998.04 If the amount of input tax calculated for the actual use of the asset was less than the input tax claimed during the year, the difference would be a debit adjustment added in Box 9 of the GST return for further GST to pay. Other adjustments Barters You can also exchange goods and services for other goods or services, or a combination of goods, services and money - this is b ar ter. If the exchange is for other goods and services, you must account for 3/23 of the open (current) market value of whatever you received in return for your supply. When part of the exchange is money, you must include: • • 3/23 of the open (current) market value of the goods and services you received, as a debit adjustment in your GST return, and • • the money received in the total sales box of your GST return. Use this rule whichever accounting basis you're on. You might also receive goods and services in full (or part- exchange) for your supplies from another person. Between you, work out a dollar value for the exchange, for example a trade-in. You must include this agreed value, plus any money involved, in Box 5 of your GST return. Insurance payments received If you receive an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, include 3/23 as an adjustment in the GST return that covers the time you received the payment. For example, an insurance company makes a payment to cover equipment damaged in a fire. GST shown on New Zealand Customs documents The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) collects GST when: • • goods are imported into New Zealand. Customs charges GST on the landed value (including insurance , freight and duties) for the goods. • • excisable goods (alcohol, fuel and tobacco) manufactured in New Zealand are removed from a licensed manufacturing area for home consumption. Customs collects any applicable levies and any GST on those levies. Documents issued by Customs (such as a Customs import entry form C4, a Deferred payment of duty statement or Broker account statement) can be used to support a claim for a GST credit. Remember, you must hold these supporting documents to make a claim. Do not include imported goods under purchases on your GST return. When to account for GST paid to Customs The table below explains when to account for GST paid to Customs, depending on your accounting basis. For more information about GST on imported goods go to the New Zealand Customs Service customs.govt.nz (search keyword: importers) or call 0800 428 786. If you use theyou invoice basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document as a credit adjustment or in Box 13 of the paper GST return for the period you receive the invoice or make a payment, whichever is earlier. payments or hybrid basisclaim the GST content shown on the Customs document as a credit adjustment or in Box 13 of the paper GST return for the period you make the GST payment. 33 StepWhat to do 1Take the total taxable value of all fringe benefits from your FBT return. (This is the amount of the benefits, not the FBT itself.) 2Subtract the value of any benefits which are exempt or zero-rated supplies for GST. The most common ones are: • • low-interest loans • • other financial services • • international travel • • contributions to employee superannuation and life insurance policies. The result is the fringe benefits liable for GST. 3Multiply the result from step 2 by 3 then divide by 23. This is the GST adjustment to include in your FBT return. Include this adjustment in: • • Box 7 of the quarterly FBT return (IR420) for quarterly filers • • Box 6 of the annual FBT return (IR422) for annual filers • • Box 6 of the income year FBT return (IR421) for income year filers. Example: Taxable benefits for FBT quarter ended 31 March 2021 Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Low-interest loans $ 425 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Subsidy on employee's honeymoon trip $ 600 Total $ 3,682 Benefits liable for GST are: Motor vehicles $ 2,605 Magazine and newspaper subscriptions $ 52 Total $ 2,657 The low-interest loan and subsidy for the honeymoon are not included because loans are exempt supplies and international travel is a zero-rated supply. The amount of the GST adjustment is $346.57 ($2,657 × 3 ÷ 23). Enter this in Box 7 for the FBT return for the quarter ended 31 March 2021. Pay the adjustment when your FBT for the March quarter is due. If an employee makes a payment direct to the employer towards a fringe benefit, this is a separate supply and is liable for GST. Include this payment as income in Box 5 of the GST return. The time of supply is the same as for any other sale by the business. Example An employee has paid $100 cash direct to the employer. Add the $100 to the sales in Box 5 of the GST return. The GST to pay on the $100 is $13.04. FBT (fringe benefit tax) Companies and employers registered for FBT do not need to make a private use adjustment. But, they will need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Sole traders, partnerships and trusts registered for FBT may still have to make a private use adjustment if the owner, partners, trust members or associated persons use business assets privately. They also need to make a GST adjustment for any fringe benefits liable for GST. Make the adjustment in the FBT return period you provide the benefits in. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE34 If you...you make the adjustment in the GST return that covers... do not have a tax agentthe date your income tax return is due or filed, whichever is the earlier date. Example If your 2023 income tax return is due on 7 July 2023 and you do not have a tax agent, you need to make your GST adjustment in the GST return which includes that date. have a tax agentthe earlier of: •• the date your income tax return is filed, or •• 31 March after the due date for your income tax return. have a tax agent who has an extension of time to file your income tax return the date your income tax return is actually filed. If an employee contributes to the expense, treat this as a separate supply for GST. Include the total expense amount in Box 11 on your GST return as usual and show the employee contribution in Box 5. Because the GST adjustment is based on the amount which is not deductible for income tax, organisations that are not liable for income tax, for example, not-for-profit organisations and charities, do not need to make this adjustment. Calculating the adjustment for entertainment expenses The table below explains how to calculate the adjustment for an entertainment expense using the example on the right. StepWhat to doExample 1To work out the GST, multiply the expense by 3 then divide by 23.$230 × 3 ÷ 23 = $30 2Subtract GST from the entertainment expense. $230 − $30 = $200 3Work out the amount that is not deductible for income tax (50%).$200 × 50% = $100 4Multiply the non-deductible amount by 15% (or 0.15). This is your GST adjustment. Show this GST adjustment on your GST adjustment calculation sheet - IR372 under 'Entertainment expenses'. Transfer the total amount to Box 9 of your GST return for the period ending 31 October. $100 × 15% = $15.00 Before 1 April 2018 the GST component was calculated by multiplying by 3 and dividing by 23 (for example, $100 × 3 ÷ 23 = $13.04) at step 4. Example XYZ Ltd's only entertainment expense in the tax year was a business lunch for clients. The lunch cost $230 including GST. The income tax return for the year ending 31 March is filed on 7 July, and the company files six-monthly GST returns for the periods April and October. XYZ makes the adjustment in the GST return for the 6 months ending 31 October. The full $230 would have been included in Box 11 of an earlier GST return to claim the GST credit. Entertainment expenses Business entertainment expenses are related to taxable income and are incurred in the course of running a business. Usually, only 50% of business entertainment expenses are deductible for income tax. Read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide for details. You'll need to make a GST adjustment of 15% of the GST-exclusive non-deductible amount once a year. You cannot claim GST on private entertainment expenses, for example, a restaurant lunch with friends. During the year, keep showing your total business entertainment expenses on your GST return. The table below explains exactly when to make the adjustment depending on whether a tax agent prepares your income tax return. 35 Telephone expenses Cellphones If you have a business cellphone, you can claim GST on the total set-up cost. If you use the same cellphone for private use, you can claim GST on these running costs: • • total fixed cost of running the phone • • business calls. How to claim for telephone line rental See the table below. If you...you... have a commercial and domestic line rentalcan claim the GST on the full cost of the commercial line. Include the commercial rental cost in Box 11 on your GST return. You cannot claim any part of the domestic rental. have only one telephone line rental and use it for business and private purposes can claim GST on 50% of the cost. Show 50% of the rental in Box 11 on your GST return. The line can be commercial or domestic. want to claim more than 50% of your rentalmust show that the actual business use of your telephone is greater than 50%. The proportion of business toll calls to private toll calls may be one factor in working out the overall business use. You'll need to consider other factors, for example, your type of business and how many people live in the house. are a farmermay claim the full cost of telephone rental used for business and private purposes. Include the full rental in Box 11 on your GST return. make business-related callsmay claim the full amount of GST on these calls. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE36 Bad debts written off If you supply goods or services services and return GST on an invoice basis, but later write off all or part of the consideration as a bad debt, you can make a credit adjustment in the period you write it off. How you do this depends on your accounting basis - see the table below. If you use the...you... invoice or hybrid basisaccount for a sale when you issue an invoice. If you've already included the GST on the sale in a previous return, and then later write off the debt, you'll use this adjustment. payments basiswill not account for the GST on a sale until you actually receive it. If you do not receive payment and write the debt off, you cannot claim a deduction, because you have not included the GST on the sale in any previous GST return. You may make an adjustment for door-to-door sales and hire purchase agreements if you use the payments basis. Calculating a credit adjustment Show 3 / 23 of the full amount you've written off on the calculation sheet and include it in Box 13 of your GST return. You do not need to send in any documents supporting the write-off, but you do need to keep a record of the steps you took to recover the debt. For example: • • a debtor's ledger showing the date you issued the invoice • • letters from a solicitor/debt collector trying to recover the debt • • a bad debts ledger showing the write-off. You must write off the debt(s). You cannot claim for provision for bad debts. Example Brent, who uses the invoice basis, issues Chris with an invoice dated 26 October for electrical goods worth $115 including GST. Brent accounts for the sale in the return for the period ending 31 October. In the following March, Brent gives up hope of receiving payment from Chris and writes off $115 as a bad debt. Brent shows $115 × 3 ÷ 23 on his IR372 under 'Bad debts written off' and includes it in Box 13 of his GST return for the taxable period ending 30 April. GST not charged on the full price If the bad debt was for goods or services where GST was not charged on the full price (for example, the fifth week of a hotel stay, or a hire purchase sale), the GST adjustment is not simply 3 / 23 of the bad debt. Use this formula to calculate the adjustment: bad debt written off ÷ total consideration × GST included in consideration = GST adjustment Example Sue stayed at the Holiday Hotel for 6 weeks. Her total bill was $6,005.57. Sue leaves, still owing $1,000. After some time, the hotel writes off the $1,000 as a bad debt. The amount of GST included in the total bill is $602.57. The hotel must make an adjustment in its return which covers the period of the write-off: $1,000 ÷ $6,005.57 × $602.57 = $100.33 Bad debts recovered If you've had a GST deduction for a bad debt written off and you later recover all or part of the debt, you must make an adjustment for the amount recovered. Include 3/23 of the amount recovered as a debit adjustment in your GST return. Example Manu, who uses the invoice basis, wrote off a bad debt of $2,500 and later recovered $1,600. He must make an adjustment of $208.70 ($1,600 × 3 ÷ 23) at the time of recovery, even if he's changed his accounting basis since then. 37 Exempt supplies Some goods and services are exempt from GST so you do not include them in your GST return. These include: • • financial services • • penalty interest • • renting a dwelling for use as a private home • • residential accommodation under a head lease. Financial services These include: • • paying or collecting any amount of interest • • mortgages and other loans • • bank fees • • securities such as stocks and shares • • providing credit under a credit contract • • exchanging currency (for example, changing US$ into NZ$) • • arranging or agreeing to do any of the above (for example, mortgage broking) • • financial options • • provision or transfer of ownership of a financial option • • deliverable future contracts • • non-deliverable future contracts. For more information see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 16, No 10 (November 2004). Penalty interest Interest charges on overdue accounts are treated as exempt supplies. Example If you sell goods to another supplier on a 30, 60 or 90-day account basis, and the account becomes overdue, any penalty interest chargeable on the non-payment should not be included in your GST return. You do not pay GST on fines and penalties you get for a statutory offence, for example, parking penalties or infringement fees issued by courts or local authorities. Renting a residential dwelling The rent for a residential dwelling is exempt from GST. A landlord cannot claim GST on any expenses, such as maintenance, rates, and insurance. If a residential dwelling is sold as part of a taxable activity, and it was rented for at least 5 years beforehand, the sale is an exempt supply. If a property developer acquires a property for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply and then subsequently rents the property out, a change of use adjustment may be required. Residential accommodation under a head lease In most cases, if a property is leased as residential accommodation under a head lease, both the supply of the head lease and the sub-lease are exempt supplies. Zero-rated supplies Some supplies are zero-rated for GST and taxed at 0%. Restraint of trade Any payment you receive in return for not conducting a taxable activity outside New Zealand is zero-rated. Internet sales A registered New Zealand-owned entity selling goods or services through the internet to customers in New Zealand must charge GST at the usual rate. But, a New Zealand-owned entity selling goods or services through the internet to overseas buyers will generally charge GST at 0%. We expect sellers to take reasonable steps to check where the customer lives and where the goods or services are going. Sale of a going concern A going concern is a business sold 'lock, stock and barrel' or is part of a business that can operate independently. The business must be a going concern at the time of sale, right up to the time of the transfer to the buyer. A supply of goods or services must meet these criteria to be a going concern: • • It must be the supply of the whole or stand-alone part of a taxable activity, from one registered person to another. • • It must be the supply of all the necessary goods and services for the activity to continue. • • Both parties must agree in writing there is a supply of a going concern. • • Both parties must intend the activity is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the buyer. The sale is zero-rated for GST if it meets all these criteria. Example Pat, a dairy farmer, sells his dairy farm (including land, herd, all buildings and all machinery) to another GST-registered farmer. This qualifies as the sale of a going concern if both parties agree. If Pat had sold the land and buildings but kept the machinery and the herd, it would not qualify as a going concern. The sale of the land and buildings may still be zero-rated, see land transactions in this guide. Part 5 - Supplies GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE38 But, if he'd sold parts of the farm that could have been operated separately as a going concern, the sale would be zero-rated. Land transactions A GST-registered person must zero rate a supply, if the supply wholly or partly includes land, and: • • is made to another registered person, and • • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies, and • • it is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence by the recipient or a relative of the recipient. To be a zero-rated supply, the above conditions for zero-rating must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction. If any of these conditions are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply will be taxed at 15%. Refer to ird.govt.nz/gst/charging-gst Not eligible for zero-rating Services performed in New Zealand for a third party Services performed under contract to a non-resident who lives outside New Zealand, delivered to a third party in New Zealand, and where it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract is entered into the services will not be received by the third party in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies, are not eligible for zero-rating. GST is charged at the standard rate of 15% if supplied to non- residents, but the supply is received in New Zealand. Example A Singaporean family wants their child to receive a year's education in New Zealand. The parents contract a New Zealand school to supply the tuition. The supply of the tuition is not zero-rated because the child will receive the tuition in New Zealand, and it was reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into, the child will not receive the tuition in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Example A non-resident tour operator buys accommodation from New Zealand hotels and puts them into travel packages for tours of New Zealand. The travel packages are then sold to non-resident tourists. The supply of accommodation contracted between New Zealand hotels and the non-resident tour operator is not zero-rated because it's reasonably foreseeable another person (the non-resident tourist) will receive the services in New Zealand and will not receive the accommodation in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. Special supplies Special supplies are different from the normal business sales or purchases. Accommodation The supply of residential accommodation in a dwelling is exempt from GST. However, GST may be included for accommodation in a commercial dwelling. Commercial dwellings include: • • hotels, motels, homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast establishments, inns, hostels or boarding houses • • some serviced apartments • • convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes or hospice • • camping grounds • • other commercial dwellings. A commercial dwelling does not include a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when it is supplied with the right to occupy. If your taxable activity is running a commercial dwelling, you can calculate the GST on the accommodation in 2 ways. 4-week rule Commercial dwellings - residential establishments, for example boarding hostels or rest homes For the first 4 weeks' stay, charge GST on the full value of accommodation in the dwellings. After 4 weeks, charge GST only on 60% of the value of the domestic goods or services, usually the right to occupy the premises. This may include any of the following: • • cleaning and maintenance • • electricity, gas, air-conditioning or heating • • telephone (not tolls), television, internet, radio or similar chattels. Example Lauren stays for 6 weeks at the Comedy Hotel. The GST- exclusive costs are: 42 nights at $104 per night $4,368 Food and laundry $1,035 39 Comedy Hotel INVOICE Lauren Hardie GST No. 987-654-321 71 John Street Christchurch 08 April 20 XX 28 days (first 4 weeks) at $104 per night$2,912.00 GST (15% of $2,912.00)$436.80 $3,348.80 14 days (after 4 weeks) at $104 per night$1,456.00 60% of $1,456.00$873.60 GST at 15%$131.04$131.04 $1,587.04 Food and laundry$1,035.00 GST at 15% $155.25 $1,190.25 Total due$6,126.09 Main Street PO Box 36 363 Phone: (04) 333 6666 WELLINGTON WELLINGTON comedyhotel@hotmail.com This is how they calculate the amount for their GST return: first 28 days $ 436.80 next 14 days $ 131.04 food and laundry $ 155.25 total GST charged $ 723.09 $723.09 × 23 ÷ 3 = $5,543.69 is included for sales and income. If a joint charge covers all supplies for bed and breakfast, the fully taxable supplies (breakfast) must be identified separately from the domestic goods or services (bed). Residential establishment, - boarding hostels, resthomes If you and the guest agree the stay is for longer than 4 weeks, you must charge GST on 60% of the value of domestic goods or services from the beginning of their stay. Advance payments A supplier who receives advance or progress payments must account for the GST on the payments. These are inducements for a supply of goods, not financial services (which are exempt supplies). Example Tina is a fruit grower. She receives an advance payment from her marketing board and accounts for it like this: She includes the advance payment in total sales and income in the same period she receives it. If, for some reason, Tina has to pay back all or part of the advance she received from the marketing board it will be treated as a loan. As a loan, the advance will be exempt from GST because it's a financial service. The marketing board may claim a GST credit for the advance payment made, as long as they hold the necessary taxable supply information (such as an invoice or other documents). If the advance is later repaid, it must be included in total sales and income. Any interest is exempt because it's a financial service. A GST-registered agent who is involved in the transaction must account for GST on any commission or fee they charge. Auctions and auctioneers Ownership of goods under auction never passes to the auctioneer. Auctioneers sell goods on behalf of others (principals). An auctioneer may not know whether the principals are registered for GST, or whether to charge GST on a particular lot. The sale of goods on behalf of a non-registered principal is not taxable. The sale of a registered person's private assets is generally not taxable. The auctioneer can charge and account for GST as though making the taxable supply, as long as both the principal and the auctioneer agree to this arrangement. If the principal is registered, the GST-inclusive sale price, less commission, is passed on to the principal who must account for GST. If the principal is not registered, the auctioneer will pass the GST-exclusive sale price, less commission, on to the principal. An auctioneer who is registered for GST must account for the GST on fees or commissions. Auctions may be held on either a GST-inclusive or a GST-exclusive basis. The auctioneer should state this clearly at the beginning of the auction, so the bidders know whether or not their bids include GST. Delayed settlement transactions A vendor registered for GST on a payments basis who enters into a property transaction with a delayed settlement date must account for GST when an invoice is issued or when payment is received, whichever happens earlier, when the price of the property exceeds $225,000 including GST. This does not apply if: • • the supply is made under a short-term agreement for the sale and purchase of property - under one year • • the supplier is a not-for-profit organisation and at the time of supply, the recipient is not a registered person and is either:  not intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity, or  intending to use the goods and services for the purposes of carrying on a taxable activity but only after the full amount for the supply is paid to the supplier. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE40 Door-to-door sales The time of supply is the first day after the period in which the purchaser may cancel the sale. If you're a door-to-door salesperson, your buyers have either 7 days or 1 month to cancel the sale depending on the cancellation period. You account for the supply in the taxable period covering the day after the final date for cancellation. Example Selena Wares, a door-to-door salesperson, sells an item on 31 May, the last day of the taxable period. Day 8 after the sale is 8 June. She includes the full price for the supply in the taxable period covering 8 June. If you purchase from a door-to-door salesperson, you can claim a credit in the taxable period covering the first day after the cancellation period (provided you hold an invoice). This applies even if you get an invoice or make payment before that date. Full price not known at the time of supply Sometimes, a final price is not settled until after the goods or services are physically supplied. If you're supplying goods or services like this and you use the invoice or hybrid basis you include GST on the known component of the price in the earliest period of when you: • • issued an invoice for any part of this supply, or • • have a payment due, or • • received a payment. If you use the payments basis, you will account for the supply when you receive payments. Example Andy sells produce to an exporter for a down payment plus an end-of-season catch-up, based on export prices. Andy accounts for the down payment immediately. He accounts for the catch-up payment when it's due, received, or when an invoice is issued - whichever is earlier. However, if you buy goods or services when you do not know the full price and you use the invoice basis, you claim a credit in the earliest taxable period you: • • receive an invoice, or • • make a payment, or • • have a payment due. You must hold taxable supply information to support any claim. For purchases under the payments or hybrid basis, claim a credit when you make a payment. Gaming machines Gaming machine operators must register for and pay gaming machine duty. They must also pay GST on the value of the gaming machine revenue. This is the difference between: • • the increase in metered turnover • • less the increase in metered total wins during a return period. The amount of any jackpots won during that return period is also deducted from total turnover if the jackpot figure is not included in the metered total wins. When accounting for GST, gaming machine revenue is calculated from the records you're required to keep for the Department of Internal Affairs. Where your monthly machine analysis reports or cashless gaming machine analysis reports are prepared to coincide with the last day of your taxable periods, you can use them to calculate the gaming machine revenue. You also pay problem gambling levy (PGL) on gaming machine profits. You can claim back the GST on PGL. For more information read our Gaming machine duty guide - IR180 guide. Grants and subsidies Any grant or subsidy you receive in relation to your taxable activity from the Crown or a public authority, is considered to include GST if you're registered for GST. Include the full grant or subsidy with total sales and income in your return. Example Helen employs 10 staff. She gets a $200 wage subsidy each week for 8 weeks. The GST content is $208.69. $200 × 8 (weeks) $ 1,600.00 $1,600 × 3 ÷ 23 $ 208.69 Helen includes $1,600 as sales in her return. There is an exception for grants intended for international overseas development. You have to return GST on the portion of the grant allocated for administration and capacity building in New Zealand. If you receive a government grant or subsidy, you do not normally need to provide taxable supply information. However, if you receive a grant or subsidy, for example, a research grant, from another registered person, they will probably ask you for taxable supply information. If you pay a grant or subsidy in exchange for taxable supplies, you may request taxable supply information and claim a GST credit. Hire purchase agreements You must account for all hire purchase sales in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever accounting basis you use. If you buy goods on hire purchase, you may claim a deduction in the taxable period covering the date you enter into the agreement. This rule applies to whichever accounting basis you use. 41 Insurance If you get an insurance payment relating to your taxable activity, you are usually required to include the GST content as a debit adjustment in the return which covers the time you received the payment. Example Damien's distilling equipment was damaged by fire on 20 January. An insurance company paid the claim on 18 March for $4,500 to cover the damage. Damien includes $586.95 ($4,500 × 3 ÷ 23) as a debit adjustment in his return for the taxable period covering 18 March. You do not account for any payment received under a life insurance contract, because the insurer cannot charge GST on the premiums. Some types of insurance premiums are liable for GST (for example, fire and general insurance). A registered insurer may claim deductions for payments to policy holders when they are made. An invoice is not needed. The insurer will need taxable supply information to deduct any other payments for claims on policies, for example, a payment to a panelbeater for repairs to an insured vehicle. Insurers cannot claim for payments made under life insurance policies. Lay-by sales The time of supply is the date the buyer gets legal possession of the goods. If the sale is cancelled and the seller keeps part of the money, the time of supply is the cancellation. Include the full cost of a lay-by sale in the taxable period in which the buyer takes ownership of the goods. This is the time of the final payment. Do not account for the lay-by payments as you receive each one, but wait until you receive the final payment, even if you use the payments basis. Example Sue buys a chair on lay-by from a furniture shop in January. The full price is $560. Sue pays $160 as a deposit, and instalments of $200 in February and March. The chair is delivered in April. The furniture shop accounts for GST in the taxable period covering March, because that's when Sue became the owner. If a lay-by sale is cancelled and the retailer keeps some of the payments already made (or receives any later payments), they account for this amount in the taxable period which the sale was cancelled in. GST is calculated on the full amount kept, or received later, and it must be included in the return. Example Sue cancels the agreement with the furniture shop in February and gets a $300 refund. She loses $60 for doing this, which the furniture shop accounts for in the taxable period covering February. If you buy goods on lay-by, you may claim a deduction when you have fully paid for them, and you have taxable supply information. When you cancel a lay-by sale, you may claim 3 / 23 of any cancellation charge made by the supplier, in the same period you cancel the sale, as long as you have taxable supply information. Local authority rates Local authorities are the only GST-registered organisations which charge rates. The time of supply for rates is on the earlier of: • • the date of an instalment notice for a single payment, or • • the due date for payment, or • • the date when payment is received. Registered people may claim GST for rates payments for premises used in a taxable activity. If you use the invoice basis and you pay your rates in one lump sum, you may claim for GST when you make the payment or receive an invoice, whichever comes first. If you pay rates in instalments, you may claim the GST when each instalment is due or paid, whichever comes first. For the payments and hybrid basis, you claim GST for rates when you make payment, if you hold taxable supply information. Periodic payments and hire agreements Periodic payments and hire agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. The time of supply is the date payment is due or received, whichever is earlier. Private dwellings as part of taxable activity If a registered person buys a taxable activity that includes a dwelling, it may be treated as a separate supply (exempt). If the dwelling is treated as a separate supply, to claim a GST credit, the purchaser must prove how the dwelling will be used as part of the taxable activity. Repossessions When a buyer does not keep up their payments in a hire purchase arrangement (debtor), the seller will usually repossess the goods and resell them. The original buyer (not the repossessor) is considered to supply the goods to the new purchaser if there is a forced sale. GST GUIDE INLAND REVENUE42 If the goods sold are used in a taxable activity, the repossessor must account for GST on goods sold after repossession, unless the repossessor has: • • a written statement from the debtor, or • • reliable information, for example, from the debtor's accountant or solicitor, that the goods would not be a taxable supply if the debtor sold them. The repossessor will need to file a GST return for goods sold in satisfaction of debt - IR373. Example Brett sells a $1,200 fridge on hire purchase to Maria for her restaurant. Brett accounts for GST of $156.52 ($1,200 × 3 ÷ 23) in the return covering the period in which the agreement was made. Maria does not keep up the payments. Brett repossesses the fridge and sells it again. He then files an IR373. The sale after repossession, and the GST to be accounted for on it, is considered to be made by Maria. Sale of interest in a taxable activity In an unincorporated body, for example, a partnership, joint venture or trust, the body is the registered person, not the individual members. So, if a member sells an interest in the unincorporated body, it's a private transaction between 2 people and not a taxable supply and there's no GST to account for. Secondhand goods For GST, secondhand goods are goods previously used and paid for by someone else. Secondhand goods do not include: • • new goods • • primary produce - unless previously used • • goods supplied under a lease or rental agreement • • livestock • • secondhand goods consisting of any fine metal of any degree of purity (except to the extent the goods are composed of gold, silver, or platinum manufactured for sale to the public). Land is secondhand goods. The same rules for GST and record keeping apply to secondhand goods as for all other goods liable for GST. Secondhand goods if seller is not GST-registered If the seller is not registered for GST or the goods are private (exempt), there is no GST charged. If the purchaser is GST- registered they can claim a credit. To do this the purchaser must record: • • the name and address of the supplier • • the date of the purchase • • a description of the goods • • the quantity of the goods • • the price paid. You'll also need to keep details of the transaction if you're going to make a claim for income tax purposes. It does not matter which accounting basis you use; you must make a payment before you can claim the credit for the purchase. Successive supplies and progress payments The 'time of supply' is when a progress payment is made or when an invoice is provided, whichever comes first. Goods or services must be either: • • supplied progressively or periodically, and paid for in the same way, or • • supplied directly in constructing, manufacturing, or extending a building, or civil engineering work, with payments made periodically as the work progresses. If you get progress payments and you use the invoice or hybrid basis, account for the GST in the earliest taxable period a payment is due or received, or when you provide an invoice for that payment only. For the payments basis, account for GST when you receive payments. If you're making progress payments under the invoice basis, you may claim a GST credit in the earliest taxable period a payment is due, when you make a payment, or when you get an invoice for that instalment. You must have taxable supply information to support any claim. You claim a credit in the taxable period you make a payment in if you're using the payments or hybrid basis. Supplies to associated persons Special rules apply if you make certain supplies to people closely associated with you, for example, relatives, closely connected associated companies or trusts. See definition of associated persons. Supply to registered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who can claim a GST credit for the purchase, you account for GST on the amount received. Example Jones, Smith and Brown, a GST-registered partnership, sells a piano to Lee, a sister of one of the partners. Lee is registered for GST and can claim GST on the purchase. The open (current) market value of the piano is $2,000, but the sale goes through for $1,500. The partnership accounts for GST of $195.65 ($1,500 × 3 ÷ 23). 43 Supply to unregistered associated persons If you supply goods or services to an associated person who cannot claim a deduction, you must determine the open (current) market value of the supply and account for the market value, or the amount you charged, whichever is the larger amount. In the previous example, if Lee was not registered for GST, the partnership would account for GST of $260.87. This is the $2,000 market value multiplied by 3 then divided by 23. Include transactions with associated persons in the return for the taxable period when the supply was made. If you get a payment or issue an invoice before the last date for filing the return, use either the payment date or invoice to work out which taxable period the supply falls in, depending on your accounting basis. Example A partnership has a 2-month taxable period. The return for the period ended 30 April is due on 28 May. The partnership supplies goods with an open (current) market value of $135 to a non-registered brother of one of the partners on 24 April and receives payment of $100 on 16 June. The partnership will account for $17.61 GST (on the market value of $135) in the return for the taxable period ended 30 April, because this is the period when the supply was made. If the partnership had issued an invoice or received payment during May (before the April return was due to be filed), the $17.61 GST would be included in the return for the taxable period ended 30 June because the invoice or payment would fall in the June period. Time of supply between associated persons Claim a deduction in your return for the taxable period when the supply is made available, removed, or performed and you hold taxable supply information. However, if you make a payment or receive an invoice before the last date for filing the return for that taxable period you should instead claim the deduction in the taxable period: • • you make any payment or an invoice is issued (whichever is the earlier), if you are an invoice basis taxpayer; or • • you make payment, if you are on payments or hybrid basis. Telecommunications – mobile roaming services Outbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used outside New Zealand by a person with a New Zealand registered mobile device and their usual network is in New Zealand. These services are subject to GST of 15% Inbound mobile roaming services These are mobile roaming services used by a non-resident who is in New Zealand and their usual mobile network is outside New Zealand. These services are zero-rated for GST if supplied by a resident or treated as being made outside New Zealand (and so not subject to GST) if supplied by a non-resident. Tenders A GST-registered person may call tenders for a future supply of goods or services. The advertisement should state whether the tenders need to include GST. Occasionally, the person making a tender will have to pay a deposit. There is not usually any GST on a deposit unless all or part of it is kept for some reason. Tokens, stamps and vouchers There are special rules for the sale of tokens, postage stamps and gift vouchers. The supplier should treat tokens, stamps and vouchers as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer buys them. GST can be accounted for when the customer actually exchanges the voucher for the monetary value of the goods or services bought, if both suppliers agree. Example A petrol station owner sells an oil company's $20 petrol voucher to a customer. The petrol station owner collects the $20 for the oil company and forwards it to them. The customer gives the voucher to a friend who buys petrol at another petrol station. Because there's an agreement between the petrol stations to return the GST on redemption of the voucher, the second petrol station tells the oil company they have sold petrol (goods) in exchange for a $20 petrol voucher. The oil company reimburses the second petrol station owner for the sale, who accounts for the GST on the $20 by including the total amount of the sale in their GST return. This option does not apply to postage stamps and vouchers sold to a non-resident for services performed in New Zealand. The supplier has to account for GST on these items when the customer buys them. Buying tokens, stamps and vouchers Where GST applies on the supply, you can claim tokens, stamps, and vouchers as an expense when you buy them, according to your accounting basis if you hold taxable supply information.

It includes any activity that supplies or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration but not necessarily for profit.

IR395 August 2021 Approved issuer levy (AIL) A guide for payers The information in this booklet is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. Introduction If you pay interest to a non-resident lender you can apply to be an approved issuer. This means, instead of deducting non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), you must pay a levy of 2% on the securities you register with us. The levy is calculated at a rate of 2% of the value of the registered security. The value is the amount of interest paid on the security, or any redemption payment on a bond issued at a discount. For certain bonds the levy can be reduced to 0%. Find out how you can be an approved issuer and learn the main requirements for: • approved issuer status • registration of securities • payment of AIL, and • zero-rated bonds. Pages 16 to 18 explain the terms used in this guide. 3 Contents Part 1 - General information 5 Zero-rating of NRWT on interest 5 Agreements in writing 5 Approved issuer status 6 Cancelling approved issuer status 6 Completing your end-of-year tax return 6 No longer paying AIL 6 Record keeping 6 Part 2 - Registering securities 7 Registering a security 7 The criteria for registration 7 Part 3 - Zero rating AIL 8 Criteria 8 Widely held test 8 Part 4 - Filing and payments 9 Paying approved issuer levy (AIL) 9 How to make payments 12 Late payment 12 AIL overpaid 13 Paying AIL instead of deducting NRWT 13 Part 5 - Services you may need 14 Terms we use 16 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 4 Part 1 - General information Zero-rating of NRWT on interest Interest payments can have a zero rate of NRWT if all the following conditions are met. • You are not associated to the non-resident lender. Separate associated person rules apply where a bank, or a financial sector business similar to a bank, borrows from an associated person. • You must apply to be an approved issuer. You can do this in myIR. • You must have registered with us all the securities on which the zero rate of NRWT is to apply. You can do this in myIR. Learn more about registering in Part 2 of this guide. • The non-resident lender and you must agree that AIL applies. We recommend that this agreement be in writing. • From the amount of interest paid to the non-resident lender an additional 2% AIL must be paid to us by the due date. If you make a payment after the due date include any interest and late payment penalties. Interest payments that do not satisfy the conditions for zero-rating are subject to NRWT. Agreements in writing There is no set format for giving written notices of interest paid to non-resident lenders under the AIL rules. However, we suggest the notice should show that: • the interest is not taxable in New Zealand, and • NRWT hasn't been deducted from the interest. If the cost of the AIL is to be recovered from the non-resident lender, it must be shown as a fee or charge on any written notice to the non-resident lender. AIL is a charge in addition to the interest. If you're entitled to claim a tax deduction for the cost of the amount borrowed, the AIL payment can also be claimed. Note Zero-rating of NRWT is different to zero-rating of AIL. 5 Approved issuer status You must apply to be an approved issuer. You can do this in myIR at ird.govt.nz/myIR If your application is approved, your approved issuer status begins from the date we receive your registration. If we find you to be responsible for serious default or neglect of your tax responsibilities during the two years before the date we receive your notification, we will cancel your application. Cancelling approved issuer status 1. Approved issuer status lasts until it’s cancelled. If your status is cancelled, zero- rating cannot apply to new securities. Cancelling does not affect existing registered securities. 2. You may also ask for your status to be cancelled. Completing your end-of-year tax return You can claim a deduction of 2% on all the AIL you’ve paid in that tax year in your New Zealand income tax return. The overseas interest you’ve paid must be tax deductible. No longer paying AIL If you stop paying AIL permanently you need to let us know and we’ll close your AIL account. You can do this in myIR. Record keeping You need to keep full records of all the AIL you pay, and details of the registered securities. You must keep your records for seven years and they must be in English or Māori unless you get approval from us to use another language. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional three years if auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297. APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 6 Part 2 - Registering securities Only securities that have been registered with us qualify for a zero rate of NRWT. Most securities can be registered, including variable principal debt instruments, New Zealand bank accounts of non-residents and standard offshore loans and bonds. You can register two types of securities. • A transaction involving money lent to you. This is a transaction where the two parties, amount involved and term can be clearly identified. • A class of transactions involving money lent to you. This is where you're involved in more than one transaction. Securities can be registered as a class if the first definition does not apply. Registering a security If you do not already have approved issuer status, you can apply to be an approved issuer when you register your first security. You can apply and register one security in myIR. All other securities must be registered separately on an Application to register security or securities IR396 for approved issuer levy (AIL) or zero-rating - IR397. You must tell us about any changes to your securities before maturity or redemption, as this may affect whether AIL still applies. You can send a secure email in myIR to do this. The criteria for registration Securities will be registered if these criteria are met: • an application is completed, and • the security relates to money lent on or after 1 August 1991. Government stock qualifies for AIL, even if it was issued before this date. We’ll confirm your securities are registered within 20 working days. If we do not cancel your application within this time, your securities will automatically register. 7 Part 3 - Zero-rating AIL AIL can apply at zero % on interest that is paid for debt securities (Bonds) that meet certain criteria. To qualify for the zero rate on interest payments the security must: • be denoted in NZ dollars • either: - be a regulated offer in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, or - be an offer of financial products that are of the same class as quoted financial products in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (and also meet other specific criteria), or - be an offer of debt securities issued by a registered bank, in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013; or - have been offered to the public in terms of section 3 of the Securities Act 1978 before it was repealed, and • not be issued as a private placement • not be an asset-backed security • be conducted through a registry and paying agent with a fixed establishment in New Zealand, and • be listed on the stock exchange or satisfy a widely held test. Widely held test To meet the widely held test a security must: • be held by 100 separate persons who the issuer could reasonably assume are not associated at the time the test applies, and • have no person or group of associated persons holding a 10% or greater interest at the time of applying the test. APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 8 Part 4 - Filing and payments Paying approved issuer levy (AIL) You (or a person on your behalf such as a nominee company) can pay interest to non-residents at a zero rate of NRWT on the securities you register. AIL is calculated at a rate of 2% of the value of the interest you've paid to your non-resident lender. For certain bonds this rate is reduced to zero %. You must file your AIL information and pay your AIL electronically unless you have an electronic filing exemption. You can apply for an exemption if you are unable to supply your AIL information electronically. In considering your request we will assess: • your capabilities • the digital services available to you • the compliance costs to you. Go to ird.govt.nz/filing-exemption for more information. Due date Your AIL return and payment must be completed by the 20th of the month following the month interest was paid. If you expect to pay less than $500 AIL in any income year, you may pay on a six-monthly basis. If the due date falls on a weekend or a New Zealand public holiday, the due date is the next working day. AIL of $500 or more each year If you pay AIL of $500 or more each year, the due date for payment is the 20th of the month following the month the interest was paid. 9 Example Monthly payer Each year, Lucy's Lovely Apartments Ltd is liable for AIL payments of more than $500 on the interest credited to its customers' accounts. In February 2021 it has $1,000 AIL to pay, March 2021 $1,000 AIL to pay but no AIL for April 2021. It must pay the AIL to us as follows: Month interest paid Total AIL to payTotal paid to usDue date for payment and return February 2021$1,000$1,00021 March 2021 March 2021$1,000$1,00020 April 2021 April 2021NilNil- AIL of less than $500 each year If you expect to pay less than $500 AIL in any income year, you may complete returns and pay on a six-monthly basis. • 1 April to 30 September - due for payment on 20 October • 1 October to 31 March - due for payment on 20 April. If your AIL payment accumulates to $500 during the year, you must complete a return and pay by the 20th of the month after AIL reaches $500. Example Six-monthly payer Luca's Investments Ltd pays less than $500 AIL each year, so may pay the deductions to us by the two regular six-monthly payment dates. Month interest paid Total AIL to payTotal paid to usDue date for payment and return June 2021$ 50Nil- August 2021$ 50Nil- September 2021$ 100$ 20020 October 2021 November 2021$ 100Nil- February 2022$ 100$ 20020 April 2022 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 10 Example Six-monthly payer with accumulated AIL over $500 Nala's Investments Ltd estimated its annual AIL liability for the 2021 income year to be less than $500. However, in December 2020 it reached the $500 threshold. Nala's Investments Ltd must pay the AIL to us by the 20th of the month which follows the month when the accumulated AIL reached $500. Nala's Investments Ltd must also pay monthly for the rest of the 2021 income year. Month interest paid Total AIL to payTotal paid to usDue date for payment and return June 2020$ 50Nil- August 2020$ 50Nil- September 2020$ 100$ 20020 October 2020 December 2020$ 300$ 30020 January 2021 January 2021NilNil- February 2021NilNil- March 2021$ 50$ 5020 April 2021 No AIL to pay Returns show as optional in myIR so if no interest was paid and you have no AIL to pay for the month, you do not need to file any income information. If zero-rate of AIL applies You must report any interest you paid that qualifies for the zero-rate of AIL by the payment due date. If you do not do this any zero-rated interest will be subject to AIL at 2% where it would have normally been zero-rated. 11 How to make payments Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: • internet banking • credit or debit card • direct debit You can also call 0800 257 777 to pay by credit/debit card over the phone. When making a payment, include: • your IRD number • the account type you are paying • the period the payment relates to. Late payment Standard rate AIL We may charge you interest if you do not make your tax payment by the due date. We'll also charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment. If you have a good payment history we may contact you before we do this. Otherwise an initial 1% late payment penalty will be added the day after the due date. We'll charge a further 4% penalty if there is still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) seven days after the due date. Every month the amount owing remains unpaid after the due date we'll charge a further 1% incremental penalty. Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Zero rate AIL If the return is not received by the due date, any zero-rated interest will be subject to AIL at 2%. The payment of this AIL will need to have been paid by the same due date for that return or penalties and interest will apply to the outstanding amount based on a 2% AIL payment due on the same date. APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 12 Example Corporation Ltd pays interest on bonds of $100,000 in June which qualify to be zero- rated if the return is completed by 20 July. The return is completed on 1 August which is late. As the return is completed late the interest on bonds will be subject to the standard levy rate of 2%. This levy would need to be paid by the 20 July (the due date for any levy payable for June) to avoid late payment penalties and interest. Arrangements If you’re unable to pay your tax in full by the due date, you can set an instalment arrangement in myIR. You can do this before or after the due date for payment but penalties charged will be less if you set up the arrangement before the due date. For more help See our Penalties and interest - IR240 guide. AIL overpaid Paying AIL instead of deducting NRWT A decision to pay AIL instead of NRWT cannot be retrospective. If you’ve paid AIL on some interest but should have deducted NRWT, you need to let us know. AIL is paid on interest at the rate of 2%. As the NRWT rates are higher than the AIL rate, you’ll have under-deducted tax. Let us know which periods you under-deducted and how much NRWT you should have paid and we’ll transfer the payment to your NRWT account. If you do not have a NRWT account, we will ask you to register for one. You’ll have to make an extra payment to cover the shortfall. You may also be liable for a late payment penalty and possibly a shortfall penalty. For more information about shortfall penalties, see our Penalties and interest - IR240 guide. 13 Part 5 - Services you may need 0800 self-service numbers Our 0800 self-service numbers are open 7 days a week - except between 5am and 6am each day.

This allows the approved issuer or a person on their behalf, to pay interest to a non-resident without having to deduct NRWT. Approved issuer levy (AIL) AIL is a payment generally calculated at the rate of 2% of the interest on a registered security. This is the amount of interest paid for the security, or any redemption payment on a bond issued at a discount.

APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 16 Bonds (qualifying) Where a bond issue meets certain requirements instead of paying AIL at 2%, a zero rate applies. Fixed establishment A place of business from which a substantial business is carried out, such as a retail shop, hotel, factory or farm. A property let for rent is generally seen as an investment rather than a business. Interest Interest is any amount paid or credited for money lent and covers redemption payments. Leviable value Leviable value is: • the amount of interest paid on a registered security • any redemption payment on a bond issued out at a discount. Redemption payments are included in the definition of interest for NRWT purposes. Non-resident passive income (NRPI) This is interest, dividends and royalties which a non-resident has received or is considered to have received from New Zealand. NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) This is a tax deducted from NRPI. Anyone who pays NRPI must deduct NRWT and pay it to us each month. The rate of NRWT to deduct depends on the type of income and where the recipient is resident. For more information about NRWT, read our NRWT - payers guide - IR291. Redemption payment This is the additional amount paid on the commercial bill when the total amount paid is more than the amount originally borrowed. Registered security This is any transaction involving money lent to an approved issuer that is: • registered by us, or • one of a class of transactions registered by us. 17 Resident A person is a tax resident if they: • have an “enduring relationship” with New Zealand • have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, or • are away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. A person who has been a New Zealand tax resident will become a non-resident if they: • no longer have an enduring relationship with New Zealand, and • are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. A company is a resident in New Zealand if: • it is incorporated in New Zealand • its directors exercise control in New Zealand • it has its centre of management in New Zealand, or • it has its head office in New Zealand. If none of these apply, a company is non-resident. Note The rules for tax residency are not the same as citizenship or usual residency criteria. For more details on enduring relationship and tax residency read our New Zealand tax residence guide - IR292. Variable principal debt instrument This is a financial arrangement where one party can ask the other party to: • borrow additional money, or • return all the amounts borrowed if the other party’s rights and obligations are shown in a foreign currency. Zero-rating (AIL) Where a bond issue meets certain requirements instead of paying AIL at 2%, a zero rate can apply. APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 18
IR395 November 2023 Approved issuer levy (AIL) A guide for payers The information in this booklet is based on current tax laws at the time of printing. Introduction If you pay interest to a non-resident lender you can apply to be an approved issuer. This means, instead of deducting non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), you must pay a levy of 2% on the securities you register with us. The levy is calculated at a rate of 2% of the value of the registered security. The value is the amount of interest paid on the security, or any redemption payment on a bond issued at a discount. For certain bonds the levy can be reduced to 0%. Find out how you can be an approved issuer and learn the main requirements for: • approved issuer status • registration of securities • payment of AIL, and • zero-rated bonds. Pages 16 to 18 explain the terms used in this guide. 3 Contents Part 1 - General information 5 Zero-rating of NRWT on interest 5 Agreements in writing 5 Approved issuer status 6 Cancelling approved issuer status 6 Completing your end-of-year tax return 6 No longer paying AIL 6 Record keeping 6 Part 2 - Registering securities 7 Registering a security 7 The criteria for registration 7 Part 3 - Zero rating AIL 8 Criteria 8 Widely held test 8 Part 4 - Filing and payments 9 Paying approved issuer levy (AIL) 9 How to make payments 12 Late payment 12 AIL overpaid 13 Paying AIL instead of deducting NRWT 13 Part 5 - Services you may need 14 Terms we use 16 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 4 Part 1 - General information Zero-rating of NRWT on interest Interest payments can have a zero rate of NRWT if all the following conditions are met. • You are not associated to the non-resident lender. Separate associated person rules apply where a bank, or a financial sector business similar to a bank, borrows from an associated person. • You must apply to be an approved issuer. You can do this in myIR. • You must have registered with us all the securities on which the zero rate of NRWT is to apply. You can do this in myIR. Learn more about registering in Part 2 of this guide. • The non-resident lender and you must agree that AIL applies. We recommend that this agreement be in writing. • From the amount of interest paid to the non-resident lender an additional 2% AIL must be paid to us by the due date. If you make a payment after the due date include any interest and late payment penalties. Interest payments that do not satisfy the conditions for zero-rating are subject to NRWT. Agreements in writing There is no set format for giving written notices of interest paid to non-resident lenders under the AIL rules. However, we suggest the notice should show that: • the interest is not taxable in New Zealand, and • NRWT hasn't been deducted from the interest. If the cost of the AIL is to be recovered from the non-resident lender, it must be shown as a fee or charge on any written notice to the non-resident lender. AIL is a charge in addition to the interest. If you're entitled to claim a tax deduction for the cost of the amount borrowed, the AIL payment can also be claimed. Note Zero-rating of NRWT is different to zero-rating of AIL. 5 Approved issuer status You must apply to be an approved issuer. You can do this in myIR at ird.govt.nz/myIR If your application is approved, your approved issuer status begins from the date we receive your registration. If we find you to be responsible for serious default or neglect of your tax responsibilities during the two years before the date we receive your notification, we will cancel your application. Cancelling approved issuer status 1. Approved issuer status lasts until it’s cancelled. If your status is cancelled, zero- rating cannot apply to new securities. Cancelling does not affect existing registered securities. 2. You may also ask for your status to be cancelled. Completing your end-of-year tax return You can claim a deduction of 2% on all the AIL you’ve paid in that tax year in your New Zealand income tax return. The overseas interest you’ve paid must be tax deductible. No longer paying AIL If you stop paying AIL permanently you need to let us know and we’ll close your AIL account. You can do this in myIR. Record keeping You need to keep full records of all the AIL you pay, and details of the registered securities. You must keep your records for seven years and they must be in English or Māori unless you get approval from us to use another language. We may ask you to keep your records for an additional three years if auditing or investigating you. Failure to keep adequate records is a very serious matter and can result in a fine. If you want to know more about audit procedures, read our guide Inland Revenue audits - IR297. APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 6 Part 2 - Registering securities Only securities that have been registered with us qualify for a zero rate of NRWT. Most securities can be registered, including variable principal debt instruments, New Zealand bank accounts of non-residents and standard offshore loans and bonds. You can register two types of securities. • A transaction involving money lent to you. This is a transaction where the two parties, amount involved and term can be clearly identified. • A class of transactions involving money lent to you. This is where you're involved in more than one transaction. Securities can be registered as a class if the first definition does not apply. Registering a security If you do not already have approved issuer status, you can apply to be an approved issuer when you register your first security. You can apply and register one security in myIR. All other securities must be registered separately on an Application to register security or securities for approved issuer levy (AIL) or zero-rating - IR397. You must tell us about any changes to your securities before maturity or redemption, as this may affect whether AIL still applies. You can send a secure email in myIR to do this. The criteria for registration Securities will be registered if these criteria are met: • an application is completed, and • the security relates to money lent on or after 1 August 1991. Government stock qualifies for AIL, even if it was issued before this date. We’ll confirm your securities are registered within 20 working days. If we do not cancel your application within this time, your securities will automatically register. 7 Part 3 - Zero-rating AIL AIL can apply at zero % on interest that is paid for debt securities (Bonds) that meet certain criteria. To qualify for the zero rate on interest payments the security must: • be denoted in NZ dollars • either: - be a regulated offer in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, or - be an offer of financial products that are of the same class as quoted financial products in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (and also meet other specific criteria), or - be an offer of debt securities issued by a registered bank, in terms of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013; or - have been offered to the public in terms of section 3 of the Securities Act 1978 before it was repealed, and • not be issued as a private placement • not be an asset-backed security • be conducted through a registry and paying agent with a fixed establishment in New Zealand, and • be listed on the stock exchange or satisfy a widely held test. Widely held test To meet the widely held test a security must: • be held by 100 separate persons who the issuer could reasonably assume are not associated at the time the test applies, and • have no person or group of associated persons holding a 10% or greater interest at the time of applying the test. APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 8 Part 4 - Filing and payments Paying approved issuer levy (AIL) You (or a person on your behalf such as a nominee company) can pay interest to non-residents at a zero rate of NRWT on the securities you register. AIL is calculated at a rate of 2% of the value of the interest you've paid to your non-resident lender. For certain bonds this rate is reduced to zero %. You must file your AIL information and pay your AIL electronically unless you have an electronic filing exemption. You can apply for an exemption if you are unable to supply your AIL information electronically. In considering your request we will assess: • your capabilities • the digital services available to you • the compliance costs to you. Due date Your AIL return and payment must be completed by the 20th of the month following the month interest was paid. If you expect to pay less than $500 AIL in any income year, you may pay on a six-monthly basis. If the due date falls on a weekend or a New Zealand public holiday, the due date is the next working day. AIL of $500 or more each year If you pay AIL of $500 or more each year, the due date for payment is the 20th of the month following the month the interest was paid. 9 Example Monthly payer Each year, Lucy's Lovely Apartments Ltd is liable for AIL payments of more than $500 on the interest credited to its customers' accounts. In February 2023 it has $1,000 AIL to pay, March 2023 $1,000 AIL to pay but no AIL for April 2023. It must pay the AIL to us as follows: Month interest paid Total AIL to payTotal paid to usDue date for payment and return February 2023$1,000$1,00021 March 2023 March 2023$1,000$1,00020 April 2023 April 2023NilNil- AIL of less than $500 each year If you expect to pay less than $500 AIL in any income year, you may complete returns and pay on a six-monthly basis. • 1 April to 30 September - due for payment on 20 October • 1 October to 31 March - due for payment on 20 April. If your AIL payment accumulates to $500 during the year, you must complete a return and pay by the 20th of the month after AIL reaches $500. Example Six-monthly payer Luca's Investments Ltd pays less than $500 AIL each year, so may pay the deductions to us by the two regular six-monthly payment dates. Month interest paid Total AIL to payTotal paid to usDue date for payment and return June 2023$ 50Nil- August 2023$ 50Nil- September 2023$ 100$ 20020 October 2023 November 2023$ 100Nil- February 2024$ 100$ 20020 April 2024 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 10 Example Six-monthly payer with accumulated AIL over $500 Nala's Investments Ltd estimated its annual AIL liability for the 2023 income year to be less than $500. However, in December 2022 it reached the $500 threshold. Nala's Investments Ltd must pay the AIL to us by the 20th of the month which follows the month when the accumulated AIL reached $500. Nala's Investments Ltd must also pay monthly for the rest of the 2023 income year. Month interest paid Total AIL to payTotal paid to usDue date for payment and return June 2022$ 50Nil- August 2022$ 50Nil- September 2022$ 100$ 20020 October 2022 December 2022$ 300$ 30020 January 2023 January 2023NilNil- February 2023NilNil- March 2023$ 50$ 5020 April 2023 No AIL to pay Returns show as optional in myIR so if no interest was paid and you have no AIL to pay for the month, you do not need to file any income information. If zero-rate of AIL applies You must report any interest you paid that qualifies for the zero-rate of AIL by the payment due date. If you do not do this any zero-rated interest will be subject to AIL at 2% where it would have normally been zero-rated. 11 How to make payments Go to ird.govt.nz/pay to find out about paying by: • internet banking • credit or debit card • direct debit You can also call 0800 257 777 to pay by credit/debit card over the phone. When making a payment, include: • your IRD number • the account type you are paying • the period the payment relates to. Late payment Standard rate AIL We may charge you interest if you do not make your tax payment by the due date. We'll also charge you a late payment penalty if you miss a payment. If you have a good payment history we may contact you before we do this. Otherwise an initial 1% late payment penalty will be added the day after the due date. We'll charge a further 4% penalty if there is still an amount of unpaid tax (including penalties) seven days after the due date. Every month the amount owing remains unpaid after the due date we'll charge a further 1% incremental penalty. Interest and late payment penalties are not charged on outstanding amounts of $100 or less. Zero rate AIL If the return is not received by the due date, any zero-rated interest will be subject to AIL at 2%. The payment of this AIL will need to have been paid by the same due date for that return or penalties and interest will apply to the outstanding amount based on a 2% AIL payment due on the same date. APPROVED ISSUER LEVY 12 Example Corporation Ltd pays interest on bonds of $100,000 in June which qualify to be zero- rated if the return is completed by 20 July. The return is completed on 1 August which is late. As the return is completed late the interest on bonds will be subject to the standard levy rate of 2%. This levy would need to be paid by the 20 July (the due date for any levy payable for June) to avoid late payment penalties and interest. Arrangements If you’re unable to pay your tax in full by the due date, you can set an instalment arrangement in myIR. You can do this before or after the due date for payment but penalties charged will be less if you set up the arrangement before the due date. For more help See our Penalties and interest - IR240 guide. AIL overpaid Paying AIL instead of deducting NRWT A decision to pay AIL instead of NRWT cannot be retrospective. If you’ve paid AIL on some interest but should have deducted NRWT, you need to let us know. AIL is paid on interest at the rate of 2%. As the NRWT rates are higher than the AIL rate, you’ll have under-deducted tax. Let us know which periods you under-deducted and how much NRWT you should have paid and we’ll transfer the payment to your NRWT account. If you do not have a NRWT account, we will ask you to register for one. You’ll have to make an extra payment to cover the shortfall. You may also be liable for a late payment penalty and possibly a shortfall penalty. For more information about shortfall penalties, see our Penalties and interest - IR240 guide. 13 Part 5 - Services you may need 0800 self-service numbers Our 0800 self-service numbers are open 7 days a week - except between 5am and 6am each day.

This allows the approved issuer or a person on their behalf, to pay interest to a non-resident without having to deduct NRWT.

Balance date If your balance date is 31 March, work out your income and expenses for the income year from 1 April to 31 March. If you're not sure, contact your tax agent, or call us on 0800 377 774. Record keeping You must keep: - books of accounts to record income, expenses, payments, wages, assets and liabilities - bank statements, invoices, receipts, and any other documents to support entries in your account books. You must keep your records for seven years. Keep all receipts and invoices with your records in case we ask to see them later. Motor vehicle records If you use your car for business you must apportion your running costs between business and private use. To work out the business portion of the running costs, keep a logbook for three months. You can then use the results for the next three years, provided the business use of the car doesn't change by more than 20%. For each business trip write down in your logbook: - the date - t he distance travelled for each business trip - t he reason for the trip. Use the difference between the odometer readings for the start and end of the three months to work out the percentage of vehicle expenses you can claim. Example Distance travelled for business 912 k m Total distance travelled in three months 1,600 k m 912 = 57% 1,600 In this case 57% of vehicle expenses can be claimed as a business expense. If you don't keep records for your vehicle we limit your claim for the expenses and depreciation to a maximum of 25%. Expenses when running a business from home If you've set aside part of your home for business purposes, you may be able to claim a portion of the costs of running your business from home. To claim these costs you have to set aside an area principally for your business, such as an office or a storage area, and keep records of the expenses you're claiming. Work out the amount of expenses you can claim according to the proportion of the floor area set aside for your business. Expenses you can claim include insurance, rates, power and mortgage interest payments. You can also claim: - a p ortion of the depreciation on your home and on some capital items used principally for business purposes in your home eg a computer or office furniture and fittings - up t o 50% deduction for your domestic telephone line rental. If you have both a commercial and a domestic line rental you can claim the full cost of the commercial line but you can't claim any portion of the domestic line. Our booklet Smart business - IR320 explains how to calculate a claim. You can order a copy at ird.govt.nz or by calling our 0800 self-service on 0800 257 773.

Show the GST on your income and expenses in your GST returns. If you aren't registered for GST include the total income and expenses, including GST, when working out your net profit. Filling in the IR3B Sales - Box 1 This is the total sales or income earned from your main business activity.

Other expenses - Box 25 Show any other deductible expense not covered by the above items, stating type and amount. Gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets - Box 28 This is the difference between the amount an asset is sold for (the sale price), and the adjusted tax value (the written down value or depreciated book value). This is the lesser of: - t he cost price less the adjusted tax value, or - the sale price less the adjusted tax value. This is to calculate the depreciation recovered. If the sale price is the lesser figure and the sale price is less than the depreciated value, the loss on sale is deductible except for the sale of a building. Net income - Box 29 To work out your net income, subtract the total expenses from total gross income, then add or subtract any gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets. Copy your answer to your tax return. Depreciation The assets you use in your business will eventually wear out or go out of date. They will therefore reduce in value, even though you maintain and repair them routinely. This gradual reduction in the value of an asset is called depreciation and can be deducted from your business income. You must claim depreciation on assets which are expected to decline in value and have a lifespan of more than 12 months, unless you elect not to. Not all assets can be depreciated - land is a common example. You must keep a fixed asset register to show assets you are depreciating. Record the depreciation claimed and the adjusted tax value of each asset. The adjusted tax value is the asset's cost price less all depreciation calculated since its purchase. Depreciation rates and calculating depreciation The depreciation rates for various assets are set by Inland Revenue. They are based on the cost and useful life of an asset being depreciated. To find the depreciation rate for any asset and calculate the depreciation claim go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation Or use our booklet General depreciation rates - IR265 available at ird.govt.nz or through our 0800 self-service on 0800 257 773. You can calculate depreciation either by the diminishing value or the straight line method. You don't have to use the same method for all your assets, but you must use the chosen method for the full income year. You can change the method for any asset from year to year. If you do change the method of calculating depreciation, the opening value of the asset is the current adjusted tax value, not the original cost. Pooling assets You can pool or group low value assets and depreciate them as though they were a single asset. The assets you can pool are ones which are not used privately and which cost $2,000 or less, or have depreciated so their adjusted tax value is $2,000 or less. You calculate pool depreciation on the average pool value at a single rate using the diminishing value method. The rate to use is the lowest rate applying to any asset in the pool. Once you have included an asset in the pool, you can segregate it only if you start to use the asset for private use. Assets costing $500 or less (including loose tools) Low-value assets, that is, assets that cost $500 or less, are deductible in the year they are acquired or created provided: • t hey aren't purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies (unless the entire purchase costs $500 or less) • the assets won't become part of an asset that is depreciable, eg, the cost of materials to build a wall in a factory • they were purchased on or after 19 May 2005 (the threshold before 19 May 2005 was $200). For more information read our booklet Depreciation - IR260 available at ird.govt.nz or through our 0800 self-service on 0800 257 773. Computer software The cost of software is a capital expense and must be depreciated. The cost includes paying for rights to use, purchasing upgrades and developing inhouse packages.

Partnerships and estates can also use this schedule. Attach it to your tax return. Balance date If your balance date is 31 March, work out your income and expenses for the income year from 1 April to 31 March. If you're not sure, contact your tax agent, or call us on 0800 377 774. Record keeping You must keep: - books of accounts to record income, expenses, payments, wages, assets and liabilities, and - bank statements, invoices, receipts, and any other documents to support entries in your account books. You must keep your records for 7 years. Keep all receipts and invoices with your records in case we ask to see them later. Motor vehicle records If you use your car for business you must apportion your running costs between business and private use. To work out the business portion of the running costs, keep a logbook for 3 months. You can then use the results for the next 3 years, provided the business use of the car does not change by more than 20%. For each business trip write down in your logbook: - the date - the distance travelled for each business trip, and - the reason for the trip. Use the difference between the odometer readings for the start and end of the 3 months to work out the percentage of vehicle expenses you can claim. Example Distance travelled for business 912 km Total distance travelled in 3 months 1,600 km 912 = 57% 1,600 In this case 57% of vehicle expenses can be claimed as a business expense. If you do not keep records for your vehicle we limit your claim for the expenses and depreciation to a maximum of 25%. Expenses when running a business from home If you've set aside part of your home for business purposes, you may be able to claim a portion of the costs of running your business from home. To claim these costs you have to set aside an area principally for your business, such as an office or a storage area, and keep records of the expenses you're claiming. Work out the amount of expenses you can claim according to the proportion of the floor area set aside for your business. Expenses you can claim include insurance, rates, power and mortgage interest payments. You can also claim: - a portion of the depreciation on your home and on some capital items used principally for business purposes in your home, for example a computer or office furniture and fittings - up to 50% deduction for your domestic telephone line rental. If you have both a commercial and a domestic line rental you can claim the full cost of the commercial line but you cannot claim any portion of the domestic line. Our booklet Smart business - IR320 explains how to calculate a claim. You can order a copy at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or by calling our 0800 self-service on 0800 257 773. GST (Goods and services tax) If you're registered for GST, do not include the GST portion of your income and expenses when working out the net profit on this form. Show the GST on your income and expenses in your GST returns. If you are not registered for GST include the total income and expenses, including GST, when working out your net profit. Filling in the IR3B Sales - Box 1 This is the total sales or income earned from your main business activity. Trading stock (including livestock) disposed of at below market value Where trading stock is disposed of or donated at below market value please refer to ird.govt.nz. Cost of sales - Boxes 2 to 4 Opening stock is measured at the start of the income year (usually 1 April) and closing stock is measured at the end of the year (usually 31 March). "Purchases" is the cost of buying or producing goods for sale. Other income - Box 7 This is sales or income earned from sources other than your main business activity, for example interest on the business bank account. Schedular payments Do not include schedular payments on the IR3B. Show any income with tax from schedular payments deducted in your tax return. See your tax return guide for notes about schedular payments. Expenses Only the expenses you incur in generating your business income are deductible for tax purposes. Apportion or exclude any personal expenses incurred. Accident compensation levies - Box 9 Include ACC levy payments for self-employment and as an employer, and any interest charged. Bad debts - Box 11 Show any debts not recovered which are actually written off. Communication - Box 12 Includes telephone, mobile phone, fax and postage costs.

Other expenses - Box 25 Show any other deductible expense not covered by the above items, stating type and amount. Gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets - Box 28 This is the difference between the amount an asset is sold for (the sale price), and the adjusted tax value (the written down value or depreciated book value). This is the lesser of: - the cost price less the adjusted tax value, or - the sale price less the adjusted tax value. This is to calculate the depreciation recovered. If the sale price is the lesser figure and the sale price is less than the depreciated value, the loss on sale is deductible except for the sale of a building. Net income - Box 29 To work out your net income, subtract the total expenses from total gross income, then add or subtract any gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets. Copy your answer to your tax return. Depreciation The assets you use in your business will eventually wear out or go out of date. They will therefore reduce in value, even though you maintain and repair them routinely. This gradual reduction in the value of an asset is called depreciation and can be deducted from your business income. You must claim depreciation on assets which are expected to decline in value and have a lifespan of more than 12 months, unless you elect not to. Not all assets can be depreciated - land is a common example. You must keep a fixed asset register to show assets you are depreciating. Record the depreciation claimed and the adjusted tax value of each asset. The adjusted tax value is the asset’s cost price less all depreciation calculated since its purchase. Depreciation rates and calculating depreciation The depreciation rates for various assets are set by Inland Revenue. They are based on the cost and useful life of an asset being depreciated. To find the depreciation rate for any asset and calculate the depreciation claim go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation or use our booklet General depreciation rates - IR265 available at ird.govt.nz/ forms-guides or through our 0800 self-service on 0800 257 773. You can calculate depreciation either by the diminishing value or the straight line method. You do not have to use the same method for all your assets, but you must use the chosen method for the full income year. You can change the method for any asset from year to year. If you do change the method of calculating depreciation, the opening value of the asset is the current adjusted tax value, not the original cost. Pooling assets You can pool or group low value assets and depreciate them as though they were a single asset. The assets you can pool are ones which are not used privately and which cost $2,000 or less, or have depreciated so their adjusted tax value is $2,000 or less. You calculate pool depreciation on the average pool value at a single rate using the diminishing value method. The rate to use is the lowest rate applying to any asset in the pool. Once you have included an asset in the pool, you can separate it only if you start to use the asset for private use. Low value Assets (including loose tools) Where you purchase an asset that has a low value you can fully deduct the cost of that asset at the time of purchase. This removes the need to depreciate that low value asset over its useful life. A low value asset is determined by its cost: • 17 March 2020 till 16 March 2021 - Up to $5,000 • 17 March 2021 onwards - Up to $1,000. Computer software The cost of software is a capital expense and must be depreciated. The cost includes paying for rights to use, purchasing upgrades and developing inhouse packages.

Add up the dollar amounts and print the total in the boxes provided. Livestock and produce on hand and unsold at the beginning of the year Print the total value of livestock and produce on hand and unsold at the beginning of the year. These totals should be the same as the livestock and produce on hand and unsold at the end of last year. If you’re using the herd scheme to value your livestock you must use the values for the current year, unless this is the first year you are using the herd scheme. Depreciation The assets you use in your business will eventually wear out or go out of date. They will therefore reduce in value, even though you maintain and repair them routinely. This gradual reduction in the value of an asset is called depreciation and can be deducted from your business income. You must claim depreciation on assets which are expected to decline in value and have a lifespan of more than 12 months, unless you elect not to. Not all assets can be depreciated - land is a common example. You must keep a fixed asset register to show assets you are depreciating. Record the depreciation claimed and the adjusted tax value of each asset. The adjusted tax value is the asset's cost price less all depreciation calculated since its purchase. Depreciation rates and calculating depreciation The depreciation rates for various assets are set by Inland Revenue. They are based on the cost and useful life of an asset being depreciated. To find the depreciation rate for any asset and calculate the depreciation claim go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation Or use our booklet General depreciation rates - IR265 available at ird.govt.nz or through our 0800 self-service on 0800 257 773. You can calculate depreciation either by the diminishing value or the straight line method. You don't have to use the same method for all your assets, but you must use the chosen method for the full income year. You can change the method for any asset from year to year. If you do change the method of calculating depreciation, the opening value of the asset is the current adjusted tax value, not the original cost. Development expenditure This relates to all expenses you’ve incurred in developing your property. These are usually capital items, eg, fencing posts or tractors. Vehicle expenses Apportion vehicle expenses between business and private use. Read the “Record keeping” notes in the next column. Other information Valuation of livestock Divide all your livestock by gender, age and type, eg, divide sheep into: – ewe hoggets – ram and wether hoggets – two-tooth ewes – mixed-age ewes (rising three and four-year-olds) – rising five years and older ewes – mixed-age wethers – breeding rams. Every year the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) lists livestock and their values. TIBs are available on ird.govt.nz or by calling us on 0800 377 774. Farmers must use one of the following valuation methods for specified livestock for the income year. • Herd scheme A ll classes of livestock can be classed under the herd scheme. • National standard cost scheme A s cheme based on the national average cost of raising livestock. Inland Revenue will provide figures for breeding, rearing and growing costs for rising one-year animals, and rearing and growing costs for rising two-year animals. Add the average cost of animals you have bought to these figures to give you the average cost of each class of livestock. • S elf-assessed cost scheme Thi s scheme is similar to the national standard cost scheme but based on the farmer’s own production costs rather than national average figures. The Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 4, No 7 (March 1993) describes this scheme in detail. • Market value or replacement price 4/4 Balance date If you have an approved balance date other than 31 March, work out your income and expenses for the year to that date. Record keeping You must keep these types of records: – account books recording income receipts and payments – vouchers, bank statements, invoices, receipts and other documents or papers to support the entries in the account books. If you use your car for business and private running, you must keep a logbook for three months to apportion the business share of the running costs. Write down the: – date – di stance travelled for each business trip – r eason for the trip. You can use the business use percentage from the three-month logbook for the next three years, provided the business use doesn’t change by more than 20%. If you don’t keep records for your vehicle, we limit your claim for expenses and depreciation to a maximum of 25%. Keep all receipts and invoices with your records in case we ask to see them later. You must keep all your records for seven years. GST (Goods and services tax) When you work out the net income for your return, if you’re registered for GST don’t include the GST portion of your income and expenses.

Farm income equalisation scheme The income equalisation scheme is designed to level out fluctuations in the year-to-year incomes of farming businesses. You may deposit a sum of up to your taxable farming income for one year with Inland Revenue. Your deposit must stay in the scheme for at least 12 months and is generally tax deductible in the year you deposit it. Deposits in the scheme for longer than 12 months earn interest at the rate of 3% per annum. Withdrawals from the scheme are treated as taxable income in the year of withdrawal. There are special rules for farmers affected by adverse events who want to make a withdrawal from the scheme.

Add up the dollar amounts and print the total in the box provided. Livestock on hand and unsold at the end of the year Print the type (for example, sheep), class (for example, two-tooth ewes), number, value per head and the total value of all livestock on hand. Add up the total values and print the total in the box provided. Wool Print the number of bales sold and the amount you sold them for in the panels provided. Then print the number of bales you’ve left unsold, the average bale value and the total value of bales on hand. Other sources of income Print the amounts you received from other sources of income in the panels provided. Schedular payments Do not include schedular payments on the IR 3F. Show any income with tax from schedular payments deducted in your tax return. See your tax return guide for notes about schedular payments. Total gross income Add up all the income amounts and print your answer in Box 22. Deductions Purchases of livestock In the spaces provided, print your total livestock purchases for each type. Add up the dollar amounts and print the total in the boxes provided. Livestock and produce on hand and unsold at the beginning of the year Print the total value of livestock and produce on hand and unsold at the beginning of the year. These totals should be the same as the livestock and produce on hand and unsold at the end of last year. If you’re using the herd scheme to value your livestock you must use the values for the current year, unless this is the first year you are using the herd scheme. Depreciation The assets you use in your business will eventually wear out or go out of date. They will therefore reduce in value, even though you maintain and repair them routinely. This gradual reduction in the value of an asset is called depreciation and can be deducted from your business income. You must claim depreciation on assets which are expected to decline in value and have a lifespan of more than 12 months, unless you elect not to. Not all assets can be depreciated - land is a common example. You must keep a fixed asset register to show assets you are depreciating. Record the depreciation claimed and the adjusted tax value of each asset. The adjusted tax value is the asset's cost price less all depreciation calculated since its purchase. Depreciation rates and calculating depreciation The depreciation rates for various assets are set by Inland Revenue. They are based on the cost and useful life of an asset being depreciated. To find the depreciation rate for any asset and calculate the depreciation claim go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation Or use our booklet General depreciation rates - IR265 available at ird.govt.nz or through our 0800 self-service on 0800 257 773. You can calculate depreciation either by the diminishing value or the straight line method. You do not have to use the same method for all your assets, but you must use the chosen method for the full income year. You can change the method for any asset from year to year. If you do change the method of calculating depreciation, the opening value of the asset is the current adjusted tax value, not the original cost. Development expenditure This relates to all expenses you’ve incurred in developing your property. These are usually capital items, for example fencing posts or tractors. Vehicle expenses Apportion vehicle expenses between business and private use. Read the “Record keeping” notes in the next column. Other information Valuation of livestock Divide all your livestock by gender, age and type, for example divide sheep into: - ewe hoggets - ram and wether hoggets - two-tooth ewes - mixed-age ewes (rising three and four-year-olds) - rising five years and older ewes - mixed-age wethers, and - breeding rams. Every year the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) lists livestock and their values. TIBs are available on ird.govt.nz or by calling us on 0800 377 774. Farmers must use one of the following valuation methods for specified livestock for the income year. • Herd scheme All classes of livestock can be classed under the herd scheme. • National standard cost scheme A scheme based on the national average cost of raising livestock. We will provide figures for breeding, rearing and growing costs for rising one-year animals, and rearing and growing costs for rising two-year animals. Add the average cost of animals you have bought to these figures to give you the average cost of each class of livestock. • Self-assessed cost scheme This scheme is similar to the national standard cost scheme but based on the farmer’s own production costs rather than national average figures. The Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 4, No 7 (March 1993) describes this scheme in detail. • Market value or replacement price 4/4 Balance date If you have an approved balance date other than 31 March, work out your income and expenses for the year to that date. Record keeping You must keep these types of records: - account books recording income receipts and payments - vouchers, bank statements, invoices, receipts and other documents or papers to support the entries in the account books. If you use your car for business and private running, you must keep a logbook for three months to apportion the business share of the running costs. Write down the: - date - distance travelled for each business trip, and - reason for the trip. You can use the business use percentage from the three-month logbook for the next three years, provided the business use does not change by more than 20%. If you do not keep records for your vehicle, we limit your claim for expenses and depreciation to a maximum of 25%. Keep all receipts and invoices with your records in case we ask to see them later. You must keep all your records for seven years. GST (Goods and services tax) When you work out the net income for your return, if you’re registered for GST do not include the GST portion of your income and expenses. Show the GST on your income and expenses in your GST returns. If you’re not registered for GST, include the total income and expenses including GST, when working out the net income for your return.

Inland Revenue will provide figures for breeding, rearing and growing costs for rising one-year animals, and rearing and growing costs for rising two-year animals. Add the average cost of animals you have bought to these figures to give you the average cost of each class of livestock. • Self-assessed cost scheme This scheme is similar to the national standard cost scheme but based on the farmer’s own production costs rather than national average figures. The Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 4, No 7 (March 1993) describes this scheme in detail. • Market value or replacement price 4/4 Balance date If you have an approved balance date other than 31 March, work out your income and expenses for the year to that date. Record keeping You must keep these types of records: – account books recording income receipts and payments – vouchers, bank statements, invoices, receipts and other documents or papers to support the entries in the account books. If you use your car for business and private running, you must keep a logbook for three months to apportion the business share of the running costs. Write down the: – date – distance travelled for each business trip – reason for the trip. You can use the business use percentage from the three-month logbook for the next three years, provided the business use doesn’t change by more than 20%. If you don’t keep records for your vehicle, we limit your claim for expenses and depreciation to a maximum of 25%. Keep all receipts and invoices with your records in case we ask to see them later. You must keep all your records for seven years. GST (Goods and services tax) When you work out the net income for your return, if you’re registered for GST don’t include the GST portion of your income and expenses. Show the GST on your income and expenses in your GST returns. If you’re not registered for GST, include the total income and expenses including GST, when working out the net income for your return. Farm income equalisation scheme The income equalisation scheme is designed to level out fluctuations in the year-to-year incomes of farming businesses. You may deposit a sum of up to your taxable farming income for one year with Inland Revenue. Your deposit must stay in the scheme for at least 12 months and is generally tax deductible in the year you deposit it. Deposits in the scheme for longer than 12 months earn interest at the rate of 3% per annum. Withdrawals from the scheme are treated as taxable income in the year of withdrawal. There are special rules for farmers affected by adverse events who want to make a withdrawal from the scheme.

If we've sent you an IR3 return pack, you must complete the return and send it to us by 7 July 2018, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. If you don't need to file a return but you'd like to talk to someone about your tax situation, you can call us. To help you work out if you need to file an IR3, go to www.ird.govt.nz and complete the questionnaire "Work out my income tax filing options" or call us on 0800 377 774. Note If you received any other income apart from salary, wages, interest, dividends (see further information below), and/or taxable Māori authority distributions, you must file an IR3 return. There are some exceptions. If you received personal service rehabilitation payments and are an ACC client or caregiver (who received payments from the client or ACC), please read page 52. If you had a workplace injury your employer may manage these payments instead of ACC. If you or your caregiver receives these payments, regardless of who makes them, you'll need to read the information on page 52. Note Other income includes: •self-employed income (see children's exempt income below) •over $200 of schedular payments •income derived overseas – calculated taxable income arising from a withdrawal or transfer from foreign superannuation schemes acquired while a non-resident of New Zealand •over $200 in total of: –interest derived overseas (if it's had tax deducted or not) –dividends of certain Australian resident listed companies and other overseas investments that are not treated as part of foreign investment funds (FIF) income - see page 20 –income attributed to you from your portfolio investment entity (PIE) where the income had the 0% rate applied, or where you had tax calculated by your PIE at a rate lower than your correct prescribed investor rate (PIR) during the year. If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your PIR, you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. Note the dividends will need to be acknowledged for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) and/or Student Loan purposes. •FIF income •rental income •estate, trust or partnership income •royalties •cash jobs or "under the table" payments •income from illegal enterprises •income without PAYE deducted, such as shareholder-employee salary or a claim received under a taxable loss of earnings policy. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE6 You'll also need to file an IR3 if you: •have losses to claim or brought forward from the previous year •have excess imputation credits brought forward from the previous year •left or arrived in New Zealand part-way through the year and are required to receive a personal tax summary (PTS) or file a return •are filing a return for a deceased person to the date of death if there is a requirement to file a return for this income year •were declared bankrupt and required to receive a PTS or file a return •changed your balance date part-way through the year. Children's exempt income Read this information if for the tax year you: •were 14 or under, or •were 15, 16 or 17 and still attending school\*, or •turned 18 on or after 1 January in the previous tax year and continued to attend school\* \* including a school for people with disabilities, but excluding tertiary institutions. The following income is required to have tax taken out before you receive it: •salary or wages •schedular payments •interest •dividends, and •Māori authority distributions. If you only receive these types of income you will not need to file an IR3. However, if you are required to file an IR3 return this income needs to be included. If you receive income that has not had tax taken out before you receive it eg: •worked as a self-employed person, •worked around the home of a neighbour or family friend, and that work was not part of a business that they carry on, or •beneficiary income from a trust, such as a testamentary trust (a trust set up from an estate of a deceased person), that is not listed above as requiring to have tax taken out and your total income from these sources is less than $2,340 for the tax year, this income is exempt from tax and is not included in your return. You are not required to file a return just because you earn this type of income. If you earn $2,340 or more, the exemption does not apply and you will need to file a return and pay tax on all the income, not just the amount that exceeds the exemption. If you have to file a return but we haven't sent you an IR3, you must request and file it by 7 July 2018, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. Please call 0800 257 773 to request an IR3 return. Remember to have your IRD number with you. 7 www.ird.govt.nz Extension of time If circumstances beyond your control will prevent you from sending in your return on time, call us on 0800 377 774 and we may grant you an extension. If you have a tax agent you may have until 31 March 2019 to file the return. Contact your agent for more information. Are there any penalties? You may face penalties and prosecution if you: •are required to put in a return but don't •give false or misleading information (including not showing all your income) •leave out details on purpose so the information is misleading •file your return late. Income year The information in this guide is based on the tax year from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. If your income year is different you can still use this guide, but work out your income and expenses for your income year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE8 Using this guide Did you know you can also file your return online? Go to www.ird.govt.nz and login to myIR secure online services. The form will prepopulate with your personal details and earnings information. Before you start filling in the return make sure you have: •any interest or dividend statements •any taxable Māori authority distribution statements •any other income details, such as overseas, rental property, farming or business income •your 2018 Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) letter, if you applied for WfFTC from Inland Revenue. The questions in this guide are in the same order as the questions on the return. Don't use anyone else's preprinted return because it's precoded with their own IRD number. Questions 1 to 5 Personal information This information helps us to contact you. Please make sure we have your details exactly right. If you've changed your name or address, please update the information in the spaces provided on the return. Postal address If you use your agent's postal address leave this panel blank. Your tax agent will let us know if they've changed their address. If your address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby, please contact New Zealand Post. Date of birth We ask for this so we don't mix up people with the same name. Question 6 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. If you're unable to identify the correct code, call ACC on 0508 426 837 for more help. Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. If you don't complete your BIC code, ACC will select one on your behalf. This may mean your ACC levy rate could be incorrect. Note 9 www.ird.govt.nz Question 8 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return, please include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two boxes. Question 9 Adjustments to your income If you have a student loan or you are eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC), you may be required to include adjustments to your income. This is so that Inland Revenue can correctly assess your student loan repayment obligation and ensure you receive your correct WfFTC entitlement. To notify Inland Revenue about your income adjustments you can: •tick 9A on your IR3 and complete an Adjust your income (IR215) form and attach it to page 3 of your return or •log in to your myIR secure online services account and complete it there or •call us on 0800 227 774 and tell us what your adjustments are. If you don't have an IR215 form you can: •download it from our website www.ird.govt.nz or •call us on 0800 257 773. What do I need to do to receive my entitlement? If you haven't already registered for WfFTC and you qualify, either go to our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: working for families) and register online, or complete a Working for Families Tax Credits registration form (FS1) and return it to us. When we've received the registration form we'll send you a letter with all your family details for you to check. Please correct and return it to us if the details are incorrect. If you've already registered for WfFTC and you need to file an IR3, we'll send you a letter by the beginning of May with all your family details on it. Please check this information and return the form with your IR3 if the details are incorrect. Question 10 Non-residents and transitional residents Non-residents If you were away from New Zealand for a total of 325 days in any 12-month period and don't have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, you may be a non-resident. Read our guide New Zealand tax residence (IR292) to find out your status. If you weren't present in New Zealand and are a non-resident for a full year, but you received income from New Zealand, you may need to complete an IR3NR return instead. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE10 Transitional residents If you became a New Zealand tax resident during the year 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 and you've elected not to be treated as a transitional resident, you have to complete an IR3 declaring your worldwide income from the date you became a New Zealand tax resident. Transitional residents don't have to declare their foreign-sourced income except for foreign employment income and foreign services income. If you were a non-resident for part of the year, complete Question 37 on your return. If your return isn't for a full year, we'll calculate your tax and income-related tax credits and let you know the result - see www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2006/2006-81/2006-81-exempt-transitionals/ for further information. 11 www.ird.govt.nz Your income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, salary, wages or schedular payments, the information you need to complete Questions 11, 11A and 12 will be on your Summary of earnings (SOE), which we'll send you in late May 2018. We send this automatically if we send you an IR3 return. Your SOE contains the following information: •all your employers throughout the year •your total gross income with tax deducted and ACC earners' levy paid •any family tax credit paid by Work and Income •your tax credits for payroll donations you've made through payroll giving. Question 11 Family tax credit from Work and Income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, copy the amount from your SOE to Box 11. Don't include any Working for Families Tax Credits from Inland Revenue in Box 11. Question 11A Income with tax deducted Did you receive any of these types of income with tax deducted between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018? •salary or wages •a student allowance •any income-tested benefit - unemployment or sickness, transitional retirement, independent youth, domestic purposes, widow's, invalid's or emergency •accident compensation payments related to earnings •New Zealand Superannuation (NZ Super) either income-tested or non-income tested, or a veteran's pension •other pensions, annuities or superannuation (read "Pensions" on page 14) •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme (also known as a share purchase agreement). Note: it is up to your employer whether they deduct tax on these or not •shareholder-employee salary. If you received any of these types of income with tax deducted, you need to copy the totals from your SOE to Question 11A. Employee Share Scheme (ESS) benefits If you (or an associate) received free or discounted shares under an employee share scheme the taxable value will be included on your SOE as long as your employer has provided us with this information. In most cases your employer will have provided this information but if they haven’t you will need to show the taxable value at Question 24. You will need to check with your employer whether this information has been provided. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE12 What to show on your return Copy the total amounts from your SOE to the corresponding boxes (11A, 11B, 11C, 11D and 11E) on your return. Amending your income details If any of the details on your SOE are incorrect (eg, wrong or missing employers), please make the changes on your SOE and attach it to page 3 of your return. You only need to attach your SOE to page 3 of your return if you've made changes to it. Please transfer the amended totals from your SOE to the corresponding boxes on your return and use the worksheet on page 13 to calculate your total tax deducted (11E). ACC earners' levy All employees must pay an ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of non-work related injuries, based on their earnings. We collect this on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The maximum amount of earners' levy is $1,755.37. The earners' levy is set at a rate of 1.39% (1.39 cents in the dollar). If you need to amend your employment details on your SOE, you'll need to recalculate your earners' levy. Using employer-provided information If you received payslips or other earnings information from your employer, you can use this information to complete your return and don't have to wait for your SOE. You don't include schedular payments in this calculation. You'll need to use your total PAYE deducted in your calculations. This is the amount of PAYE shown on your payslips before any tax credits for payroll donations are deducted. If you made donations through payroll giving to an organisation that is not on Inland Revenue's approved donee organisations list, you won't be able to keep the tax credits you received and you won't have paid enough PAYE throughout the year. You'll have either received a letter telling you about these extinguished tax credits or they'll show on your summary of earnings. Put the total PAYE, less the amount of your extinguished tax credits, in Box 11A. If the amount of total PAYE deducted isn't clear from your payslips: •contact your employer, or •refer to your SOE for details, or •refer to "Account information" in myIR, or •call us on 0800 227 774. 13 www.ird.govt.nz You'll need to calculate your ACC earners' levy liability and deduct it from your total PAYE, using the worksheet below. Worksheet for ACC earners' levy Copy your total taxable earnings from salary and wages to Box 1. Copy the amount to Box 11B of your return. 1 Copy your taxable earnings from salary and wages that are not liable for earners' levy to Box 2. See below for a list of income not liable. Copy this amount to Box 11C of your return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print the answer in Box 3. If the answer exceeds the maximum liable earnings of $126,286, print $126,286 in Box 3. 3 This is your liable income for ACC earners' levy Multiply Box 3 by 0.0139 (1.39%). Print your answer in Box 4. This is your ACC earners' levy. Copy this amount to Box 11D of your return. 4 Copy your total PAYE from salary and wages to Box 5. Copy this amount to Box 11A of your return. 5 Copy your total ACC earners' levy from Box 4 (above) to Box 6. 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 and print the answer in Box 7. 7 This is your total tax deducted. Copy this amount to Box 11E of your return. The following income isn't liable for ACC earners' levy -NZ Super-income from a partnership earned by a non-working partner in that partnership -income-tested benefits -non-taxable allowances-pensions from superannuation schemes not registered with the Financial Markets Authority -student allowances -veteran's pension-overseas pensions -living alone payments-rents -redundancy payments-estate and trust income -retiring allowances-royalties -jury and witness fees-income attributed to you from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) -interest and dividends -taxable Māori authority distributions-income arising from a withdrawal from foreign superannuation schemes. -free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE14 Pensions Don't include the following pensions or annuities in your tax return: •non-taxable pensions or annuities from either life insurance funds or superannuation schemes registered with the Financial Markets Authority (eg, Government Superannuation) •pensions that are completely tax-free, such as war pensions (other than a veteran's pension). Any overseas social security pension you receive is taxable. Include it at Question 17 (see the notes on page 23). If you receive a United Kingdom national retirement pension and have joined the special banking option operated by Work and Income, include the income and tax deducted at Question 11A. For more information about overseas pensions read page 23. Question 12 Schedular payments Schedular payments are generally payments made to people who are not employees but are employed on a contract basis. All ACC personal service rehabilitation payments which are paid by ACC or your employer are classified as schedular payments. Different tax rates apply to schedular payments, depending on the work done. A full list is available in the PAYE tables (IR340 and IR341) and on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C). People who receive schedular payments will receive a summary of earnings (SOE) detailing their schedular payments received and the tax deducted. If your SOE shows total schedular income over $200, you must file an IR3 return. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you are an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, please read the information on page 52 before you complete Question 12. Question 12C Expenses related to schedular payments Show any expenses you can claim against this income here. Don't include it with other expenses at Question 26. Question 12D Net schedular payments This is the total gross schedular payments shown at Box 12B, less any expenses being claimed at Box 12C. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Include the amount of tax loss in Box 12D. What to show on your return Copy the total tax deducted (Box 12A) and gross payments (Box 12B) from your SOE to the same box numbers of your return. Add up the expenses related to your schedular payments and print the total in Box 12C. Subtract Box 12C from Box 12B and print the result in Box 12D. 15 www.ird.govt.nz If you're registered for GST, your gross schedular payment may include GST. Enter the GST-exclusive amount at Question 12B. Note Shareholder-employee salary If you received a shareholder-employee salary with no PAYE deducted, show the amount at Question 21. ACC levies You'll have to pay ACC levies on schedular payments. ACC will invoice you for these. Question 13 New Zealand interest Did you receive any New Zealand interest between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 from: •banks •Inland Revenue •building and investment societies •credit unions •securities •a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust •loans you've made? If so, show all the New Zealand interest you received at Question 13B. If the interest is from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust please tick Box 13C. If you were charged commission on any of your interest, claim this at Question 26. Read the note about expenses on page 32. Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have "negative interest" to account for. This is interest you've repaid on the term deposit. It may reduce the amount of interest you need to declare on your tax return. If you broke the term deposit in full, use the worksheet below to deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on your Deduction certificate for RWT on interest (IR15) or equivalent statement. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your IR15 to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Include this in the amount shown at Box 13B. 3 IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE16 RWT During the year, RWT will have been deducted from some or all of your interest and you can claim a credit for this. The interest payer will usually send you an IR15 or similar statement which shows the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Add up the amounts from each statement or certificate and print the totals in Boxes 13A and 13B. Don't send us your statements or IR15s, but keep them in case we need to see them later. Interest of $50 or less If the interest you received for the year is $50 or less, you may not receive a certificate or statement, but you still need to show the gross interest and RWT. Get the details from your bank statements. Interest on joint accounts If you hold a joint account, you must show your share of the interest in your tax return. Interest from overseas If you received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show it at Question 17. Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Farm vendor mortgage or finance bonds If you received interest from a farm vendor mortgage or farm vendor finance bonds approved by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand, only half of the interest is taxable. Show the RWT deducted and the taxable amount of interest in Boxes 13A and 13B. Income from financial arrangements If you are a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To determine whether a spreading method must be used, see "Financial arrangements" on page 31. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. Any RWT will have to be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. Interest paid by Inland Revenue If we pay you interest because you overpaid your tax, include the gross interest in Box 13B in the income year you received the interest. Interest paid by a person If you paid us interest because you underpaid your tax, include it as a deduction in the return at Question 26 for the income year the interest is paid. 17 www.ird.govt.nz Question 14 New Zealand dividends Dividends are a part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes and unit trust distributions are treated as dividends. Complete Question 14 if you received any New Zealand dividends between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, including dividends from your local electricity or gas company (but don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax-free). The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Include dividends earned by a partnership or estate, or distributed by a trust. If you were charged commission on any of your dividends, claim this at Question 26. Read the notes about expenses on page 32. If you receive dividends from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) that is a listed company and doesn't use your prescribed investor rate, you can decide whether or not to include the dividends in your return. Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits so the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. If the dividend is from a listed PIE, it should not have RWT deducted. What to show on your return Your dividend statements show the amount: •you received (net dividend) •of any imputation credit •of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your gross dividend. Add up all the imputation credits, RWT credits and gross dividend totals and transfer them to the relevant boxes at Question 14. If the dividends are from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust, please tick Box 14C. Don't send us your dividend statements, but keep them in case we ask for them later. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE18 Shares and other non-cash dividends If you received shares from a taxable bonus issue or a non-cash dividend , include them as income at Question 14. Dividends from overseas Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Question 15 Māori authority distributions Complete Question 15 if you received taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit" and includes tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits. What to show on your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: •the distribution made to you, including which portion is taxable and which portion isn't •the Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, to the relevant boxes at Question 15. For more information read our guide Māori authorities (IR487). Question 16 Estate or trust income If you received estate or trust income that relates to the year 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, show it at Question 16. There are three types of estates or trusts: •complying •foreign •non-complying. Complying trusts are trusts that have been taxed in New Zealand on all their income since the day they started. Allocations of beneficiary income which the minor beneficiary rule applies to are taxed as trustee income. This means the trust is subject to tax on this income at 33 cents in the dollar, and it's included in the trustee tax calculation in the trust's IR6 return. These distributions shouldn't be included in the minor's individual tax return. All other trusts are non-complying or foreign. Read our guide Trusts' and estates' income tax rules (IR288) for more details. 19 www.ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Add up the tax paid by the trustee/s and print the total in Box 16A. Print your share of the estate or complying trust income in Box 16B. But, if your estate or trust income includes: •interest with RWT deducted, show this at Question 13 and tick 13C. •dividends with imputation credits attached, show this at Question 14 and tick 14C. •overseas income and overseas tax paid, show this at Question 17 •taxable Māori authority distributions, show this at Question 15. Income from foreign and non-complying trusts If you're a beneficiary of a foreign or non-complying trust please complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) form. Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts Copy the amount of taxable distributions from the non-complying trust to Box 16C, and attach the IR307 to the top of page 3 of your return. We separate taxable distributions from non-complying trusts because they're taxed at a different rate. If you have this type of income, your tax calculation at Question 32 may not be correct. We'll do this calculation for you and send you a notice of assessment. Question 17 Overseas income If you received income from, or while you were overseas, between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, show it at Box 17B in New Zealand dollars. This includes taxable income from withdrawals and transfers from foreign superannuation schemes while you were a non-resident of New Zealand. Transitional residents must include any foreign employment or service income at Box 17B. You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: •using the rates tables on our website (search keywords: overseas currencies) •contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Portable NZ Super and/or portable veteran's pension paid while residing overseas are tax exempt and won't need to be included on your return. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: Veterans income). Note IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE20 Dividends received from overseas companies that are treated as FIFs (except companies covered by the exclusions listed under foreign rights at Question 36) are not taxable separately. Generally, you would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate), which doesn't tax dividends separately. The foreign tax deducted from the dividend may be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income for that company. Note Foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you've received a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme, have transferred your foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme, or you have transferred a superannuation interest to another person you are liable for income tax unless you qualify for an exemption. You need to calculate the amount of taxable income from the withdrawal or transfer (refer below) and include this income in Box 17B, and tick Box 17C. Lump sums received or transferred in the first four years of New Zealand tax residence are generally exempt from tax; see "temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals" on page 23. Lump sums and transfers are taxed using one of two methods: •schedule method (default method) - this means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income, based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident and contributions you've made in that time (certain conditions apply). •formula method (alternative method) - can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and meets certain requirements. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. KiwiSaver withdrawal facility for tax liability on foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you transfer a lump sum to a KiwiSaver scheme you may have income tax and student loan repayment obligations. You can request a withdrawal of funds from your KiwiSaver account to pay these obligations. Your KiwiSaver provider will deal with your application. For more information about foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) or go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: foreign superannuation). Foreign investment fund (FIF) income If, at any time during the 2018 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. Generally, you'll use the fair dividend rate (FDR) or comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income. 21 www.ird.govt.nz The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: •investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts (a list of these companies is available on our website (search keyword: IR871) •interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) •a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). From 1 April 2014 the FIF rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes unless acquired when the holder was a New Zealand tax resident or the interest is grandparented. For more information see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257). There's also an exemption from the FIF rules where the total cost of all the investment for FIF purposes is below NZ$50,000. What to show on your return After you've converted the amounts to New Zealand dollars, add up the available amounts of overseas tax paid and print the total in Box 17A. Add up the gross amounts of overseas income (before tax was deducted) and print the total in Box 17B. Staple proof of any overseas tax paid to the top of page 3 of your return. If a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) was maintained, complete a Branch equivalent tax account return (IR308) and attach it to your IR3 return. Tax paid overseas If you paid tax overseas on any foreign income derived, you may be able to claim it as a credit against your New Zealand tax payable. The amount of credit you receive may be restricted by any double taxation agreements and is the lesser of the actual amount of tax paid on the overseas income or the amount of tax you would pay in New Zealand on the foreign income. To claim an overseas tax credit you must supply proof of the tax deducted, eg, an overseas tax deduction certificate. If you need one, you'll have to request it from the overseas government agency concerned. Staple a copy of the certificate to the top of page 3 of your return. Also, if you receive a dividend that isn't taxed separately under the FIF rules, you can offset most overseas tax credit paid on the dividend against your tax payable. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461) pages 25 to 29. Claiming overseas tax paid on overseas dividends FIF income You can claim the tax paid up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the FIF income associated with the attributing interest that has paid the dividend. If you used the FDR method you can use the overseas tax paid to reduce the tax payable on the FDR income associated with that attributing interest. Please note that Australian franking credits and tax on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed as overseas tax paid. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE22 Where there is no FIF income or a FIF loss Tax paid overseas can only be used to cover your liability for income tax payable on your FIF income. If there is no New Zealand income tax payable on your FIF investment, no claim can be made for the overseas tax paid on any dividends received from that FIF. You cannot get a refund of overseas tax paid, or reduce tax payable on any other income. For more information read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). Unused overseas tax credits Generally, these are forfeited (lost). Carrying forward any excess or unused overseas tax credits? You can't carry forward unused overseas credits where you have used the FDR, CV, deemed rate of return or cost methods to calculate FIF income or loss. New Zealand tax credits (imputation or RWT) deducted from overseas dividends You can claim New Zealand tax credits on overseas dividends as follows: •If the credits are RWT, they are used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. •If they're imputation credits, they are used to reduce tax payable. If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. •Any excess imputation credit can't be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. The full amount of these New Zealand tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is an FIF loss. These credits will only be attached to Australian company or unit trust dividends. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Temporary tax exemption from foreign income If you're currently claiming the four-year temporary tax (transitional resident) exemption for certain types of foreign-sourced income, you don't need to declare this income in Box 17B, unless it's foreign employment or services income. When your tax exemption expires, you must include all your worldwide income when you file your income tax return. Go to www.ird.govt.nz for further information about the temporary tax exemption qualifying criteria and types of exempt foreign-sourced income. 23 www.ird.govt.nz Temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals This four-year exemption period is similar to the temporary tax exemption from foreign income and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals during the period. The exemption doesn't require you to be non-resident for a minimum period. This exemption applies if you: •first acquired your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and •haven't previously had this exemption. Foreign superannuation withdrawals during the four-year exemption period do not need to be declared as income in Box 17B. Go to www.ird.govt.nz for further information about the foreign superannuation temporary exemption or read our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257). Australian dividends from non-FIF companies If you received Australian dividends, your dividend statements may show all or some of the following: •the franked/unfranked amount •Australian withholding tax •imputed credit or franking credits •New Zealand imputation credits. Add up the amounts of Australian withholding tax deducted and print the total in Box 17A. Dividends paid by Australian companies may have a New Zealand imputation credit. To calculate the gross dividend, add together the franked and unfranked amounts, along with the New Zealand imputation credits and print the total in Box 17B. Don't include any Australian imputed or franking credits. Claim New Zealand imputation credits in Box 14. Overseas pensions If you received an overseas social security pension, convert the amount into New Zealand dollars. Print the total in Box 17B. You may also have received other types of overseas pensions, such as foreign private annuities or foreign investment funds. For more information, please read the note about foreign rights disclosure on page 49. Under most of the tax treaties New Zealand has with other jurisdictions, you cannot claim a tax credit for tax deducted overseas on pensions. If you paid tax on the pension overseas, generally you need to claim a refund or tax credit from the overseas tax authority, not from Inland Revenue in New Zealand. For more information, please read our guides Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) and Overseas social security pensions (IR258) or go to www.ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/ IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE24 Specific dividends If you received dividends that are treated as interest or that are from an overseas company through an agent or trustee, who has deducted RWT in New Zealand, show the tax credits and overseas income in Boxes 17A and 17B. Show New Zealand RWT deducted in Box 14A. Staple a copy of the dividend statement to the top of page 3 of your return. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Note Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute the net income/loss and tax credits they derive across their investors. Individual investors generally don't include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. You can only claim a loss when it has the zero rate applied. In all other cases you cannot claim a loss from your PIE. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement, setting out the details of the income/loss and the tax it has paid on the income it has attributed to you. Where your PIE has calculated the tax using a prescribed investor rate lower than your correct rate or you have exited a PIE that doesn't calculate tax when an investor exits, you may need to include the income in your return to pay the tax. Where you're required to include attributed PIE income in your return, show the income and tax paid/ credit where the rate lower than your correct rate has been applied. Include any tax credits shown on your PIE's investor statement where you've exited from a PIE that zero-rates exiting investors. You can show the net income or loss (after adjusting for the investor level fees) in Question 17B and the general tax credits shown at 17A. Where any specified tax credits (eg, RWT) are shown, include these in the appropriate question on the return. If you have a student loan or if you're eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits you now have to declare PIE income on an Adjust your income (IR215) form, except if the PIE is a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme (eg, KiwiSaver) where the funds are locked in. If you have declared PIE income in your return and it is from a: •non-locked-in PIE it will be taken into account •locked-in PIE you need to show the amount on the IR215 so we can exclude it from your income. If you have non-locked-in PIE income or dividends from a listed PIE that are not included in your return you may need to declare it on the IR215 for either or both student loan and Working for Families Tax Credits. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: adjust your income). 25 www.ird.govt.nz Question 18 Partnership income Show your share of income from the partnership's trade or business from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 in Box 18B, unless it includes: •interest and any RWT - show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits - show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •overseas income and overseas tax paid - show this at Question 17 •rental income - show this at Question 22 •other income and, if your share of this income: –is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (eg, you were a sleeping partner), or –is generated from other investment activity (eg, sale of shares), show this at Question 24. Partnership income earned as a result of "active" involvement is liable for ACC levies, which will be invoiced by ACC. Losses from limited partnerships If you're claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to www.ird.govt.nz Expenses You may be able to claim expenses against your share of the partnership income that wasn't claimed in the partnership's IR7 return, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership. Claim these expenses at Question 26. Question 19 Look-through company (LTC) income If you received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 19. Don’t include: •interest and any RWT – show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits – show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •Māori authority distributions and credits – show these at Question 15 •any overseas income – show this at Question 17, along with qualifying tax credits attached •rental income – show this at Question 22. The LTC will normally supply information about non-allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. Note The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner’s “owner’s basis” (equity) in the LTC. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE26 For the 2017-18 and later income years the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. For most LTC owners, you can now claim the full amount of your prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This won’t apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. Daniel is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2017-18 income year Daniel has a net loss of $7,000.00 from the LTC. Daniel also has prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Daniel has no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Daniel’s tax return should show these amounts in the following boxes: •19A: $0.00 •19B: $7,000.00- •19C: $0.00 •19D: $5,000.00 •19E: $12,000.00- Example What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 19A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 19B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 19C. There shouldn’t be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimed this year and print in Box 19D. You’ll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 19C, add this to Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you have an amount in Box 19D, subtract this from Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you don’t have any amounts in Box 19C or Box 19D, copy the amount from Box 19B to 19E. Box 19E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in our guide Look-through companies (IR879). 27 www.ird.govt.nz Question 21 Shareholder-employee salary If, as a shareholder-employee, you received a salary between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 with PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 11A. If, as a shareholder-employee, your shareholder-employee's salary or director's fees had no PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 21. If you would normally receive a shareholder-employee salary (even if you didn't receive one this year), please tick 21A. If you are not a shareholder employee and you received director's fees with no tax deducted, show the income at Question 23. The company that paid your salary or fees will be able to tell you exactly how much to show in your return. Question 21B In-work tax credit (IWTC) is for families who normally work a minimum number of hours each week, as follows: •a two-parent family where one or both parents between them normally work 30 hours or more a week •a single parent normally working 20 hours or more a week. The eligibility criteria for IWTC changed from 1 April 2011 to include the hours worked without pay by major shareholders 1 in their close companies 2 . To qualify, the company must derive gross income. If you're already registered for WfFTC, and now meet the requirements for IWTC you'll need to tick Box 21B of your IR3. If you're not registered for WfFTC but you think you qualify, please complete a Working for Families Tax Credits registration form (FS1). For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: in-work tax credit). ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employee remuneration or director's fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company should deduct earners' levy from your remuneration or director's fees when declared. ACC will invoice the company for this. Question 22 Rents Show income you received from rents between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 at Question 22. Prepare a summary of the details for each rental property. You can use either: •the Rental income (IR3R) form, which asks for all the information we need, or •your own summary. If you need an IR3R form, you can print a copy off our website www.ird.govt.nz If you prepare your own summary, please refer to the IR3R form or our guide Rental income (IR264) to see what to include. 1 You are a major shareholder if you either own, control or have rights to acquire at least 10% of shares or voting rights in a close company, or have by other means at least 10% control of a close company. 2 A company where there are five or fewer shareholders whose total voting interests in the company are greater than 50%.

Schedular payment income Don't show any schedular payment income at Question 23. This income is declared at Question 12. If you're an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, please read the information on page 52 before you complete Question 12. You can claim expenses and deductions against many schedular payments at Question 12C - see page 14. Attribution rules The attribution rule may apply where an individual provides services to an associated person (company, trust, partnership). In particular, it can apply where the associated person sells those services on, principally to a third party. To find out how to apply this rule, please read Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Prepare a summary of details You can use any of the following: •your financial records •the Farming income (IR3F) form for agricultural businesses •the Business income (IR3B) form for other businesses •the Financial statement summary (IR10) form. Staple one of the above forms to page 3 of your return and print your profit (net income) in Box 23. The Financial statement summary (IR10) is a short form of the financial statements of a business. Use an IR10 and speed up processing of the return. We don't need a set of accounts if you use the IR10. You still need to complete a set of financial accounts and keep them in case we ask for them later. For help with filling out the IR10, see our IR10 guide. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them too. Providing childcare services in a home Based on the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 and/or the Licensing Criteria for Home-Based Education and Care Services 2008, Inland Revenue's Determination DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers sets out the types of expenditure generally incurred (standard cost) by individuals providing childcare services in their home. But, if you're a childcare provider who's registered for GST, this determination doesn't apply to you. 29 www.ird.govt.nz Individuals providing childcare services in their homes may use the standard costs (set out in the determination) or their actual costs and income for calculating their tax. If your childcare activities began part-way through the year, calculate your tax from that date using either the standard costs or actual costs. See our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005) for details. Show your childcare income at Question 23 if: •the determination applies to you, and your childcare taxable income is greater than nil, after standard costs have been deducted, or •you keep full records of your childcare income and actual expenses, and you make a taxable profit or loss after expenses have been deducted. If you need help deciding whether you need to declare childcare income using standard costs, please call us. You can't offset any loss calculated using standard costs (see the determination) against other income in any income year. Note Childcare services not under the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 These childcare providers can't use the determination. They must keep full records of actual income and expenses and are liable for tax on their total income after actual expenses are deducted for childcare services provided. At Question 23 show any childcare taxable income or loss after expenses have been deducted. ACC levies Income from self-employment is liable for ACC levies which ACC will invoice you for. Question 24 Other income If you received any other income between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, show it at Question 24. This may include: •the sale of land and/or buildings •the sale of non-FIF shares or other property •financial arrangements •cash jobs, payments made “under the table”, tips, bartering or income from an illegal enterprise •any share of partnership income as a result of capital investment •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme if your employer has not provided us with this information. If you’re not sure if your income is taxable, please call us. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE30 Income from the sale of land and/or buildings The profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If you purchased a property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within two years, any profit will be taxable, even if you didn’t intend to sell when you purchased it. The profits may also be taxable if you: •are a builder and improved a property before selling it •developed or subdivided land and sold sections •had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Show the total profit in Box 24. If you’re a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Income from the sale of non-FIF shares or other property The profits are taxable if you bought: •and sold shares or other property as a business •shares or other property for the purpose of resale •shares or property to make a profit. This doesn't apply to shares that are FIFs. Print the total profit in Box 24. Staple the details of your income and expenses from these sales to the top of page 3 of your return. Sale or disposal of assets If you sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, call us or read our guides Depreciation (IR260), General depreciation rates (IR265) or Historic depreciation rates (IR267). Losses from the sale of land, buildings, shares or other property If you made a loss and can show that if you'd made a profit, it would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Show the total in Box 24. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within two years, any excess deductions can’t be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. The Property sale information (IR833) form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property (IR313). 31 www.ird.govt.nz Financial arrangements If you're a party to a financial arrangement, you must account for income from those arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. A cash-basis person doesn't need to use the accrual method to calculate income. You qualify as a cash- basis person if: •on every day in the income year the absolute value of all financial arrangements added together is $1,000,000 or less, or •the absolute value of your income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements is $100,000 or less, and •the deferral of income or acceleration of expenditure using the cash method rather than the accrual method is $40,000 or less. If you held the financial arrangement prior to 20 May 1999 the amounts above may be reduced to $600,000, $70,000 and $20,000 respectively. Please note the "absolute value" is the value of an amount whether it's positive or negative. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading method applies, you must do a "wash-up" calculation in certain circumstances. For example: •a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred •there is an absolute assignment of the financial arrangement •a party to a financial arrangement is released from making all remaining payments under the Insolvency Act 1967, the Companies Act 1993 or the laws of a country or territory other than New Zealand •you cease to be a resident of New Zealand. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are brought to account. This applies in every case - you don't have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or have bought them for the purpose of resale, as you would with shares. When calculating the income or expenditure on sale, use our Sale or disposal of financial arrangements (IR3K) form. Income from cash jobs, tips, "under the table" payments, bartering or an illegal enterprise If you received any other type of income that didn't have tax deducted from it, show it in Box 24. Staple the details of your income and any expenses to the top of page 3 of your return. Share of partnership income as a result of capital investment If your share of partnership income is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (ie, you were a sleeping partner), show your share of partnership income in Box 24. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE32 Question 24A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If you are an “offshore RLWT person” and have sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. You should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. You can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Show the name of your withholder(s) in the “name of payer” box. Question 26 Other expenses and deductions If you paid any of these expenses, between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, you can claim them in Box 26. •a fee to someone for completing your tax return •commission on interest or dividend income (but not bank fees - they're a private expense) •additional expenses incurred in earning partnership income, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership •interest on money you borrowed to buy shares or to invest - as long as the investment will produce some taxable income •premiums on loss of earnings insurance (income protection), provided the benefit from the insurance policy is taxable •interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, only if the interest is not already included as a deduction in your accounts. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you're an ACC client and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments and have retained some of these, you may claim the payments you've made to your caregiver as a deduction at Question 12C.

Question 30 Independent earner tax credit (IETC) You can calculate your IETC: •by using the worksheets provided in this section •by calling our self-service line - see page 58. IETC The IETC is a tax credit for individuals whose annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000. Your annual net income is shown at Box 27 "Income after expenses" in your return. If you're eligible for IETC, but earn over $44,000, your annual entitlement to IETC decreases by 13 cents for every dollar earned above $44,000. For the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, you'll be entitled to IETC for any months: •you were a New Zealand tax resident •you or your partner weren't entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits (or received an overseas equivalent) and you didn't receive: –an income-tested benefit –NZ Super –a veteran's pension or –an overseas equivalent of any of the above. You're a tax resident if you lived in New Zealand for more than 183 days in the last twelve months, or have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. For more information, read our guide New Zealand tax residence (IR292). To work out the months you're entitled to this tax credit, use the total number of whole months the criteria applied to. If you didn't meet the above criteria for even one day of any month you won't be entitled to IETC at all for that month, so don't include it in your calculation. \* Net income means your total income from all sources, less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). 35 www.ird.govt.nz Calculating your IETC Enter the start and end dates when you had any overseas income that excludes you from being eligible for IETC at Box 30B on your return. If the overseas income continued past the end of the year enter the end date for the income as 31/03/2018. If you have more than one date range for the overseas excluded income, attach a note telling us of the date ranges. You'll also need to include any dates you weren't a New Zealand tax resident.

IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE40 Excess imputation credits carried forward Imputation credits are treated differently from RWT. If you received dividends from a New Zealand company that gave you imputation credits or an Australian company that gave you New Zealand imputation credits, you may have excess imputation credits to carry forward. This will only happen if your total imputation credits (including any excess imputation credits brought forward from 2017) are greater than your total tax payable. Use the worksheet below to work out the excess imputation credits that must be carried forward to your 2019 tax return. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount. Worksheet Copy your total imputation credits from Box 9 of your tax calculation on page 39 in this guide to Box 1. 1 Copy your total tax payable from Box 6 of your tax calculation on page 39 in this guide to Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer in Box 3. 3 This is your excess imputation credits amount to carry forward to 2019. Student loan We'll work out how much of your student loan you need to repay, based on your income. If you have an end-of-year repayment obligation we'll send you a notice showing how much is due. If you want to calculate the amount yourself, either use the worksheet provided here or go to "Work it out" on our website. The worksheet is for your information only and will give you an indication of your student loan end-of-year repayment obligation. Interest-free student loan If you've lived in New Zealand for six months (183 days) or more, your student loan is interest-free. Interest will be charged and then written off on a daily basis. Even if you haven't been in New Zealand for six months, you may qualify for an interest-free student loan if you meet the criteria for an exemption. Go to our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: interest free) for more details. End of year repayment obligation Repayment deductions from salary or wages are generally considered your final obligation on that income and don't form part of your end-of-year repayment obligation. Income from casual agricultural work and election day work doesn't have student loan deductions. This income is excluded as salary and wage income and becomes part of adjusted net income. 41 www.ird.govt.nz If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, any income or deductions are excluded in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, you can offset a loss from one business or investment activity against other like income. For example, Rory has an overall loss from his landscaping business of $7,500. He has also made a profit from his lawnmowing service of $50,000. The activities are carried out in association with each other, so Rory can claim the $7,500 loss against the $50,000 profit. From the 2017 tax year onwards income adjustments are now required to be part of your adjusted net income. For a full list of the adjustments required go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: adjust your income). You'll only have an end-of-year repayment obligation if you: •have adjusted net income of $1,500 or more with a total income (including salary or wages) of $20,584 (annual repayment threshold plus $1,500) or more •had an interim assessment for the year. Adjusted net income is your annual gross income, excluding salary or wages and less annual total deductions you may claim. If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, neither the income or the deductions from that activity are included in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, a loss from one business or investment activity can be offset against other like income. Note Annual total deductions are the expenses and deductions you can claim for the tax year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE42 If you're required to file an Adjust your income (IR215) form, you can't use this worksheet to calculate your 2018 repayment obligation. Once we have received your IR3 and your IR215 we will send you your end-of-year repayment obligation for 2018. Note Use this worksheet to calculate your 2018 repayment. Annual repayment threshold. 1 19,084 00 Copy any gross salary or wage income (excluding casual agricultural or election day income) from Box 11B of your return to Box 2. 2 If Box 2 is more than Box 1 print $0.00 in Box 3, otherwise subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the result in Box 3. 3 This is your unused repayment threshold you can use against your other income. Enter your income after expenses from Box 27 of your return (excluding any losses), less any salary and wage income from Box 2 in Box 4. 4 Subtract Box 3 from Box 4. If the result is less than $1,500.00 print $0.00 in Box 5. Otherwise, print the result in Box 5 (this is your total liable income). 5 Multiply the amount in Box 5 by 0.12 (12%). 6 This is your end-of-year payment obligation for the 2018 tax year. Print any 2017 voluntary repayments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6A. 6A Print any 2018 interim payments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6B. 6B Add Boxes 6A and 6B together and print the result in Box 7. 7 Subtract Box 7 from Box 6 and print your answer in Box 8. 8 If Box 7 is less than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year loan repayment. (Tick one) Loan repayment If Box 7 is larger than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year overpayment. Overpayment 43 www.ird.govt.nz Question 33 Early payment discount An early payment discount is available for people who: •are new in business •haven't begun to pay provisional tax •made payments within the corresponding income year up to their balance date, eg, a standard balance date taxpayer, who has made a payment or payments on or before 31 March 2018 as income tax for the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018. The discount is calculated at the rate of 6.7% of either: •the amount paid during the year, or •105% of your end-of-year residual income tax liability, whichever is the lesser, and is credited against your end-of-year tax bill. To check if you qualify, work through the following flowchart. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE44 Do you qualify for an early payment discount?

Year - as referred to in the diagram on the next page, year means the standard tax year from 1 April to 31 March, unless you have an approved different balance date, in which case your income year will end then. If you have any questions about your entitlement to the discount, please contact us.

If you've made payments towards your 2019 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, we can include the overpayment in the amount we refund or transfer. Print the overpaid amount in Box 34A. Direct credit If you choose direct credit you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct bank account number is printed at Question 8 on the front page of your return. Refunds of less than $5 If your refund is less than $5 we will carry it forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you don't want it carried forward please call us. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like your excess tax transferred (the "transfer date"). The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. For more information on the rules for working out the date the transfer is available, please refer to the tables on our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: credit transfers). IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE46 Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out the boxes on page 5 of your return. If you ask for a transfer on your return, we will transfer your refund at one of the following dates: Transfer to your own account or an account of someone associated to you, the later of: •the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March), or •the due date in the destination account. Transfer to an account of someone not associated to you: •the day after your return was filed. If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you'd like the credit transferred at a different date, you can contact us and ask for the transfer date to be changed (including if we've transferred your credit to cover a debt). Associated taxpayers The following are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: •a company you're a shareholder-employee in •a partner in the same partnership •a relative (eg, child, parent) •spouse or partner •a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. Transfers requiring a separate note attached to the return Situations such as requesting a transfer at a future date, transfer to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement and transfers at a different date will require you to attach a separate note to your return advising the following specific details. •The amount you want transferred. •The account you want it transferred to, eg, name, IRD number, tax type and period end date (and if it's another person, whether they're associated). •The date you'd like the credit transferred. •If it is to be transferred to debt covered by an instalment arrangement. Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling funds transferred in. 47 www.ird.govt.nz Provisional tax Question 35 Provisional tax Provisional tax is generally payable because you earned income during the year that either: •wasn't taxed, or •was taxed at the wrong rate. It's usually payable in three instalments during the year (28 August 2018, 15 January 2019, 7 May 2019), unless: •you have a non-standard balance date, or •you pay GST on a six-monthly basis, or •you use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax. If your 2018 residual income tax (RIT) (Box 32A of your return) is more than $2,500, you'll become a provisional tax payer and will be liable to pay 2019 provisional tax. For more information read our guides Provisional tax (IR289) or Penalties and interest (IR240). Initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. You will have an initial provisional tax liability if: •you begin to derive income from a taxable activity during the tax year, and •your RIT in any of the four preceding tax years didn't exceed $2,500, and •your RIT for the current year is $60,000 or more. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). The date you cease employment determines when interest will be charged from. You are not liable to pay provisional tax in the year you have an initial provisional tax liability. You may make voluntary payments to reduce your interest liability. Interest rules if you have an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply to when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Payment options You have three options for paying provisional tax - the standard option "S", the estimation option "E" or the ratio option "R". Standard option Under this option, your 2019 provisional tax is the same as your 2018 RIT (if it is more than $2,500) plus 5%. Copy this amount to Box 35B of your return and print “S” in Box 35A. Divide the amount by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment - record this on page 51. If you’re filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE48 If you think your income for 2019 will be more than your 2018 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Note Use this worksheet to calculate your 2019 provisional tax using the standard option "S" Copy your RIT from Box 32A of your return to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.05 (5%).

Estimation option Anyone can estimate provisional tax. If you expect your 2019 RIT to be lower than your 2018 RIT, estimating will keep you from paying more than you have to. If you choose to estimate, your estimate must be fair and reasonable at the time you make it and at each instalment date. You can be charged a penalty and/or interest if you don't take reasonable care when you estimate your provisional tax.

If you or your caregiver receive these payments, regardless of whether ACC or your employer makes them, you'll need to read this information before you complete your return. Any ACC personal service rehabilitation payments paid by ACC or your employer direct to the client or caregiver, are schedular payments and will have tax deducted before the payments are made. Depending on their circumstances, ACC clients or carers receiving ACC personal service rehabilitation payments may not be required to file an IR3. Do I need to file? Are you a caregiver receiving payments from ACC, or a caregiver paid by a client? If you earn over $14,000 from all sources of income, you're required to file an IR3. If you earn less than $14,000, you're not required to file an IR3 because enough tax will have been deducted during the year from these payments. However, you may have another reason to file an IR3 - see page 5 for more information. If you're not required to file an IR3 please call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll update our records. Are you a client who received these payments from ACC and then passed on those payments to your caregiver? Because you've received these personal service rehabilitation payments from ACC to pass on to your caregiver, we've sent you an IR3. You're not required to file an IR3 if: •you have no other income •you're not liable for child support •you don't have a student loan and income over the threshold •your family is not entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits •you have no other reason to file - see page 5. Please note the above rules apply whether or not you've passed these payments on to your caregiver. If you're not required to file, please call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll update our records. If you're a client or caregiver who is required to file, please read the information on the following pages before you complete Questions 12 and 26. Question 12 Schedular payments If you're a caregiver paid directly by ACC Use the income from schedular payments information on your summary of earning (SOE) to help you complete your IR3. If you haven't received an SOE, call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll send you a copy. If you haven't given ACC your IRD number, please include any payments that aren't on your SOE in your IR3. Enter the amount of tax deducted in Box 12A. Enter the total gross payments in Box 12B. 53 www.ird.govt.nz If you're a caregiver paid by the ACC client Using the records you've kept on the amount of personal service rehabilitation payments you received throughout the year, work out the gross payments to show in your return.

Staple the details of your income to the top of page 3 of your return. Note If you're an ACC client If you've kept all payments and haven't paid any of the money received from ACC to your caregiver(s), use the amounts from schedular payments information on your SOE. Enter the tax on schedular payments in Box 12A and enter the total gross payments in Box 12B. If you haven't received your SOE, you can get these details from myIR secure online services or call us on 0800 377 774 and we will send you a copy. If you haven't provided ACC with your IRD number, please include any payments that aren't on your SOE in your IR3. If you've passed on all the income to your caregiver(s) you don't need to include these from your SOE at Question 12. This is because these payments, when they're all passed to your caregiver(s) throughout the year, are considered exempt income to you. You won't need to put any amount in Boxes 12A or 12B. Please attach a copy of the payments you made to your caregiver(s) with your IR3. If you've kept some of the income, you'll include the total gross payments from your SOE at Box 12B but claim any of these payments you've passed on to your caregiver(s) as a deduction at Question 12C. Read Question 12C Expenses related to schedular payments below. If you haven't given ACC your IRD number, please include any payments that aren't on your SOE in your IR3.

More information If you have any questions about your tax please go to our website www.ird.govt.nz Accident Compensation Act 2001 (ACC) Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide earnings information from your IR 3 return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). ACC will begin invoicing self- employed levies from August 2017. ACC gets the information from IR3 returns as follows: •Question 11A Gross earnings with PAYE deducted and earnings not liable for ACC earners' levy •Question 12 Schedular payments •Question 17 Overseas income •Question 18 Share of partnership income ("active" income) from the partnership's trade or business •Question 19 Look-through company (LTC) active income •Question 21 Shareholder-employee salary with no tax deducted •Question 23 Self-employed income •Question 24 Other income •Question 26 Other expenses. Shareholder-employees Other income In addition to your shareholder's remuneration, you may also have received other income liable for ACC levies, such as self-employed income. ACC will take your shareholder-employee remuneration into account if invoicing for additional levies. 57 www.ird.govt.nz Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of ACC earners' levy deductions is $1,755.37. You may be due for a refund from ACC if your shareholder-employee remuneration is from two or more companies and the combined total is over $126,286. Please call ACC on 0508 426 837 to find out more about the refund process. Mixed income Mixed income earners are those who have a combination of employee (including shareholder-employee remuneration without PAYE deducted) and self-employed earnings. If you're in this situation you have to pay ACC levies on both sources of income, up to the maximum. ACC will invoice you for the amount you'll have to pay. Current year losses If you were in full-time employment and have recorded a loss, or your earnings are below the minimum earnings threshold, you're still liable for ACC levies. These will be calculated at the minimum level. IR56 taxpayers If you're a private domestic worker, you've already paid ACC earners' levy on your IR56 income as part of your PAYE. ACC will invoice you as an employer for other levies payable on your IR56 income. If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. ACC will make allowance for levies paid as an employer.

If you don't need to file a return but you'd like to talk to someone about your tax situation, you can call us. To help you work out if you need to file an IR3, go to www.ird.govt.nz and complete the questionnaire "Work out my income tax filing options" or call us on 0800 377 774. Note If you received any other income apart from salary, wages, interest, dividends (see further information below), and/or taxable Māori authority distributions, you must file an IR3 return. There are some exceptions. If you received personal service rehabilitation payments and are an ACC client or caregiver (who received payments from the client or ACC), please read page 52. If you had a workplace injury your employer may manage these payments instead of ACC. If you or your caregiver receives these payments, regardless of who makes them, you'll need to read the information on page 52. Note Other income includes: •self-employed income (see children's exempt income below) •over $200 of schedular payments •income derived overseas – calculated taxable income arising from a withdrawal or transfer from foreign superannuation schemes acquired while a non-resident of New Zealand •over $200 in total of: –interest derived overseas (if it's had tax deducted or not) –dividends of certain Australian resident listed companies and other overseas investments that are not treated as part of foreign investment funds (FIF) income - see page 20 –income attributed to you from your portfolio investment entity (PIE) where the income had the 0% rate applied, or where you had tax calculated by your PIE at a rate lower than your correct prescribed investor rate (PIR) during the year. If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your PIR, you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. Note the dividends will need to be acknowledged for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) and/or Student Loan purposes. •FIF income •rental income •estate, trust or partnership income •royalties •cash jobs or "under the table" payments •income from illegal enterprises •income without PAYE deducted, such as shareholder-employee salary or a claim received under a taxable loss of earnings policy. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE6 You'll also need to file an IR3 if you: •have losses to claim or brought forward from the previous year •have excess imputation credits brought forward from the previous year •left or arrived in New Zealand part-way through the year •are filing a return for a deceased person to the date of death if there is a requirement to file a return for this income year •were declared bankrupt •changed your balance date part-way through the year. Children's exempt income Read this information if for the tax year you: •were 14 or under, or •were 15, 16 or 17 and still attending school\*, or •turned 18 on or after 1 January in the previous tax year and continued to attend school\* \* including a school for people with disabilities, but excluding tertiary institutions. The following income is required to have tax taken out before you receive it: •salary or wages •schedular payments •interest •dividends, and •Māori authority distributions. If you only receive these types of income you will not need to file an IR3. However, if you are required to file an IR3 return this income needs to be included. If you receive income that has not had tax taken out before you receive it eg: •worked as a self-employed person, •worked around the home of a neighbour or family friend, and that work was not part of a business that they carry on, or •beneficiary income from a trust, such as a testamentary trust (a trust set up from an estate of a deceased person), that is not listed above as requiring to have tax taken out and your total income from these sources is less than $2,340 for the tax year, this income is exempt from tax and is not included in your return. You are not required to file a return just because you earn this type of income. If you earn $2,340 or more, the exemption does not apply and you will need to file a return and pay tax on all the income, not just the amount that exceeds the exemption. If you have to file a return but we haven't sent you an IR3, you must request and file it by 7 July 2019, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. Please call 0800 257 773 to request an IR3 return. Remember to have your IRD number with you. 7 www.ird.govt.nz Extension of time If circumstances beyond your control will prevent you from sending in your return on time, call us on 0800 377 774 and we may grant you an extension. If you have a tax agent you may have until 31 March 2020 to file the return. Contact your agent for more information. Are there any penalties? You may face penalties and prosecution if you: •are required to put in a return but don't •give false or misleading information (including not showing all your income) •leave out details on purpose so the information is misleading •file your return late. Income year The information in this guide is based on the tax year from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. If your income year is different you can still use this guide, but work out your income and expenses for your income year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE8 Using this guide Did you know you can also file your return online? Go to www.ird.govt.nz and login to myIR secure online services. The form will prepopulate with your personal details and earnings information. Before you start filling in the return make sure you have: •any interest or dividend statements •any taxable Māori authority distribution statements •any other income details, such as overseas, rental property, farming or business income •your 2019 Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) letter, if you applied for WfFTC from Inland Revenue. The questions in this guide are in the same order as the questions on the return. Don't use anyone else's preprinted return because it's precoded with their own IRD number. Questions 1 to 5 Personal information This information helps us to contact you. Please make sure we have your details exactly right. If you've changed your name or address, please update the information in the spaces provided on the return. Postal address If you use your agent's postal address leave this panel blank. Your tax agent will let us know if they've changed their address. If your address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby, please contact New Zealand Post. Date of birth We ask for this so we don't mix up people with the same name. Question 6 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. If you're unable to identify the correct code, call ACC on 0508 426 837 for more help. Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. If you don't complete your BIC code, ACC will select one on your behalf. This may mean your ACC levy rate could be incorrect. Note 9 www.ird.govt.nz Question 8 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return, please include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two boxes. Question 9 Adjustments to your income If you have a student loan or you are eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC), you may be required to include adjustments to your income. This is so that Inland Revenue can correctly assess your student loan repayment obligation and ensure you receive your correct WfFTC entitlement. To notify Inland Revenue about your income adjustments you can: •tick 9A on your IR3 and complete an Adjust your income (IR215) form and attach it to your income tax return or •log in to your myIR secure online services account and complete it there or •call us on 0800 227 774 and tell us what your adjustments are. If you don't have an IR215 form you can: •download it from our website www.ird.govt.nz or •call us on 0800 257 773. What do I need to do to receive my entitlement? If you haven't already registered for WfFTC and you qualify, go to our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: working for families) and register online. When we've received the registration form we'll send you a letter with all your family details for you to check. Please correct and return it to us if the details are incorrect. If you've already registered for WfFTC and you need to file an IR3, we'll send you a letter by the beginning of May with all your family details on it. Please check this information and return the form with your IR3 if the details are incorrect. Question 10 Non-residents and transitional residents Non-residents If you were away from New Zealand for a total of 325 days in any 12-month period and don't have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, you may be a non-resident. Read our guide New Zealand tax residence (IR292) to find out your status. If you weren't present in New Zealand and are a non-resident for a full year, but you received income from New Zealand, you may need to complete an IR3NR return instead. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE10 Transitional residents If you became a New Zealand tax resident during the year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 and you've elected not to be treated as a transitional resident, you have to complete an IR3 declaring your worldwide income from the date you became a New Zealand tax resident. Transitional residents don't have to declare their foreign-sourced income except for foreign employment income and foreign services income. If you were a non-resident for part of the year, complete Question 37 on your return. If your return isn't for a full year, we'll calculate your tax and income-related tax credits and let you know the result - see www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2006/2006-81/2006-81-exempt-transitionals/ for further information. 11 www.ird.govt.nz Your income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, salary, wages or schedular payments, the information you need to complete Questions 11, 11A and 12 will be on your Summary of Income (previously Summary of Earnings), which we'll send you in late May 2019. We send this automatically if we send you an IR3 return. Your Summary of Income (SOI) contains the following information: •all your employers throughout the year •your total gross income with tax deducted and ACC earners' levy paid •any family tax credit paid by Work and Income •your tax credits for payroll donations you've made through payroll giving. Question 11 Family tax credit from Work and Income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, copy the amount from your SOI to Box 11 if it doesn’t already show. Don't include any Working for Families Tax Credits from Inland Revenue in Box 11. Question 11A Income with tax deducted Did you receive any of these types of income with tax deducted between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019? •salary or wages •a student allowance •any income-tested benefit - unemployment or sickness, transitional retirement, independent youth, domestic purposes, widow's, invalid's or emergency •accident compensation payments related to earnings •New Zealand Superannuation (NZ Super) either income-tested or non-income tested, or a veteran's pension •other pensions, annuities or superannuation (read "Pensions" on page 14) •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme (previously known as a share purchase agreement). Note: it is up to your employer whether they deduct tax on these or not •shareholder-employee salary. If you received any of these types of income with tax deducted, you need to copy the totals from your SOI to Question 11A if they don’t already show on your return. Employee Share Scheme (ESS) benefits If you (or an associate) received free or discounted shares under an employee share scheme the taxable value will be included on your SOI as long as your employer has provided us with this information. In most cases your employer will have provided this information but if they haven’t you will need to show the taxable value at Question 24. You will need to check with your employer whether this information has been provided. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE12 What to show on your return Copy the total amounts from your SOI to the corresponding boxes (11A, 11B, 11C, 11D and 11E) on your return if it doesn’t already show. Amending your income details If any of the details on your SOI are incorrect (eg, wrong or missing employers), please make the changes on your SOI and attach it to your income tax return. You only need to attach your SOI to your income tax return if you've made changes to it. Please transfer the amended totals from your SOI to the corresponding boxes on your return and use the worksheet on page 13 to calculate your total tax deducted (11E). ACC earners' levy All employees must pay an ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of non-work related injuries, based on their earnings. We collect this on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The maximum amount of earners' levy is $1,755.37. The earners' levy is set at a rate of 1.39% (1.39 cents in the dollar). If you need to amend your employment details on your SOI, you'll need to recalculate your earners' levy. Using employer-provided information If you received payslips or other earnings information from your employer, you can use this information to complete your return and don't have to wait for your SOI. You don't include schedular payments in this calculation. You'll need to use your total PAYE deducted in your calculations. This is the amount of PAYE shown on your payslips before any tax credits for payroll donations are deducted. If you made donations through payroll giving to an organisation that is not on Inland Revenue's approved donee organisations list, you won't be able to keep the tax credits you received and you won't have paid enough PAYE throughout the year. You'll have either received a letter telling you about these extinguished tax credits or they'll show on your summary of income. Put the total PAYE, less the amount of your extinguished tax credits, in Box 11A. If the amount of total PAYE deducted isn't clear from your payslips: •contact your employer, or •refer to your SOI for details, or •refer to "Account information" in the my income tab in myIR, or •call us on 0800 227 774. 13 www.ird.govt.nz You'll need to calculate your ACC earners' levy liability and deduct it from your total PAYE, using the worksheet below.

Print your answer in Box 4. This is your ACC earners' levy. Copy this amount to Box 11D of your return. 4 Copy your total PAYE from salary and wages to Box 5. Copy this amount to Box 11A of your return. 5 Copy your total ACC earners' levy from Box 4 (above) to Box 6. 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 and print the answer in Box 7. 7 This is your total tax deducted. Copy this amount to Box 11E of your return. The following income isn't liable for ACC earners' levy -NZ Super-income from a partnership earned by a non-working partner in that partnership -income-tested benefits -non-taxable allowances-pensions from superannuation schemes not registered with the Financial Markets Authority -student allowances -veteran's pension-overseas pensions -living alone payments-rents -redundancy payments-estate and trust income -retiring allowances-royalties -jury and witness fees-income attributed to you from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) -interest and dividends -taxable Māori authority distributions-income arising from a withdrawal from foreign superannuation schemes. -free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE14 Pensions Don't include the following pensions or annuities in your tax return: •non-taxable pensions or annuities from either life insurance funds or superannuation schemes registered with the Financial Markets Authority (eg, Government Superannuation) •pensions that are completely tax-free, such as war pensions (other than a veteran's pension). Any overseas social security pension you receive is taxable. Include it at Question 17 (see the notes on page 23). If you receive a United Kingdom national retirement pension and have joined the special banking option operated by Work and Income, include the income and tax deducted at Question 11A. For more information about overseas pensions read page 23. Question 12 Schedular payments Schedular payments are generally payments made to people who are not employees but are employed on a contract basis. All ACC personal service rehabilitation payments which are paid by ACC or your employer are classified as schedular payments. Different tax rates apply to schedular payments, depending on the work done. A full list is available in the PAYE tables (IR340 and IR341) and on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C). People who receive schedular payments will receive a summary of income (SOI) detailing their schedular payments received and the tax deducted. If your SOI shows total schedular income over $200, you must file an IR3 return. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you are an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, please read the information on page 52 before you complete Question 12. Question 12A Total tax deducted This is the total amount of tax deducted from schedular payments you received during the year. The amount in this Box should also include any amount of tax deducted from schedular payments made to a close company which has been transferred directly to you as a shareholder-employee. Question 12C Expenses related to schedular payments Show any expenses you can claim against this income here. Don't include it with other expenses at Question 26. Question 12D Net schedular payments This is the total gross schedular payments shown at Box 12B, less any expenses being claimed at Box 12C. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Include the amount of tax loss in Box 12D. 15 www.ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Copy the total tax deducted (Box 12A) and gross payments (Box 12B) from your SOI to the same box numbers of your return. Add up the expenses related to your schedular payments and print the total in Box 12C. Subtract Box 12C from Box 12B and print the result in Box 12D. If you're registered for GST, your gross schedular payment may include GST. Enter the GST-exclusive amount at Question 12B. Note Shareholder-employee salary If you received a shareholder-employee salary with no PAYE deducted, show the amount at Question 21. ACC levies You'll have to pay ACC levies on schedular payments. ACC will invoice you for these. Question 13 New Zealand interest Did you receive any New Zealand interest between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 from: •banks •Inland Revenue •building and investment societies •credit unions •securities •a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust •loans you've made? If so, show all the New Zealand interest you received at Question 13B. If the interest is from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust please tick Box 13C. If you were charged commission on any of your interest, claim this at Question 26. Read the note about expenses on page 32. Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have "negative interest" to account for. This is interest you've repaid on the term deposit. It may reduce the amount of interest you need to declare on your tax return. If you broke the term deposit in full, use the worksheet on page 16 to deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on your Deduction certificate for RWT on interest (IR15) or equivalent statement. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE16 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your IR15 to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Include this in the amount shown at Box 13B. 3 RWT During the year, RWT will have been deducted from some or all of your interest and you can claim a credit for this. The interest payer will usually send you an IR15 or similar statement which shows the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Add up the amounts from each statement or certificate and print the totals in Boxes 13A and 13B. Don't send us your statements or IR15s, but keep them in case we need to see them later. Interest of $50 or less If the interest you received for the year is $50 or less, you may not receive a certificate or statement, but you still need to show the gross interest and RWT. Get the details from your bank statements. Interest on joint accounts If you hold a joint account, you must show your share of the interest in your tax return. Interest from overseas If you received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show it at Question 17. Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Farm vendor mortgage or finance bonds If you received interest from a farm vendor mortgage or farm vendor finance bonds approved by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand, only half of the interest is taxable. Show the RWT deducted and the taxable amount of interest in Boxes 13A and 13B. Income from financial arrangements If you are a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To determine whether a spreading method must be used, see "Financial arrangements" on page 31. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. Any RWT will have to be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. 17 www.ird.govt.nz Interest paid by Inland Revenue If we pay you interest because you overpaid your tax, include the gross interest in Box 13B in the income year you received the interest. Interest paid by a person If you paid us interest because you underpaid your tax, include it as a deduction in the return at Question 26 for the income year the interest is paid. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Dividends are a part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes and unit trust distributions are treated as dividends. Complete Question 14 if you received any New Zealand dividends between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, including dividends from your local electricity or gas company (but don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax-free). The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Include dividends earned by a partnership or estate, or distributed by a trust. If you were charged commission on any of your dividends, claim this at Question 26. Read the notes about expenses on page 32. If you receive dividends from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) that is a listed company and doesn't use your prescribed investor rate, you can decide whether or not to include the dividends in your return. Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits so the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. If the dividend is from a listed PIE, it should not have RWT deducted. What to show on your return Your dividend statements show the amount: •you received (net dividend) •of any imputation credit •of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your gross dividend. Add up all the imputation credits, RWT credits and gross dividend totals and transfer them to the relevant boxes at Question 14. If the dividends are from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust, please tick Box 14C. Don't send us your dividend statements, but keep them in case we ask for them later. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE18 Shares and other non-cash dividends If you received shares from a taxable bonus issue or a non-cash dividend , include them as income at Question 14. Dividends from overseas Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Question 15 Māori authority distributions Complete Question 15 if you received taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit" and includes tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits. What to show on your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: •the distribution made to you, including which portion is taxable and which portion isn't •the Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, to the relevant boxes at Question 15. For more information read our guide Māori authorities (IR487). Question 16 Estate or trust income If you received estate or trust income that relates to the year 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, show it at Question 16. There are three types of estates or trusts: •complying •foreign •non-complying. Complying trusts are trusts that have been taxed in New Zealand on all their income since the day they started. Allocations of beneficiary income which the minor beneficiary rule applies to are taxed as trustee income. This means the trust is subject to tax on this income at 33 cents in the dollar, and it's included in the trustee tax calculation in the trust's IR6 return. These distributions shouldn't be included in the minor's individual tax return. All other trusts are non-complying or foreign. Read our guide Trusts' and estates' income tax rules (IR288) for more details. 19 www.ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Add up the tax paid by the trustee/s and print the total in Box 16A. Print your share of the estate or complying trust income in Box 16B. But, if your estate or trust income includes: •interest with RWT deducted, show this at Question 13 and tick 13C. •dividends with imputation credits attached, show this at Question 14 and tick 14C. •overseas income and overseas tax paid, show this at Question 17 •taxable Māori authority distributions, show this at Question 15. Income from foreign and non-complying trusts If you're a beneficiary of a foreign or non-complying trust please complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) form. Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts Copy the amount of taxable distributions from the non-complying trust to Box 16C, and attach the IR307 to your income tax return. We separate taxable distributions from non-complying trusts because they're taxed at a different rate. If you have this type of income, your tax calculation at Question 32 may not be correct. We'll do this calculation for you and send you a notice of assessment. Question 17 Overseas income If you received income from, or while you were overseas, between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, show it at Box 17B in New Zealand dollars. This includes taxable income from withdrawals and transfers from foreign superannuation schemes while you were a non-resident of New Zealand. Transitional residents must include any foreign employment or service income at Box 17B. You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: •using the rates tables on our website (search keywords: overseas currencies) •contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Portable NZ Super and/or portable veteran's pension paid while residing overseas are tax exempt and won't need to be included on your return. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: Veterans income). Note IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE20 Dividends received from overseas companies that are treated as FIFs (except companies covered by the exclusions listed under foreign rights at Question 36) are not taxable separately. Generally, you would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate), which doesn't tax dividends separately. The foreign tax deducted from the dividend may be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income for that company. Note Foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you've received a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme, have transferred your foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme, or you have transferred a superannuation interest to another person you are liable for income tax unless you qualify for an exemption. You need to calculate the amount of taxable income from the withdrawal or transfer (refer below) and include this income in Box 17B, and tick Box 17C. Lump sums received or transferred in the first four years of New Zealand tax residence are generally exempt from tax; see "temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals" on page 23. Lump sums and transfers are taxed using one of two methods: •schedule method (default method) - this means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income, based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident and contributions you've made in that time (certain conditions apply). •formula method (alternative method) - can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and meets certain requirements. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. KiwiSaver withdrawal facility for tax liability on foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you transfer a lump sum to a KiwiSaver scheme you may have income tax and student loan repayment obligations. You can request a withdrawal of funds from your KiwiSaver account to pay these obligations. Your KiwiSaver provider will deal with your application. For more information about foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) or go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: foreign superannuation). Foreign investment fund (FIF) income If, at any time during the 2019 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. Generally, you'll use the fair dividend rate (FDR) or comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income. 21 www.ird.govt.nz The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: •investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts (a list of these companies is available on our website (search keyword: IR871) •interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) •a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). From 1 April 2014 the FIF rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes unless acquired when the holder was a New Zealand tax resident or the interest is grandparented. For more information see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257). There's also an exemption from the FIF rules where the total cost of all the investment for FIF purposes is below NZ$50,000. What to show on your return After you've converted the amounts to New Zealand dollars, add up the available amounts of overseas tax paid and print the total in Box 17A. Add up the gross amounts of overseas income (before tax was deducted) and print the total in Box 17B. Attach proof of any overseas tax paid to your income tax return. If a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) was maintained, complete a Branch equivalent tax account return (IR308) and attach it to your IR3 return. Tax paid overseas If you paid tax overseas on any foreign income derived, you may be able to claim it as a credit against your New Zealand tax payable. The amount of credit you receive may be restricted by any double taxation agreements and is the lesser of the actual amount of tax paid on the overseas income or the amount of tax you would pay in New Zealand on the foreign income. To claim an overseas tax credit you must supply proof of the tax deducted, eg, an overseas tax deduction certificate. If you need one, you'll have to request it from the overseas government agency concerned. Attach a copy of the certificate to your return. Also, if you receive a dividend that isn't taxed separately under the FIF rules, you can offset most overseas tax credit paid on the dividend against your tax payable. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461) pages 25 to 29. Claiming overseas tax paid on overseas dividends FIF income You can claim the tax paid up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the FIF income associated with the attributing interest that has paid the dividend. If you used the FDR method you can use the overseas tax paid to reduce the tax payable on the FDR income associated with that attributing interest. Please note that Australian franking credits and tax on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed as overseas tax paid. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE22 Where there is no FIF income or a FIF loss Tax paid overseas can only be used to cover your liability for income tax payable on your FIF income. If there is no New Zealand income tax payable on your FIF investment, no claim can be made for the overseas tax paid on any dividends received from that FIF. You cannot get a refund of overseas tax paid, or reduce tax payable on any other income. For more information read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). Unused overseas tax credits Generally, these are forfeited (lost). Carrying forward any excess or unused overseas tax credits? You can't carry forward unused overseas credits where you have used the FDR, CV, deemed rate of return or cost methods to calculate FIF income or loss. New Zealand tax credits (imputation or RWT) deducted from overseas dividends You can claim New Zealand tax credits on overseas dividends as follows: •If the credits are RWT, they are used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. •If they're imputation credits, they are used to reduce tax payable. If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. •Any excess imputation credit can't be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. The full amount of these New Zealand tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is an FIF loss. These credits will only be attached to Australian company or unit trust dividends. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Temporary tax exemption from foreign income If you're currently claiming the four-year temporary tax (transitional resident) exemption for certain types of foreign-sourced income, you don't need to declare this income in Box 17B, unless it's foreign employment or services income. When your tax exemption expires, you must include all your worldwide income when you file your income tax return. Go to www.ird.govt.nz for further information about the temporary tax exemption qualifying criteria and types of exempt foreign-sourced income. 23 www.ird.govt.nz Temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals This four-year exemption period is similar to the temporary tax exemption from foreign income and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals during the period. The exemption doesn't require you to be non-resident for a minimum period. This exemption applies if you: •first acquired your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and •haven't previously had this exemption. Foreign superannuation withdrawals during the four-year exemption period do not need to be declared as income in Box 17B. Go to www.ird.govt.nz for further information about the foreign superannuation temporary exemption or read our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257). Australian dividends from non-FIF companies If you received Australian dividends, your dividend statements may show all or some of the following: •the franked/unfranked amount •Australian withholding tax •imputed credit or franking credits •New Zealand imputation credits. Add up the amounts of Australian withholding tax deducted and print the total in Box 17A. Dividends paid by Australian companies may have a New Zealand imputation credit. To calculate the gross dividend, add together the franked and unfranked amounts, along with the New Zealand imputation credits and print the total in Box 17B. Don't include any Australian imputed or franking credits. Claim New Zealand imputation credits in Box 14. Overseas pensions If you received an overseas social security pension, convert the amount into New Zealand dollars. Print the total in Box 17B. You may also have received other types of overseas pensions, such as foreign private annuities or foreign investment funds. For more information, please read the note about foreign rights disclosure on page 49. Under most of the tax treaties New Zealand has with other jurisdictions, you cannot claim a tax credit for tax deducted overseas on pensions. If you paid tax on the pension overseas, generally you need to claim a refund or tax credit from the overseas tax authority, not from Inland Revenue in New Zealand. For more information, please read our guides Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) and Overseas social security pensions (IR258) or go to www.ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/ IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE24 Specific dividends If you received dividends that are treated as interest or that are from an overseas company through an agent or trustee, who has deducted RWT in New Zealand, show the tax credits and overseas income in Boxes 17A and 17B. Show New Zealand RWT deducted in Box 14A. Attach a copy of the dividend statement to your return. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Note Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute the net income/loss and tax credits they derive across their investors. Individual investors generally don't include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. You can only claim a loss when it has the zero rate applied. In all other cases you cannot claim a loss from your PIE. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement, setting out the details of the income/loss and the tax it has paid on the income it has attributed to you. Where your PIE has calculated the tax using a prescribed investor rate lower than your correct rate or you have exited a PIE that doesn't calculate tax when an investor exits, you may need to include the income in your return to pay the tax. Where you're required to include attributed PIE income in your return, show the income and tax paid/ credit where the rate lower than your correct rate has been applied. Include any tax credits shown on your PIE's investor statement where you've exited from a PIE that zero-rates exiting investors. You can show the net income or loss (after adjusting for the investor level fees) in Question 17B and the general tax credits shown at 17A. Where any specified tax credits (eg, RWT) are shown, include these in the appropriate question on the return. If you have a student loan or if you're eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits you now have to declare PIE income on an Adjust your income (IR215) form, except if the PIE is a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme (eg, KiwiSaver) where the funds are locked in. If you have declared PIE income in your return and it is from a: •non-locked-in PIE it will be taken into account •locked-in PIE you need to show the amount on the IR215 so we can exclude it from your income. If you have non-locked-in PIE income or dividends from a listed PIE that are not included in your return you may need to declare it on the IR215 for either or both student loan and Working for Families Tax Credits. For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: adjust your income). 25 www.ird.govt.nz Question 18 Partnership income Show your share of income from the partnership's trade or business from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 in Box 18B, unless it includes: •interest and any RWT - show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits - show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •overseas income and overseas tax paid - show this at Question 17 •rental income - show this at Question 22 •other income and, if your share of this income: –is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (eg, you were a sleeping partner), or –is generated from other investment activity (eg, sale of shares), show this at Question 24. Partnership income earned as a result of "active" involvement is liable for ACC levies, which will be invoiced by ACC. Losses from limited partnerships If you're claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to www.ird.govt.nz Expenses You may be able to claim expenses against your share of the partnership income that wasn't claimed in the partnership's IR7 return, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership. Claim these expenses at Question 26. Question 19 Look-through company (LTC) income If you received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 19. Don’t include: •interest and any RWT – show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits – show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •Māori authority distributions and credits – show these at Question 15 •any overseas income – show this at Question 17, along with qualifying tax credits attached •rental income – show this at Question 22. The LTC will normally supply information about non-allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. Note The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner’s “owner’s basis” (equity) in the LTC. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE26 For the 2018-19 and later income years the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. For most LTC owners, you can now claim the full amount of your prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This won’t apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. Daniel is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2018-19 income year Daniel has a net loss of $7,000.00 from the LTC. Daniel also has prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Daniel has no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Daniel’s tax return should show these amounts in the following boxes: •19A: $0.00 •19B: $7,000.00- •19C: $0.00 •19D: $5,000.00 •19E: $12,000.00- Example What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 19A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 19B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 19C. There shouldn’t be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimed this year and print in Box 19D. You’ll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 19C, add this to Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you have an amount in Box 19D, subtract this from Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you don’t have any amounts in Box 19C or Box 19D, copy the amount from Box 19B to 19E. Box 19E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in our guide Look-through companies (IR879). 27 www.ird.govt.nz Question 21 Shareholder-employee salary If, as a shareholder-employee, you received a salary between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 with PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 11A. If, as a shareholder-employee, your shareholder-employee's salary or director's fees had no PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 21. If you would normally receive a shareholder-employee salary (even if you didn't receive one this year), please tick 21A. If you are not a shareholder employee and you received director's fees with no tax deducted, show the income at Question 23. The company that paid your salary or fees will be able to tell you exactly how much to show in your return. Question 21B In-work tax credit (IWTC) is for families who normally work a minimum number of hours each week, as follows: •a two-parent family where one or both parents between them normally work 30 hours or more a week •a single parent normally working 20 hours or more a week. The eligibility criteria for IWTC changed from 1 April 2011 to include the hours worked without pay by major shareholders 1 in their close companies 2 . To qualify, the company must derive gross income. If you're already registered for WfFTC, and now meet the requirements for IWTC you'll need to tick Box 21B of your IR3. If you're not registered for WfFTC but you think you qualify, please complete a Working for Families Tax Credits registration form (FS1). For more information go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: in-work tax credit). ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employee remuneration or director's fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company should deduct earners' levy from your remuneration or director's fees when declared. ACC will invoice the company for this. Question 22 Rents Show income you received from rents between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019 at Question 22. Prepare a summary of the details for each rental property. You can use either: •the Rental income (IR3R) form, which asks for all the information we need, or •your own summary. If you need an IR3R form, you can print a copy off our website www.ird.govt.nz If you prepare your own summary, please refer to the IR3R form or our guide Rental income (IR264) to see what to include. 1 You are a major shareholder if you either own, control or have rights to acquire at least 10% of shares or voting rights in a close company, or have by other means at least 10% control of a close company. 2 A company where there are five or fewer shareholders whose total voting interests in the company are greater than 50%. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE28 What to show in your return Add up the net rents (total rents after expenses) and print the total in Box 22. Attach the IR3R, or your summary, to your income tax return. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them later. Question 23 Self-employed income If you received self-employed income between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, show it at Question 23. Schedular payment income Don't show any schedular payment income at Question 23. This income is declared at Question 12. If you're an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, please read the information on page 52 before you complete Question 12. You can claim expenses and deductions against many schedular payments at Question 12C - see page 14. Attribution rules The attribution rule may apply where an individual provides services to an associated person (company, trust, partnership). In particular, it can apply where the associated person sells those services on, principally to a third party. To find out how to apply this rule, please read Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Prepare a summary of details You can use any of the following: •your financial records •the Farming income (IR3F) form for agricultural businesses •the Business income (IR3B) form for other businesses •the Financial statement summary (IR10) form. Attach one of the above forms to your return and print your profit (net income) in Box 23. The Financial statement summary (IR10) is a short form of the financial statements of a business. Use an IR10 and speed up processing of the return. We don't need a set of accounts if you use the IR10. You still need to complete a set of financial accounts and keep them in case we ask for them later. For help with filling out the IR10, see our IR10 guide. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them too. Providing childcare services in a home Based on the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 and/or the Licensing Criteria for Home-Based Education and Care Services 2008, Inland Revenue's Determination DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers sets out the types of expenditure generally incurred (standard cost) by individuals providing childcare services in their home. But, if you're a childcare provider who's registered for GST, this determination doesn't apply to you. 29 www.ird.govt.nz Individuals providing childcare services in their homes may use the standard costs (set out in the determination) or their actual costs and income for calculating their tax. If your childcare activities began part-way through the year, calculate your tax from that date using either the standard costs or actual costs. See our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005) for details. Show your childcare income at Question 23 if: •the determination applies to you, and your childcare taxable income is greater than nil, after standard costs have been deducted, or •you keep full records of your childcare income and actual expenses, and you make a taxable profit or loss after expenses have been deducted. If you need help deciding whether you need to declare childcare income using standard costs, please call us. You can't offset any loss calculated using standard costs (see the determination) against other income in any income year. Note Childcare services not under the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 These childcare providers can't use the determination. They must keep full records of actual income and expenses and are liable for tax on their total income after actual expenses are deducted for childcare services provided. At Question 23 show any childcare taxable income or loss after expenses have been deducted. ACC levies Income from self-employment is liable for ACC levies which ACC will invoice you for. Question 24 Other income If you received any other income between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, show it at Question 24. This may include: •the sale of land and/or buildings •the sale of non-FIF shares or other property •financial arrangements •cash jobs, payments made “under the table”, tips, bartering or income from an illegal enterprise •any share of partnership income as a result of capital investment •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme if your employer has not provided us with this information. If you’re not sure if your income is taxable, please call us. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE30 Income from the sale of land and/or buildings The profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If you purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period of time, any profit will be taxable, even if you didn’t intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to: •properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/disposed of within two years, and •properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within five years. The profits may also be taxable if you: •are a builder and improved a property before selling it •developed or subdivided land and sold sections •had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. Show the total profit in Box 24. If you’re a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Income from the sale of non-FIF shares or other property The profits are taxable if you bought: •and sold shares or other property as a business •shares or other property for the purpose of resale •shares or property to make a profit. This doesn't apply to shares that are FIFs. Print the total profit in Box 24. Attach the details of your income and expenses from these sales to your return. Sale or disposal of assets If you sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, call us or read our guides Depreciation (IR260), General depreciation rates (IR265) or Historic depreciation rates (IR267). 31 www.ird.govt.nz Losses from the sale of land, buildings, shares or other property If you made a loss and can show that if you'd made a profit, it would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Show the total in Box 24. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test, any excess deductions can’t be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales in the same year. Any excess deductions not allocated to the income year will be treated as the cost of revenue account property and carried forward to the next income year. The Property sale information (IR833) form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property (IR313). Financial arrangements If you're a party to a financial arrangement, you must account for income from those arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. A cash-basis person doesn't need to use the accrual method to calculate income. You qualify as a cash- basis person if: •on every day in the income year the absolute value of all financial arrangements added together is $1,000,000 or less, or •the absolute value of your income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements is $100,000 or less, and •the deferral of income or acceleration of expenditure using the cash method rather than the accrual method is $40,000 or less. If you held the financial arrangement prior to 20 May 1999 the amounts above may be reduced to $600,000, $70,000 and $20,000 respectively. Please note the "absolute value" is the value of an amount whether it's positive or negative. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading method applies, you must do a "wash-up" calculation in certain circumstances. For example: •a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred •there is an absolute assignment of the financial arrangement •a party to a financial arrangement is released from making all remaining payments under the Insolvency Act 1967, the Companies Act 1993 or the laws of a country or territory other than New Zealand •you cease to be a resident of New Zealand. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are brought to account. This applies in every case - you don't have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or have bought them for the purpose of resale, as you would with shares. When calculating the income or expenditure on sale, use our Sale or disposal of financial arrangements (IR3K) form. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE32 Income from cash jobs, tips, "under the table" payments, bartering or an illegal enterprise If you received any other type of income that didn't have tax deducted from it, show it in Box 24. Attach the details of your income and any expenses to your return. Share of partnership income as a result of capital investment If your share of partnership income is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (ie, you were a sleeping partner), show your share of partnership income in Box 24. Question 24A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If you are an “offshore RLWT person” and have sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. You should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. You can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Show the name of your withholder(s) in the “name of payer” box. Question 26 Other expenses and deductions If you paid any of these expenses, between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, you can claim them in Box 26. •a fee to someone for completing your tax return •commission on interest or dividend income (but not bank fees - they're a private expense) •additional expenses incurred in earning partnership income, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership •interest on money you borrowed to buy shares or to invest - as long as the investment will produce some taxable income •premiums on loss of earnings insurance (income protection), provided the benefit from the insurance policy is taxable •interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, only if the interest is not already included as a deduction in your accounts. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you're an ACC client and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments and have retained some of these, you may claim the payments you've made to your caregiver as a deduction at Question 12C. Read the information on page 52 before you complete Question 12C. Schedular income expenses If you incurred expenses while earning income that's had tax from schedular payments deducted, you claim these at Question 12C, not here. 33 www.ird.govt.nz Other expenses For other expenses, attach the details to your return. Include your name and IRD number. You can't claim expenses against income from: •salary and/or wages •election day services •casual agricultural work •commissions, if you're also paid a salary or retainer from the same employer. You can still claim expenses for having your tax return completed for you and loss of earnings insurance premiums from these income sources. If you're GST-registered you must deduct any GST included in any expenses. GST-registered people claim the GST portion of their expenses in their GST return, not the IR3. Note ACC levies ACC will take into account all expenses shown in Box 26 when calculating any ACC levies due. Question 28 Net losses brought forward Where to find your net loss to bring forward You can find the amount of net loss you have to bring forward on the loss carried forward letter we sent you after your 2018 return acknowledgement or notice of assessment. What to show on your return Add up all net losses to be brought forward to 2019 and print the total in Box 28A. Print the amount you can claim this year in Box 28B. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE34 Your tax credits Tax credits can reduce the tax you have to pay on your income. Other tax credits Donation tax credits are claimed separately on a Tax credit claim form (IR526). If you claimed this tax credit last year, we'll have sent you a claim form in May. Question 30 Independent earner tax credit (IETC) You can calculate your IETC: •by using the worksheets provided in this section •by calling our self-service line - see page 58. IETC The IETC is a tax credit for individuals whose annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000. Your annual net income is shown at Box 27 "Income after expenses" in your return. If you're eligible for IETC, but earn over $44,000, your annual entitlement to IETC decreases by 13 cents for every dollar earned above $44,000. For the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, you'll be entitled to IETC for any months: •you were a New Zealand tax resident •you or your partner weren't entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits (or received an overseas equivalent) and you didn't receive: –an income-tested benefit –NZ Super –a veteran's pension or –an overseas equivalent of any of the above. You're a tax resident if you lived in New Zealand for more than 183 days in the last twelve months, or have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. For more information, read our guide New Zealand tax residence (IR292). To work out the months you're entitled to this tax credit, use the total number of whole months the criteria applied to. If you didn't meet the above criteria for even one day of any month you won't be entitled to IETC at all for that month, so don't include it in your calculation. \* Net income means your total income from all sources, less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). 35 www.ird.govt.nz Calculating your IETC Enter the start and end dates when you had any overseas income that excludes you from being eligible for IETC at Box 30B on your return. If the overseas income continued past the end of the year enter the end date for the income as 31/03/2019. If you have more than one date range for the overseas excluded income, attach a note telling us of the date ranges. You'll also need to include any dates you weren't a New Zealand tax resident. Tick the boxes below for each month (between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019) you were entitled to the IETC for the full month.

IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE40 Excess imputation credits carried forward Imputation credits are treated differently from RWT. If you received dividends from a New Zealand company that gave you imputation credits or an Australian company that gave you New Zealand imputation credits, you may have excess imputation credits to carry forward. This will only happen if your total imputation credits (including any excess imputation credits brought forward from 2018) are greater than your total tax payable. Use the worksheet below to work out the excess imputation credits that must be carried forward to your 2020 tax return. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount. Worksheet Copy your total imputation credits from Box 9 of your tax calculation on page 39 in this guide to Box 1. 1 Copy your total tax payable from Box 6 of your tax calculation on page 39 in this guide to Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer in Box 3. 3 This is your excess imputation credits amount to carry forward to 2020. Student loan We'll work out how much of your student loan you need to repay, based on your income. If you have an end-of-year repayment obligation we'll send you a notice showing how much is due. If you want to calculate the amount yourself, either use the worksheet provided here or go to "Work it out" on our website. The worksheet is for your information only and will give you an indication of your student loan end-of-year repayment obligation. Interest-free student loan If you've lived in New Zealand for six months (183 days) or more, your student loan is interest-free. Interest will be charged and then written off on a daily basis. Even if you haven't been in New Zealand for six months, you may qualify for an interest-free student loan if you meet the criteria for an exemption. Go to our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: interest free) for more details. End of year repayment obligation Repayment deductions from salary or wages are generally considered your final obligation on that income and don't form part of your end-of-year repayment obligation. Income from casual agricultural work and election day work doesn't have student loan deductions. This income is excluded as salary and wage income and becomes part of adjusted net income. 41 www.ird.govt.nz If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, any income or deductions are excluded in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, you can offset a loss from one business or investment activity against other like income. For example, Rory has an overall loss from his landscaping business of $7,500. He has also made a profit from his lawnmowing service of $50,000. The activities are carried out in association with each other, so Rory can claim the $7,500 loss against the $50,000 profit. From the 2015 tax year onwards income adjustments are now required to be part of your adjusted net income. For a full list of the adjustments required go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: adjust your income). You'll only have an end-of-year repayment obligation if you: •have adjusted net income of $1,500 or more with a total income (including salary or wages) of $20,948 (annual repayment threshold plus $1,500) or more •had an interim assessment for the year. Adjusted net income is your annual gross income, excluding salary or wages and less annual total deductions you may claim. If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, neither the income or the deductions from that activity are included in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, a loss from one business or investment activity can be offset against other like income. Note Annual total deductions are the expenses and deductions you can claim for the tax year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE42 If you're required to file an Adjust your income (IR215) form, you can't use this worksheet to calculate your 2019 repayment obligation. Once we have received your IR3 and your IR215 we will send you your end-of-year repayment obligation for 2019. Note Use this worksheet to calculate your 2019 repayment. Annual repayment threshold. 1 19,448 00 Copy any gross salary or wage income (excluding casual agricultural or election day income) from Box 11B of your return to Box 2. 2 If Box 2 is more than Box 1 print $0.00 in Box 3, otherwise subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the result in Box 3. 3 This is your unused repayment threshold you can use against your other income. Enter your income after expenses from Box 27 of your return (excluding any losses), less any salary and wage income from Box 2 in Box 4. 4 Subtract Box 3 from Box 4. If the result is less than $1,500.00 print $0.00 in Box 5. Otherwise, print the result in Box 5 (this is your total liable income). 5 Multiply the amount in Box 5 by 0.12 (12%). 6 This is your end-of-year payment obligation for the 2019 tax year. Print any 2019 voluntary repayments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6A. 6A Print any 2019 interim payments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6B. 6B Add Boxes 6A and 6B together and print the result in Box 7. 7 Subtract Box 7 from Box 6 and print your answer in Box 8. 8 If Box 7 is less than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year loan repayment. (Tick one) Loan repayment If Box 7 is larger than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year overpayment. Overpayment 43 www.ird.govt.nz Question 33 Early payment discount An early payment discount is available for people who: •are new in business •haven't begun to pay provisional tax •made payments within the corresponding income year up to their balance date, eg, a standard balance date taxpayer, who has made a payment or payments on or before 31 March 2019 as income tax for the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. The discount is calculated at the rate of 6.7% of either: •the amount paid during the year, or •105% of your end-of-year residual income tax liability, whichever is the lesser, and is credited against your end-of-year tax bill. To check if you qualify, work through the following flowchart. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE44 Do you qualify for an early payment discount? Terms we use Provisional tax - this is tax paid in instalments during the year, based on what you expect your income to be, or what it was last year. Assessable income - income that is not exempt income or excluded income (eg, a government grant to a business). Assessable income includes undeclared business income you may have earned (eg, cash jobs). Year - as referred to in the diagram below, year means the standard tax year from 1 April to 31 March, unless you have an approved different balance date, in which case your income year will end then. If you have any questions about your entitlement to the discount, please contact us. No Ye s No No No Are you self-employed or in a partnership and you don't use a company or trust to run your business and most of your income is from your business - not interest, dividends, rents or benefits?

Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like your excess tax transferred (the "transfer date"). The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. For more information on the rules for working out the date the transfer is available, please refer to the tables on our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: credit transfers). IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE46 Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out the boxes on page 5 of your return.

Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling funds transferred in. 47 www.ird.govt.nz Provisional tax Question 35 Provisional tax Provisional tax is generally payable because you earned income during the year that either: •wasn't taxed, or •was taxed at the wrong rate. It's usually payable in three instalments during the year (28 August 2019, 15 January 2020, 7 May 2020), unless: •you have a non-standard balance date, or •you pay GST on a six-monthly basis, or •you use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax. If your 2019 residual income tax (RIT) (Box 32A of your return) is more than $2,500, you'll become a provisional tax payer and will be liable to pay 2020 provisional tax. For more information read our guides Provisional tax (IR289) or Penalties and interest (IR240). Initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. You will have an initial provisional tax liability if: •you begin to derive income from a taxable activity during the tax year, and •your RIT in any of the four preceding tax years didn't exceed $2,500, and •your RIT for the current year is $60,000 or more. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). The date you cease employment determines when interest will be charged from. You are not liable to pay provisional tax in the year you have an initial provisional tax liability. You may make voluntary payments to reduce your interest liability. Interest rules if you have an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply to when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Payment options You have three options for paying provisional tax - the standard option "S", the estimation option "E" or the ratio option "R". Standard option Under this option, your 2020 provisional tax is the same as your 2019 RIT (if it is more than $2,500) plus 5%. Copy this amount to Box 35B of your return and print “S” in Box 35A. Divide the amount by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment - record this on page 51. If you’re filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE48 If you think your income for 2020 will be more than your 2019 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Note Use this worksheet to calculate your 2020 provisional tax using the standard option "S" Copy your RIT from Box 32A of your return to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.05 (5%). Print your answer in Box 2. 2 Add Box 1 and Box 2. Print your answer in Box 3. Box 3 is your 2018 provisional tax. 3 00 Copy this amount to Box 35B of your return and print "S" in Box 35A. Divide the amount in Box 3 by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment. Record this on page 51. If you’re filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. Estimation option Anyone can estimate provisional tax. If you expect your 2020 RIT to be lower than your 2019 RIT, estimating will keep you from paying more than you have to. If you choose to estimate, your estimate must be fair and reasonable at the time you make it and at each instalment date. You can be charged a penalty and/or interest if you don't take reasonable care when you estimate your provisional tax. Use this worksheet to calculate your 2020 provisional tax using the estimation option "E" Print your estimated 2020 taxable income in Box 1. 1 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 1. Print your answer in Box 2. 2 Print your estimated 2020 credits, such as tax credits, PAYE deducted, in Box 3. 3 Subtract Box 3 from Box 2. Print your answer in Box 4. Box 4 is your 2020 provisional tax. 4 Copy this amount to Box 35B of your return and print "E" in Box 35A. Divide the amount in Box 4 by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment. Record this on page 51. 49 www.ird.govt.nz Ratio option If you're GST-registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. You must apply to use the ratio option, before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 35A. Read our guide Provisional tax (IR289) for more information about the ratio option.

If you or your caregiver receive these payments, regardless of whether ACC or your employer makes them, you'll need to read this information before you complete your return. Any ACC personal service rehabilitation payments paid by ACC or your employer direct to the client or caregiver, are schedular payments and will have tax deducted before the payments are made. Depending on their circumstances, ACC clients or carers receiving ACC personal service rehabilitation payments may not be required to file an IR3. Do I need to file? Are you a caregiver receiving payments from ACC, or a caregiver paid by a client? If you earn over $14,000 from all sources of income, you're required to file an IR3. If you earn less than $14,000, you're not required to file an IR3 because enough tax will have been deducted during the year from these payments. However, you may have another reason to file an IR3 - see page 5 for more information. If you're not required to file an IR3 please call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll update our records. Are you a client who received these payments from ACC and then passed on those payments to your caregiver? Because you've received these personal service rehabilitation payments from ACC to pass on to your caregiver, we've sent you an IR3. You're not required to file an IR3 if: •you have no other income •you're not liable for child support •you don't have a student loan and income over the threshold •your family is not entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits •you have no other reason to file - see page 5. Please note the above rules apply whether or not you've passed these payments on to your caregiver. If you're not required to file, please call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll update our records.

Children's exempt income Read this information if for the tax year you: •were 14 or under, or •were 15, 16 or 17 and still attending school\*, or •turned 18 on or after 1 January in the previous tax year and continued to attend school\* \* including a school for people with disabilities, but excluding tertiary institutions. The following income is required to have tax taken out before you receive it: •salary or wages •schedular payments •interest •dividends, and •Māori authority distributions. If you only receive these types of income you will not need to file an IR3. However, if you are required to file an IR3 return this income needs to be included. If you receive income that has not had tax taken out before you receive it eg: •worked as a self-employed person, •worked around the home of a neighbour or family friend, and that work was not part of a business that they carry on, or •beneficiary income from a trust, such as a testamentary trust (a trust set up from an estate of a deceased person), that is not listed above as requiring to have tax taken out and your total income from these sources is less than $2,340 for the tax year, this income is exempt from tax and is not included in your return. You are not required to file a return just because you earn this type of income. If you earn $2,340 or more, the exemption does not apply and you will need to file a return and pay tax on all the income, not just the amount that exceeds the exemption. If you have to file a return but we haven't sent you an IR3, you must request and file it by 7 July 2020, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. Please call 0800 257 773 to request an IR3 return. Remember to have your IRD number with you. 7 ird.govt.nz Extension of time If circumstances beyond your control will prevent you from sending in your return on time, call us on 0800 377 774 and we may grant you an extension. If you have a tax agent you may have until 31 March 2021 to file the return. Contact your agent for more information. Are there any penalties? You may face penalties and prosecution if you: •are required to put in a return but don't •give false or misleading information (including not showing all your income) •leave out details on purpose so the information is misleading •file your return late. Income year The information in this guide is based on the tax year from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. If your income year is different you can still use this guide, but work out your income and expenses for your income year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE8 Using this guide Did you know you can also file your return online? Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR The form will prepopulate with your personal details and earnings information. Before you start filling in the return make sure you have: •any interest or dividend statements •any taxable Māori authority distribution statements •any other income details, such as overseas, rental property, farming or business income •your 2020 Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) letter, if you applied for WfFTC from Inland Revenue. The questions in this guide are in the same order as the questions on the return. Don't use anyone else's preprinted return because it's precoded with their own IRD number. Questions 1 to 5 Personal information This information helps us to contact you. Please make sure we have your details exactly right. If you've changed your name or address, please update the information in the spaces provided on the return. Postal address If you use your agent's postal address leave this panel blank. Your tax agent will let us know if they've changed their address. If your address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure of your box lobby, please contact New Zealand Post. Date of birth We ask for this so we don't mix up people with the same name. Question 6 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. If you're unable to identify the correct code, call ACC on 0508 426 837 for more help. Note Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. If you don't complete your BIC code, ACC will select one on your behalf. This may mean your ACC levy rate could be incorrect. 9 ird.govt.nz Question 8 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return, please include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two boxes. Question 9 Adjustments to your income If you have a student loan or you are eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC), you may be required to include adjustments to your income. This is so that Inland Revenue can correctly assess your student loan repayment obligation and ensure you receive your correct WfFTC entitlement. To notify Inland Revenue about your income adjustments you can: •tick 9A on your IR3 and complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form and attach it to your income tax return or •log in to your myIR account and complete it there or •call us on 0800 227 774 and tell us what your adjustments are. If you don't have an IR215 form you can: •download it from our website ird.govt.nz or •call us on 0800 257 773. What do I need to do to receive my entitlement? If you haven't already registered for WfFTC and you qualify, go to our website ird.govt.nz/working-for-families and register online. When we've received the registration form we'll send you a letter with all your family details for you to check. Please correct and return it to us if the details are incorrect. If you've already registered for WfFTC and you need to file an IR3, we'll send you a letter by the beginning of May with all your family details on it. Please check this information and return the form with your IR3 if the details are incorrect. Question 10 Non-residents and transitional residents Non-residents If you were away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period and don't have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, you may be a non-resident. Read our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292 to find out your status. If you weren't present in New Zealand and are a non-resident for a full year, but you received income from New Zealand, you may need to complete an IR3NR return instead. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE10 Transitional residents If you became a New Zealand tax resident during the year 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 and you've elected not to be treated as a transitional resident, you have to complete an IR3 declaring your worldwide income from the date you became a New Zealand tax resident. Transitional residents don't have to declare their foreign-sourced income except for foreign employment income and foreign services income. If you were a non-resident for part of the year, complete Question 39 on your return. If your return isn't for a full year, we'll calculate your tax and income-related tax credits and let you know the result - see ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2006/2006-81/2006-81-exempt-transitionals/ for further information. 11 ird.govt.nz Your income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, salary, wages or schedular payments, the information you need to complete Questions 11, 11A and 12 will be on your Summary of Income (SOI), which we'll send you in May 2020. We send this automatically if we send you an IR3 return. Yo u r Summary of Income (SOI) contains the following information: •all your employers throughout the year •your total gross income with tax deducted and ACC earners' levy paid •any family tax credit paid by Work and Income •your tax credits for payroll donations you've made through payroll giving. Question 11 Family tax credit from Work and Income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, copy the amount from your SOI to Box 11 if it doesn't already show. Don't include any Working for Families Tax Credits from Inland Revenue in Box 11. Question 11A Income with tax deducted Did you receive any of these types of income with tax deducted between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020? •salary or wages •a student allowance •any income-tested benefit - unemployment or sickness, transitional retirement, independent youth, domestic purposes, widow's, invalid's or emergency •accident compensation payments related to earnings •New Zealand Superannuation (NZ Super) either income-tested or non-income tested, or a veteran's pension •other pensions, annuities or superannuation (read "Pensions" on page 14) •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme (previously known as a share purchase agreement). Note: it is up to your employer whether they deduct tax on these or not •shareholder-employee salary. If you received any of these types of income with tax deducted, you need to copy the totals from your SOI to Question 11A if they don't already show on your return. Employee Share Scheme (ESS) benefits If you (or an associate) received free or discounted shares under an employee share scheme the taxable value will be included on your SOI as long as your employer has provided us with this information. In most cases your employer will have provided this information but if they haven't you will need to show the taxable value at Question 26. You will need to check with your employer whether this information has been provided. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE12 What to show on your return Copy the total amounts from your SOI to the corresponding boxes (11A, 11B, 11C, 11D and 11E) on your return if it doesn't already show. Amending your income details If any of the details on your SOI are incorrect (eg, wrong or missing employers), please make the changes on your SOI and attach it to your income tax return. You only need to attach your SOI to your income tax return if you've made changes to it. Please transfer the amended totals from your SOI to the corresponding boxes on your return and use the worksheet on page 13 to calculate your total tax deducted (11E). ACC earners' levy All employees must pay an ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of non-work related injuries, based on their earnings. We collect this on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The maximum amount of earners' levy is $1,785.73. The earners' levy is set at a rate of 1.39% (1.39 cents in the dollar). If you need to amend your employment details on your SOI, you'll need to recalculate your earners' levy. Using employer-provided information If you received payslips or other earnings information from your employer, you can use this information to complete your return and don't have to wait for your SOI. You don't include schedular payments in this calculation. You'll need to use your total PAYE deducted in your calculations. This is the amount of PAYE shown on your payslips before any tax credits for payroll donations are deducted. If you made donations through payroll giving to an organisation that is not on Inland Revenue's approved donee organisations list, you won't be able to keep the tax credits you received and you won't have paid enough PAYE throughout the year. You'll have either received a letter telling you about these extinguished tax credits or they'll show on your summary of income. Put the total PAYE, less the amount of your extinguished tax credits, in Box 11A. If the amount of total PAYE deducted isn't clear from your payslips: •contact your employer, or •refer to your SOI for details, or •refer to "Earning summary" in the my income tab in myIR, or •call us on 0800 227 774. 13 ird.govt.nz You'll need to calculate your ACC earners' levy liability and deduct it from your total PAYE, using the worksheet below. Worksheet for ACC earners' levy Copy your total taxable earnings from salary and wages to Box 1. Copy the amount to Box 11B of your return. 1 Copy your taxable earnings from salary and wages that are not liable for earners' levy to Box 2. See below for a list of income not liable. Copy this amount to Box 11C of your return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print the answer in Box 3. If the answer exceeds the maximum liable earnings of $128,470, print $128,470 in Box 3. 3 This is your liable income for ACC earners' levy Multiply Box 3 by 0.0139 (1.39%). Print your answer in Box 4. This is your ACC earners' levy. Copy this amount to Box 11D of your return. 4 Copy your total PAYE from salary and wages to Box 5. Copy this amount to Box 11A of your return. 5 Copy your total ACC earners' levy from Box 4 (above) to Box 6. 6 Subtract Box 6 from Box 5 and print the answer in Box 7. 7 This is your total tax deducted. Copy this amount to Box 11E of your return. The following income isn't liable for ACC earners' levy -NZ Super-income from a partnership earned by a non-working partner in that partnership -income-tested benefits -non-taxable allowances-pensions from superannuation schemes not registered with the Financial Markets Authority -student allowances -veteran's pension-overseas pensions -living alone payments-rents -redundancy payments-estate and trust income -retiring allowances-royalties -jury and witness fees-income attributed to you from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) -interest and dividends -taxable Māori authority distributions-income arising from a withdrawal from foreign superannuation schemes. -free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE14 Pensions Don't include the following pensions or annuities in your tax return: •non-taxable pensions or annuities from either life insurance funds or superannuation schemes registered with the Financial Markets Authority (eg, Government Superannuation) •pensions that are completely tax-free, such as war pensions (other than a veteran's pension). Any overseas social security pension you receive is usually taxable. Include it at Question 17 (see the notes on page 23). If you receive a United Kingdom national retirement pension and have joined the special banking option operated by Work and Income, only include the New Zealand Super income and tax deducted at Question 11A. For more information read our guides Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257 or Overseas social security pensions - IR258. Question 12 Schedular payments Schedular payments are generally payments made to people who are not employees but are employed on a contract basis. All ACC personal service rehabilitation payments which are paid by ACC or your employer are classified as schedular payments. Different tax rates apply to schedular payments, depending on the work done. A full list is available in the PAYE tables - IR340 and IR341 and on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C. People who receive schedular payments will receive a Summary of income (SOI) detailing their schedular payments received and the tax deducted. If your SOI shows total schedular income over $200, you must file an IR3 return. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you are an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, please read the information on page 57 before you complete Question 12. Question 12A Total tax deducted This is the total amount of tax deducted from schedular payments you received during the year. The amount in this Box should also include any amount of tax deducted from schedular payments made to a close company which has been transferred directly to you as a shareholder-employee. Question 12C Expenses related to schedular payments Show any expenses you can claim against this income here. Don't include it with other expenses at Question 28. Question 12D Net schedular payments This is the total gross schedular payments shown at Box 12B, less any expenses being claimed at Box 12C. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Include the amount of tax loss in Box 12D. 15 ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Copy the total tax deducted (Box 12A) and gross payments (Box 12B) from your SOI to the same box numbers of your return. Add up the expenses related to your schedular payments and print the total in Box 12C. Subtract Box 12C from Box 12B and print the result in Box 12D. Note If you're registered for GST, your gross schedular payment may include GST. Enter the GST-exclusive amount at Question 12B. Shareholder-employee salary If you received a shareholder-employee salary with no PAYE deducted, show the amount at Question 20. ACC levies You'll have to pay ACC levies on schedular payments. ACC will invoice you for these. Question 13 New Zealand interest Did you receive any New Zealand interest between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 from: •banks •Inland Revenue •building and investment societies •credit unions •securities •a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust •loans you've made? If so, show all the New Zealand interest you received at Question 13B. If the interest is from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust please tick Box 13C. If you were charged commission on any of your interest, claim this at Question 28. Read the note about expenses on page 37. Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have "negative interest" to account for. This is interest you've repaid on the term deposit. It may reduce the amount of interest you need to declare on your tax return. If you broke the term deposit in full, use the worksheet on page 16 to deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on your Deduction certificate for RWT on interest - IR15 or equivalent statement. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE16 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your IR15 to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Include this in the amount shown at Box 13B. 3 RWT During the year, RWT will have been deducted from some or all of your interest and you can claim a credit for this. The interest payer will usually send you an IR15 or similar statement which shows the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Add up the amounts from each statement or certificate and print the totals in Boxes 13A and 13B. Don't send us your statements or IR15s, but keep them in case we need to see them later. Interest of $50 or less If the interest you received for the year is $50 or less, you may not receive a certificate or statement, but you still need to show the gross interest and RWT. Get the details from your bank statements. Interest on joint accounts If you hold a joint account, you must show your share of the interest in your tax return. Interest from overseas If you received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show it at Question 17. Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Farm vendor mortgage or finance bonds If you received interest from a farm vendor mortgage or farm vendor finance bonds approved by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand, only half of the interest is taxable. Show the RWT deducted and the taxable amount of interest in Boxes 13A and 13B. Income from financial arrangements If you are a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To determine whether a spreading method must be used, see "Financial arrangements" on page 36. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. Any RWT will have to be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. 17 ird.govt.nz Interest paid by Inland Revenue If we pay you interest because you overpaid your tax, include the gross interest in Box 13B in the income year you received the interest. Interest paid by a person If you paid us interest because you underpaid your tax, include it as a deduction in the return at Question 28 for the income year the interest is paid. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Dividends are a part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes and unit trust distributions are treated as dividends. Complete Question 14 if you received any New Zealand dividends between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, including dividends from your local electricity or gas company (but don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax-free). The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Include dividends earned by a partnership or estate, or distributed by a trust. If you were charged commission on any of your dividends, claim this at Question 28. Read the notes about expenses on page 37. If you receive dividends from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) that is a listed company and doesn't use your prescribed investor rate, you can decide whether or not to include the dividends in your return. Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits so the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. If the dividend is from a listed PIE, it should not have RWT deducted. What to show on your return Your dividend statements show the amount: •you received (net dividend) •of any imputation credit •of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your gross dividend. Add up all the imputation credits, RWT credits and gross dividend totals and transfer them to the relevant boxes at Question 14. If the dividends are from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust, please tick Box 14C. Don't send us your dividend statements, but keep them in case we ask for them later. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE18 Shares and other non-cash dividends If you received shares from a taxable bonus issue or a non-cash dividend , include them as income at Question 14. Dividends from overseas Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Question 15 Māori authority distributions Complete Question 15 if you received taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit" and includes tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits. What to show on your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: •the distribution made to you, including which portion is taxable and which portion isn't •the Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, to the relevant boxes at Question 15. For more information read our guide Māori authorities - IR487. Question 16 Estate or trust income If you received estate or trust income that relates to the year 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, show it at Question 16. There are three types of estates or trusts: •complying •foreign •non-complying. Complying trusts are trusts that have been taxed in New Zealand on all their income since the day they started. Allocations of beneficiary income which the minor beneficiary rule applies to are taxed as trustee income. This means the trust is subject to tax on this income at 33 cents in the dollar, and it's included in the trustee tax calculation in the trust's IR6 return. These distributions shouldn't be included in the minor's individual tax return. All other trusts are non-complying or foreign. Read our guide Trusts' and estates' income tax rules - IR288 for more details. 19 ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Add up the tax paid by the trustee/s and print the total in Box 16A. Print your share of the estate or complying trust income in Box 16B. But, if your estate or trust income includes: •interest with RWT deducted, show this at Question 13 and tick 13C. •dividends with imputation credits attached, show this at Question 14 and tick 14C. •overseas income and overseas tax paid, show this at Question 17 •taxable Māori authority distributions, show this at Question 15. Income from foreign and non-complying trusts If you're a beneficiary of a foreign or non-complying trust please complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 form. Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts Copy the amount of taxable distributions from the non-complying trust to Box 16C, and attach the IR307 to your income tax return. We separate taxable distributions from non-complying trusts because they're taxed at a different rate. If you have this type of income, your tax calculation at Question 34 may not be correct. We'll do this calculation for you and send you a notice of assessment. Question 17 Overseas income If you received income from, or while you were overseas, between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, show it at Box 17B in New Zealand dollars. This includes taxable income from withdrawals and transfers from foreign superannuation schemes while you were a non-resident of New Zealand. Transitional residents must include any foreign employment or service income at Box 17B. You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: •using the rates tables on our website ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax •contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Note Portable NZ Super and/or portable veteran's pension paid while residing overseas are tax exempt and won't need to be included on your return. Note Dividends received from overseas companies that are treated as FIFs (except companies covered by the exclusions listed under foreign rights at Question 38) are not taxable separately. Generally, you would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate), which doesn't tax dividends separately. The foreign tax deducted from the dividend may be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income for that company. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE20 Foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you've received a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme, have transferred your foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme, or you have transferred a superannuation interest to another person you are liable for income tax unless you qualify for an exemption. You need to calculate the amount of taxable income from the withdrawal or transfer (refer below) and include this income in Box 17B, and tick Box 17C. Lump sums received or transferred in the first four years of New Zealand tax residence are generally exempt from tax; see "temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals" on page 22. Lump sums and transfers are taxed using one of two methods: •schedule method (default method) - this means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income, based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident and contributions you've made in that time (certain conditions apply). •formula method (alternative method) - can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and meets certain requirements. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. KiwiSaver withdrawal facility for tax liability on foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you transfer a lump sum to a KiwiSaver scheme you may have income tax and student loan repayment obligations. You can request a withdrawal of funds from your KiwiSaver account to pay these obligations. Your KiwiSaver provider will deal with your application. For more information about foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257 or go to ird.govt.nz/foreign-super Foreign investment fund (FIF) income If, at any time during the 2020 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. Generally, you'll use the fair dividend rate (FDR) or comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: •investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts (you can check this on our website by going to ird.govt.nz/asx-fif) •interest in certain Australian unit trusts –limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) •a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). From 1 April 2014 the FIF rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes unless acquired when the holder was a New Zealand tax resident or the interest is grandparented. For more information see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257. There's also an exemption from the FIF rules where the total cost of all the investment for FIF purposes is below NZ$50,000. 21 ird.govt.nz What to show on your return After you've converted the amounts to New Zealand dollars, add up the available amounts of overseas tax paid and print the total in Box 17A. Add up the gross amounts of overseas income (before tax was deducted) and print the total in Box 17B. Attach proof of any overseas tax paid to your income tax return. If a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) was maintained, complete a Branch equivalent tax account return - IR308 and attach it to your IR3 return. Tax paid overseas If you paid tax overseas on any foreign income derived, you may be able to claim it as a credit against your New Zealand tax payable. The amount of credit you receive may be restricted by any double taxation agreements and is the lesser of the actual amount of tax paid on the overseas income or the amount of tax you would pay in New Zealand on the foreign income. To claim an overseas tax credit you must supply proof of the tax deducted, eg, an overseas tax deduction certificate. If you need one, you'll have to request it from the overseas government agency concerned. Attach a copy of the certificate to your return. Also, if you receive a dividend that isn't taxed separately under the FIF rules, you can offset most overseas tax credit paid on the dividend against your tax payable. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461 pages 25 to 29. Claiming overseas tax paid on overseas dividends FIF income You can claim the tax paid up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the FIF income associated with the attributing interest that has paid the dividend. If you used the FDR method you can use the overseas tax paid to reduce the tax payable on the FDR income associated with that attributing interest. Please note that Australian franking credits and tax on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed as overseas tax paid. Where there is no FIF income or a FIF loss Tax paid overseas can only be used to cover your liability for income tax payable on your FIF income. If there is no New Zealand income tax payable on your FIF investment, no claim can be made for the overseas tax paid on any dividends received from that FIF. You cannot get a refund of overseas tax paid, or reduce tax payable on any other income. For more information read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Unused overseas tax credits Generally, these are forfeited (lost). Carrying forward any excess or unused overseas tax credits? You can't carry forward unused overseas credits where you have used the FDR, CV, deemed rate of return or cost methods to calculate FIF income or loss. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE22 New Zealand tax credits (imputation or RWT) deducted from overseas dividends You can claim New Zealand tax credits on overseas dividends as follows: •If the credits are RWT, they are used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. •If they're imputation credits, they are used to reduce tax payable. If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. •Any excess imputation credit can't be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. The full amount of these New Zealand tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is an FIF loss. These credits will only be attached to Australian company or unit trust dividends. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Temporary tax exemption from foreign income If you're currently claiming the four-year temporary tax (transitional resident) exemption for certain types of foreign-sourced income, you don't need to declare this income in Box 17B, unless it's foreign employment or services income. When your tax exemption expires, you must include all your worldwide income when you file your income tax return. Go to ird.govt.nz for further information about the temporary tax exemption qualifying criteria and types of exempt foreign-sourced income. Temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals This four-year exemption period is similar to the temporary tax exemption from foreign income and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals during the period. The exemption doesn't require you to be non-resident for a minimum period. This exemption applies if you: •first acquired your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and •haven't previously had this exemption. Foreign superannuation withdrawals during the four-year exemption period do not need to be declared as income in Box 17B. Go to ird.govt.nz for further information about the foreign superannuation temporary exemption or read our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257. 23 ird.govt.nz Australian dividends from non-FIF companies If you received Australian dividends, your dividend statements may show all or some of the following: •the franked/unfranked amount •Australian withholding tax •imputed credit or franking credits •New Zealand imputation credits. Add up the amounts of Australian withholding tax deducted and print the total in Box 17A. Dividends paid by Australian companies may have a New Zealand imputation credit. To calculate the gross dividend, add together the franked and unfranked amounts, along with the New Zealand imputation credits and print the total in Box 17B. Don't include any Australian imputed or franking credits. Claim New Zealand imputation credits in Box 14. Overseas pensions If you received an overseas social security pension, convert the amount into New Zealand dollars. Print the total in Box 17B. You may also have received other types of overseas pensions, such as foreign private annuities or foreign investment funds. For more information, please read the note about foreign rights disclosure on page 54. Under most of the tax treaties New Zealand has with other jurisdictions, you cannot claim a tax credit for tax deducted overseas on pensions. If you paid tax on the pension overseas, generally you need to claim a refund or tax credit from the overseas tax authority, not from Inland Revenue in New Zealand. For more information, please read our guides Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257 and Overseas social security pensions - IR258 or go to ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/ Specific dividends If you received dividends that are treated as interest or that are from an overseas company through an agent or trustee, who has deducted RWT in New Zealand, show the tax credits and overseas income in Boxes 17A and 17B. Show New Zealand RWT deducted in Box 14A. Attach a copy of the dividend statement to your return. Note If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE24 Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) Certain PIEs attribute the net income/loss and tax credits they derive across their investors. Individual investors generally don't include the attributed income or loss in their tax return. You can only claim a loss when it has the zero rate applied. In all other cases you cannot claim a loss from your PIE. Each year, the PIE is required to provide an investor statement, setting out the details of the income/loss and the tax it has paid on the income it has attributed to you. Where your PIE has calculated the tax using a prescribed investor rate lower than your correct rate or you have exited a PIE that doesn't calculate tax when an investor exits, you may need to include the income in your return to pay the tax. Where you're required to include attributed PIE income in your return, show the income and tax paid/ credit where the rate lower than your correct rate has been applied. Include any tax credits shown on your PIE's investor statement where you've exited from a PIE that zero-rates exiting investors. You can show the net income or loss (after adjusting for the investor level fees) in Question 17B and the general tax credits shown at 17A. Where any specified tax credits (eg, RWT) are shown, include these in the appropriate question on the return. If you have a student loan or if you're eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits you now have to declare PIE income on an Adjust your income - IR215 form, except if the PIE is a superannuation fund or a retirement savings scheme (eg, KiwiSaver) where the funds are locked in. If you have declared PIE income in your return and it is from a: •non-locked-in PIE it will be taken into account •locked-in PIE you need to show the amount on the IR215 so we can exclude it from your income. If you have non-locked-in PIE income or dividends from a listed PIE that are not included in your return you may need to declare it on the IR215 for either or both student loan and Working for Families Tax Credits. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/situations 25 ird.govt.nz Question 18 Partnership income Show your share of income from the partnership's trade or business from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 in Box 18B, unless it includes: •interest and any RWT - show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits - show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •overseas income and overseas tax paid - show this at Question 17 •residential rental income - show this at Question 22 •other rental income - show this at Question 23 •other income and, if your share of this income: –is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (eg, you were a sleeping partner), or –is generated from other investment activity (eg, sale of shares), show this at Question 26. Partnership income earned as a result of "active" involvement is liable for ACC levies, which will be invoiced by ACC. Losses from limited partnerships If you're claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz Expenses You may be able to claim expenses against your share of the partnership income that wasn't claimed in the partnership's IR7 return, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership. Claim these expenses at Question 28. Question 19 Look-through company (LTC) income If you received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 19. Don't include: •interest and any RWT - show this at Question 13 and tick 13C •dividends and any credits - show this at Question 14 and tick 14C •Māori authority distributions and credits - show these at Question 15 •any overseas income - show this at Question 17, along with qualifying tax credits attached •residential rental income - show this at Question 22 •other rental income - show this at Question 23. Note The LTC will normally supply information about non-allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE26 The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner's "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. For most LTC owners, you can now claim the full amount of your prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This won't apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. Example Daniel is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2019-20 income year Daniel has a net loss of $7,000.00 from the LTC. Daniel also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Daniel has no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Daniel's tax return should show these amounts in the following boxes: •19A: $0.00 •19B: $7,000.00- •19C: $0.00 •19D: $5,000.00 •19E: $12,000.00- What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 19A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 19B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 19C. There shouldn't be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimed this year and print in Box 19D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 19C, add this to Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you have an amount in Box 19D, subtract this from Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you don't have any amounts in Box 19C or Box 19D, copy the amount from Box 19B to 19E. Box 19E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in our guide Look-through companies - IR879. 27 ird.govt.nz Question 20 Shareholder-employee salary If, as a shareholder-employee, you received a salary between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 with PAYE deducted, include the amounts at Question 11A. If, as a shareholder-employee, your shareholder-employee's salary or director's fees had no PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 20. If you would normally receive a shareholder-employee salary (even if you didn't receive one this year), please tick Box 20A. If you are not a shareholder employee and you received director's fees with no tax deducted, show the income at Question 26. Over-payments of AIM provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals are allowed to be used to meet the shareholder’s tax liability on that salary at the end of the income year. Include the amount of any AIM tax credits transferred to you at Box 20B. The company that paid your salary or fees will be able to tell you exactly how much to show in your return. Question 20C In-work tax credit (IWTC) is a payment for families who are normally in paid work. Prior to 1 July 2020 you need to work a minimum number of hours each week (20 hours for a single parent family or 30 hours for a two parent family). From 1 July 2020 the hours are not required to be worked. You can not receive in-work tax credit if you receive an income-tested benefit or student allowance. Please refer to our website for more information go to ird.govt.nz/new-to-wff The eligibility criteria for IWTC changed from 1 April 2011 to include the hours worked without pay by major shareholders1 in their close companies2. To qualify, the company must derive gross income. If you're already registered for WfFTC, and now meet the requirements for IWTC you'll need to tick Box 20C of your IR3. If you haven’t already registered for WfFTC and you qualify, go to our website ird.govt.nz/working-for-families and register online. ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employee remuneration or director's fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company should deduct earners' levy from your remuneration or director's fees when declared. ACC will invoice the company for this. Question 22 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. 1 You are a major shareholder if you either own, control or have rights to acquire at least 10% of shares or voting rights in a close company, or have by other means at least 10% control of a close company. 2 A company where there are five or fewer shareholders whose total voting interests in the company are greater than 50%. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE28 Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. There are two levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: •the main home; •property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (holiday home rented out part-time); •certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 23 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 25B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: •property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land; •other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 23 and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 25B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income Box 22A. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deductions rules also apply if you borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and you have interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. 29 ird.govt.nz Completing Question 22 in your return You will use this question to record residential income and deductions that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use one of the following methods: •Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. •Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. •Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income and/or residential rental deductions, you need to use the same method the LTC uses (portfolio or individual property basis) for the residential properties owned by the LTC. If you are a partner in a partnership and have attributed residential income and/or residential rental deductions, you do not need to use the same method the partnership uses. For LTCs and partnerships, the residential property income and deductions calculations are made at the owner or partner level as they may have other residential income and deductions that need to be included. An LTC or partnership does not need to calculate its net residential income and excess deductions. Instead, the LTC or partnership’s residential income and deductions are attributed to the owners or partners, who then calculate their net residential income and any excess deductions and enter those amounts on their IR3 income tax return. You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 22A to 22F using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at Boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz Write the total residential income in Box 22A. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property; (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from the portfolio or individual property; (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in your portfolio or individual property; and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential income Box 26G on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here. Do not include rental losses from properties not covered by the rules in Question 22. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded in Box 25B. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE30 Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring-fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 22B. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown in Box 26M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 22B. Include the amount of interest paid that doesn’t relate to the rental property in Box 24. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 22C. This Box cannot be completed for the tax year ending 31 March 2020. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 22D. This is the result of Box 22B plus Box 22C minus the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio calculations shown in Box 22F. Include the amount of interest you can claim on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 22D. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 22A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for each property and/or property portfolio calculations in Box 22E. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the results of either: •excess deductions released as the result of the taxable disposal of the rental property or all properties in a portfolio, or •claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. The amount in Box 22E should equal Total residential income Box 22A minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 22D. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 22F. 31 ird.govt.nz NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable; or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least one of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE32 Question 23 Income from other rental activities Show income you received from other rental activities between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 at Question 23. Only include net residential rental income or losses not included at Question 22 and commercial rental income in Box 23. This includes rents not caught by the residential rental rules such as rents from: •a bach or holiday home that comes within the mixed-use asset rules •the family home •rental properties held on revenue account, such as part of a business dealing in land or building residences •commercial rents. Prepare a summary of the details for each rental property. You can use either: •the Rental income - IR3R form, which asks for all the information we need, or •your own summary. If you need an IR3R form, you can print a copy from ird.govt.nz If you prepare your own summary, refer to the IR3R form or the Rental income - IR264 guide to find out what to include. What to show in your return Add up the net rents (total rents after expenses) and write the total in Box 23. Attach the IR3R, or your summary, to your income tax return. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them later. 33 ird.govt.nz Question 24 Self-employed income If you received self-employed income between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, show it at Question 24. Schedular payment income Don't show any schedular payment income at Question 24. This income is declared at Question 12. If you're an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, please read the information on page 57 before you complete Question 12. You can claim expenses and deductions against many schedular payments at Question 12C - see page 14. Attribution rules The attribution rule may apply where an individual provides services to an associated person (company, trust, partnership). In particular, it can apply where the associated person sells those services on, principally to a third party. To find out how to apply this rule, please read Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) and Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Prepare a summary of details You can use any of the following: •your financial records •the Farming income - IR3F form for agricultural businesses •the Business income - IR3B form for other businesses •the Financial statement summary - IR10 form. Attach one of the above forms to your return and print your profit (net income) in Box 24. The Financial statement summary - IR10 is a short form of the financial statements of a business. Use an IR10 and speed up processing of the return. We don't need a set of accounts if you use the IR10. You still need to complete a set of financial accounts and keep them in case we ask for them later. For help with filling out the IR10, see our IR10 guide. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them too. Providing childcare services in a home Based on the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 and/or the Licensing Criteria for Home- Based Education and Care Services 2008, Inland Revenue's Determination DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers sets out the types of expenditure generally incurred (standard cost) by individuals providing childcare services in their home. But, if you're a childcare provider who's registered for GST, this determination doesn't apply to you. Individuals providing childcare services in their homes may use the standard costs (set out in the determination) or their actual costs and income for calculating their tax. If your childcare activities began part-way through the year, calculate your tax from that date using either the standard costs or actual costs. See our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005) for details. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE34 Show your childcare income at Question 24 if: •the determination applies to you, and your childcare taxable income is greater than nil, after standard costs have been deducted, or •you keep full records of your childcare income and actual expenses, and you make a taxable profit or loss after expenses have been deducted. If you need help deciding whether you need to declare childcare income using standard costs, please call us. Note You can't offset any loss calculated using standard costs (see the determination) against other income in any income year. Childcare services not under the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 These childcare providers can't use the determination. They must keep full records of actual income and expenses and are liable for tax on their total income after actual expenses are deducted for childcare services provided. At Question 24 show any childcare taxable income or loss after expenses have been deducted. ACC levies Income from self-employment is liable for ACC levies which ACC will invoice you for. Question 25 income from taxable sale/disposals of property Income from the sale of land and/or buildings Include all income from land sales that are that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Also include taxable sales of the main home or holiday homes taxed under the mixed-use asset rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property are also included under this question. Net income from a bright-line sale other than your main home or a property taxed under the mixed-use assets rules is included under Residential income at Question 22. Profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it, or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if you: •are a builder and improved a property before selling it, •developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or •had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. If you purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period, any profit will be taxable, even if you didn’t intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to: •properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/disposed of within 2 years, and •properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. 35 ird.govt.nz Income and losses for property captured by the bright line test are treated differently in the tax return: •After a bright line sale, when net income (a profit) is made, the profit is included in the residential rental income Box (22A). However, this does not apply to disposals of your main home or a property taxed under the mixed-use assets rules. Unless the property is included in a portfolio expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal, •After a bright line sale, when a net loss is made, any excess deductions must be carried forward to a later income year when they can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, or future disposals captured by the bright line rules. Show the total profit from other property in Box 25B. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form at ird.govtnz/forms-guides Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test and made a loss, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other residential property sales. For more information on property sales, refer to our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Question 25A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If you are an "offshore RLWT person" and have sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. You should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. You can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than one amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Attach a note showing the name of your withholder(s) to the return. Question 26 Other income If you received any other income between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, show it at Question 26. This may include: •the sale of non-FIF shares or other property •financial arrangements •cash jobs, payments made ‘under the table’, tips, bartering or income from an illegal enterprise •any share of partnership income as a result of capital investment •free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme if your employer has not provided us with this information •amount of loss carry-back to 2019. If you're not sure if your income is taxable, please call us. If you're a New Zealand tax resident you'll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE36 Income from the sale of non-FIF shares or other property The profits are taxable if you bought: •and sold shares or other property as a business •shares or other property for the purpose of resale •shares or property to make a profit. This doesn't apply to shares that are FIFs. Write the total profit in Box 26. Attach the details of your income and expenses from these sales to your return. Sale or disposal of assets If you sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, call us or refer to our Depreciation - IR260, General depreciation rates - IR265 or Historic depreciation rates - IR267 guides. Losses from the sale of land, buildings, shares or other property If you made a loss and can show that if you'd made a profit, it would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Show the total in Box 25B. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test, any excess deductions can't be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales in the same year. Any excess deductions not allocated to the income year will be treated as the cost of revenue account property and carried forward to the next income year. The Property sale information - IR833 form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Financial arrangements If you're a party to a financial arrangement, you must account for income from those arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. A cash-basis person doesn't need to use the accrual method to calculate income. You qualify as a cash-basis person if: •on every day in the income year the absolute value of all financial arrangements added together is $1,000,000 or less, or •the absolute value of your income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements is $100,000 or less, and •the deferral of income or acceleration of expenditure using the cash method rather than the accrual method is $40,000 or less. If you held the financial arrangement prior to 20 May 1999 the amounts above may be reduced to $600,000, $70,000 and $20,000 respectively. Please note the "absolute value" is the value of an amount whether it's positive or negative. 37 ird.govt.nz Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading method applies, you must do a "wash-up" calculation in certain circumstances. For example: •a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred •there is an absolute assignment of the financial arrangement •a party to a financial arrangement is released from making all remaining payments under the Insolvency Act 1967, the Companies Act 1993 or the laws of a country or territory other than New Zealand •you cease to be a resident of New Zealand. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are brought to account. This applies in every case - you don't have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or have bought them for the purpose of resale, as you would with shares. When calculating the income or expenditure on sale, use our Sale or disposal of financial arrangements - IR3K form. Income from cash jobs, tips, "under the table" payments, bartering or an illegal enterprise If you received any other type of income that didn't have tax deducted from it, show it in Box 26. Attach the details of your income and any expenses to your return. Share of partnership income as a result of capital investment If your share of partnership income is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you didn't take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (ie, you were a sleeping partner), show your share of partnership income in Box 26. Question 28 Other expenses and deductions If you paid any of these expenses, between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, you can claim them in Box 28. •a fee to someone for completing your tax return •commission on interest or dividend income (but not bank fees - they're a private expense) •additional expenses incurred in earning partnership income, eg, interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership •interest on money you borrowed to buy shares or to invest - as long as the investment will produce some taxable income •premiums on loss of earnings insurance (income protection), provided the benefit from the insurance policy is taxable •interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, only if the interest is not already included as a deduction in your accounts. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE38 ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you're an ACC client and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments and have retained some of these, you may claim the payments you've made to your caregiver as a deduction at Question 12C. Read the information on page 57 before you complete Question 12C. Schedular income expenses If you incurred expenses while earning income that's had tax from schedular payments deducted, you claim these at Question 12C, not here. Other expenses For other expenses, attach the details to your return. Include your name and IRD number. You can't claim expenses against income from: •salary and/or wages •election day services •casual agricultural work •commissions, if you're also paid a salary or retainer from the same employer. You can still claim expenses for having your tax return completed for you and loss of earnings insurance premiums from these income sources. Note If you're GST-registered you must deduct any GST included in any expenses. GST-registered people claim the GST portion of their expenses in their GST return, not the IR3. ACC levies ACC will take into account all expenses shown in Box 28 when calculating any ACC levies due. Question 30 Net losses brought forward You can find the amount of net loss you have to bring forward on the loss carried forward letter we sent you after your 2019 return acknowledgement or notice of assessment. Add up all net losses to be brought forward to 2020 and print the total in Box 30A. Print the amount you can claim this year in Box 30B. Loss carry-back Where on your return to claim loss carry-back You must let us know if you are going use the loss carry-back scheme. You can do this in the ‘I want to’ section of your income tax account in myIR and selecting “Opt-in to carry-back loss”.

In myIR choose amendment reason “loss carry-back”. Select income type “you are claiming net losses brought forward” and enter the amount of the loss carried-back in Box 28B (Amount of loss claimed this year). Claiming a loss carry-back in 2020 from 2021 If you are claiming a loss carry-back in 2020, based on an estimated loss in 2021, enter the amount of the estimated loss carry-back in Box 30B (Amount claimed this year). Your tax credits Tax credits can reduce the tax you have to pay on your income. Other tax credits Donation tax credits are claimed separately on a Tax credit claim form - IR526 or you can submit a receipt for donations in myIR. Go to ird.govt.nz/donations for more information. Question 32 Independent earner tax credit (IETC) You can calculate your IETC: •by using the worksheets provided in this section •by calling our self-service line - see page 63. IETC The IETC is a tax credit for individuals whose annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000. Your annual net income is shown at Box 29 "Income after expenses" in your return. If you're eligible for IETC, but earn over $44,000, your annual entitlement to IETC decreases by 13 cents for every dollar earned above $44,000. For the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, you'll be entitled to IETC for any months: •you were a New Zealand tax resident •you or your partner weren't entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits (or received an overseas equivalent) and you didn't receive: –an income-tested benefit –NZ Super –a veteran's pension or –an overseas equivalent of any of the above. You're a tax resident if you lived in New Zealand for more than 183 days in the last twelve months, or have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. For more information, read our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292. To work out the months you're entitled to this tax credit, use the total number of whole months the criteria applied to. If you didn't meet the above criteria for even one day of any month you won't be entitled to IETC at all for that month, so don't include it in your calculation. \* Net income means your total income from all sources, less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE40 Calculating your IETC Enter the start and end dates when you had any overseas income that excludes you from being eligible for IETC at Box 32B on your return. If the overseas income continued past the end of the year enter the end date for the income as 31/03/2020. If you have more than one date range for the overseas excluded income, attach a note telling us of the date ranges. You'll also need to include any dates you weren't a New Zealand tax resident. Tick the boxes below for each month (between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020) you were entitled to the IETC for the full month.

If you received dividends from a New Zealand company that gave you imputation credits or an Australian company that gave you New Zealand imputation credits, you may have excess imputation credits to carry forward. This will only happen if your total imputation credits (including any excess imputation credits brought forward from 2019) are greater than your total tax payable. Use the worksheet below to work out the excess imputation credits that must be carried forward to your 2021 tax return. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount. Worksheet Copy your total imputation credits from Box 9 of your tax calculation on page 44 in this guide to Box 1. 1 Copy your total tax payable from Box 6 of your tax calculation on page 44 in this guide to Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer in Box 3. 3 This is your excess imputation credits amount to carry forward to 2021. Student loan We'll work out how much of your student loan you need to repay, based on your income. If you have an end-of-year repayment obligation we'll send you a notice showing how much is due. If you want to calculate the amount yourself, either use the worksheet provided here or go to ird.govt.nz/myIR and use our student loan repayment calculator. Interest-free student loan If you've lived in New Zealand for six months (183 days) or more, your student loan is interest-free. Even if you haven't been in New Zealand for six months, you may qualify for an interest-free student loan if you meet the criteria for an exemption. Go to our website ird.govt.nz/sl-interest-free for more details. End of year repayment obligation Repayment deductions from salary or wages are generally considered your final obligation on that income and don't form part of your end-of-year repayment obligation. Income from casual agricultural work and election day work doesn't have student loan deductions. This income is excluded as salary and wage income and becomes part of adjusted net income. If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, any income or deductions are excluded in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, you can offset a loss from one business or investment activity against other like income. For example, Rory has an overall loss from his landscaping business of $7,500. He has also made a profit from his lawnmowing service of $50,000. The activities are carried out in association with each other, so Rory can claim the $7,500 loss against the $50,000 profit. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE46 From the 2015 tax year onwards income adjustments are now required to be part of your adjusted net income. For a full list of the adjustments required go to ird.govt.nz/adjust-income You'll only have an end-of-year repayment obligation if you: •have adjusted net income of $1,500 or more with a total income (including salary or wages) of $21,260 (annual repayment threshold plus $1,500) or more •had an interim assessment for the year. Note Adjusted net income is your annual gross income, excluding salary or wages and less annual total deductions you may claim. If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, neither the income or the deductions from that activity are included in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, a loss from one business or investment activity can be offset against other like income. Annual total deductions are the expenses and deductions you can claim for the tax year. Note If you're required to file an Adjust your income - IR215 form, you can't use this worksheet to calculate your 2020 repayment obligation. Once we have received your IR3 and your IR215 we will send you your end-of-year repayment obligation for 2020. 47 ird.govt.nz Use this worksheet to calculate your 2020 repayment. Annual repayment threshold. 1 19,760 00 Copy any gross salary or wage income (excluding casual agricultural or election day income) from Box 11B of your return to Box 2. 2 If Box 2 is more than Box 1 print $0.00 in Box 3, otherwise subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the result in Box 3. 3 This is your unused repayment threshold you can use against your other income. Enter your income after expenses from Box 29 of your return (excluding any losses), less any salary and wage income from Box 2 in Box 4. 4 Subtract Box 3 from Box 4. If the result is less than $1,500.00 print $0.00 in Box 5. Otherwise, print the result in Box 5 (this is your total liable income). 5 Multiply the amount in Box 5 by 0.12 (12%). 6 This is your end-of-year payment obligation for the 2020 tax year. Print any 2020 voluntary repayments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6A. 6A Print any 2020 interim payments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6B. 6B Add Boxes 6A and 6B together and print the result in Box 7. 7 Subtract Box 7 from Box 6 and print your answer in Box 8. 8 If Box 7 is less than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year loan repayment. (Tick one) Loan repayment If Box 7 is larger than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year overpayment. Overpayment IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE48 Question 35 Early payment discount An early payment discount is available for people who: •are new in business •haven't begun to pay provisional tax •made payments within the corresponding income year up to their balance date, eg, a standard balance date taxpayer, who has made a payment or payments on or before 31 March 2020 as income tax for the period 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020. The discount is calculated at the rate of 6.7% of either: •the amount paid during the year, or •105% of your end-of-year residual income tax liability, whichever is the lesser, and is credited against your end-of-year tax bill. To check if you qualify, work through the following flowchart. 49 ird.govt.nz Do you qualify for an early payment discount? Terms we use Provisional tax - this is tax paid in instalments during the year, based on what you expect your income to be, or what it was last year.

Assessable income includes undeclared business income you may have earned (eg, cash jobs). Year - as referred to in the diagram below, year means the standard tax year from 1 April to 31 March, unless you have an approved different balance date, in which case your income year will end then. If you have any questions about your entitlement to the discount, please contact us.

If you’ve made payments towards your 2021 provisional tax and, after completing this return, you find that you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the over payment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Direct credit If you choose direct credit you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund over $1.00 direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct bank account number is printed at Question 8 on the front page of your return. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like your excess tax transferred (the "transfer date"). The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out the boxes on page 5 of your return. If you ask for a transfer on your return, we will transfer your refund at one of the following dates: Transfer to your own account or an account of someone associated to you, the later of: •the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March), or •the due date in the destination account. Transfer to an account of someone not associated to you: •the day after your return was filed. If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you'd like the credit transferred at a different date, you can contact us and ask for the transfer date to be changed (including if we've transferred your credit to cover a debt). 51 ird.govt.nz Associated taxpayers The following are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: •a company you're a shareholder-employee in •a partner in the same partnership •a relative (eg, child, parent) •spouse or partner •a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. Transfers requiring a separate note attached to the return Situations such as requesting a transfer at a future date, transfer to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement and transfers at a different date will require you to attach a separate note to your return advising the following specific details. •The amount you want transferred. •The account you want it transferred to, eg, name, IRD number, tax type and period end date (and if it's another person, whether they're associated). •The date you'd like the credit transferred. •If it is to be transferred to debt covered by an instalment arrangement. Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling funds transferred in. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE52 Provisional tax Question 37 Provisional tax Provisional tax is generally payable because you earned income during the year that either: •wasn't taxed, or •was taxed at the wrong rate. It's usually payable in three instalments during the year (28 August 2020, 15 January 2021, 7 May 2021), unless: •you have a non-standard balance date, or •you pay GST on a six-monthly basis, or •you use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax. If your 2020 residual income tax (RIT) (Box 34A of your return) is more than $5,000, you'll become a provisional tax payer and will be liable to pay 2021 provisional tax. For more information read our guides Provisional tax - IR289 or Penalties and interest - IR240. Initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. You will have an initial provisional tax liability if: •you begin to derive income from a taxable activity during the tax year, and •your RIT in any of the four preceding tax years didn’t exceed $5,000 ($2,500 for the 2019-20 and earlier years), and •your RIT for the current year is $60,000 or more. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. The date you cease employment determines when interest will be charged from. You are not liable to pay provisional tax in the year you have an initial provisional tax liability. You may make voluntary payments to reduce your interest liability. Interest rules if you have an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply to when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. If this applies to you, please read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Payment options You have three options for paying provisional tax - the standard option "S", the estimation option "E" or the ratio option "R". Standard option Under this option, your 2021 provisional tax is the same as your 2020 RIT (if it is more than $5,000) plus 5%. Copy this amount to Box 37B of your return and print "S" in Box 37A. Divide the amount by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment - record this on page 56. If you're filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. 53 ird.govt.nz Note If you think your income for 2021 will be more than your 2020 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Use this worksheet to calculate your 2021 provisional tax using the standard option "S" Copy your RIT from Box 34A of your return to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.05 (5%). Print your answer in Box 2. 2 Add Box 1 and Box 2. Print your answer in Box 3. Box 3 is your 2021 provisional tax. 3 00 Copy this amount to Box 37B of your return and print "S" in Box 37A. Divide the amount in Box 3 by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment. Record this on page 56. If you're filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. Estimation option Anyone can estimate provisional tax. If you expect your 2021 RIT to be lower than your 2020 RIT, estimating will keep you from paying more than you have to. If you choose to estimate, your estimate must be fair and reasonable at the time you make it and at each instalment date. You can be charged a penalty and/or interest if you don't take reasonable care when you estimate your provisional tax. Use this worksheet to calculate your 2021 provisional tax using the estimation option "E" Print your estimated 2021 taxable income in Box 1. 1 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 1.

Any ACC personal service rehabilitation payments paid by ACC or your employer direct to the client or caregiver, are schedular payments and will have tax deducted before the payments are made. If you received these payments you may not be required to complete an IR3, let us know and we’ll update our records. Do I need to file? Are you a caregiver receiving payments from ACC, or a caregiver paid by a client? If this is your only income, you are not required to complete an IR3 and can receive an automatic income tax assessment instead. However, you may have another reason to complete an IR3 - see page 5 for more information. Are you a client who received these payments from ACC and then passed on those payments to your caregiver? You're are required to file an IR3 if: •you have other income •you have other reasons to file - see page 5. Note the above rules apply whether or not you've passed these payments on to your caregiver. If you're a client or caregiver who is required to file, please read the information on the following pages before you complete Questions 12 and 28. Question 12 Schedular payments If you're a caregiver paid directly by ACC Use the income from schedular payments information on your Summary of Income (SOI) to help you complete your IR3. If you haven't received an SOI, call us on 0800 377 774 and we'll send you a copy. If you haven't given ACC your IRD number, please include any payments that aren't on your SOI in your IR3.

More information If you have any questions about your tax please go to our website ird.govt.nz Accident Compensation Act 2001 (ACC) Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide earnings information from your IR 3 return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). ACC will begin invoicing self-employed levies from August. ACC gets the information from IR3 returns as follows: •Question 11A Gross earnings with PAYE deducted and earnings not liable for ACC earners' levy •Question 12 Schedular payments •Question 17 Overseas income •Question 18 Share of partnership income ("active" income) from the partnership's trade or business •Question 19 Look-through company (LTC) active income •Question 20 Shareholder-employee salary with no tax deducted •Question 24 Self-employed income •Question 26 Other income •Question 28 Other expenses. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE62 Shareholder-employees Other income In addition to your shareholder's remuneration, you may also have received other income liable for ACC levies, such as self-employed income. ACC will take your shareholder-employee remuneration into account if invoicing for additional levies. Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of ACC earners' levy deductions is $1,785.73. You may be due for a refund from ACC if your shareholder-employee remuneration is from two or more companies and the combined total is over $128,470. Please call ACC on 0508 426 837 to find out more about the refund process. Mixed income Mixed income earners are those who have a combination of employee (including shareholder-employee remuneration without PAYE deducted) and self-employed earnings. If you're in this situation you have to pay ACC levies on both sources of income, up to the maximum. ACC will invoice you for the amount you'll have to pay. Current year losses If you were in full-time employment and have recorded a loss, or your earnings are below the minimum earnings threshold, you're still liable for ACC levies. These will be calculated at the minimum level. IR56 taxpayers If you're a private domestic worker, you've already paid ACC earners' levy on your IR56 income as part of your PAYE. ACC will invoice you as an employer for other levies payable on your IR56 income. If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. ACC will make allowance for levies paid as an employer.

If we've sent you a message to complete your Individual income tax return - IR3 in myIR, or a paper copy by post, you must complete the return and send it to us by 7 July 2021, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. If you do not need to complete a return but you'd like to talk to someone about your tax situation, you can call us. Note To help you work out if you need to complete an IR3, go to ird.govt.nz/end-of-tax-year or call us on 0800 377 774. If you received any other income apart from salary, wages, interest, dividends (see further information below), and/or taxable Māori authority distributions, you must complete an IR3 return. There are some exceptions. If you received personal service rehabilitation payments and are an ACC client or caregiver (who received payments from the client or ACC), read page 59. Note If you had a workplace injury your employer may manage these payments instead of ACC. If you or your caregiver receives these payments, regardless of who makes them, you'll need to read the information on page 59. Other income includes: • self-employed income (see children's exempt income below) • schedular payments • income der ived overseas - calculated taxable income arising from a withdrawal or transfer from foreign superannuation schemes acquired while a non-resident of New Zealand • over $200 in tota l of income that has not been reported to us such as: – interest d erived overseas (if it's had tax deducted or not) – dividends of certain Australian resident listed companies and other overseas investments that are not treated as part of foreign investment funds (FIF) income - see page 20 – employment income or schedular payments – income fro m a PIE for example you are 1 of the joint holders of a PIE investment that is not under your IRD number • FIF income • rental inc ome • estate, trust or partnership income • royalties • cash jobs o r "under the table" payments • income fro m illegal enterprises, and • income wit hout PAYE deducted, such as shareholder-employee salary or a claim received under a taxable loss of earnings policy. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE6 You'll also need to complete an IR3 if you: • left or arrived in New Zealand part-way through the year • are filing a ret urn for a deceased person to the date of death if there is a requirement to complete a return for this income year • were declared bankrupt, or • changed your balance date part-way through the year. Children's exempt income Read this information if for the tax year you: • were 14 or under • were 15, 16 or 17 and still attending school\*, or • turned 18 on or a fter 1 January in the previous tax year and continued to attend school\* \* including a school for people with disabilities, but excluding tertiary institutions. The following income is required to have tax taken out before you receive it: • salary or wages • schedular payments • interest • dividends, and • Māori authority distributions. If you only receive these types of income you will not need to complete an IR3. However, if you are required to complete an IR3 return this income needs to be included. You may receive income that has not had tax taken out before you get it for example: • worked as a self-employed person • worked ar ound the home of a neighbour or family friend, and that work was not part of a business that they carry on, or • benefic iary income from a trust, such as a testamentary trust (a trust set up from an estate of a deceased person), that is not listed above as requiring to have tax taken out. If your total income from these sources is less than $2,340 for the tax year, this income is exempt from tax and is not included in your return. You are not required to complete a return just because you earn this type of income. If you earn $2,340 or more, the exemption does not apply and you will need to complete a return and pay tax on all the income, not just the amount that exceeds the exemption. If you have to complete a return but we have not sent you an IR3, you must request and complete it by 7 July 2021, unless you have an extension of time or a non-standard balance date. Contact us to request an IR3 return. You can do this in myIR 7 ird.govt.nz Extension of time If circumstances beyond your control will prevent you from sending in your return on time, call us on 0800 377 774 and we may grant you an extension. If you have a tax agent you may have until 31 March 2022 to complete the return. Contact your agent for more information. Are there any penalties? You may face penalties and prosecution if you: • are required to put in a return but do not • give false or misleading information (including not showing all your income) • leave out details on purpose so the information is misleading • complete your return late. Income year The information in this guide is based on the tax year from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. If your income year is different you can still use this guide, but work out your income and expenses for your income year. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE8 Using this guide Did you know you can also complete your return online? Go to ird.govt.nz/myIR The form will prepopulate with your personal details and earnings information. Before you start filling in the return make sure you have: • any intere st or dividend statements • any taxab le Māori authority distribution statements • any other income details, such as overseas, rental property, farming or business income, and • your 2021 Workin g for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) letter, if you applied for WfFTC from Inland Revenue. The questions in this guide are in the same order as the questions on the return. Do not use anyone else's preprinted return because it's precoded with their own IRD number. Questions 1 to 5 Personal information This information helps us to contact you. Please make sure we have your details correct. If you have changed your name or address, update the information in the spaces provided on the return. You can also update your personal information in your myIR account. Postal address If you use your tax preparer’s postal address leave this panel blank. Your tax preparer will let us know if they've changed their address. If your address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealan d Post. Date of birth We ask for this so we do not mix up people with the same name. Question 6 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not preprinted on the return or is different from the preprinted one, enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. If you are unable to identify the correct code, call ACC on 0508 426 837 for more help. Note Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. If you do not complete your BIC code, ACC will select one on your behalf. This may mean your ACC levy rate could be incorrect. 9 ird.govt.nz Question 8 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example, a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return, include it at Question 8. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 boxes. Question 9 Adjustments to your income If you have a student loan or you’re eligible for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC), you may need to include adjustments to your income. This is so we can correctly assess your student loan repayment obligation and make sure you receive the right WfFTC entitlement. Find out more about adjusting your income at ird.govt.nz/adjust-income To let us know about your income adjustments you can: • complete it in your myIR account • call us on 0800 227 774, or • tick 9A on your IR3, complete and attach an Adjust your income - IR215 form to your income tax return. If you need a IR215 form, you can download it from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides or call us on 0800 257 773. What do I need to do to receive my entitlement? If you have not already registered for WfFTC, you can find out if you qualify and register online at ird.govt.nz/working-for-families Once you’re registered, we’ll send you a notice of entitlement with all your family details for you to check. Please let us know if anything is incorrect. For more information about the notice of entitlement go to ird.govt.nz/noe If you’re already registered and you need to file an IR3, we may send you a letter showing your family details. You’ll receive this by the beginning of May. Please let us know if any of the details are incorrect. Question 10 Non-residents and transitional residents Non-residents If you were away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period and do not have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, you may be a non-resident. Read our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292 to find out your status. If you were not present in New Zealand and are a non-resident for a full year, but you received income from New Zealand, you may need to complete an IR3NR return instead. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE10 Transitional residents If you became a New Zealand tax resident during the year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 and you've elected not to be treated as a transitional resident, you have to complete an IR3 declaring your worldwide income from the date you became a New Zealan d tax resident. Transitional residents do not have to declare their foreign-sourced income except for foreign employment income and foreign services income. If you were a non-resident for part of the year, complete Question 42 on your return. If your return is not for a full year, we'll calculate your tax and income-related tax credits and let you know the result - see ird.govt.nz/tte for more information. 11 ird.govt.nz Your income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, salary, wages or schedular payments, the information you need to complete Questions 11, 11A and 12 will be on your Summary of Income (SOI), which we'll send you in May 2021. We send this automatically if we send you an IR3 return. Your SOI contains the following information: • all your emplo yers throughout the year • your total gross income with tax deducted and ACC earners' levy paid • any family tax credit paid by Work and Income, and • your tax credits for payroll donations you've made through payroll giving. Question 11 Family tax credit from Work and Income If you received family tax credit from Work and Income, copy the amount from your SOI to Box 11 if it does not already show. Do not include any Working for Families Tax Credits from Inland Revenue in Box 11. Question 11A Income with tax deducted Did you receive any of these types of income with tax deducted between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021? • salary or wages • a student a llowance • any income-tested benefit - unemployment or sickness, transitional retirement, independent youth, domestic purposes, widow's, invalid's or emergency • acciden t compensation payments related to earnings • New Zealan d Superannuation (NZ Super) either income-tested or non-income tested, or a veteran's pension • other pensions, annuities or superannuation (read "Pensions" on page 14) • free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme (previously known as a share purchase agreement). Note: it is up to your employer whether they deduct tax on these or not • shareholde r-employee salary. If you received any of these types of income with tax deducted, you need to copy the totals from your SOI to Question 11A if they do n ot already show on your return. Employee Share Scheme (ESS) benefits If you (or an associate) received free or discounted shares under an employee share scheme the taxable value will be included on your SOI as long as your employer has provided us with this information. In most cases your employer will have provided this information but if they have not you will need to show the taxable value at Question 27. You will need to check with your employer whether this information has been provided. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE12 What to show on your return Copy the total amounts from your SOI to the corresponding boxes (11A, 11B, 11C, 11D and 11E) on your return if it does not already show. Amending your income details If any of the details on your SOI are incorrect (for example wrong or missing employers), please make the changes on your SOI and attach it to your income tax return. You only need to attach your SOI to your income tax return if you've made changes to it. Transfer the amended totals from your SOI to the corresponding boxes on your return and use the worksheet on page 13 to calculate your total tax deducted (11E). ACC earners' levy All employees must pay an ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of non-work related injuries, based on their earnings. We collect this on behalf of the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The maximum amount of earners' levy is $1,819.66. The earners' levy is set at a rate of 1.39% (1.39 cents in the dollar). If you need to amend your employment details on your SOI, you'll need to recalculate your earners' levy. Using employer-provided information If you received payslips or other earnings information from your employer, you can use this information to complete your return and do not have to wait for your SOI. You do not include schedular payments in this calculation. You'll need to use your total PAYE deducted in your calculations. This is the amount of PAYE shown on your payslips before any tax credits for payroll donations are deducted. If you made donations through payroll giving to an organisation that is not on Inland Revenue's approved donee organisations list, you will not be able to keep the tax credits you received and you will not have paid enough PAYE throughout the year. You'll have either received a letter telling you about these extinguished tax credits or they'll show on your summary of income. Put the total PAYE, less the amount of your extinguished tax credits, in Box 11A. If the amount of total PAYE deducted is not clear from your payslips: • contact your employer • refer to your SOI for details • refer to Ea rning summary in the My Income tab in myIR, or • call us on 0800 227 774. 13 ird.govt.nz You'll need to calculate your ACC earners' levy liability and deduct it from your total PAYE, using the worksheet below. Worksheet for ACC earners' levy Copy your total taxable earnings from salary and wages to Box 1. Copy the amount to Box 11B of your return. 1 Copy your taxable earnings from salary and wages that are not liable for earners' levy to Box 2. See below for a list of income not liable.

Copy this amount to Box 11E of your return. The following income is not liable for ACC earners' levy - NZ Super-income from a partnership earned by a non-working partner in that partnership - income-tested benefits - non-taxable allowances-pensions from superannuation schemes not registered with the Financial Markets Authority -student allowances -veteran's pension-overseas pensions - living alone payments-rents - redundancy payments-estate and trust income - retiring allowances-royalties - jury and witness fees-income attributed to you from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) - interest and dividends - taxable Māori authority distributions-income arising from a withdrawal from foreign superannuation schemes. - free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE14 Pensions Do not include the following pensions or annuities in your tax return: • non-taxab le pensions or annuities from either life insurance funds or superannuation schemes registered with the Financial Markets Authority (for example Government Superannuation) • pensions that are completely tax-free, such as war pensions (other than a veteran's pension). Any overseas social security pension you receive is usually taxable. Include it at Question 17 (see the notes on page 23). If you receive a United Kingdom national retirement pension and have joined the special banking option operated by Work and Income, only include the New Zealand Super income and tax deducted at Question 11A. For more information read our guides Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257 or Overseas social security pensions - IR258. Question 12 Schedular payments Schedular payments are generally payments made to people who are not employees but are employed on a contract basis. All ACC personal service rehabilitation payments which are paid by ACC or your employer are classified as schedular payments. Different tax rates apply to schedular payments, depending on the work done. A full list is available in the PAYE tables - IR340 and IR341 and on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C. People who receive schedular payments will receive a Summary of income (SOI) detailing their schedular payments received and the tax deducted. If your SOI shows total schedular income over $200, you must complete an IR3 return. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you are an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, read the information on page 59 before you complete Question 12. Question 12A Total tax deducted This is the total amount of tax deducted from schedular payments you received during the year. The amount in this Box should also include any amount of tax deducted from schedular payments made to a close company which has been transferred directly to you as a shareholder-employee. Question 12C Expenses related to schedular payments Show any expenses you can claim against this income here. Do not include it with other expenses at Question 29. Question 12D Net schedular payments This is the total gross schedular payments shown at Box 12B, less any expenses being claimed at Box 12C. Mineral mining tax credit Include in Box 12A the amount of refundable tax credit being claimed where a tax loss is incurred on disposal of land or claiming rehabilitation expenditure. Include the amount of tax loss in Box 12D. 15 ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Copy the total tax deducted (Box 12A) and gross payments (Box 12B) from your SOI to the same box numbers of your return. Add up the expenses related to your schedular payments and print the total in Box 12C. Subtract Box 12C from Box 12B and print the result in Box 12D. If your employer received and passed on the wage subsidy as part of your schedular payments with tax deducted at source no further action is required for this wage subsidy receipt. If your employer received the wage subsidy and passed this on to you without tax deducted at source you will need to include the amount in the government subsidies box at Question 26. Note If you are registered for GST, your gross schedular payment may include GST. Enter the GST-exclusive amount at Question 12B. Shareholder-employee salary If you received a shareholder-employee salary with no PAYE deducted, show the amount at Question 20. ACC levies You'll have to pay ACC levies on schedular payments. ACC will invoice you for these. Question 13 New Zealand interest Did you receive any New Zealand interest between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021 from: • banks • Inland Revenue • building and investment societies • credit unions • securities • a partner ship, look-through company, estate or trust, or • loans you'v e made. If so, show all the New Zealand interest you received at Question 13B. If the interest is from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust please tick Box 13C. If you were charged commission on any of your interest, claim this at Question 29. Read the note about expenses on page 37. Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have "negative interest" to account for. This is interest you've repaid on the term deposit. It may reduce the amount of interest you need to declare on your tax return. If you broke the term deposit in full, use the worksheet on page 16 to deduct the negative interest from the gross interest amount shown on your RWT withholding certificate or equivalent statement. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a later tax return when the term deposit matures. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE16 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Include this in the amount shown at Box 13B. 3 RWT During the year, RWT will have been deducted from some or all of your interest and you can claim a credit for this. The interest payer will usually send you a RWT withholding certificate or similar statement which shows the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Add up the amounts from each statement or certificate and print the totals in Boxes 13A and 13B. Do not send us your interest statements with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later. Interest of $50 or less If the interest you received for the year is $50 or less, you may not receive a certificate or statement, but you still need to show the gross interest and RWT. Get the details from your bank statements. Interest on joint accounts If you hold a joint account, you must show your share of the interest in your tax return. Interest from overseas If you received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 17. Read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Farm vendor mortgage or finance bonds If you received interest from a farm vendor mortgage or farm vendor finance bonds approved by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation of New Zealand, only half of the interest is taxable. Show the RWT deducted and the taxable amount of interest in Boxes 13A and 13B. Income from financial arrangements If you are a party to a financial arrangement, such as government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures or deferred property settlements, you may have to calculate the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement using a spreading method, rather than on a cash basis. To determine whether a spreading method must be used, see "Financial arrangements" on page 36. If the financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation, known as a base price adjustment, must be made. Any RWT will have to be deducted on a cash basis. Show the RWT deducted and any income from the financial arrangement in Boxes 13A and 13B. 17 ird.govt.nz Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 13B in the income year you received the interest. If you paid us interest, include it as a deduction at Question 29 for the income year the interest is paid. Question 14 New Zealand dividends Dividends are a part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes and unit trust distributions are treated as dividends. Complete Question 14 if you received any New Zealand dividends between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, including dividends from your local electricity or gas company (but do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax-free). The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Include dividends earned by a partnership or estate, or distributed by a trust. If you were charged commission on any of your dividends, claim this at Question 29. Read the notes about expenses on page 37. If you receive dividends from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) that is a listed company and does not use your prescribed investor rate, you can decide whether or not to include the dividends in your return. Credits attached to dividends A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach several types of credits to dividends. "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits so the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. If the dividend is from a listed PIE, it should not have RWT deducted. What to show on your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • you received (net dividend) • of any imputation credit, and • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your gross dividend. Add up all the imputation credits, RWT credits and gross dividend totals and transfer them to the relevant boxes at Question 14. If the dividends are from a partnership, look-through company, estate or trust, please tick Box 14C. Do not send us your dividend statements, keep them in case we ask for them later. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE18 Shares and other non-cash dividends If you received shares from a taxable bonus issue or a non-cash dividend , include them as income at Question 14. Dividends from overseas Please read the notes about overseas income on page 19. Question 15 Māori authority distributions Complete Question 15 if you received taxable Māori authority distributions between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Māori authority credit and includes tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits. What to show on your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • the distribution made to you, including which portion is taxable and which portion is not, and • the Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, not including any non-taxable distribution, to the relevant boxes at Question 15. For more information read our guide Māori authorities - IR487. Question 16 Estate or trust income If you received estate or trust income that relates to the year 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, show it at Question 16. There are 3 types of estates or trusts: • complying • foreign, and • non-complying. Complying trusts are trusts that have been taxed in New Zealand on all their income since the day they started. Allocations of beneficiary income which the minor beneficiary rule applies to are taxed as trustee income. This means the trust is subject to tax on this income at 33 cents in the dollar, and it's included in the trustee tax calculation in the trust's IR6 return. These distributions should not be included in the minor's individual tax return. All other trusts are non-complying or foreign. Read our guide Trusts' and estates' income tax rules - IR288 for more details. 19 ird.govt.nz What to show on your return Add up the tax paid by the trustee/s and print the total in Box 16A. Print your share of the estate or complying trust income in Box 16B. But, if your estate or trust income includes: • interest with RWT deducted, show this at Question 13 and tick 13C • dividends with imputation credits attached, show this at Question 14 and tick 14C • taxable Māori authority distributions, show this at Question 15, or • overseas income and overseas tax paid, show this at Question 17. If you received a wage subsidy payment from the Trust which did not have tax deducted at source you will need to include the amount in the government subsidies box at Question 26. Income from foreign and non-complying trusts If you are a beneficiary of a foreign or non-complying trust please complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 form. Taxable distributions from non-complying trusts Copy the amount of taxable distributions from the non-complying trust to Box 16C and attach the IR307 to your income tax return. We separate taxable distributions from non-complying trusts because they're taxed at a different rate. If you have this type of income, your tax calculation at Question 37 may not be c orrect. We'll do this calculation for you and send you a notice of assessment. Question 17 Overseas income If you received income from, or while you were overseas, between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, show it at Box 17B in New Zealand dollars. This includes taxable income from withdrawals and transfers from foreign superannuation schemes while you were a non-resident of New Zealand. Transitional residents must include any foreign employment or service income at Box 17B. You can convert all overseas income and tax credits to New Zealand dollars by: • using the rates tables on our website ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Note Portable NZ Super and/or portable veteran's pension paid while residing overseas are tax exempt and will not need to be included on your return. Note Dividends received from overseas companies that are treated as FIFs (except companies covered by the exclusions listed under foreign rights at Question 41) are not taxable separately. Generally, you would use the default FIF income calculation method (the fair dividend rate), which does not tax dividends separately. The foreign tax deducted from the dividend may be claimed as a credit against the tax payable on the calculated FIF income for that company. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE20 Foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you've received a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme, have transferred your foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme, or you have transferred a superannuation interest to another person you are liable for income tax unless you qualify for an exemption. You need to calculate the amount of taxable income from the withdrawal or transfer (refer below) and include this income in Box 17B, and tick Box 17C. Lump sums received or transferred in the first 4 years of New Zealand tax residence are generally exempt from tax, see "temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals" on page 22. Lump sums and transfers are taxed using 1 of 2 methods: • schedule metho d (default method) - this means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income, based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident and contributions you've made in that time (certain conditions apply). • formula method (alternative method) - can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and meets certain requirements. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. KiwiSaver withdrawal facility for tax liability on foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers If you transfer a lump sum to a KiwiSaver scheme you may have income tax and student loan repayment obligations. You can request a withdrawal of funds from your KiwiSaver account to pay these obligations. Your KiwiSaver provider will deal with your application. For more information about foreign superannuation withdrawals or transfers see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257 or go to ird.govt.nz/foreign-super Foreign investment fund (FIF) income If, at any time during the 2021 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, unit trust, superannuation scheme or life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate FIF income or loss. Generally, you'll use the fair dividend rate (FDR) or comparative value (CV) method to calculate FIF income. The main exclusions from an interest in a FIF are: • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts (you can check this on our website by going to ird.govt.nz/asx-fif) • interest in certain Australian unit trusts – limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). From 1 April 2014 the FIF rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes unless acquired when the holder was a New Zealand tax resident or the interest is grandparented. For more information see our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257. There's also an exemption from the FIF rules where the total cost of all the investment for FIF purposes is below NZ$50,000. 21 ird.govt.nz What to show on your return After you've converted the amounts to New Zealand dollars, add up the available amounts of overseas tax paid and print the total in Box 17A. Add up the gross amounts of overseas income (before tax was deducted) and print the total in Box 17B. Attach proof of any overseas tax paid to your income tax return. If a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) was maintained, complete a Branch equivalent tax account return - IR308 and attach it to your IR3 return. Tax paid overseas If you paid tax overseas on any foreign income derived, you may be able to claim it as a credit against your New Zealand tax payable. The amount of credit you receive may be restricted by any double taxation agreements and is the lesser of the actual amount of tax paid on the overseas income or the amount of tax you would pay in New Zealand on the foreign income. To claim an overseas tax credit you must supply proof of the tax deducted, for example an overseas tax deduction certificate. If you need one, you'll have to request it from the overseas government agency concerned. Attach a copy of the certificate to your return. Also, if you receive a dividend that is not taxed separately under the FIF rules, you can offset most overseas tax credit paid on the dividend against your tax payable. For more information about foreign tax credits read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461 pages 25 to 29. Claiming overseas tax paid on overseas dividends FIF income You can claim the tax paid up to the amount of New Zealand income tax payable on the FIF income associated with the attributing interest that has paid the dividend. If you used the FDR method you can use the overseas tax paid to reduce the tax payable on the FDR income associated with that attributing interest. Note that Australian franking credits and tax on dividends from the United Kingdom cannot be claimed as overseas tax paid. Where there is no FIF income or a FIF loss Tax paid overseas can only be used to cover your liability for income tax payable on your FIF income. If there is no New Zealand income tax payable on your FIF investment, no claim can be made for the overseas tax paid on any dividends received from that FIF. You cannot get a refund of overseas tax paid, or reduce tax payable on any other income. For more information read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Unused overseas tax credits Generally, these are forfeited (lost). Carrying forward any excess or unused overseas tax credits? You can not carry forward unused overseas credits where you have used the FDR, CV, deemed rate of return or cost methods to calculate FIF income or loss. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE22 New Zealand tax credits (imputation or RWT) deducted from overseas dividends You can claim New Zealand tax credits on overseas dividends as follows: • If the credits are RWT, they are used to offset tax payable with any excess refundable. • If they're impu tation credits, they are used to reduce tax payable. If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. • Any excess imputation credit can not be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. The full amount of these New Zealand tax credits can be entered in the return even where the FIF income is reduced to zero or there is an FIF loss. These credits will only be attached to Australian company or unit trust dividends. If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. Temporary tax exemption from foreign income If you are currently claiming the four-year temporary tax (transitional resident) exemption for certain types of foreign-sourced income, you do not need to declare this income in Box 17B, unless it's foreign employment or services income. When your tax exemption expires, you must include all your worldwide income when you complete your income tax return. Go to ird.govt.nz/tte for further information about the temporary tax exemption qualifying criteria and types of exempt foreign-sourced income. Temporary tax exemption from foreign superannuation withdrawals This four-year exemption period is similar to the temporary tax exemption from foreign income and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals during the period. The exemption does not require you to be non-resident for a minimum period. This exemption applies if you: • first acquired your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and • have not previously had this exemption. Foreign superannuation withdrawals during the four-year exemption period do not need to be declared as income in Box 17B. Go to ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/types-of-individual-income/foreign- superannuation for further information about the foreign superannuation temporary exemption or read our guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257. 23 ird.govt.nz Australian dividends from non-FIF companies If you received Australian dividends, your dividend statements may show all or some of the following: • the franke d/unfranked amount • Australian withholding tax • imputed credit or franking credits, or • New Zealand imputation credits. Add up the amounts of Australian withholding tax deducted and print the total in Box 17A. Dividends paid by Australian companies may have a New Zealand imputation credit. To calculate the gross dividend, add together the franked and unfranked amounts, along with the New Zealand imputation credits and print the total in Box 17B. Do not include any Australian imputed or franking credits. Claim New Zealand imputation credits in Box 14. Overseas pensions If you received an overseas social security pension, convert the amount into New Zealand dollars. Print the total in Box 17B. You may also have received other types of overseas pensions, such as foreign private annuities or foreign investment funds. For more information, read the note about foreign rights disclosure on page 56. Under most of the tax treaties New Zealand has with other jurisdictions, you cannot claim a tax credit for tax deducted overseas on pensions. If you paid tax on the pension overseas, generally you need to claim a refund or tax credit from the overseas tax authority, not from Inland Revenue in New Zealand. For more information, read our guides Overseas pensions and annuity schemes - IR257 and Overseas social security pensions - IR258 or go to ird.govt.nz/international/residency/dta/ Specific dividends If you received dividends that are treated as interest or that are from an overseas company through an agent or trustee, who has deducted RWT in New Zealand, show the tax credits and overseas income in Boxes 17A and 17B. Sho w New Zealand RWT deducted in Box 14A. Attach a copy of the dividend statement to your return. Note If you've shown a tax credit and there is no income in the associated panel, you'll need to include a note in your return setting out the details. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE24 Investments in Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) This year all attributed portfolio investment entity (PIE) income received by New Zealand resident individuals will be checked to make sure it has been taxed at the right prescribed investor rate (PIR) for the full year. Because PIE income is taxed differently to your other taxable income, your annual income tax calculation now includes a separate PIE calculation. This is to work out whether you have paid the right amount of tax on your PIE income based on the PIR you should have used. To find out what PIR you should be using, go to ird.govt.nz/pir If you did not use the correct PIR for the full year and the outcome of the calculation is • you did not pa y enough tax, the difference is added to your tax on taxable income in Box 37. • you paid to o much tax, the difference is used to reduce your tax to pay and any remaining credit refunded as part of calculating residual income tax at Box 37A. Page 42 has a worksheet to help you with the PIE calculation. Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) or student loan There are two types of PIE income - locked-in and non-locked-in. Locked-in funds are a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme, such as KiwiSaver, that limits your access to the funds until you reach a specified retirement age. As these funds are not available for your daily living they are not included as income for both WfFTC and student loan purposes. If you can access your funds at any time, the PIE income must be included for both WfFTC and student loan purposes. To do this, you’ll need to complete the Adjust your income - IR215 form and attach it to your Individual tax return - IR3. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/situations Income from overseas residential rental property Income and deductions from overseas residential rental property that is subject to the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007 are recorded in Question 22. However, the amount of tax paid on the overseas rental income is recorded in Question 17. To ensure quick processing of your income tax return, please include a note outlining the breakdown of the overseas rental income and deductions, and the amount of tax paid. 25 ird.govt.nz Question 18 Partnership income Show your share of income from the partnership's trade or business from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 in Box 18B, unless it includes: • interest and any RWT - show this at Question 13 and tick 13C • dividend s and any credits - show this at Question 14 and tick 14C • overseas income and overseas tax paid - show this at Question 17 • resident ial rental income - show this at Question 22 • other rental income - show this at Question 23 • government subsidies – show this at Question 26, or • other income and, if your share of this income: – is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you did not take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (for example you were a sleeping partner), or – is generated from other investment activity (for example sale of shares), show this at Question 27. Partnership income earned as a result of "active" involvement is liable for ACC levies, which will be invoiced by ACC. Losses from limited partnerships If you are claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/partnerships Expenses You may be able to claim expenses against your share of the partnership income that was not claimed in the partnership's IR7 return, for example interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership. Claim these expenses at Question 29. Question 19 Look-through company (LTC) income If you received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 19. Do not include: • interest and any RWT - show this at Question 13 and tick 13C • dividends and any credits - show this at Question 14 and tick 14C • Māori aut hority distributions and credits - show these at Question 15 • any overseas income - show this at Question 17, along with qualifying tax credits attached • resident ial rental income - show this at Question 22 • other rental income - show this at Question 23, or • government subsidies – show this at Question 26. Note The LTC will normally supply information about non-allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE26 The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner's "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. For most LTC owners, you can now claim the full amount of your prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This will not apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. Example Daniel is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2020-21 income year Daniel has a net loss of $7,000.00 from the LTC. Daniel also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Daniel has no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Daniel's tax return should show these amounts in the following boxes: • 19A: $0.00 • 19B: $7,000.00- • 19C: $0.00 • 19D: $5,000.00 • 19E: $12,000.00- What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 19A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 19B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 19C. There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimed this year and print in Box 19D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 19C, add this to Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you have an amount in Box 19D, subtract this from Box 19B and put the total in Box 19E. If you do not have any amounts in Box 19C or Box 19D, copy the amount from Box 19B to 19E. Box 19E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in our guide Look-through companies - IR879. 27 ird.govt.nz Question 20 Shareholder-employee salary If, as a shareholder-employee, you received a salary between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021 with PAYE deducted, include the amounts at Question 11A. If a wage subsidy was received and fully applied to these wages, the wage subsidy amount does not also need to be included at Q26. If the wage subsidy was not fully applied to these wages, the excess wage subsidy (not applied to the salary with tax deducted at source) must be included at Q26. If, as a shareholder-employee, your shareholder-employee's salary or director's fees had no PAYE deducted, include the amount in Box 20. If a wage subsidy was received include that separately at Q26. If you did not receive a shareholder-employee salary but may in the future, tick Box 20A. If you are not a shareholder employee and you received director's fees with no tax deducted, show the income at Question 27. If a wage subsidy was received by the business for your role as director which did not have tax deducted include that separately at Q26. Over-payments of AIM provisional tax that relate to shareholder employee salary accruals are allowed to be used to meet the shareholder's tax liability on that salary at the end of the income year. Include the amount of any AIM tax credits transferred to you at Box 20B. The company that paid your salary or fees will be able to tell you exactly how much to show in your return. Question 20C In-work tax credit (IWTC) is a payment for families who are normally in paid work. From 1 July 2020 the hours are not required to be worked. You can not receive in-work tax credit if you receive an income-tested benefit or student allowance. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/new-to-wff If you are already registered for WfFTC, and now meet the requirements for IWTC you'll need to tick Box 20C of your IR3. If you have not already registered for WfFTC and you qualify, go to our website ird.govt.nz/working-for-families and register online. ACC earners' levy Shareholder-employee remuneration or director's fees without PAYE deducted are liable for ACC earners' levy. The company should deduct earners' levy from your remuneration or director's fees when declared. ACC will invoice the company for this. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE28 Question 22 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • the main hom e • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it's usually only used on working days), or • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at Box 23 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in Box 25B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • other rev enue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 23 and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 25B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income at Box 22A. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • when the rul es apply • how to calculate your income • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deductions rules also apply if you borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and you have interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. 29 ird.govt.nz Completing Question 22 in your return You will use this question to record residential income and deductions that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • Portfolio b asis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • Individual , property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • Combinat ion of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income and/or residential rental deductions, you need to use the same method the LTC uses (portfolio or individual property basis) for the residential properties owned by the LTC. If you are a partner in a partnership and have attributed residential income and/or residential rental deductions, you do not need to use the same method the partnership uses. For LTCs and partnerships, the residential property income and deductions calculations are made at the owner or partner level as they may have other residential income and deductions that need to be included. An LTC or partnership does not need to calculate its net residential income and excess deductions. Instead, the LTC or partnership's residential income and deductions are attributed to the owners or partners, who then calculate their net residential income and any excess deductions and enter those amounts on their IR3 income tax return. An LTC must complete the IR7L form and a partnership must complete the IR7P form to attribute amounts to the owners or partners. You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 22A to 22F using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at Boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the total residential income in Box 22A. This is the total of the following amounts: (a) all rental in come from the portfolio and/or individual property (b) all deprec iation recovery income for assets disposed of from the portfolio or individual property (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in your portfolio or individual property, and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential income at Box 26G on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here. Do not include in Question 22 rental income or losses from properties excluded from the rules. Enter those amounts in Question 23 instead. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 25B. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE30 Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring-fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 22B. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look-through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown at Box 26M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 22B. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 24. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 22C. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 22D. This is the result of Box 22B plus Box 22C minus the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio calculations shown in Box 22F. Include the amount of interest you can claim on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 22D. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 22A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for each property and/or property portfolio calculations in Box 22E. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the results of either: • excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by- property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. The amount in Box 22E should equal Total residential income Box 22A minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 22D. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 22F. NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. 31 ird.govt.nz Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to notify us of the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. For more information read the Rental income - IR264 guide. Question 23 Income from other rental activities Show income you received from other rental activities between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021 at Question 23. Only include net residential rental income or losses not included at Question 22 and commercial rental income in Box 23. This includes rents not caught by the residential rental rules such as rents from: • a bach or holiday home that comes within the mixed-use asset rules • the main home • rental pr operties held on revenue account, such as part of a business dealing in land or building residences, or • a commercial property. Prepare a summary of the details for each rental property. You can use either: • the Rental income - IR3R form, which asks for all the information we need, or • your own summary. If you need an IR3R form, you can print a copy from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides If you prepare your own summary, refer to the IR3R form or the Rental income - IR264 guide to find out what to include. What to show in your return Add up the net rents (total rents after expenses) and write the total in Box 23. Attach the IR3R, or your summary, to your income tax return. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them later. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE32 Question 24 Self-employed income If you received self-employed income between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, show it at Question 24. If you received the wage subsidy, show the total wage subsidy amount received at Question 26 (this amount must be separated from your self-employed income). Schedular payment income Do not show any schedular payment income at Question 24. This income is declared at Question 12. If you are an ACC client or caregiver and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments, read the information on page 59 before you complete Question 12. If you received a wage subsidy from your employer without tax deducted refer to Question 12 and 26, show this amount in Q26. You can claim expenses and deductions against many schedular payments at Question 12C - see page 14. Attribution rules The attribution rule may apply where an individual provides services to an associated person (company, trust, partnership). In particular, it can apply where the associated person sells those services on, principally to a third party. To find out how to apply this rule, please read Interpretation statement 19/02 “Income tax – attribution rule for income from personal services”. Prepare a summary of details You can use any of the following: • your financial records • the Farming income - IR3F form for agricultural businesses • the Business income - IR3B form for other businesses • the Financial statement summary - IR10 form. Tax losses from disposals of residential property (except a loss from a bright-line sale as explained on the following page) are also included under this question. The Financial statement summary - IR10 is a short form of the financial statements of a business. Use an IR10 and speed up processing of the return. We do not need a set of accounts if you use the IR10. You still need to complete a set of financial accounts and keep them in case we ask for them later. For help with completing the IR10, see our IR10 guide. Keep your receipts with your records in case we ask to see them too. Providing childcare services in a home Based on the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 and/or the Licensing Criteria for Home- Based Education and Care Services 2008, Inland Revenue's Determination DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers sets out the types of expenditure generally incurred (standard cost) by individuals providing childcare services in their home. If you are a childcare provider who's registered for GST, this determination does not apply to you. 33 ird.govt.nz Individuals providing childcare services in their homes may use the standard costs (set out in the determination) or their actual costs and income for calculating their tax. If your childcare activities began part-way through the year, calculate your tax from that date using either the standard costs or actual costs. See our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005) for details. If you use the standard cost method and received the wage subsidy refer to ird.govt.nz/covid-19/ business-and-organisations/employing-staff/financial-support/wage-subsidy---issues-for-self-employed for information on how to calculate this including the wage subsidy. Show your childcare income at Question 24 if: • the determination applies to you, and your childcare taxable income is greater than nil, after standard costs have been deducted, or • you keep full records of your childcare income and actual expenses, and you make a taxable profit or loss after expenses have been deducted. If you need help deciding whether you need to declare childcare income using standard costs, contact us. Note You can not offset any loss calculated using standard costs (see the determination) against other income in any income year. Childcare services not under the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 These childcare providers can not use the determination. They must keep full records of actual income and expenses and are liable for tax on their total income after actual expenses are deducted for childcare services provided. At Question 24 show any childcare taxable income or loss after expenses have been deducted. ACC levies Income from self-employment is liable for ACC levies which ACC will invoice you for. Question 25 income from taxable sale/disposals of property Income from the sale of land and/or buildings Include all income from land sales that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Also include taxable sales of the main home or holiday homes taxed under the mixed-use asset rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property (except a loss from a bright-line sale as explained on the following page) are also included under this question. Net income from a bright-line sale other than your main home or a property taxed under the mixed-use assets rules is included under Residential income at Question 22. Profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if you: • are a builder a nd improved a property before selling it • develop ed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • had a chang e of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE34 If you purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period, any profit will be taxable, even if you did not intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to: • propert ies purchased or acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold or disposed of within 2 years, and • properties purchased or acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. Income and losses for property captured by the bright-line test are treated differently in the tax return: • After a bright-line sale, when net income (a profit) is made, the profit is included in the residential rental income Box (22A). However, this does not apply to disposals of your main home or a property taxed under the mixed-use assets rules. Unless the property is included in a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal, • After a bright-line sale, when a net loss is made, any excess deductions must be carried forward to a later income year when they can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, or future disposals captured by the bright-line rules. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. Show the total profit from other property in Box 25B. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Property sale information - IR833 form for each property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial Statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test and made a loss, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other residential property sales. For more information on property sales, refer to our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Question 25A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit If you are an "offshore RLWT person" and have sold or transferred residential property located in New Zealand, RLWT may have been deducted from the sale price. You should have received a statement on the completion of the sale process showing the amount of RLWT deducted. You can claim a credit for any RLWT deducted. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. If there was more than 1 amount of RLWT deducted, show the combined amount, less any RLWT paid back to you and/or transferred to outstanding amounts during the income year. Attach a note showing the name of your withholder(s) to the return. 35 ird.govt.nz Question 26 Government subsidy The government subsidy box is used to report the TOTAL Covid-19 wage subsidy, wage subsidy extension, wage subsidy resurgence and wage subsidy March 2021 payments received by an individual where tax was not deducted at source and passed on to Inland Revenue e.g. received by the employer and passed on as salary/wages with normal PAYE etc deductions. The resurgence support payment (RSP) is not subject to income tax and therefore does not need to be included in this box as income. Where the RSP has been received you need to reduce your expenditure claims to the extent of the total RSP’s you received. If your employer received the wage subsidy on your behalf and continued to pay your salary/wages or contractor payments, and these have been reported in the gross earnings or schedular payments fields, you are not required to include the amounts in this box. If you received any wage subsidy payment that has not been dealt with via payroll as noted above, for example customers that received the wage subsidy payments due to loss of self-employed income, shareholder salary or partnership/LTC income; you will need to report it in this box. Full details, including various scenarios that apply to wage subsidy receipts and what amount to report can be found at ird.govt.nz/covid-19/business-and-organisations/employing-staff/financial-support/ wage-subsidy-issues-for-self-employed Question 27 Other income If you received any other income between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, show it at Question 27. This may include: • the sale of n on-FIF shares or other property • financial arrangements • cash jobs , payments made 'under the table', tips, bartering or income from an illegal enterprise • any share o f partnership income as a result of capital investment • free or discounted shares received under an employee share scheme if your employer has not provided us with this information. If you are not sure if your income is taxable, contact us. Income from the sale of non-FIF shares or other property The profits are taxable if you bought: • and sold shares or other property as a business • shares or other property for the purpose of resale, or • shares or property to make a profit. This does not apply to shares that are FIFs. Write the total profit in Box 27. Attach the details of your income and expenses from these sales to your return. Sale or disposal of assets If you sold or disposed of a depreciated asset for more than its adjusted tax value, contact us or refer to our Depreciation - IR260, General depreciation rates - IR265 or Historic depreciation rates - IR267 guides. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE36 Losses from the sale of shares or other property If you made a loss and can show that if you'd made a profit, it would have been taxable, you may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Financial arrangements If you are a party to a financial arrangement, you must account for income from those arrangements on an accrual basis. Financial arrangements include government stock, futures contracts and deferred property settlements, excluding short-term agreements for sale and purchase of property. A cash-basis person does not need to use the accrual method to calculate income. You qualify as a cash-basis person if: • on every day in the income year the absolute value of all financial arrangements added together is $1,000,000 or less • the absolute value of your income and expenditure in the income year under all financial arrangements is $100,000 or less, and • the deferral of income or acceleration of expenditure using the cash method rather than the accrual method is $40,000 or less. If you held the financial arrangement prior to 20 May 1999 the amounts above may be reduced to $600,000, $70,000 and $20,000 respectively. Note the "absolute value" is the value of an amount whether it's positive or negative. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading method applies, you must do a "wash-up" calculation in certain circumstances. For example: • a financial arrangement matures, is sold, remitted or transferred • there is an absolute assignment of the financial arrangement • a party to a fin ancial arrangement is released from making all remaining payments under the Insolvency Act 1967, the Companies Act 1993 or the laws of a country or territory other than New Zealand, or • you cease t o be a resident of New Zealan d. The calculation ensures that the total gains or losses from the financial arrangement are brought to account. This applies in every case - you do not have to be in the business of buying or selling financial arrangements, or have bought them for the purpose of resale, as you would with shares. When calculating the income or expenditure on sale, use our Sale or disposal of financial arrangements - IR3K form. Income from cash jobs, tips, "under the table" payments, bartering or an illegal enterprise If you received any other type of income that did not have tax deducted from it, show it in Box 27. Attach the details of your income and any expenses to your return. 37 ird.govt.nz Share of partnership income as a result of capital investment If your share of partnership income is received in recognition of your capital investment in the partnership and you did not take any active part in the day-to-day operation or management of the business (for example, you were a sleeping partner), show your share of partnership income in Box 27. Question 29 Other expenses and deductions If you paid any of these expenses, between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021, you can claim them in Box 29. • a fee to someone for completing your tax return • commissio n on interest or dividend income (but not bank fees - they're a private expense) • additional expenses incurred in earning partnership income, for example interest on capital borrowed to purchase a share in the partnership • interest on money you borrowed to buy shares or to invest - as long as the investment will produce some taxable income • premiums on l oss of earnings insurance (income protection), provided the benefit from the insurance policy is taxable, or • interest paid to Inland Revenue for late payment of tax, only if the interest is not already included as a deduction in your accounts. ACC personal service rehabilitation payments If you are an ACC client and received ACC personal service rehabilitation payments and have retained some of these, you may claim the payments you've made to your caregiver as a deduction at Question 12C. Read the information on page 59 before you complete Question 12C. Schedular income expenses If you incurred expenses while earning income that's had tax from schedular payments deducted, you claim these at Question 12C, not here. Other expenses For other expenses, attach the details to your return. Include your name and IRD number. You cannot claim expenses against income from: • salary an d/or wages • election d ay services • casual agricultural work, or • commissions, if you are also paid a salary or retainer from the same employer. You can still claim expenses for having your tax return completed for you and loss of earnings insurance premiums from these income sources. Note If you are GST-registered you must deduct any GST included in any expenses. GST-registered people claim the GST portion of their expenses in their GST return, not the IR3. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE38 ACC levies ACC will take into account all expenses shown in Box 29 when calculating any ACC levies due. Question 31 Net losses brought forward You can find the amount of net loss you have to bring forward on the loss carried forward letter we sent you after your 2020 return acknowledgement or notice of assessment. Add up all net losses to be brought forward to 2021 and print the total in Box 31A. Print the amount you can claim this year in Box 31B. Go to Question 33 for loss carry back. Question 33 Loss carry back Enter the amount of any 2021 loss to carry back to 2020 in Box 33. You’ll need to amend your 2020 income tax return to include the amount of loss you carry back if you have not already. In your myIR income tax account, select the 2020 income tax period. Go to I want to...> File or amend return. Choose the amendment reason ‘Loss carry back’. Select the income type ‘You are claiming net loss brought forward’ and enter the amount in ‘Net losses claimed this year’. 39 ird.govt.nz Your tax credits Tax credits can reduce the tax you have to pay on your income. Other tax credits Donation tax credits are claimed separately on a Tax credit claim form - IR526 or you can submit a receipt for donations in myIR. Go to ird.govt.nz/donations for more information. Question 34 Independent earner tax credit (IETC) You can calculate your IETC: • by using the worksheets provided in this section, or • by calling our self-service line - see page 65. IETC The IETC is a tax credit for individuals whose annual net income\* is between $24,000 and $48,000. Your annual net income is shown at Box 30 "Income after expenses" in your return. If you are eligible for IETC, but earn over $44,000, your annual entitlement to IETC decreases by 13 cents for every dollar earned above $44,000. For the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, you'll be entitled to IETC for any months: • you were a New Zealand tax resident • you or your partner were not entitled to Working for Families Tax Credits (or received an overseas equivalent) and you did not receive: – an income-tested benefit – NZ Super – a veteran's pension, or – an overseas equivalent of any of the above. You are a tax resident if you lived in New Zealan d for more than 183 days in the last 12 months or have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. For more information, read our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292. To work out the months you are entitled to this tax credit, use the total number of whole months the criteria applied to. If you did not meet the above criteria for even 1 day of any month you will not be entitled to IETC at all for that month, so do not include it in your calculation. \* Net income means your total income from all sources, less any allowable deductions or current year losses (not including any losses brought forward). IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE40 Calculating your IETC Enter the start and end dates when you had any overseas income that excludes you from being eligible for IETC at Box 34B on your return.

If you closed your PIE investment during the year If you exit certain PIEs (Quarterly PIE) part-way through a quarter, they may calculate your PIE tax liability at the end of that quarter using a zero rate of tax, or they may voluntarily pay the tax using your PIR. Your investor statement will show the income you earned up to the end of the quarter and any tax credits. Any remaining balance you have at the end of the quarter is also treated as a tax credit. If you have any credits, include them in Box 2 in the worksheet below. If you had a PIE loss the PIE would have claimed a tax refund for you, so show this as a negative in Box 2. If you have both tax credits and negative amounts, reduce the negative by the amount of any additional tax credits. PIE worksheet Copy the Total PIE deductions and Total PIE Income/Loss from your Summary of Income, details in myIR or your investor statements to boxes 36A and 36B of your return.

If you received dividends from a New Zealand company that gave you imputation credits or an Australian company that gave you New Zealand imputation credits, you may have excess imputation credits to carry forward. This will only happen if your total imputation credits (including any excess imputation credits brought forward from 2020) are greater than your total tax payable. Use the worksheet below to work out the excess imputation credits that must be carried forward to your 2022 tax return. We'll send you a letter confirming the amount. Worksheet Copy your total imputation credits from Box 9 of your tax calculation on page 46 in this guide to Box 1. 1 Copy your total tax payable from Box 6 of your tax calculation on page 46 in this guide to Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer in Box 3. 3 This is your excess imputation credits amount to carry forward to 2022. Student loan We'll work out how much of your student loan you need to repay, based on your income. If you have an end-of-year repayment obligation we'll send you a notice showing how much is due. If you want to calculate the amount yourself, either use the worksheet provided here or go to ird.govt.nz/calculators and use our student loan repayment calculator. Interest-free student loan If you've lived in New Zealand for 6 months (183 days) or more, your student loan is interest-free. Even if you have not been in New Zealand for six months, you may qualify for an interest-free student loan if you meet the criteria for an exemption. Go to our website ird.govt.nz/sl-interest-free for more details. End of year repayment obligation Repayment deductions from salary or wages are generally considered your final obligation on that income and do not form part of your end-of-year repayment obligation. Income from casual agricultural work and election day work does not have student loan deductions. This income is excluded as salary and wage income and becomes part of adjusted net income. If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, any income or deductions are excluded in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, you can offset a loss from 1 business or investment activity against other like income. For example, Rory has an overall loss from his landscaping business of $7,500. He has also made a profit from his lawnmowing service of $50,000. The activities are carried out in association with each other, so Rory can claim the $7,500 loss against the $50,000 profit. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE48 Income adjustments are now required to be part of your adjusted net income. For a full list of the adjustments required go to ird.govt.nz/adjust-income You'll only have an end-of-year repayment obligation if you: • have adjus ted net income of $500 or more with a total income (including salary or wages) of $20,520 (annual repayment threshold plus $500) or more, or • had an interim assessment for the year. Note Adjusted net income is your annual gross income, excluding salary or wages and less annual total deductions you may claim. If you have a loss from an investment or business activity, neither the income or the deductions from that activity are included in calculating your adjusted net income. If you have separate business or investment activities which are normally carried out in association with each other, a loss from 1 business or investment activity can be offset against other like income. Annual total deductions are the expenses and deductions you can claim for the tax year. Note If you are required to complete an Adjust your income - IR215 form, you cannot use this worksheet to calculate your 2021 repayment obligation. Once we have received your IR3 and your IR215 we will send you your end-of-year repayment obligation for 2021. 49 ird.govt.nz Use this worksheet to calculate your 2021 repayment. Annual repayment threshold. 1 20,020 00 Copy any gross salary or wage income (excluding casual agricultural or election day income) from Box 11B of your return to Box 2. 2 If Box 2 is more than Box 1 print $0.00 in Box 3, otherwise subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the result in Box 3. 3 This is your unused repayment threshold you can use against your other income. Enter your income after expenses from Box 30 of your return (excluding any losses), less any salary and wage income from Box 2 in Box 4. 4 Subtract Box 3 from Box 4. If the result is less than $500.00 print $0.00 in Box 5. Otherwise, print the result in Box 5 (this is your total liable income). 5 Multiply the amount in Box 5 by 0.12 (12%). 6 This is your end-of-year payment obligation for the 2021 tax year. Print any 2021 voluntary repayments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6A. 6A Print any 2021 interim payments made to Inland Revenue in Box 6B. 6B Add Boxes 6A and 6B together and print the result in Box 7. 7 Subtract Box 7 from Box 6 and print your answer in Box 8. 8 If Box 7 is less than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year loan repayment. (Tick one) Loan repayment If Box 7 is larger than Box 6, the difference is your end-of-year overpayment. Overpayment IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE50 Question 38 Early payment discount An early payment discount is available for people who: • are either self-employed or a partner in a partnership • are new in business • derive income mainly from the business • have no obligation to pay provisional tax in their current tax year • made payments within the corresponding income year up to their balance date, for example a standard balance date taxpayer, who has made a payment or payments on or before 31 March 2021 as income tax for the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 • elect by 31 March of the following year, for example a taxpayer electing for the year ending 31 March 2021, must elect on or before 31 March 2022. The discount is calculated at the rate of 6.7% of either: • the amount p aid during the year, or • 105% of your end-of-year residual income tax liability, whichever is the lesser, and is credited against your end-of-year tax bill. To check if you qualify, work through the flowchart on the following page. 51 ird.govt.nz Do you qualify for an early payment discount?

Assessable income includes undeclared business income you may have earned (for example cash jobs). Year - as referred to in the diagram below, year means the standard tax year from 1 April to 31 March, unless you have an approved different balance date, in which case your income year will end then. If you have any questions about your entitlement to the discount, please contact us. No Ye s No No No Are you self-employed or in a partnership and you do not use a company or trust to run your business and most of your income is from your business - not interest, dividends, rents or benefits?

If you've made payments towards your 2022 provisional tax and, after completing this return, you find that you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the over payment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Direct credit If you choose direct credit you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund over $1.00 direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct bank account number is printed at Question 8 on the front page of your return. Transfers If you'd like your refund transferred to another account or to arrears being paid off through an instalment arrangement, you'll need to tell us the date you'd like it transferred. The date you can choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Requesting transfers on your return You can ask us to transfer a refund to another account by filling out the boxes on page 5 of your return. If you ask for a transfer on your return, we will transfer your refund at 1 of the following dates: Transfer to your own account or an account of someone associated to you, the later of: • the day aft er your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March), or • the due date in t he destination account. Transfer to an account of someone not associated to you: • the day after your return was completed. If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we will transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. If you'd like the credit transferred at a different date, you can contact us and ask for the transfer date to be changed (including if we've transferred your credit to cover a debt). 53 ird.govt.nz Associated taxpayers The following are associated taxpayers for the purposes of transferring overpaid tax: • a company yo u are a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership • a relative (for example child, parent) • spouse or partner, or • a trustee of a family trust you are a beneficiary of. Transfers requiring a separate note attached to the return Situations such as requesting a transfer at a future date, transfer to arrears being paid off by an instalment arrangement and transfers at a different date will require you to attach a separate note to your return advising the following specific details. • The amount you want transferred. • The account you want it transferred to, for example name, IRD number, tax type and period end date (and if it's another person, whether they're associated). • The date yo u'd like the credit transferred. • If it is to be tr ansferred to debt covered by an instalment arrangement. Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling funds transferred in. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE54 Provisional tax Question 40 Provisional tax Provisional tax is generally payable because you earned income during the year that either: • was not taxed, or • was taxed a t the wrong rate. It's usually payable in 3 instalments during the year (28 August 2021, 15 January 2022, 7 May 2022), unless: • you have a non-standard balance date • you pay GST on a six-monthly basis, or • you use the GS T ratio method to calculate provisional tax. If your 2021 residual income tax (RIT) (Box 37A of your return) is more than $5,000, you'll become a provisional tax payer and will be liable to pay 2022 provisional tax. For more information read our guides Provisional tax - IR289 or Penalties and interest - IR240. Initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. You will have an initial provisional tax liability if: • you begin to derive income from a taxable activity during the tax year • your RIT in any of the four preceding tax years did not exceed $5,000 ($2,500 for the 2019-20 and earlier years), and • your RIT for the current year is $60,000 or more. If this applies to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. The date you cease employment determines when interest will be charged from. You are not liable to pay provisional tax in the year you have an initial provisional tax liability. You may make voluntary payments to reduce your interest liability. Interest rules if you have an initial provisional tax liability Special rules apply to when interest may be charged for an initial provisional tax liability. If this applies to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Payment options You have three options for paying provisional tax - the standard option "S", the estimation option "E" or the ratio option "R". Standard option Under this option, your 2022 provisional tax is the same as your 2021 RIT (if it is more than $5,000) plus 5%. Copy this amount to Box 40B of your return and print "S" in Box 40A. Divide the amount by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment - record this on page 58. If you are filing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. 55 ird.govt.nz Note If you think your income for 2022 will be more than your 2021 income, you can make voluntary payments over and above the amount you have to pay under the standard option. Use this worksheet to calculate your 2022 provisional tax using the standard option "S" Copy your RIT from Box 37A of your return to Box 1. 1 Multiply Box 1 by 0.05 (5%). Print your answer in Box 2. 2 Add Box 1 and Box 2. Print your answer in Box 3. Box 3 is your 2022 provisional tax. 3 00 Copy this amount to Box 40B of your return and print "S" in Box 40A. Divide the amount in Box 3 by 3 to get the amount you must pay for each instalment. Record this on page 58. If you are completing your return after 28 August, your instalment amounts may be different. Estimation option Anyone can estimate provisional tax. If you expect your 2022 RIT to be lower than your 2021 RIT, estimating will keep you from paying more than you have to. If you choose to estimate, your estimate must be fair and reasonable at the time you make it and at each instalment date. You can be charged a penalty and/or interest if you do not take reasonable care when you estimate your provisional tax. Use this worksheet to calculate your 2022 provisional tax using the estimation option "E" Print your estimated 2022 taxable income in Box 1. 1 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 1.

More information If you have any questions about your tax go to ird.govt.nz Accident Compensation Act 2001 (ACC) Under the Accident Compensation Act 2001, Inland Revenue is required to provide earnings information from your IR 3 return to the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). ACC will begin invoicing self-employed levies from August. ACC gets the information from IR3 returns as follows: • Question 11A Gross earnings with PAYE deducted and earnings not liable for ACC earners' levy • Question 12 Schedular payments • Question 17 O verseas income • Questio n 18 Share of partnership income ("active" income) from the partnership's trade or business • Questio n 19 Look-through company (LTC) active income • Questio n 20 Shareholder-employee salary with no tax deducted • Questio n 24 Self-employed income • Questio n 26 Other income • Question 29 Other expenses. IR 3 INDIVIDUAL RETURN GUIDE64 Shareholder-employees Other income In addition to your shareholder's remuneration, you may also have received other income liable for ACC levies, such as self-employed income. ACC will take your shareholder-employee remuneration into account if invoicing for additional levies. Maximum earnings from multiple companies The maximum amount of ACC earners' levy deductions is $1,819.66. You may be due for a refund from ACC if your shareholder-employee remuneration is from 2 or more companies and the combined total is over $130,911. Please call ACC on 0508 426 837 to find out more about the refund process. Mixed income Mixed income earners are those who have a combination of employee (including shareholder-employee remuneration without PAYE deducted) and self-employed earnings. If you are in this situation you have to pay ACC levies on both sources of income, up to the maximum. ACC will invoice you for the amount you'll have to pay. Current year losses If you were in full-time employment and have recorded a loss, or your earnings are below the minimum earnings threshold, you are still liable for ACC levies. These will be calculated at the minimum level. IR56 taxpayers If you are a private domestic worker, you've already paid ACC earners' levy on your IR56 income as part of your PAYE. ACC will invoice you as an employer for other levies payable on your IR56 income. If you also receive other income liable for ACC levies, we'll pass this information to ACC to invoice levies on this income. ACC will make allowance for levies paid as an employer.
