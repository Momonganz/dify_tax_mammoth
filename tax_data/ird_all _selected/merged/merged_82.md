Fact sheet: GST on low-value imported goods Summary of proposals in the discussion document From 1 October 2019:  Offshore suppliers would be required to register, collect, and return New Zealand GST on goods valued at or below $400 supplied to New Zealand consumers.  The rules would apply when the good is outside New Zealand at the time of supply and is delivered to a New Zealand address.  Offshore suppliers would be required to register when their total supplies of goods and services to New Zealand exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. In certain circumstances, marketplaces and re-deliverers may also be required to register.  Tariffs and border cost recovery charges would be removed from goods valued at or below $400.  The current processes for collecting GST and other duty at the border by Customs will continue to apply for goods valued over $400.  The current border processes for managing risks in relation to imported goods, including biosecurity assessment, will remain in place.

Media Statement

### GST loophole closed to offshore companies

The Government is to close a loophole that gives offshore companies an advantage by not requiring them to collect GST on all goods sold to local consumers.

“Domestic businesses have long called for greater fairness in the treatment of low-value goods from offshore retailers,” says Revenue and Small Business Minister Stuart Nash. “Foreign companies are not required to collect GST on goods under $400. We are now calling for feedback on a system to register these suppliers for GST.”

“There are more than 26,000 small businesses employing more than 62,000 people in the retail sector. Many are in competition with foreign firms who enjoy this tax break. Local firms compete on an uneven playing field. Large multinationals sell exactly the same product into our market without collecting GST.

“Small businesses such as bookshops have convincingly argued they are penalised by a system which is badly out of date. It’s particularly difficult for very small shops outside the main centres. Some Kiwi firms are doubly disadvantaged, as online retailers who sell into Australia will soon pay GST to the Australian Tax Office,” Mr Nash says.

“GST has always been payable on low-value goods but it is not cost effective for Customs to collect it when it is $60 or less,” says Customs Minister Meka Whaitiri.

“GST is collected at the border for goods over $400. We propose making offshore suppliers collect GST on low value goods at the moment of sale, and in turn, buyers of these goods will no longer pay Customs tariffs or border security and biosecurity fees. This will simplify compliance and administration costs at the border. This supports the focus of Customs to make cross-border transactions easier without compromising the need to keep out illicit substances and materials,” says Ms Whaitiri.

“GST has been collected on services and digital products from offshore, such as streamed movies and music, since 2016. This extends that to goods,” says Mr Nash.

“I acknowledge the work of the previous Government which agreed to a GST Discussion Document in July 2017. It forms the basis of the document released today. The former Revenue Minister Judith Collins got the ball rolling on this and it is a pleasure to complete her work. This is an example of an issue with cross party support.

“I also thank the Tax Working Group for its advice to proceed with the proposal. It is consistent with our GST framework, which is broad-based, low-rate, and applies to goods and services traded across borders and consumed here,” Mr Nash says.

Submissions on the proposals are due by 29 June 2018. The discussion document can be found at: taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

### Questions and Answers

#### 1\. What do other countries do?

Australia will have an offshore supplier registration model for collecting GST on low-value imported goods from 1 July 2018. Switzerland will also introduce an offshore supplier registration system for the collection of VAT on low-value goods from 1 January 2019. The EU has announced plans to implement a system akin to an offshore supplier registration model for the collection of VAT by 2021. Other countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada also have a _de minimis_ that is significantly lower than New Zealand’s _de minimis_ – the threshold at which revenue is collected.

#### 2\. Why is this a priority?

It is a question of fairness. Smaller retailers, especially those who operate outside large shopping centres, struggle against foreign competitors who enjoy a tax advantage. New Zealand’s GST is a broad-based consumption tax with few exemptions. It is based on the principle that goods and services are subject to GST when they are consumed in New Zealand. All domestic retailers have GST added to the price tag of their goods. The proposed measures will help to restore balance.

#### 3\. How much revenue is the proposal expected to collect?

The changes would take effect from 1 October 2019. Revenue officials conservatively estimate that $53 million would be collected in 2019/20, increasing to $78 million in 2020/21 and $87 million in 2021/22.

#### 4\. How will the proposed changes affect consumers?

GST will be charged at the point of sale when the value of the goods is $400 or less. In some cases consumers will pay more for their goods but in some cases goods will be cheaper because of the removal of Customs tariffs, border security fees and biosecurity cost recovery charges. There is no change to the tax treatment of goods valued above $400, where the current process for collecting GST and tariff duty at the border will continue.

#### 5\. Would all offshore businesses selling online to NZ be required to register for GST?

Offshore retailers would be required to register and collect GST if their total sales to New Zealand consumers exceed NZ$60,000 per annum. This is the same threshold that applies to domestic businesses and to offshore suppliers of cross-border services.

#### 6\. How much GST was collected from offshore sellers of services after the law changed on 1 October 2016?

Over 200 offshore suppliers registered for GST under the new rules on services. They have returned more than $162 million to New Zealand since 1 October 2016, well above initial estimates of $40 million per annum.

#### Summary of proposals in the discussion document

From 1 October 2019:

*   Offshore suppliers would be required to register, collect, and return New Zealand GST on goods valued at or below $400 supplied to New Zealand consumers.
*   The rules would apply when the good is outside New Zealand at the time of supply and is delivered to a New Zealand address.
*   Offshore suppliers would be required to register when their total supplies of goods and services to New Zealand exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. In certain circumstances, marketplaces and re-deliverers may also be required to register.
*   Tariffs and border cost recovery charges would be removed from goods valued at or below $400.
*   The current processes for collecting GST and other duty at the border by Customs will continue to apply for goods valued over $400.
*   The current border processes for managing risks in relation to imported goods, including biosecurity assessment, will remain in place.

The following table sets out what the changes would generally mean for different parties:

| Buyers & sellers | Imported goods valued at or below $400 | Imported goods valued above $400 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NZ consumer | GST charged on the purchase at the point of sale. | GST collected on purchase at the border by Customs. |
| NZ GST-registered business | No GST charged on the purchase | GST collected on purchase at the border by Customs. Any GST incurred can be claimed back. |
| Offshore suppliers, online marketplaces and re-deliverers that reach the registration threshold | GST should be charged, collected and remitted to IRD on sales to NZ consumers.  <br>GST should not be charged on supplies made to GST-registered businesses. | GST should not be charged by the supplier. Customs would collect GST as the goods cross the border. |

Note: this table reflects only how the proposed rules would work in the majority of cases. Actual results may differ in some instances. Chapter 3 of the Discussion Document has a more thorough explanation of the scope of the proposals. For example, it addresses what would happen if an offshore supplier returns GST on a consignment that Customs assesses as having a value greater than $400, or if a GST-registered business is incorrectly charged GST by the supplier.

#### Impact on consumers - examples

The proposed changes would not necessarily mean that all online purchases of goods by consumers will become more expensive.

Under the proposals, if a consumer imports goods valued at or below $400 the offshore supplier would add GST to price of the online purchase. Goods valued below $400 which do not currently have GST, duties and cost-recovery charges collected at the border would be more expensive under the proposal.

However, goods valued at or below $400 which do currently have GST, duties and cost-recovery charges collected at the border would be cheaper under the proposal.[\[1\]](#footnote1)
 This is because consumers would no longer pay tariff duty and cost recovery charges on these goods.

| Purchase | Current treatment | Proposed treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $50 t-shirt | Total cost of parcel: **$50**  <br>No current charges at the border | Total cost of parcel: **$57.50**  <br>$50 t-shirt + $7.50 GST |
| $300 jacket | Total cost of parcel: **$428.74**  <br>$300 jacket + $30 tariff (10% x $300) + $49.50 GST (15% x $330) + $49.24 border processing fee | Total cost of parcel: **$345**  <br>$300 jacket + $45 GST. |

#### Proposed registration requirements for offshore suppliers

Offshore suppliers would be required to register and return GST if their total supplies in a 12-month period to New Zealand consumers exceed $60,000. This is the same threshold that applies to domestic businesses and to offshore suppliers of cross-border services. Offshore suppliers would not be required to collect GST on goods supplied to GST-registered businesses.

The proposal includes special rules for online marketplaces and “re-deliverers”:

*   In situations where an offshore supplier sells their goods through a marketplace, the marketplace is required to register and return the GST on the good instead of the supplier.
*   Re-deliverers are used by consumers when the supplier or marketplace does not offer shipping to New Zealand. The good is instead shipped to an overseas “hub” or mailbox, which then ships the good to New Zealand. Under the proposals, re-deliverers would be required to register and return GST in respect of goods that they “re-deliver” to a New Zealand address.

The $60,000 GST registration threshold would also apply to marketplaces and re-deliverers.

Dear Ministers

**GST on low-value imported goods**

I am writing to you to provide the Tax Working Group’s (the Group’s) recommendations for collecting Goods and Services Tax (GST) on low-value goods imported into New Zealand.

You previously wrote asking the Group to consider this issue. In your letter you noted that the Government is minded to proceed with this work, and would welcome early advice on the merits of reform options, ahead of the production of the Group’s Interim Report in September.

The Group has now considered this issue and agrees that in principle GST should be collected on low-value imported goods. Collecting GST on low-value imported goods is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base low-rate GST framework. It is also consistent with New Zealand’s destination principle, which provides that GST should apply to goods and services that are traded across borders when they are consumed in New Zealand.

As a result, there is no in-principle reason why GST should not be collected on imported goods consumed in New Zealand just as it is collected on domestically sold goods consumed in New Zealand. The current non-collection of GST results in a competitive disadvantage and unfairness for New Zealand retailers and results in an increasing amount of GST revenue foregone for the Government.

The non-collection of GST is an increasing problem which the Group considers should be addressed quickly. The key question is how to collect GST on low-value imported goods in the current environment in a low-cost and effective way.

The Group has considered three options:

*   _Offshore supplier registration:_ Offshore suppliers would be required to return GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers if their total supplies to New Zealand exceed the GST registration threshold.
*   _Between the point of sale and delivery:_ Freight couriers and New Zealand Post would collect revenue on low-value imported goods they deliver.
*   _Pay after delivery:_ Consumers would pay the GST on low-value imported goods after they have been delivered to them.

In the short term, of these three options, the Group prefers the option of an offshore supplier registration system. The Group considers that this option would provide a cost-effective way of collecting GST that would also provide price certainty and low compliance costs for consumers. The Group considers that currently there are practical concerns with options to collect between the point of sale and delivery and after delivery that mean they may not be feasible in the short term.

The two concerns with an offshore supplier registration system are potential non-compliance with the rules by offshore suppliers and the potential for not returning the revenue collected. Officials have advised us of the recent success of the application of this model for cross-border services and intangibles and so this provides an encouraging sign in this regard.

For this option to be successful, the Group considers that further consultation on the detail and implementation of an offshore-supplier registration model is essential. Further consultation is needed to ensure that this model is effective.

The Group has concerns that an offshore supplier registration model would mean that GST would continue to not be collected on imported low-value goods provided by unregistered sellers. For this reason the Group would not support an increase in the threshold for collection of GST by Customs which is generally $400.

We note that the $400 threshold is equivalent to the current _de minimis_ for goods that are not subject to tariffs. However, for goods that are subject to tariffs the $400 threshold would be a rise in the _de minimis_ of up to $174. Officials have advised that setting the _de minimis_ based on the value of the good is necessary to minimise compliance and administration costs for an offshore supplier registration system.

On the basis of this advice the Group accepts that the small rise in the threshold for goods sold by unregistered suppliers is broadly acceptable given the plan for offshore supplier registration is to include marketplaces and parcel forwarders. This will narrow the scale of non-registration.

Officials have advised that the impact of raising the _de minimis_ will result in a small reduction in tariff revenue and Ministry for Primary Industries and Customs funding for border and biosecurity risk management. However, in their view the benefits of having a simpler threshold through reduced compliance and administration costs will outweigh the costs.

In addition, the Group recommends that the Government continue to review the options to collect GST between the point of sale and delivery and after delivery following implementation of an offshore supplier registration model. This continued review should consider whether the feasibility issues with these options can be overcome as technology and data sharing improvements occur.

As a result the Group recommends the following:

a) The Government should implement an offshore supplier registration model to collect GST on imported goods from suppliers who exceed the GST registration threshold.

b) The _de minimis_ for collection of GST by Customs should be changed to a $400 threshold based on the good’s value but should not be increased beyond that point.

c) The Government should consult on the proposed offshore supplier registration model to ensure it is effective.

d) Options for collecting GST between the point of sale and delivery and for payment of GST after delivery should continue to be reviewed to see if the practical issues with them can be overcome and become an effective means of collecting GST on low-value goods, in particular from unregistered suppliers.

Yours sincerely

### Cracking down on tax dodgers and restoring fairness

New initiatives to make the tax system fairer and a crackdown on tax dodgers are expected to provide the Government with an extra $726.3 million of revenue over the next four years, says Revenue Minister Stuart Nash.

“The Coalition Government is committed to being fiscally responsible. Creating more fairness in the tax system is a critical part of this,” says Stuart Nash.

“Extra revenue from cracking down on those dodging their tax obligations, while levelling the playing field, will help the Government address significant under-resourcing of critical public services. We are reducing distortions in the tax system and ensuring everyone pays the right amount of tax.”

“Budget 2018 gives Inland Revenue $31.3 million of operating spending over the next four years, including $23.5 million to ensure outstanding company tax returns are filed. This is expected to recover approximately $183.3 million.

“It also includes $3.0 million of operating funding over the next four years to analyse the potential to improve tax compliance in specific industries through the use of third-party reporting and withholding taxes.

“Recently announced initiatives to reduce distortion in the tax system and boost productivity will also provide more revenue. Ring-fencing rental losses will mean speculators and investors can no longer offset tax losses from residential properties against other income to reduce their tax liabilities.

“This is expected to boost revenue by at least $325 million over four years and further dampen property speculation, while encouraging investment in the productive economy.

“Meanwhile, offshore suppliers of low-value goods will be required to register for, collect and return goods and services tax (GST) just like New Zealand retailers have to. This is estimated to provide $218 million in new revenue over the next four years, and is expected to increase each year as online shopping continues to grow.

“This Government’s plan includes adequately funding health, education and housing, increasing police numbers, and lifting more children out of poverty. We are not changing tax rates. But we do need a tax system that is simple, balanced and fair – where people and businesses comply with their obligations, and where those in similar circumstances pay the same amount.

“Our Tax Working Group is also tasked with making recommendations for a fairer and more balanced tax system. It will report back in early 2019 and no significant changes recommended in the Group’s final report will come into force until after the 2020 election,” says Stuart Nash.

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
Deputy Prime Minister  
Minister for Racing

17 May 2018

Media statement

### Bloodstock tax rules to change

Minister for Racing Winston Peters today announced changes to bloodstock tax rules for the New Zealand racing industry as part of Budget 2018.

“Racing is a significant industry in New Zealand and this measure will provide economic stimulus to many parts of the country. The change will encourage new investment in the breeding industry to make it more financially attractive and increase the quality of this country’s racing stock,” says Winston Peters.

“The Budget allows $4.8 million over the next four years for tax deductions that can be claimed for the costs of high-quality horses acquired with the intention to breed.

“The previous rules around tax write-downs did not serve their original purpose of promoting new investment, as they favoured established breeding businesses rather than attracting new entrants.

“These changes mean that a new investor in the breeding industry will be able to claim tax deductions for the costs of a horse as if they had an existing breeding business. To qualify, the horse must be a standout yearling.

“Quality breeding is the life blood of the thoroughbred racing code. It also helps sustain an iconic New Zealand industry and ensures New Zealand horses can compete with the best in the world.

“I expect the new rules will apply to yearlings acquired from next year’s premier bloodstock sales,” says Winston Peters.

Bill introduced to modernise and simplify New Zealand’s tax system
==================================================================

The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced in Parliament yesterday.

The Bill proposes measures to simplify tax returns for individuals and update the Tax Administration Act. It also adds 13 charities to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 of the Tax Administration Act, proposes amendments to make KiwiSaver more accessible, and includes numerous other policy, remedial and technical changes to tax legislation.

### Tax simplified for individual taxpayers

A new tax bill introduced to Parliament will mean automatic tax refunds for around 750,000 New Zealanders.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill will simplify tax obligations for individuals who only earn employment or investment income. It will remove the need for them to file a personal tax summary (PTS) to get a tax refund.

“Filing a PTS is currently the only way for individuals to get a refund, but around 750,000 people don’t follow this process. They are missing out on their money as a result. We want people to get their refunds automatically”, Mr Nash says.

“The only reason to file a PTS in the future will be if a taxpayer has additional information they need to provide. If this is not the case, Inland Revenue will automatically work out the amount of the refund or the tax to pay.

“The legislation also amends the Tax Administration Act to clarify how Inland Revenue can collect, use and disclose taxpayer information. Inland Revenue follows good rules around the use of information but the changes will improve efficiency and clarity.

“The changes will better focus the confidentiality rule to clearly protect taxpayer information. It will clearly set out any exceptions. It strikes the right balance between careful treatment of taxpayers’ confidential information and improved customer service,” Mr Nash says.

In other measures, the legislation:

*   introduces a ‘short process ruling’ where small businesses can more easily apply for a binding ruling from Inland Revenue on any tax matter;
*   provides the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with more flexibility to deal with minor anomalies in tax legislation;
*   allows over-65 year olds to join KiwiSaver as a provider of low cost managed funds. Employers would not be obliged to contribute for over-65s but may do so voluntarily
*   adds new KiwiSaver contribution rates of 6% and 10%
*   improves the ability of taxpayers to fix errors in tax returns; and
*   sets the annual tax rates for the 2018-19 tax year, which remain unchanged from previous tax years.

“This Bill represents a significant step in the modernisation and simplification of New Zealand’s tax system, supporting much of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation work,” Mr Nash says.

Government moves to close GST loophole
======================================

Today Minister Nash announced that as part of a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the tax bill currently before parliament, the Government will look to close a GST loophole where not-for-profits arguably don’t have to pay GST on sales of assets.

The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced on 28 June 2018 and is at the Select Committee stage.

As well as this measure, the SOP proposes extending the depreciation roll-over relief provisions for businesses affected by the Canterbury earthquakes for a further five years, to the end of the 2023-24 income year.

### Canterbury tax relief, GST loophole closed

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash has confirmed Parliament will extend tax relief for Canterbury businesses affected by issues relating to depreciation following the earthquakes.

Mr Nash today introduced a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill currently making its way through Parliament.

“The SOP extends tax relief for Canterbury businesses affected by earthquakes. It extends depreciation roll-over relief for a further five years to the end of the 2023-24 income year. I have been advised that at least 40 Canterbury businesses will be adversely affected if current depreciation provisions are not extended.

“The tax issue arises because an insurance payout on a depreciable asset can attract a tax liability which may cause consequent cash flow problems. We do not want to hinder the city’s recovery or unfairly burden these taxpayers.

“Many Canterbury businesses are experiencing problems outside their control, such as delays with insurance pay-outs or finding tenants for properties or making progress on building projects. This measure will provide relief to affected businesses and further assist with the Canterbury rebuild.”

Mr Nash says the SOP will also close a loophole which allows non-profit entities to potentially avoid GST on income from asset sales. The change was signalled in an issues paper released on 15 May and will apply from that date.

“The GST treatment of non-profit organisations differs from other entities,” says Mr Nash. “Non-profits can register for GST and claim GST refunds on most of their expenses, even if their turnover is below the $60,000 threshold for GST registration. In many cases non-profit bodies do not pay much GST on their activities.

“In turn, when a GST-registered body sells an asset for which it has claimed GST expenses, it must pay GST on the income from the sale. Inland Revenue has applied this rule since GST was first introduced in 1986.

“Revenue officials have recently been advised of a new legal interpretation of this rule which exposes the tax system to potential losses. For the avoidance of doubt, the SOP introduced today will clarify the GST rules.

“The new interpretation is not consistent with the way the GST rules have been applied and understood in the past. If GST expenses have been claimed by a non-profit body in relation to an asset, GST should apply to the asset when it is sold or there is an equivalent event, such as an insurance pay-out.

“The tax system is based on fairness, and being simple and efficient to operate. The new interpretation threatens those principles and the law change restores certainty.

Government consults on information sharing with SFO and Customs
===============================================================

An existing information sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police enables Inland Revenue to provide information, under certain criteria, to the New Zealand Police to help detect, prevent and prosecute serious crime.

The Government is seeking feedback on proposals to extend this agreement to include the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service. Submissions close on 30 October 2018.

### Information sharing to target organised crime

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash and Customs Minister Kris Faafoi are encouraging feedback on a proposal to extend an information sharing agreement designed to crack down on organised crime.

Since 2014 Inland Revenue and Police have worked together under the _Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement_ where they have reasonable grounds to suspect a serious offence is being committed. The government proposes extending that agreement to include the Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office.

“Police and tax authorities work together well when they suspect a serious crime, punishable by a prison term of four years or more, is being committed. We have released a discussion document calling for public submissions on the proposal to include two more agencies under the same framework,” Mr Nash says.

“Under the proposal, the one-way flow of information from the IRD would be extended to the SFO and Customs. Information could be requested from IRD or proactively provided if there are reasonable grounds to suspect a serious offence may be or has been committed.

“Inland Revenue is usually prevented from revealing details of individual taxpayers. However the Privacy Act makes an exception to the general secrecy rule if there is an approved information sharing agreement, or AISA,” Mr Nash says.

Mr Faafoi says an extension to the existing AISA would make it easier for the Customs Service to investigate and track unlawful imports and transactions.

“The IRD could for example share information from tax audits which show significant amounts of money flowing through a bank account which are not related to core business activities. Further investigation by Customs could reveal potential smuggling of drugs or other contraband across our borders,” Mr Faafoi says.

“Government agencies need to work more closely together to disrupt and prevent illicit cross-border activity that not only evades taxes but also leads to harm in our communities,” Mr Faafoi says.

Submissions are open till 30 October 2018. The discussion document is available at taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

### Question and Answers

**1\. What are the main changes proposed by this AISA?**

The change is the extension of the original agreement between NZ Police and Inland Revenue, to include two agencies in the sharing of information – NZ Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office.

The information would be shared with the two additional agencies utilising the same framework that Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police use to share information for tackling serious crime.

**2\. How will the new Agreement help agencies prevent serious crime?**

The ability to share information held by Inland Revenue with other agencies could open up new lines of enquiry and provide clearer pictures of legitimate revenue streams and illegitimate money, linking individuals and businesses that might be involved in criminal activity.

**3\. How does this proposed AISA improve information sharing between agencies?**

By expanding the AISA to include the Serious Fraud Office and the NZ Customs Service, Inland Revenue would be able to share information with these agencies to help investigations of fraud, corruption and cross-border offences that fit the serious crime definition. Sharing information for this purpose is consistent with the Government’s commitment to making communities safer and reducing crime.

**4\. What measures are in place to ensure the Privacy of individuals’ information?**

The proposed AISA would include controls and processes to minimise any risk of a privacy or secrecy breach occurring. Alongside the protections of the strict secrecy requirements imposed on staff and anyone who receives tax information, the information will be shared on a case-by-case basis and will need to meet a set of criteria to be shared (such as relation to a serious crime and relevance to a case). Information would be available only to authorised staff in each agency to ensure that information is treated appropriately. Staff who knowingly disclose information outside what is legally permitted would face potential criminal liability for breaching taxpayer secrecy.

**5\. What are the benefits of the extended information sharing?**

Information provided by Inland Revenue would assist in providing new leads to an investigation and strengthening serious criminal cases such as fraud, financial crime, money laundering, and drug trafficking. This would support the Government’s objective of giving the NZ Police and the NZ Customs Service the resources they need to crack down on gangs, organised crime and drug trafficking.

**6\. What will be the cost of setting it up?**

For all three agencies, implementation costs would be minimal. The proposed changes do not require any systems or technology changes as the information shared is compiled manually on a case-by-case basis and sent by secure mail.

**7\. What impact will the extended information sharing / AISA have on individuals whose information is held by the concerned agencies?**

The information will only be shared if related to a suspicion of a serious crime, so it won’t affect the majority of individuals whose information is held by the agencies.

Proposed new rules for GST on low-value imported goods announced
================================================================

In his speech today at the Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand tax conference, the Minister of Revenue announced proposed new rules for GST on low-value imported goods.

The proposed changes would require offshore suppliers to register, collect, and return New Zealand GST on goods valued at or below $1,000 that are supplied to consumers in New Zealand. A bill amending the GST Act will be introduced this year, with the changes expected to come into effect from 1 October 2019.

### New GST rules to level playing field

Overseas companies selling goods online into New Zealand will soon be required to collect GST in the same way as domestic retailers.

Speaking at the Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand tax conference today, Stuart Nash said that new rules would be aimed at imported goods valued at or below $1,000. Customs would retain responsibility for collecting GST on imported parcels valued more than $1,000.

“There are about 26,000 small businesses in New Zealand employing more than 62,000 people in the retail sector. Many are in competition with foreign firms who sell exactly the same product into our market without collecting GST,” says Mr Nash.

“We intend to make offshore suppliers collect GST on low value goods at the moment of sale, and in turn, buyers of these goods will no longer pay Customs tariffs or border security and biosecurity fees. This will simplify compliance and administration costs at the border.

“GST has been collected on services and digital products from offshore, such as streamed movies and music, since 2016. This extends that to goods.

“With the steady growth in online shopping from offshore suppliers, a significant amount of tax revenue is being lost. Mostly though, it’s a matter of fairness so the sooner we get this in place the better. This measure aims to help level the playing field and improve the integrity of our tax system.

“Our new rules have been endorsed by the Tax Working Group and will be broadly similar to those introduced by Australia in July. The EU has also committed to following this approach,” says Mr Nash.

### Tax reforms focus on fairness

New tax legislation has been introduced to Parliament to ensure greater fairness in the way the tax system shapes commerce, investment decisions and social policies.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash has introduced the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill.

“The bill implements two major policies which went through public consultation earlier this year, as well as picking up on smaller issues which have been the source of some frustration and complaint for those who deal with the revenue system,” says Mr Nash.

“The legislation establishes a framework to collect GST on low-value imported goods. The changes put local retailers on a level playing field with foreign firms who have taken advantage of the tax break. There are 26,000 small businesses in the retail sector employing more than 62,000 people. They are required to collect GST on all sales, and now the same requirement will apply to offshore retail giants.

“The new GST collection system applies to imported goods valued under $1000 and will come into effect on 1 October 2019. GST on goods valued above $1000 will continue to be collected by Customs when the goods enter New Zealand.

“The internet has opened up more markets for global companies but if they want to do business here they must follow the rules like everyone else. We’re not the first to introduce such a rule and eventually this will be the new reality of doing business.

“The second major change will mean residential property investors no longer get a tax break by using losses on rental properties to offset the tax payable on other sources of income such as salary and wages.

“Currently investors with loss-making rental properties can subsidise part of the cost of their mortgages through reduced tax on other income, helping them to outbid owner-occupiers for properties.  Yet these investors often make tax-free capital gains when these properties are sold.

“In conjunction with the extension to the bright-line test, ring-fencing losses from rental properties would make property speculation less attractive and level the playing field between property investors and home buyers. The new rules will not apply to a person’s main home or a property that is rented out and used privately such as a bach.

“The legislation also recognises the growing use of te reo Māori as an everyday language, including by many businesses. Inland Revenue has allowed taxpayers to keep records in te reo Māori for more than 20 years but this has never been enshrined as standard practice through legislation.  The right to use te reo Māori should be officially recognised in the law, rather than at the discretion of a Government department.

“Another wrong that is righted by this bill is the situation where a person who is the victim of a sex offence becomes liable for child support payments for a baby born as a consequence of that offence.

“Although an exemption is available to prevent this liability, it has only been granted twice in twelve years. In order for a victim to qualify for the exemption, the offender must have been prosecuted. Sadly, all too often sex offences are not reported and even once reported, few result in a conviction. The law change will mean the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can use her discretion in such cases when deciding whether an exemption should be granted. Not only do we want a fairer tax system, we also want a humane and effective justice system, and this change will help to achieve that.

“The bill also tidies up a somewhat confusing situation where domestic student loan borrowers are eligible for interest-free loans, but find they are charged interest which is then written off at the end of each year. This has been required as a technical workaround because of the IRD’s aged technology platform. Now with the transition to a new platform, we can finally clear up that confusion and not charge interest for these borrowers in the first place.”

“Our revenue system enables the funding of our vital public services but it also needs to operate fairly in the way tax is administered and collected. These changes achieve those objectives and create a fairer system,” Mr Nash says.

The bill is expected to have its first reading on 12 December 2018.

Under the current rules, however, GST is not typically collected on imported goods below the customs de minimis of $60 of duty owing (this typically equates to a parcel with a value of $400 if GST is the only duty). When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased goods from offshore suppliers, and online shopping did not exist. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported goods under the de minimis outweighed the benefits of taxation. The growth of e-commerce means the volume of imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. Many are concerned that the current tax settings place New Zealand suppliers of low-value goods at a competitive disadvantage relative to offshore suppliers. The non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods has also resulted in a growing gap in New Zealand’s GST revenue base (estimated to be around $130 million in 2017–18). The amendments proposed in the Bill apply GST to imported goods valued at or below $1,000 that are imported from offshore suppliers by consumers in New Zealand. They would require the offshore supplier to register for and return GST on these supplies. Offshore suppliers may have the option to also charge GST on their supplies of goods over $1,000 to consumers in New Zealand. The New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) will cease to collect any form of duty on consignments valued at $1,000 or less, except for tobacco products or alcoholic beverages. Customs will however continue to collect GST on imported parcels valued above $1,000. The proposed amendments contain rules to prevent double taxation by requiring Customs to not collect GST on goods that have already had GST collected on them at the point of sale by the offshore supplier. Offshore suppliers would not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand GST- registered businesses, nor would they be required to provide tax invoices. Furthermore, as with domestic suppliers and offshore suppliers of remote services, offshore suppliers would only be required to register for and return GST when their taxable supplies to New Zealand consumers exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. A range of other amendments are also proposed focusing on implementation. The overall package of amendments is intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and to create a level playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of low- value goods. Non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods is an international challenge faced by countries that have a GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) system. On 1 July 2018 Australia introduced rules requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST on their supplies of low-value imported goods to Australian consumers. The proposed amendments broadly follow Australia’s recently introduced rules. 4 The European Union (EU) has also announced that from 1 January 2021 non-EU suppliers will be required to register and return VAT on supplies of low-value imported goods to consumers in the EU. Other features of the proposed rules include: • Supplies of low-value imported goods by non-resident suppliers to New Zealand GST- registered businesses would not be subject to GST unless the supplier decides that the supply will be zero-rated (taxed at a rate of zero percent). The supplier would then be able to claim back any New Zealand GST costs incurred in making the zero-rated supplies. • Offshore suppliers would be required to determine whether a customer is in New Zealand on the basis of the address the goods are to be delivered to. • Offshore suppliers would be required to presume that a New Zealand-resident customer is not a GST-registered business unless the customer has provided their GST registration number, New Zealand Business Number or notified their status as a registered business. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) is also able to agree to an alternative method of determining whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. • If a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST, it should seek a refund from the non-resident supplier. However, if the payment for the supply excluding the amount of GST is $1,000 or less, a non-resident supplier would have the option to provide a tax invoice to the purchaser to allow them to claim a deduction, rather than refund the GST charged. • When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of an electronic marketplace would be required to register for and return GST on supplies made through the marketplace instead of the underlying supplier. • Redeliverers would be required to register and return GST on low-value imported goods they deliver to New Zealand consumers. • The Commissioner would have the discretion to require a person to register for and pay the GST in cases when a person provides false or misleading information about themselves in order to avoid GST, if the GST amount involved is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. • A simplified “pay-only” registration system would be made available to offshore suppliers that are only required to return GST and who do not have any New Zealand GST costs to claim back. • For the period from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020, non-resident suppliers of low- value goods would have a taxable period of six months (or the option of having a quarterly taxable period right from the start of the rules). After this transit io nal period, these suppliers would be required to have quarterly taxable periods. The proposed amendments follow proposals outlined in the discussion document, GST on low-value imported goods– an offshore supplier registration system, released in May 2018. The new rules will apply to supplies made on or after 1 October 2019. All references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) unless otherwise specified. All mo netar y values in this Commentary are denominated in New Zealand dollars unless otherwise stated. The fo llowing items detail how this measure would work in practice. 5 SUPPLIES OF LOW-VALUE IMPORTED GOODS TO CONSUMERS IN NEW ZEALAND (Clauses 5(2), 6, 9(1), 12(2), 13 and 31) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes amendments to the GST Act that will apply GST to imported goods valued at or below $1,000 supplied to New Zealand-resident consumers, by requiring offshore suppliers (as well as marketplaces and redeliverers) to register and return GST on these supplies. Customs will continue to collect GST on imported consignments valued above $1,000. Key features Distantly taxable goods The Bill proposes a definition of “distantly taxable goods” be inserted into the GST Act. A distantly taxable good would generally be defined as a good valued up to $1,000 that is outside New Zealand at the time of supply, supplied by a non-resident and delivered to New Zealand. In addition, proposed new section 10C would allow suppliers to elect to treat goods that they supply which are individually valued above $1,000 as distantly taxable goods if certain requirements are met. This means that a good with a value above $1,000 may be a distantly taxable good if it is outside New Zealand at the time of supply, supplied by a non-resident and delivered to a place in New Zealand, and the supplier has elected to treat such goods as distantly taxable goods. Goods that are deemed to be supplied by a marketplace operator or a redeliverer would also be distantly taxable goods, regardless of the residency of the deemed supplier or where the goods are geographically situated at the time of supply. Alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and tobacco products cannot be distantly taxable goods. Instead, these goods will have GST and other duties collected on them at the border by Customs regardless of their value. To determine whether a good exceeds the $1,000 threshold, the good’s value would be determined in accordance with proposed new section 10B. If a good’s value under section 10B does not exceed $1,000 it would be a distantly taxable good. If a good’s value under section 10B exceeds $1,000, it would not be a distantly taxable good unless the supplier (or deemed supplier) has elected to treat its supplies of high-value imported goods as distantly taxable goods. 6 Change to the place of supply rules Proposed new section 8(3)(ab) is inserted into the place of supply rules. This would treat “distantly taxable goods” (as defined) supplied by a non-resident to a person providing a delivery address in New Zealand as supplied in New Zealand, and therefore subject to GST. Goods deemed to be supplied by a resident marketplace operator or redeliverer would be treated as supplied in New Zealand by existing section 8(2). Determining the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods The value of a supply of distantly taxable goods for determining the amount of GST payable would generally be determined under existing section 10(2) and proposed new section 10(7E). Under section 10(2)(a), the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods (with the addition of GST) would generally be the amount of consideration in money for the supply. Proposed section 10(7E) would ensure the amount of consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods includes any additional amounts for services provided in connection with the distantly taxable goods (such as delivery and associated insurance), in all situations where the supplier of the goods supplies, or arranges or facilitates the supply, of these services. Registration threshold As a consequence of proposed section 8(3)(ab), non-resident suppliers (including non- resident marketplaces and redeliverers) would be required to register and return GST when their total supplies treated as being made in New Zealand, including supplies of distantly taxable goods to consumers, exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period. Supplies of distantly taxable goods to New Zealand GST-registered businesses would only count towards this threshold if the supplier decides to zero-rate the supply (discussed in the next item of this Commentary). Background New Zealand’s GST is a broad-based consumption tax that should apply to all consumption in New Zealand, including imported goods. The New Zealand Customs Service is responsible for collecting GST on imported goods. However, GST is not collected on imported consignments of goods for which less than $60 of duty (including GST) is payable. This $60 threshold (referred to as the “de minimis”) typically means GST is not collected on imported parcels valued under $400 if GST is the only duty payable. When GST was introduced in 1986, few final consumers purchased goods from non- residents for delivery in New Zealand. Instead, most imported goods were purchased by GST-registered businesses so the non-collection of GST on imported goods below the customs de minimis was not a significant issue. However, the growth of online shopping means it is now common for consumers to purchase goods from non-resident suppliers. The non-collection of GST on imported goods below the de minimis is therefore becoming an increasingly significant gap in the GST base. 7 International developments Non-taxation of low-value imported goods is an international issue faced by countries that have a GST or VAT system. Since 1 July 2018, legislation in Australia now requires suppliers, electronic distribution platforms (electronic marketplaces) and redeliverers to collect and return GST on imported goods valued at or below A$1,000 that they supply or are deemed to supply to consumers in Australia. Switzerland will also introduce an offshore supplier registration system for collecting VAT on low-value imported goods from 1 January 2019. The European Union (EU) has also announced that it will extend its existing VAT rules for cross-border supplies of goods within the EU to also tax low-value imported goods from non-EU suppliers, starting from 1 January 2021. Current place of supply rules The GST Act adopts an iterative approach to determining whether a good or service is treated as supplied in New Zealand, and therefore whether GST applies to the supply. The place of supply rules in section 8 of the Act are then followed by a range of exclusions that determine whether the supply is zero-rated or exempt. In the specific case of supplies of goods by non-residents, the current place of supply rules apply GST on the basis of where goods are at the time of supply. Goods that are outside New Zealand at the time of supply are not subject to GST under section 8 if supplied by a non- resident, regardless of whether the goods are subsequently imported into New Zealand. Under section 8(2) of the Act, when a New Zealand-resident person supplies goods or services, the supply is deemed to be in New Zealand and is therefore subject to GST. However, if the goods are exported, the supply will be zero-rated under section 11. If a non-resident person supplies goods, the starting point is the supply will be deemed to be outside New Zealand, and therefore not subject to GST. However, under section 8(3)(a), goods are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand if the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply. Conversely, section 8(4) provides that if a supply is made to a GST-registered business for the purpose of carrying on its taxable activity, the goods are deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand (and therefore are not subject to GST) unless the parties agree that GST will apply. 8 Summary of the current place of supply rules for goods supplied by a non-resident Are the goods in New Zealand at the time of supply? No GST applies Are the goods supplied to a registered person for use in their taxable activity? NoYes Do the supplier and the registered person agree that the supply will be a taxable supply? GST applies at 15% No GST applies GST applies at 15% NoYes YesNo Detailed analysis Definition of “distantly taxable goods” Under the GST Act, “goods” are defined to mean all kinds of real or personal property; but do not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system. Proposed new section 4B sets out that “distantly taxable goods” would generally be defined as goods that: • are supplied by a non-resident; • are outside New Zealand at the time of supply; • are delivered to a place in New Zealand by the supplier, or the supplier arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • individually have an entry value of $1,000 or less. As discussed in later sections of this Commentary, the proposed definition of distantly taxable goods also includes goods treated by section 60C, 60D or 60E as being supplied by a marketplace operator or redeliverer, regardless of the residency of the marketplace operator or redeliverer. 9 Alcoholic beverages, tobacco and tobacco products that are exempted from regulations made under section 406(1) of the Customs and Excise Act 2018 would not be distantly taxable goods. At present, Customs collects GST and excise taxes on these goods, which will not change under the proposals. Goods outside New Zealand at the time of supply A non-resident person who is the actual supplier of goods that are delivered to an address in New Zealand (that is, someone who is not merely treated as the supplier of the goods for GST purposes) would be considered to have made a supply of distantly taxable goods if the goods are outside New Zealand at the time of supply. This is subject to the other requirements of a supply of distantly taxable goods being met. Existing section 9(1) sets out that the time of supply is generally the earlier of any payment being received or an invoice being issued. In the case of goods purchased online by consumers, this will generally be the same as the time the consumer purchases the goods. If either a redeliverer or an operator of a marketplace is treated by section 60C, 60D or 60E as the supplier of the goods, the location of the goods at the time of supply would not be relevant for determining if the goods are distantly taxable goods. In other words, any supply of goods that is deemed under those sections to be made by a marketplace operator or a redeliverer would be a supply of distantly taxable goods, regardless of where the goods are physically located at the time of supply. Goods individually having entry values of $1,000 or less In order to determine if a good is a distantly taxable good, suppliers would be required to determine the good’s entry value in accordance with proposed section 10B. However, existing section 10(2) and proposed new section 10(7E) would generally apply for determining the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods in order to calculate the amount of GST payable. Under section 10B(2), a good’s entry value would be the amount of consideration it is sold for, less any amounts included in the consideration for: • duty payable under the Customs and Excise Act 2018; and • any amounts included in the consideration for the cost of transport and insurance for the good between leaving its country of export and being delivered in New Zealand. This is consistent with the valuation that Customs would use for determining if a consignment is above or below the de minimis. Under proposed section 10B(3), suppliers would be able to use information available to them at the time of supply to determine a reasonable estimate of a good’s entry value under subsection (2). If a good has an entry value of $1,000 or less then it would be a distantly taxable good. If a good has an entry value exceeding $1,000, that good would not be a distantly taxable good unless, as discussed below, the supplier has made an election under proposed new section 10C to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods that is effective at the time of supply. 10 It is worthwhile noting that currency conversion to New Zealand dollars for the purpose of establishing whether GST applies would only be necessary if: • it is unclear whether a good that is sold in another currency has an entry value exceeding $1,000 or not; and • the supplier has not elected to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods. As the entry value is worked out by using a reasonable estimate at the time of supply, the date or time of supply would be the date or time of the currency conversion (if required). The Bill does not propose any restrictions on the type of exchange rate that suppliers may use for converting foreign currency amounts. This means that suppliers would have a choice of using a sell NZD rate, a buy NZD rate or a midpoint rate for the purpose of establishing whether GST applies (as well as for the purpose of determining the amount of output tax to be returned in New Zealand dollars when filing their GST returns, as discussed later in this Commentary). Which goods would be included in a supply of distantly taxable goods? In some cases, a single transaction will involve one or more goods that each have an entry value of $1,000 or less and, at the same time, one or more other goods that each have an entry value exceeding $1,000. If the supplier has not made an election to treat goods with entry values above $1,000 as distantly taxable goods, proposed section 4B(2) would split such transactions into two separate supplies: • a supply of distantly taxable goods, consisting of all the goods that are low-value goods (that is, have individual entry values of $1,000 or less), except for alcoholic beverages, tobacco and tobacco products; and • a second supply consisting of the remaining goods supplied in the transaction. However, if the supplier has elected to treat its supplies of high-value goods as distantly taxable goods, proposed section 4B(2) would only apply to split a single supply of goods into two separate supplies if some of the goods supplied do not meet the definition of “distantly taxable goods” because they are in New Zealand at the time of supply, or because they are alcoholic beverages, tobacco or tobacco products. Further explanation of the proposed rules that would allow suppliers to treat their supplies of high-value goods as distantly taxable goods is provided in a later section of this Commentary. Changes to the place of supply rules The amendments propose changes to the place of supply rules, so that GST applies to supplies of distantly taxable goods where the goods are delivered to an address in New Zealand. Proposed section 8(3)(ab) provides that distantly taxable goods supplied (or deemed to be supplied) by a non-resident would be treated as supplied in New Zealand (subject to GST). 11 Existing section 8(2) provides that supplies of goods and services by New Zealand residents are treated as supplied in New Zealand. Section 8(2) would therefore treat distantly taxable goods that are deemed to be supplied by resident marketplace operators and redeliverers as supplied in New Zealand (and hence also subject to GST). Proposed new section 8(4E) sets out that distantly taxable goods that are supplied by a non- resident to a GST-registered business for the purpose of carrying on its taxable activity would be treated as supplied outside New Zealand (not subject to GST), unless the non-resident supplier decides to treat the supply as made in New Zealand. Where the supplier decides to treat the supply as made in New Zealand, the goods would be zero-rated under proposed section 11(1)(fb). (For more information on business-to-business supplies of distantly taxable goods, see the following section of this Commentary item.) Goods that are already exempt (such as supplies of fine metal) or zero-rated under a specific rule, would retain that character under the proposed amendments. A further amendment is proposed to exclude supplies of distantly taxable goods that are subject to new section 8(3)(ab) from the scope of existing paragraph (a) (being the provision that applies GST to supplies by non-residents of goods that are in New Zealand at the time of supply). This is because it is possible that some of the distantly taxable goods a marketplace or redeliverer is deemed to supply may be in New Zealand at the time of supply, and therefore could be subject to both section 8(3)(a) and (ab) without the proposed amendment to (a). 12 Summary of the new place of supply rules for non-resident suppliers of goods Are the goods distantly taxable goods?

The value of a supply of distantly taxable goods would typically be determined by the amount of consideration in money for the supply. Existing section 10(2)(a) provides that, to the extent the consideration for a supply of goods and services is in money, the value of the supply with the addition of GST is equal to the amount of consideration in mo ney. 1 This means that, for supplies of goods that are priced inclusive of GST, the amount of output tax that should be returned on the supply would be equal to the total amount of consideration multiplied by the tax fraction of 3/23. An example of how this applies is provided below. Treatment of amounts paid by the recipient for delivery and other related services Under ordinary GST principles, the amount of consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods may include amounts paid by the recipient relating to services such as delivery, insurance or giftwrapping of the goods in the supply, even if an explicit fee is charged for these services. This is because these services may be ancillary, integral or incidental to the supply of the goods (or otherwise would be a means of better enjoying the dominant element of the supply, being the goods). Where this is the case, such services may form part of the supply of distantly taxable goods. This may be the case even though services such as international transportation of goods (including ancillary activities such as handling) and insurance associated with the international transportation are zero-rated. 2 However, it is possible that there may be a separate zero-rated supply if the recipient contracts separately for the supply of these services. For example, an operator of an electronic marketplace may facilitate the delivery of goods that a consumer has purchased on its marketplace by allowing the consumer to also purchase international transportation services from a transport company through the marketplace. To avoid doubt and ensure consistent treatment in situations where there may or may not be a separate zero-rated supply, proposed section 10(7E) provides that the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods would include the amount of consideration for a supply of related services to the recipient of the distantly taxable goods, where the supply of the related services: • is made, arranged or facilitated by the supplier (or by the underlying supplier, if the supplier for GST purposes is a marketplace operator); • is directly in connection with the distantly taxable goods or is insurance of the goods; 1 To the extent that the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods is not in money, existing section 10(2)(b) would provide that the value of the supply with the addition of GST is equal to the open market value of the consideration. 2 For more information on when multiple goods and services supplied in a single transaction will form a single supply or multiple supplies, see the Interpretation Statement, IS 18/04 Goods and Services Tax – Single supply or multiple supplies, available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/2/2/229901d1-77a8-410e-a005- 933a9904455e/is1804.pdf. 14 • would be zero-rated in the absence of this rule; and • does not form a single supply with the distantly taxable goods. This would mean that amounts paid by the recipient for related services (such as international transportation that is contractually supplied to the recipient by a third party) may still be included as part of the consideration for a supply of distantly taxable goods, provided all of the above conditions are met. This would ensure that GST effectively applies at the rate of 15% to any amounts paid to the supplier or marketplace operator for services that are sufficiently connected with the distantly taxable goods (in terms of being the transportation of the goods or associated with the transportation, or having some other direct physical intervention with the goods) such that the consumption of these services ought to be treated as consumption in New Zealand. This would also provide neutrality with the situation where GST would, under ordinary principles, apply to an amount charged by the supplier for these services because the amount forms part of the consideration for the supply. However, for practical reasons, paragraph (a) of proposed section 10(7E) requires that the consideration for the services supplied in connection with the distantly taxable goods is a charge solely related to the distantly taxable goods and the associated services. This means that a subscription where a consumer is paying for the transport of many supplies of goods, for example, would be excluded from the scope of the rule. Example – calculating amount of output tax based on GST-inclusive price Wendy, a consumer in New Zealand, purchases a fascinator from Wild Hats, an e-commerce business based in Australia that ships novelty party hats from its warehouse in Melbourne. Wild Hats is registered for GST in New Zealand. The full amount paid by Wendy for the fascinator, including GST and an explicit charge for shipping to New Zealand of $11.50 (also inclusive of GST), is $34.50. The amount of output tax returned on the supply by Wild Hats is $4.50 ($34.50 × 3/23 = $4.50). This includes the $1.50 of GST included in the shipping fee. The entry value of the good is $20, being the full amount of consideration for the supply of $34.50, less the total amount of GST ($4.50) and the amount of the shipping fee excluding GST ($10). Special rule for calculating GST payable by a redeliverer Neither the ordinary rule in section 10(2)(a) nor the proposed new rule in section 10(7E) would apply for determining the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods that a redeliverer is deemed to make under section 60E. Instead, proposed new section 10(7C) contains a special rule for determining the amount of GST payable on a supply of distantly taxable goods that section 60E would treat as being made by a redeliverer. The special rule is explained in a later section on the proposed rules for redeliverers in this Commentary item. 15 Discounts provided by marketplaces The Bill also proposes a special valuation rule to deal with the situation where an operator of a marketplace provides discounts for remote services or distantly taxable goods that it is deemed to be the supplier of. This rule is discussed in a later section of this Commentary on the proposed rules for marketplaces. GST registration threshold Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods to New Zealand customers would be required to register for GST if their total value of supplies made to New Zealand consumers exceeds $60,000 in a 12-month period, which is equivalent to the existing registration threshold for non-resident suppliers of remote services and resident suppliers of goods and services. Non-resident suppliers would be able to use a fair and reasonable method of converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars to determine whether the registration threshold has been exceeded. As these suppliers would be subject to the rules contained in section 51 of the GST Act, non- resident suppliers would be required to register if: • the total value of their supplies made in New Zealand in the past 12 months exceeded $60,000 (unless the Commissioner is satisfied that their supplies in the next 12 months will not exceed this threshold); or • the total value of their supplies made in New Zealand in the next 12 months is expected to exceed $60,000. As distantly taxable goods supplied by a non-resident to New Zealand GST-registered businesses are generally treated as not being supplied in New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST), these supplies will not count towards the registration threshold. However, if the supplier decides that these supplies will be zero-rated, these supplies would count towards the threshold. Where a non-resident supplier of distantly taxable goods is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand, and their supplies fall below the $60,000 threshold, they would be able to voluntarily register for GST. The existing rules that allow non-resident businesses to register for GST, which are contained in section 54B of the GST Act, will continue to apply. These rules allow a non- resident business that has been charged GST on goods or services received in New Zealand, but that does not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand, to register and claim refunds of the GST paid, provided certain conditions are met. 16 Example – non-resident supplier below the registration threshold Jersey Co., a non-resident company based in the United States, sells clothing to customers across the world. Jersey Co. also makes and supplies businesses with staff uniforms. Each year, Jersey Co. makes supplies valued at $50,000 to New Zealand customers who are not GST-registered. It makes supplies valued at $20,000 to New Zealand GST-registered customers. Unless Jersey Co. chooses to treat its supplies to GST-registered businesses as zero-rated, Jersey Co. will not be required to register and return GST on any of its supplies in New Zealand, as it has not exceeded the $60,000 registration threshold. Effect on suppliers’ residency and income tax obligations Although these amendments treat certain goods provided by non-residents as “supplied in New Zealand”, there is no intention that this will have a broader impact on whether a supplier is a resident of New Zealand for GST or income tax purposes, or whether a supplier has a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. The definition of “resident” in the GST Act includes a resident as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. For GST purposes, a person is also considered to be a resident of New Zealand to the extent that the person carries on a taxable activity or other activity in New Zealand, and has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. The proposed amendments will not affect the extent to which a person carries on an activity in New Zealand, despite making certain supplies taxable for GST purposes. Double tax agreements (DTAs) primarily deal with whether a resident of one country is subject to income tax on income derived in another country. The concept of “permanent establishment” is used in DTAs between New Zealand and other countries. Under DTAs, a company that does not have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand will have no New Zealand income tax. The fact that a supplier is registered for New Zealand GST under the proposed rules should not affect whether or not they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand for DTA purposes, or the application of the definition of resident used for GST purposes. 17 SUPPLIES TO NEW ZEALAND GST-REGISTERED BUSINESSES (Clauses 8, 9(2) to (6), 11, 14(1), (4), 19(1), (3) to (9), 23, 25, 26(1) to (3), (5) and 27) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that supplies of distantly taxable goods by non-residents to New Zealand GST-registered businesses (business-to-business supplies) will not be subject to GST unless the supplier decides to zero-rate the supply. Zero-rating the supply would allow the non- resident supplier to deduct any New Zealand GST costs incurred in making the supply. Special rules are proposed to deal with the situation where GST is inadvertently charged on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a GST-registered person and the registered person uses (or intends to use) the goods for non-taxable purposes. These rules mirror existing rules applying to business-to-business supplies of remote services. Key features Under the proposed rules, supplies of distantly taxable goods by non-residents to New Zealand GST-registered businesses will not be subject to GST unless the supplier decides to zero-rate the supply. Proposed section 11(1)(fb) would apply to business-to-business supplies of distantly taxable goods that the supplier has chosen to zero-rate. This allows the supplier to deduct any New Zealand GST costs incurred in relation to the supply. As a consequence of these rules, non-resident suppliers may be required to identify whether a New Zealand recipient of the supply is GST-registered. The existing rules for identifying GST-registered recipients of remote services would also apply for identifying a GST- registered recipient of distantly taxable goods. Under these rules, the supplier would be required to treat the recipient as not being a registered person unless the recipient: • notifies the supplier that they are a registered person; or • provides the supplier with their GST registration number or New Zealand business number. GST-registered recipients of distantly taxable goods should not identify themselves as a GST-registered person or provide their GST registration number, or a New Zealand business number, if they intend to use the goods for one hundred percent non-taxable purposes. As with the rules for remote services, the Commissioner can agree with a supplier on the use of another method to determine whether the supply is made to a registered person for the purpose of carrying on the registered person’s taxable activity. 18 Tax invoices A non-resident supplier would not be required to provide a tax invoice in relation to supplies of distantly taxable goods (see proposed new section 24(5)(c) in clause 23(1) of the Bill). However, under existing section 24(5B), a non-resident supplier of remote services can choose to provide a full tax invoice if the recipient has been inadvertently charged GST and the consideration for the supply is $1,000 or less (inclusive of GST). The Bill proposes to extend this rule to include supplies of distantly taxable goods. The Bill also proposes to amend section 24(5B)(b) to refer to the GST-exclusive value of the supply, rather than consideration (being a GST-inclusive concept). Input tax deductions Under the proposed amendment to section 20(4C), a recipient cannot claim an input tax deduction for a supply of distantly taxable goods unless the recipient has obtained a tax invoice under section 24(5B), resulting from the recipient being inadvertently charged GST, and the value of the supply is $1,000 or less. The recipient would not be denied an input tax deduction when, as discussed later in this section, the supply is treated as made in New Zealand by the recipient of the supply (under section 8(4B)) and the recipient has applied the reverse charge under section 5B. GST-registered business inadvertently charged GST When a GST-registered recipient is inadvertently charged GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods, a non-resident supplier may make an output tax adjustment in the return when it is apparent that a mistake has been made, under amendments proposed to section 25(1)). These amendments apply when: • the supply was standard-rated when it should not have been treated as a taxable supply (see the proposed amendment to subsection 25(1)(aab) in clause 26 of the Bill); or • the supply was standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated (see the proposed amendment to subsection 25(1)(abb)). A non-resident supplier would have the option to issue a tax invoice when the recipient has been inadvertently charged GST at the standard rate of 15% on a supply of distantly taxable goods when it should not have been taxed or should have been taxed at the rate of zero percent (see the proposed amendments to section 24(5B)(a)(i) and (ii)). However, the non- resident supplier may only provide a tax invoice when the value of the supply is $1,000 or less, and the recipient notifies the supplier that they are a registered person (see the proposed amendments to section 24(5B)). When a business-to-business supply has been incorrectly taxed at the standard rate, and the supplier opts to issue a tax invoice, the invoice must contain all the particulars specified in existing section 24(3). The provision of a tax invoice allows the GST-registered recipient to make a deduction for the inadvertently charged GST to the extent to which the recipient uses the goods, or the goods are available for use in, making taxable supplies. 19 When a non-resident supplier opts to provide a tax invoice under section 24(5B): • the supplier must not make an adjustment under section 25 to correct the amount of GST shown on the invoice; • the supplier and recipient would be deemed to have agreed that the supply is subject to GST; and • the proposed zero-rating provision under section 11(1)(fb) would not apply (see the exception to the zero-rating provision in proposed new section 11(8E)). Reverse charge A proposed amendment to section 8(4B) extends the existing reverse charge to distantly taxable goods that would be treated by section 8(4E) as not being supplied in New Zealand. It also extends the reverse charge in section 8(4B) to goods treated by section 8(4) as not being supplied in New Zealand. Currently, the reverse charge applies to services acquired by a GST-registered business from a non-resident supplier if the percentage of intended taxable use (or percentage of actual taxable use) of the services is less than 95 percent of the total use. The reverse charge treats the services as being supplied in New Zealand by the recipient in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the recipient (see section 5B). Section 20(3JC), which applies a reverse charge to zero-rated supplies of remote services, would be amended to also require the recipient of a supply of distantly taxable goods that is zero-rated under 11(1)(fb) to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non- taxable use of the goods. Consistent with section 8(4B), this section only applies when at the time of acquisition, or at the end of an adjustment period, the taxable use of the good is less than 95 percent. Background A key feature of the proposals is the exclusion for business-to-business supplies. Fro m a revenue perspective, there is little value in applying GST to business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods as the GST-registered recipient would, in most cases, be able to claim back the GST in their GST return, resulting in no net GST revenue. Other advantages of excluding business-to-business supplies include the following: • Tax invoice requirements can be relaxed because no New Zealand consumers charged with GST would be in a posit ion to claim back the GST. • There are some revenue risks associated with applying GST to business-to-business supplies by non-residents, which would arise if a non-resident supplier purported to charge GST but did not return the GST to Inland Revenue. Registered New Zealand businesses would then seek to claim the GST back in the normal manner. • Excluding business-to-business supplies is consistent with New Zealand’s existing rules for remote services and how similar rules for imported goods have been applied in Australia. 20 Because business-to-business supplies are proposed to be excluded, special rules are required for when a GST-registered recipient acquires goods from a non-resident supplier for non-taxable purposes (such as private purposes or use in making exempt supplies). In these situations, a GST-registered recipient should be treated in a similar way to a final consumer, as otherwise the supply may be under-taxed. It is therefore proposed that the existing reverse charge provisions (sections 8(4B) and 20(3JC)) would apply to ensure GST is returned by the GST-registered recipient on the portion of non-taxable use of the goods. This would ensure that businesses acquiring distantly taxable goods from a non-resident supplier for purposes other than for making taxable supplies are treated in the same way as individual consumers. Detailed analysis Proposed section 8(4E) would apply to supplies of distantly taxable goods to GST-registered businesses, so that these supplies would be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand unless the supplier decides to treat the supply as a taxable supply. Where the supplier has decided to treat the supply as a taxable supply, the supply would be zero-rated under proposed new section 11(1)(fb). Example – business-to-business exclusion for distantly taxable goods supplied by non-residents Electronics Co. is a non-resident company that supplies phones, computers and other electronic goods to customers around the world. The goods sold by Electronics Co. are not situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. Therefore, the goods Electronic Co. supplies to customers in New Zealand will be distantly taxable goods if they have individual entry values of $1,000 or less. Electronics Co.’s supplies of distantly taxable goods to customers in New Zealand that are not registered for GST would be subject to GST under section 8(3)(ab). However, its supplies of distantly taxable goods to customers in New Zealand that are GST registered would be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand unless Electronics Co. decides to zero-rate the supply. If Electronics Co. incurs New Zealand GST costs, it may wish to zero-rate its supplies of distantly taxable goods to GST-registered customers as this would allow it to deduct the costs incurred in New Zealand in making the supplies. As a consequence of these rules for business-to-business supplies, non-resident suppliers would need to differentiate between individual consumers and GST-registered businesses. The proposed rules require the supplier to treat the supply as being to a consumer, unless the recipient notifies the supplier that they are registered or provides their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number. GST-registered recipients of distantly taxable goods should not identify themselves as a GST-registered person, or provide their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number, if they intend to use the service for one hundred percent non-taxable purposes (for example, private purposes or use in making exempt supplies). 21 It is recognised that it may not be practical for all suppliers to ask for evidence that a customer is GST-registered. Therefore, to provide additional flexibility, the proposed rules allow the Commissioner to prescribe or agree alternative methods for determining whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. This discretion would apply in situations where a supplier can reasonably distinguish between supplies to businesses and individual consumers on the basis of the nature of the goods they supply, and can provide evidence that the goods targeted at businesses are supplied to GST-registered businesses. The proposed approach for determining whether a recipient of a supply of distantly taxable goods is GST-registered mirrors the rules already applying to supplies of remote services. These rules are contained in proposed new section 8BB, which would replace existing section 8B(6), (7) and (8). GST inadvertently charged to a GST-registered recipient There may be instances when a non-resident supplier accidently treats a GST-registered business as an individual consumer and therefore charges the business GST. In this situation, the GST-registered recipient should seek a refund from the non-resident supplier and not claim an input tax deduction for the inadvertently charged GST (see the proposed amendment to section 20(4C)). There is, however, a proposed exception to the deduction prohibition in section 20(4C) for supplies under $1,000, as discussed below. Proposed amendments to section 25(1) would allow a supplier to make adjustments to the payment of output tax in the return in which it is apparent that the mistake has been made. This will apply when the supply was standard-rated when it should not have been treated as a taxable supply (see the proposed amendment to subsection 25(1)(aab)), or the supply was standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated (see the proposed amendment to subsection 25(1)(abb) in clause 26 of the Bill). An adjustment would only be required if the non-resident supplier has already filed a return and has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax as a result of the mistake (see existing section 25(1)(e)). Since non-resident suppliers would not be required to provide a tax invoice under the proposed amendment to section 24(5), they would not be required to issue a credit note under section 25(4). Supplies of $1,000 or less An exception to the above rules would apply when the payment for the supply (excluding GST) is $1,000 or less. In this situation, if the supplier inadvertently charges a GST- registered recipient GST, the supplier could choose to provide a full tax invoice to the GST- registered recipient (see the proposed amendment to section 24(5B)). This option is intended to be a compliance cost-saving measure for non-resident suppliers in relation to low-value supplies, when the cost of issuing a refund relative to the amount of the refund may exceed the cost of issuing a tax invoice. If the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice, the supplier would be required to provide a full tax invoice, even if the payment for the supply (including GST) is less than $50 (see the proposed amendments to section 24(5)). 22 Existing section 24(3) sets out that a full tax invoice must contain the following particulars: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient; • the date upon which the tax invoice is issued; • a description of the goods supplied; • the quantity of the goods supplied; and either— • the total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or • where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of the tax. An existing exception to the deduction prohibition in section 20(4C) allows a GST-registered recipient of remote services (for which the non-resident supplier has issued a tax invoice under section 24(5B)) to claim an input tax deduction under the normal deduction provisions, to the extent that the services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. An amendment is proposed to section 20(4C), so that this exception would also apply in the situation where a non-resident supplier provides the recipient of a supply of distantly taxable goods not exceeding $1,000 in value with a full tax invoice. If the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice: • the supplier would not be required to make an adjustment under section 25 to correct the amount of GST shown on the invoice (see section 25(1)(aab)(ii) and the exception to section 25(1)(abb)); and • the proposed zero-rating provision under section 11(1)(fb) would not apply (see the exception to section 11(1)(fb) in proposed new section 11(8E)). These provisions are intended to turn a supply that should not have been taxed (or should have been taxed at zero percent), into a supply that is taxed at the standard rate of 15%. In this situation, the correct amount of GST is returned by the supplier, and therefore an adjustment to the supplier’s GST return, under section 25, is not required. 23 The diagram summarises how these rules would apply. A n on-resident has made a supply of distantly taxab le go o ds to a G ST- registered person and charged GST Is the valu e of th e su pp ly equal to or less than $1,000? Supplier has a choice between A and B Y es Supplier can provide a tax invoice Supplier can provide a refund of GST charged The goods are treated as a standard-rated supply. The GST-registered recipient is able to claim an input tax deduction The non-resident supplier w ill n ot m ake an adjustment The supplier must make an adjustment of tax payable in the period when the incorrect treatment becomes apparent No AB Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of goods) An amendment to the existing reverse charge under section 8(4B) would require GST- registered recipients of supplies of distantly taxable goods (that are treated by section 8(4E) as not being supplies in New Zealand) to return output tax on the supply if the percentage intended or actual use of the goods is less than 95 percent of the total use. The amendment would also extend the reverse charge to business-to-business supplies of goods that are in New Zealand at the time of supply (that are treated by existing section 8(4) as not being supplies in New Zealand). 24 An exception (proposed amendment to section 20(4D)) to the prohibition on input tax deductions in section 20(4C) would allow a recipient of distantly taxable goods, that is required to return output tax under the reverse charge, to make an input tax deduction to the extent that the goods are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Example – reverse charge Melissa is a self-employed project manager who is registered for GST. She purchases a phone from a non- resident supplier for $400. At the time of purchase, she identifies herself as a GST-registered person and therefore is not charged GST. She uses the phone fifty percent for her taxable project management services and fifty percent for private use. Under the reverse charge, Melissa is treated as making a taxable supply to herself of $400 at the 15% rate. She must return output tax of $60 ($400 × 15%). However, Melissa can claim an input tax deduction for the portion of her total use of the phone that is for taxable purposes (fifty percent). The amount of the input tax deduction is $30 ($60 × fifty percent). Her net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of $30 ($60 output tax minus $30 input tax). If Melissa’s taxable use of the phone had been 95 percent or more, she would not have been required to apply the reverse charge. The existing reverse charge would only apply when the supply of distantly taxable goods is not treated as a supply in New Zealand. Therefore, the reverse charge under section 8(4B) would not apply when the non-resident supplier decides to zero-rate the supply under section 11(1)(fb) by treating it as being a supply in New Zealand under section 8(4E). In this situation, amended section 20(3JC) would require the recipient of a distantly taxable goods that are zero-rated under proposed section 11(1)(fb), to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the goods. The nominal GST component is the tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply, as if the value (that is, before the addition of GST) were equal to the consideration for the supply. Section 20(3JC) would only apply when at the time of acquisition, or at the end of an adjustment period, the taxable use of the goods is less than 95 percent. This is consistent with the proposed application of the reverse charge under section 8(4B). Example – output tax adjustment under section 20(3JC) Consider the same example as above, however, this time the supplier decides to treat the phone as a supply in New Zealand, in which case the supply of the phone is zero-rated under section 11(1)(fb). Because the supply is zero-rated, Melissa will be required to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the phone under section 20(3JC). Since the value of the phone is $400, the nominal GST component is $60 ($400 × 15%). The amount of output tax Melissa is required to return is $30; this is calculated by multiplying the nominal GST component ($60) by the non-taxable use of the phone (fifty percent). Note that an equivalent amount of tax is paid on the phone as with the application of section 8(4B). 25 Reverse charge for supplies of $1,000 or less There may be instances when a GST-registered recipient applies the reverse charge and the non-resident supplier also inadvertently charges the recipient GST. In this situat ion, GST would be returned twice on a single supply (by the non-resident supplier and the GST- registered recipient). This issue will likely be resolved if the non-resident supplier subsequently refunds the GST charged to the GST-registered recipient and makes an adjustment under section 25 as described previously (note that an adjustment may still be necessary under section 25AA(1)(a)(iii) to ensure the correct amount of tax is accounted for under the reverse charge in section 8(4B)). To ensure the correct amount of tax is paid in the alternative scenario where the supplier provides a tax invoice under section 24(5B), existing section 25AA would allow the GST- registered recipient to correct the amount of output tax returned and input tax deductions claimed. The recipient would then be able to claim, in the normal manner, a deduction for the portion of the GST that was charged by the non-resident supplier, to the extent that the goods are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. Example – supplier inadvertently charges GST on supply to a registered person and recipient applies the reverse charge Consider the earlier example again, where Melissa has applied the reverse charge under section 8(4B). However, she subsequently finds out that the price for the phone included GST at the standard rate of 15% (3/23 × $400 = $52.17). Melissa contacts the non-resident supplier and requests a refund for the incorrectly charged GST. Instead of providing a refund, the supplier issues Melissa with a full tax invoice, since the value of the supply is $1,000 or less. The tax invoice enables Melissa to claim an input tax deduction to the extent the phone is used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies, which means she can deduct $26.09. The non-resident supplier is also not required to make any adjustments under section 25. Under section 25AA(1)(a)(v), Melissa makes an adjustment in the return for the taxable period in which it is discovered that a mistake has been made to correct the amount of output tax and input tax deductions claimed as a result of applying the reverse charge in section 8(4B). Melissa claims a deduction under section 20(3) for the output tax that she accounted for ($60 – section 25AA(2)) and returns output tax for the input tax deduction she claimed earlier ($30 – section 25AA(3)). 26 PREVENTING DOUBLE TAXATION (Clauses 16, 17, 19(2), 24 and 26(4)) Summary of proposed amendment Under the proposed offshore supplier registration system, Customs would continue to collect GST on imported consignments valued over $1,000. However, a consignment valued over $1,000 may contain distantly taxable goods, on which GST has already been collected by the supplier. The Bill therefore proposes that, for consignments over $1,000, Customs would not collect GST on the distantly taxable goods in the consignment if documentation is provided to Customs showing that GST has already been collected by the supplier. The Bill also proposes a non-double taxation rule to deal with the situation where a supplier of distantly taxable goods is required by legislation in another jurisdiction to charge that jurisdiction’s consumption tax on the supply at a rate of more than zero. In this situation, the supplier would be entitled to make a deduction that offsets the amount of New Zealand GST payable on the supply, to the extent that the supply is subject to a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. Key features Changes to the customs de minimis As part of the proposed offshore supplier registration system, the customs de minimis would be changed to $1,000 based on the total value of the goods in a consignment. The effect of this is that Customs would not collect GST or any other duty on consignments valued at $1,000 or less. This change would occur through an amendment to the Customs and Excise regulations and, as such, is not proposed in this Bill. Exception to the collection of GST on importation Proposed section 12(1B) sets out that GST would not be collected by Customs on consignments over $1,000, to the extent that GST has already been collected at the time of supply on goods in the consignment, provided that Customs is notified that GST has already been collected. Customs would still collect GST on goods in a consignment over $1,000 if it has not received a notification that GST was collected by the supplier. Information requirements To prevent double taxation, the Bill proposes a range of information requirements for suppliers. These information requirements will help to ensure Customs is notified in the approved manner that GST has already been collected on some or all of the goods in a consignment. 27 Under proposed section 24BAC, suppliers of distantly taxable goods would be required to take reasonable steps to ensure tax information is included on relevant customs documents when those goods are imported. The information suppliers would need to take reasonable steps to include on customs documents consists of: • the registration number of the supplier; • which particular goods in the consignment GST has already been collected on; and • which particular goods in the consignment GST has not been collected on. Under proposed section 24BAB, suppliers of distantly taxable goods would need to provide a receipt to consumers if they have charged the consumer GST on some or all of the goods in the transaction. The receipt would be required to show a number of particulars, including the registration number of the supplier and which goods in the transaction GST has been charged on. Refunds when double taxation occurs The Bill proposes that if GST has been collected on the same good by both Customs and the supplier, the supplier would be required to refund the GST they collected to the consumer, but only if the consumer requests a refund and provides a declaration or other confirmation that GST was collected by Customs on the importation of the item. A supplier that has provided a GST refund in this situation would be entitled to make an adjustment in its GST return to correct its net GST position (provided that it has reimbursed the recipient for the GST charged and has received a declaration from the recipient or other confirmat ion that GST was paid to Customs on the importation of the goods). These rules would also apply in the situation where a supplier has incorrectly charged GST on an imported good valued over $1,000. Non-double taxation rule Double taxation could potentially also arise in the situation where a supplier of distantly taxable goods is required by legislation in another jurisdiction to charge that jurisdiction’s consumption tax on the supply at a rate of more than zero. To prevent double taxation from occurring, the Bill proposes that a supplier in this situation would be entitled to make a deduction that offsets the amount of New Zealand GST payable on the supply, to the extent that the supply is subject to a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. Background Requiring non-resident suppliers, marketplaces and redeliverers to collect GST on imported goods with entry values not exceeding $1,000, while Customs is also collecting GST on consignments valued over $1,000, creates the potential for double taxation to occur in some situations. For example, a single consignment could be valued over $1,000 but contain an item or items that, individually, are valued at $1,000 or less. Double taxation could also potentially arise if goods are sold in a foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations occur between the time of supply and the time of importation, resulting in the supplier valuing the good at or below $1,000 and Customs valuing the good above $1,000. 28 Under the proposed amendments, the supplier would be required to collect GST on the distantly taxable goods included in the consignment. However, without the proposed mechanisms to prevent double taxation, Customs would collect GST on the value of the entire consignment, including any goods in the consignment which already had GST collected on them at the point of sale. Double taxation may also arise when a supplier that is registered for a consumption tax in another jurisdiction is required to charge that jurisdiction’s consumption tax on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a consumer in New Zealand at a rate of more than zero, despite the fact that the goods are exported from that other jurisdiction. This may occur when, for example, tax legislation in that jurisdiction requires the goods to be exported within a specified timeframe in order for the supply to be zero-rated, and the supplier fails to meet this requirement for zero-rating. Detailed analysis Change to the customs de minimis As part of implementing the proposed offshore supplier registration system, the customs de minimis would be changed from $60 of duty owing, to $1,000 based on the entry value of the consignment. Customs would therefore collect GST and other duties on imported consignments valued above $1,000, but would not collect GST on consignments valued at or below $1,000. Consignments containing alcohol and tobacco products would not be subject to the de minimis, with Customs continuing to collect GST and excise taxes on these products, regardless of their value. As the customs de minimis is contained in section 70 of the Customs and Excise Regulations 1996, the proposed change to the de minimis would be made using an Order in Council (and for this reason is not proposed in this Bill). Exception to the collection of GST on importation Under proposed section 12(1B), GST would not be collected by Customs on the importation of goods, to the extent that the importation consists of distantly taxable goods on which GST was charged by the supplier at the standard rate of 15%. For this section to apply, the information available to Customs at the time the goods are imported would need to sufficiently identify the items in the consignment on which tax has been charged, the rate at which tax was charged on these items, and the registered person who charged GST on the distantly taxable goods in the consignment. However, Customs would still collect GST on the full value of an imported consignment valued above $1,000 if they are not notified before the time at which GST would be collected at the border that tax was already charged at the rate of 15% on the supply. 29 Example – consignment of distantly taxable goods with total value above $1,000 Jason purchases a phone for $900 and noise cancelling headphones for $200 (excluding GST) from Kim’s Phone Warehouse, a GST-registered non-resident supplier. As both goods individually have an entry value below $1,000, Kim’s Phone Warehouse charges Jason GST on both the phone and the headphones. The phone and headphones are sent to Jason in a single package with a value of $1,100. As the consignment is over $1,000, Customs will stop the consignment for revenue collection. However, provided that evidence is made available to Customs that GST was already collected by Kim’s Phone Warehouse on both the phone and the headphones, Customs would not collect GST on either good in the consignment. Information requirements To help prevent double taxation, the Bill proposes a range of information requirements for offshore suppliers, marketplaces and redeliverers. These requirements will help to ensure that, when GST has been charged at the point of sale, Customs is notified of this in the approved form and does not also collect GST. Receipts Proposed section 24BAB would require a supplier to issue a receipt to a recipient of a supply of distantly taxable goods if the supplier has charged GST at the rate of 15% on the supply. The receipt would need to contain the following particulars: • the name of the supplier; • the registration number of the supplier; • the date of the supply; • the date of issue of the receipt (if different from the date of the supply); • a description of the goods supplied; • the consideration for the supply and the amount of GST included; • information indicating the items for which GST has been charged at the rate of 15%; and • information indicating the items for which the amount of GST charged is zero. The amounts shown on the receipt would not be required to be in New Zealand dollars. Section 24BAB proposes that the supplier would be required to issue the receipt at the time of supply. However, if they have not issued a receipt at the time of supply and the recipient requests a receipt, the supplier would be required to issue one within 10 business days after the request. Under proposed section 143A(1)(fb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a supplier that knowingly fails to issue this receipt within ten business days would have committed a knowledge offence. 30 Requirement to take reasonable steps to ensure tax information is included on relevant customs documents In addition to the requirement to issue receipts, proposed section 24BAC would require suppliers of distantly taxable goods to take reasonable steps to ensure that the relevant GST informat ion is available to Customs at the time of importation of the goods. This requirement would apply to all supplies of distantly taxable goods where GST has been charged at 15% on some or all of the goods in the transaction. The tax information that suppliers would need to take reasonable steps to include on customs documents is the following: • the registration number of the supplier (or deemed supplier); • which goods in the supply have had GST charged at the rate of 15%; and • which goods have not had GST charged (or have had GST charged at the rate of zero). If GST is not charged at the rate of 15% on some items in the transaction, these items must be identified to meet this requirement. This would allow the rule in proposed section 12(1B) that prevents double taxation to operate correctly, as GST on importation will only be switched off to the extent that GST at the rate of 15% has been collected on the item at the point of sale. For goods transported by express freight, the supplier would fulfil the requirement to take reasonable steps by providing the GST information (included on the receipt or tax invoice for the goods) in the commercial documentation provided to the freight forwarder or customs broker, for use in completing the customs documents on behalf of the importer. Customs brokers and transporters would only need to include this information on customs documents if it is provided to them. If this information is not provided, they would not need to take extra steps to source this information. An operator of an electronic marketplace would meet the requirement to take reasonable steps if it includes GST information on commercial documentation which they require an underlying supplier to pass through the logistics chain on their behalf. In relation to goods transported by international post, the transmission of this information may not be accommodated under current systems. Therefore, for goods transported by post, providing a receipt to the customer may currently be sufficient to meet the reasonable steps requirement. The customer would be able to provide the receipt to Customs to prevent Customs from collecting GST again on items that had GST collected by the supplier. What may constitute reasonable steps in relation to goods sent by post may change in the future, as the systems and practices of international postal operators change owing to the increased availability of electronic advance data in the international postal system. Under proposed new section 143A(1)(fc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a supplier would commit a knowledge offence if they knowingly fail to take reasonable steps to ensure that tax information is included on customs documents. 31 Refunds when double taxation occurs Where the relevant tax information is not available to Customs, GST would be collected on importation by Customs on the entire value of a consignment over $1,000. If some or all of the goods in the consignment had already had GST collected on them by the supplier, the consumer would need to request a refund of the GST from the supplier. Proposed new section 12B provides that if a consumer requests a refund of the GST charged by the supplier, and the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient or some other confirmation that GST was paid on importation, the supplier would be required to issue a refund of the GST they charged. If the supplier complies with the requirement under section 12B to issue a GST refund, proposed new section 25(1)(bb) would allow the supplier to make a subtraction from its output tax in its GST return for the amount refunded. Mistakes where GST has been incorrectly charged on a supply Proposed sections 12B and 25(1)(bb) would apply in the situation where a supplier has incorrectly charged GST at the rate of 15% on a supply of imported goods that is not a supply of distantly taxable goods (for example, because the goods individually have entry values above $1,000, and the supplier has not made an effective election to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods). This means that a supplier in this situation would be required to provide a refund of the GST they have charged if the above requirements that the recipient has requested a GST refund, and the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient or some other confirmation that GST was paid on the importation of the goods, are both met. As above, the supplier would only be entitled to make the adjustment under section 25(1)(bb) if: • they have reimbursed the recipient for the GST charged; and • the supplier has received a declaration from the recipient or other confirmation that GST was paid on importation to Customs. This exception from the ability to make an adjustment is necessary to prevent a potential tax advantage from arising, where a supplier incorrectly charging GST on a supply of high-value goods and making the adjustment results in non-taxation (that is, because GST was not collected by Customs on the importation of the goods). Non-double taxation rule Proposed new section 20(3)(dd) would prevent double taxation from arising on supplies of distantly taxable goods to consumers in New Zealand by allowing a deduction that offsets the supplier’s liability for GST in New Zealand, to the extent that the supply is subject to consumption tax in another jurisdiction. Proposed section 20(3)(dd) would provide an input tax deduction for the New Zealand GST charged when: • there is a supply of distantly taxable goods to a person in New Zealand who is not a GST-registered person; and • the supplier has, in relation to the supply, incurred liability for, returned and paid a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. 32 The deduction would be limited to the GST paid on the supply in New Zealand (15%) and to the extent tax is paid and returned in the other country. Example – non-double taxation rule in section 20(3)(dd) Mike, a consumer in New Zealand imports some shirts from a supplier based in Country A, who ships the goods from its warehouse in Country A. The supplier is registered for VAT in Country A and is also registered for GST in New Zealand. In order for the supplier to charge Country A’s VAT at a rate of zero percent on the supply to Mike, VAT legislation in Country A requires the supplier to export the goods within 21 days of the date of the supply. The supplier does not manage to export the goods within this timeframe, and is therefore required to charge Country A’s VAT at the rate of 20%. In addition, the goods are all distantly taxable goods, so the supplier is also required to charge New Zealand GST at the rate of 15% on the supply. The non-double taxation rule in section 20(3)(dd) allows the supplier to make an input tax deduction up to the amount of New Zealand GST returned on the supply (15%) if the supplier has returned and paid VAT to Country A. If Country A’s VAT rate was instead 10%, the supplier would only be entitled to an input tax deduction of 10%. 33 OPTION TO CHARGE GST ON SUPPLIES OF HIGH-VALUE GOODS (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that suppliers (including redeliverers and operators of marketplaces) could also charge GST at the rate of 15% on their supplies of high-value imported goods to consumers, provided that at least 95 percent of the total value of goods that they supply in a specified 12-month period to New Zealand customers are low-value goods. Alternatively, a supplier could choose to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods to consumers if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that the potential revenue risk associated with allowing the supplier to charge GST at the rate of 15% is minimal and agrees to allow the supplier to elect to account for GST on these supplies. Key features Self-assessed 95 percent test for electing suppliers The Bill proposes a self-assessed test for suppliers to determine their eligibility to charge GST on supplies of high-value goods to New Zealand consumers. Under the self-assessed test, suppliers of distantly taxable goods could elect to treat imported goods (other than tobacco and alcohol) valued above $1,000 as distantly taxable goods if it is reasonable to believe that at least 95 percent of the total value of distantly taxable goods that would be supplied to New Zealand consumers in the next 12 months will consist of goods that are individually valued at $1,000 or less. A supplier would need to check annually whether at least 95 percent of the total value of distantly taxable goods that it supplied in the previous 12 months to New Zealand consumers consisted of goods individually valued at $1,000 or less. As long as this test is met, the supplier could continue to charge GST on its supplies of high-value imported goods to New Zealand consumers. If this historical test is not met, the Bill proposes that the supplier would have two options: • The supplier may ask the Commissioner to allow it to continue to treat its supplies of high-value imported goods as distantly taxable goods subject to GST at the rate of 15% (discussed below); or • The supplier must stop treating its high-value imported goods as distantly taxable goods within six months and notify the Commissioner within that timeframe that it will no longer be applying the election. 34 Commissioner discretion to allow suppliers to charge GST on high-value goods It is proposed that the Commissioner would have discretion to allow a supplier to treat its supplies of high-value goods to New Zealand consumers as distantly taxable goods in situations where the self-assessed test is not met. In applying this discretion, the Commissioner would primarily consider any risk to the integrity of the tax system or to the Crown revenue in allowing the supplier to charge GST on its supplies of high-value imported goods. Commissioner’s ability to cancel an election by a supplier In cases of non-compliance, or where a supplier no longer wishes to apply the election, the Bill also proposes to give the Commissioner the power to cancel an election made by a supplier, provided that certain procedures are follo wed. Background Under the proposed rules, the starting point is that a supply by a non-resident to a consumer in New Zealand of goods having individual entry values exceeding $1,000 and that are outside New Zealand at the time of supply, is not subject to GST. Unless suppliers are somehow allowed to standard-rate such supplies, this default rule means that a non-resident supplier would be required to distinguish between individual goods having entry values of $1,000 or less versus those valued above $1,000, and only return GST on the low-value goods. This need to distinguish between low-value and high-value goods may also create complexity for redeliverers and operators of marketplaces who, in the absence of a rule allowing them to elect to be the deemed suppliers of high-value goods and charge GST on these supplies, would only be treated as being the suppliers of goods (that are actually supplied by third parties) to the extent that these goods are low-value goods. Allowing all these types of suppliers to simply account for GST on all their supplies (or deemed supplies) of goods to consumers with delivery addresses in New Zealand, regardless of the value of the individual items, may therefore reduce compliance costs for these suppliers. However, there are some risks involved in allowing suppliers of distantly taxable goods to standard-rate their supplies of high-value imported goods: • Taxing the supply of high-value imported goods while also maintaining the collection of GST at the border on consignments valued above $1,000 increases the potential for double taxation to occur. Suppliers opting to standard-rate their supplies of high-value imported goods would therefore need to ensure they follow processes for preventing double taxation for these goods, so that collection of GST on these items by Customs is effectively replaced by the supplier collecting GST at the point of sale. 35 • On the other hand, reliance on processes for preventing double taxation may involve some revenue risks for the Crown if suppliers are permitted to standard-rate their supplies of high-value imported goods. This risk would arise in situations where a supplier has collected GST (or has purported to have collected GST, so that Customs does not collect GST on the importation of the goods), but fails to return the GST to Inland Revenue. Both the proposed 95 percent test for determining a supplier’s eligibility to treat its supplies of high-value imported goods to consumers as distantly taxable goods, and the associated Commissioner discretion, are intended to balance the potential compliance cost savings to suppliers from being able to charge GST on all of their supplies to consumers against the potential risks involved. In the situation where only a very small proportion of the supplier’s total sales of imported goods to consumers in New Zealand are of goods with entry values above $1,000, the proposed 95 percent test would ensure suppliers are not required to make further systems changes to distinguish between low and high-value goods at the point of sale. The proposed Commissioner discretion is intended to provide some flexibility in other situations where the cost of a further systems upgrade to distinguish between low and high-value goods is likely to be disproportionate to the potential revenue risk (for instance, because the supplier has a good tax compliance history). Detailed analysis Self-assessed 95 percent test for electing suppliers Proposed new section 10C(1) provides that a registered person (referred to as the “electing supplier”) may elect to treat goods with individual entry values exceeding $1,000 as distantly taxable goods if all the following conditions are met: • at the time of the election, the electing supplier has reasonable grounds to believe that 95 percent or more of the total value of distantly taxable goods that it will supply in the initial year (being the 12-month period starting on the first day that the electing supplier intends the election to be effective for) will consist of items having an entry value of $1,000 or less; and • the electing supplier notifies the Commissioner of the election before the start of the first taxable period that it would be effective for; and • the Commissioner has not before the date the election is made by the electing supplier, unilaterally cancelled a previous election by the supplier. Proposed new section 10C(2)(a) provides that an election made under section 10C(1) is effective for the initial year (provided that the self-assessed 95 percent test is met). 36 95 percent test – reasonable grounds requirement The proposed 95 percent test discussed above implicitly requires an electing supplier to firstly assume that it will have made an effective election for the initial year – meaning that for the purposes of determining whether the 95 percent test is met, the electing supplier would include its supplies of high-value imported goods in the “total value of distantly taxable goods supplied by the electing supplier to places in New Zealand” (referred to in proposed section 10C(1)(b)). Having made the above starting assumption, the test then requires the electing supplier to determine whether it is reasonable to believe that the total value of its low-value goods supplied in the initial year will be at least 95 percent of the total value of the distantly taxable goods that it will supply in the initial year. For an electing supplier who is a redeliverer that is treated by proposed section 60E as the supplier, or an electing supplier who is a merchant (that is, a person who is the actual supplier of distantly taxable goods, and is not merely treated by section 60C, 60D or 60E as the supplier), the reasonable grounds requirement above essentially means the following: • The electing supplier has a reasonable belief that 95 percent or more of the total value of goods that it will bring (or assist in bringing) into New Zealand in the initial year of the election will consist of goods having individual entry values of $1,000 or less. • The electing supplier would not include alcohol or tobacco products for the purposes of assessing whether this test is met. For an electing supplier who is an operator of a marketplace (and who would be treated by either of proposed sections 60C or 60D as the supplier of goods sold through its marketplace by non-resident underlying suppliers), the reasonable grounds requirement above means the following: • The marketplace operator has a reasonable belief that 95 percent or more of the total value of goods that would be purchased on or through the marketplace in the initial year of the election, and supplied by non-resident underlying suppliers to customers providing delivery addresses in New Zealand, will consist of goods having individual entry values of $1,000 or less. • As above, the marketplace operator should not include sales of alcohol and tobacco products for the purposes of assessing whether this test is met. 37 Example – supplier making initial election under self-assessed 95 percent test Big Ben’s Bikes, an online British bike, bike parts and bike accessories store, sells and ships goods from its warehouse in London to customers around the world. Big Ben’s Bikes sold $97,000 worth of low-value imported goods to customers in New Zealand in the year 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. Big Ben’s Bikes also sold $3,000 worth of high-value imported goods to New Zealand customers in that year. Therefore, 97 percent of the total value of Big Ben’s Bikes’ supplies of goods to customers in New Zealand that year were of goods individually valued at or below $1,000, which is typical of its annual sales to New Zealand customers (in previous years, Big Ben’s Bikes’ sales of goods valued at or below $1,000 as a proportion of its total sales to New Zealand customers have been within the range of 95 percent to 98 percent). Based on this historical information, it seems reasonable to assume that the 95 percent test will continue to be met in future years. Big Ben’s Bikes wishes to elect under section 10C to charge GST at the rate of 15% on its supplies of high- value goods to customers in New Zealand, and intends that the election be effective from the start of its first taxable period, being 1 October 2019. Big Ben’s Bikes has no reason to expect that it will fail to meet the 95 percent test for the year 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020, so Big Ben’s Bikes self-assesses that it is eligible to make the election. Backward-looking test (proposed section 10C(2)(b) and (c)) Where a supplier has elected to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods under proposed section 10C(1), proposed new section 10C(2)(b), (c) and (d) would apply to determine whether the election is still effective for later years beginning after the initial year covered by the election. Unless the Commissioner has exercised her discretion in proposed section 10C(4) to allow the supplier to continue to apply the election for such taxable periods (discussed later), the supplier would be required under proposed section 10C(2)(b) to continuously meet a similar 95 percent test to that described above if it wishes to continue to apply the election. However, this second self-assessed 95 percent test would be backward-looking (solely based on historical results) instead of forward-looking (based on future expectations). Requirements of the backward-looking test Proposed new section 10C(2)(b) provides that a supplier who has elected to treat its high- value goods as distantly taxable goods for an initial year may continue to apply this election in later years. This would be the case if at least 95 percent of the total value of distantly taxable goods that the electing supplier supplied to New Zealand customers in the most recent year comprised sales of low-value goods. This means that the election would remain effective for subsequent taxable periods beginning after the initial year that the election is made for, provided that the backward- looking 95 percent test is met on an annual basis, beginning after the initial year has ended. 38 High-value goods supplied after election is effective are distantly taxable goods Proposed section 10C(3) provides that, for supplies of goods made in the period during which the election is effective, high-value goods supplied by the electing supplier would be distantly taxable goods (provided that the goods meet the definition of “distantly taxable goods” in proposed section 4B, meaning that they are not alcoholic beverages or tobacco products and that they are delivered at a place in New Zealand). When the backward-looking 95 percent test is not met Proposed section 10C(2)(c) and (d) sets out that if a supplier fails to meet the backward- looking 95 percent test for a 12-month period (referred to as the failing year), the supplier may be able to continue to apply the election for a maximum of six months after the end of the failing year. However, this would be subject to the condition that the supplier notifies the Commissioner within this six-month timeframe of the date on which the effect of the election would end. If the supplier fails to meet this requirement, it would be required to stop treating its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods immediately after the end of the failing year. If an electing supplier wishes to continue to use the election beyond the six-month extension period, the supplier may (as discussed below) apply to the Commissioner for an exercise of her discretion under proposed new section 10C(4). The Commissioner would be able to grant this discretion for an indefinite period if she is satisfied that this is appropriate. Alternatively, if the supplier intends to stop charging GST on its supplies of high-value goods to consumers but needs more time beyond the six-month extension period to make these changes, the Commissioner may grant the discretion for a given period. In this situation, the Commissio ner may be satisfied that it is appropriate to grant an extension (by way of exercising her discretion) if such an extension is needed other than as a consequence of avoidable delay by the electing supplier. Commissioner discretion to allow suppliers to charge GST on high-value goods Proposed section 10C(4) provides that the Commissioner may allow a supplier to make an elect ion to treat its high-value goods as distantly taxable goods, even if the self-assessed 95 percent test in proposed section 10C(1)(b) or (2)(b) (whichever is relevant) is not met. In doing so, the Commissioner may agree with the electing supplier on requirements that are an alternative to the self-assessed 95 percent test. When deciding whether to exercise her discretion under proposed section 10C(4), the Commissioner must be satisfied that the exercise of the discretion appropriately balances the potential fiscal risk against the compliance costs of the requirements for the supplier. In determining whether it is appropriate to allow the electing supplier to apply or continue to apply the election, the Commissioner would take the following factors into account: • Whether the registered person and any associated persons have a good history of previous compliance with New Zealand tax legislation and the tax laws of countries and territories outside New Zealand. • The total value of high-value goods supplied by the electing supplier to New Zealand consumers. • Any other relevant factors. 39 As mentioned above, the Commissioner would be able to apply the discretion indefinitely or for a given period. Situations where the Commissioner may exercise the proposed discretion The Commissioner’s proposed discretion to allow suppliers to elect to treat their high-value goods as distantly taxable goods recognises that there may be some instances where it is difficult for an electing supplier to determine if it is eligible to make the election (or, potentially, if it is eligible to continue to apply the election) under the proposed self-assessed 95 percent test. In this situation, the Commissioner may be satisfied that it is appropriate to allow the supplier to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods to consumers if the supplier has a good tax compliance history. Alternatively, if the supplier does not have a tax compliance history that the Commissioner is aware of, the Commissioner may be satisfied that it is appropriate to exercise this discretion if the supplier can show that it is likely that it will meet the 95 percent test, or if the value of the supplier’s sales of high-value imported goods to consumers in New Zealand is not significant. There may also be instances where it is clear the supplier’s sales of low-value goods as a proportion of its total sales of goods to New Zealand consumers do not meet the 95 percent test, but the Commissioner is nevertheless satisfied that the supplier is a low compliance risk. The Commissioner may determine that it is appropriate to exercise the proposed discretion in this situat ion. Example – exercise of Commissioner’s discretion Consider Big Ben’s Bikes in the previous example. Big Ben’s Bikes finds that it sold $95,000 worth of low- value imported goods to New Zealand customers in the 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020 year. It also sold $5,000 worth of high-value imported goods to New Zealand customers in that year. Therefore, only five percent of Big Ben’s Bikes’ supplies of goods in the initial year of the election being effective were over the low-value goods threshold, so Big Ben’s Bikes may continue to charge GST on these high-value goods for at least another year. After a year, Big Ben’s Bikes finds it supplied $94,000 of low-value goods and $6,000 of high value goods in the year ending 30 September 2021. Big Ben’s Bikes applies to the Commissioner to continue being allowed to charge GST on its supplies of high-value goods. As Big Ben’s Bikes has a good compliance history, only supplies a small amount of high-value goods and had previously been charging GST on its supplies of high- value goods to consumers, the Commissioner exercises her discretion to allow Big Ben’s Bikes to continue charging GST on its high-value supplies. Requirement for the Commissioner to consider the supplier’s compliance history A non-resident supplier that would be subject to these proposals may be unlikely to have a compliance history for New Zealand tax purposes. In considering a non-resident supplier’s tax compliance history, it is proposed that the Commissioner may consider any information she has about the supplier’s compliance with tax laws in other jurisdictions, including that of ent it ies associated with the supplier. 40 If an electing supplier or an entity associated with the electing supplier is already registered for GST in New Zealand (for example, under the remote services rules), and/or has New Zealand income tax obligations, the Commissioner would also take this compliance history into account. Commissioner’s ability to cancel an election by a supplier If a supplier who has made an election requests that the election be cancelled, proposed new section 10C(5)(a) provides that the Commissioner may cancel the election by notifying the supplier of the date on which the election ends. In the situation where the Commissioner unilaterally decides to cancel an election by a supplier (in cases of non-compliance by the supplier), proposed section 10C(5)(b) provides that the Commissioner would: • notify the electing supplier of the date of the proposed cancellation and the reasons for the proposed cancellation; • consider any arguments against the proposed cancellation that are provided by the electing supplier within 30 days from the date of notification, or within a shorter or longer period if the Commissioner considers that period is appropriate in the circumstances; and • notify the supplier of the date on which the election is cancelled. 41 MARKETPLACES (Clauses 5(1), (3), (6), 12(2), 14(3), 30, 34(2) to (4), 35 and 36) Summary of proposed amendment Special rules are proposed to apply when distantly taxable goods are supplied through an electronic marketplace to a consumer with a delivery address in New Zealand. The proposed rules would require the operator of the marketplace, as opposed to the actual supplier of the goods, to register and return GST. Rules are also proposed to allow operators of non-electronic marketplaces to register and return GST on supplies of distantly taxable goods sold through their marketplaces, subject to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s approval. Key features Definitions of “electronic marketplace” and “underlying supplier” Section 2 of the GST Act currently defines an electronic marketplace as a marketplace that is operated by electronic means through which a person (the underlying supplier) makes a supply of remote services by electronic means through another person (the operator of the marketplace) to a third person (the recipient). The Bill proposes to amend the definit io n to include a marketplace operated by electronic means through which an underlying supplier makes a supply of goods to a recipient. This definition includes a marketplace operated via a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace. It excludes a marketplace that solely processes payments. The Bill also proposes a definition of “underlying supplier” to be included in section 2. An “underlying supplier” is defined as the person that would be the supplier of the goods or services for GST purposes in the absence of the marketplace rules. Electronic marketplace rule Section 60C of the GST Act currently applies to supplies of remote services made to a person resident in New Zealand through an electronic marketplace operated by a non-resident. The section treats the operator of the electronic marketplace, as opposed to the underlying supplier, as the supplier for GST purposes. The Bill proposes to amend sect ion 60C so that it will also apply to supplies of goods made to a person in New Zealand through an electronic marketplace. 42 Section 60C would not apply when: • the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; • the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed in a document signed by them that the supplier is liable for the payment of tax; and • the electronic marketplace does not: – authorise the charge to the recipient; – make or authorise the delivery to the recipient; or – directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made. An amendment is also proposed to extend the existing rule in section 60C(3) for remote services to supplies of distantly taxable goods. Section 60C(3) currently applies when multiple electronic marketplaces may be liable to register and return GST in relation to a supply of remote services. In this situation, the first operator that authorises a charge or receives payment for the supply is treated as making the supply. If no operator exists that meets this requirement, the first operator that authorises delivery of the supply is treated as making the supply. Approved marketplace rule Similar to the rule that applies to electronic marketplaces, section 60D allows non-electronic marketplaces (such as a syndicate providing insurance services to New Zealand residents) to register as a marketplace, subject to the Commissioner’s approval. The Bill proposes to amend section 60D for approved marketplaces so that this rule would apply to non-electronic marketplaces for goods (in addition to non-electronic marketplaces for remote services). An approved marketplace, and not the underlying supplier of the goods, would then be treated as the supplier for GST purposes. Residency of underlying suppliers The proposed extension of the marketplace rules in sections 60C and 60D to supplies of goods would only apply when goods are supplied by non-resident underlying suppliers. This means that the person who operates the marketplace through which the supply of goods is made would be treated as the supplier, and would therefore be required to return GST on goods sold through its marketplace by non-resident underlying suppliers. However, a marketplace would not be deemed to be the supplier of (and should not return GST on) goods supplied by residents. Because the definition of “distantly taxable goods” includes all goods that are treated by section 60C or 60D as having been supplied by a marketplace operator (regardless of where the goods are situated at the time of supply), the location of the goods at the time of supply is not relevant for determining whether the marketplace operator is the supplier of distantly taxable goods under section 60C or 60D. 43 This residency rule for supplies of distantly taxable goods can be contrasted with the existing marketplace rules for remote services. Under the rules for remote services, the residency of the underlying supplier is not relevant for determining whether the marketplace operator is deemed to be the supplier of the services. This existing rule for remote services is not proposed to change. Repeal of residency rule for marketplace operators The rules for electronic marketplaces and approved marketplaces in sections 60C and 60D currently only apply to non-resident marketplace operators. The Bill proposes to repeal the requirement in these sections for the marketplace to be operated by a non-resident person. This would extend the marketplace rules for both remote services and distantly taxable goods to marketplaces operated by New Zealand residents. Specific rule for underlying suppliers Section 60(1C) is a specific rule that currently applies to New Zealand-resident underlying suppliers supplying remote services through a marketplace. In this situation, the underlying supplier and marketplace operator may treat the supply as two separate supplies: • a supply of services from the underlying supplier to the operator; and • a supply of those services from the operator of the marketplace to the recipient. An amendment is proposed to section 60(1C) so that this rule also applies in the situation where a GST-registered non-resident underlying supplier makes a supply of remote services or distantly taxable goods to a consumer in New Zealand through a marketplace (that is, so that the non-resident underlying supplier is treated as making a supply to the marketplace operator). This would allow the non-resident underlying supplier to claim input tax deductions for New Zealand GST on expenses incurred in making the supply. Discounts provided by marketplace operators The Bill proposes to clarify the amount of GST that a marketplace operator would be required to return on a supply of remote services or distantly taxable goods that it is treated by section 60C or 60D as the supplier of. The proposed amendment would apply in the situation where the operator provides a discount for a product sold on its marketplace by an underlying supplier to a New Zealand consumer. The amendment would ensure that the marketplace operator is only required to return GST on the amount that the consumer actually paid for the supply of goods or services (and not on the amount of the discount provided by the marketplace). Bad debt deduction rule There may be situations where an operator of a marketplace may not receive the payment for a supply of distantly taxable goods sold on its marketplace by an underlying supplier (as the payment may be made by the recipient directly to the underlying supplier). In this situation, a marketplace operator that is treated by either of sections 60C or 60D as the supplier of the goods would need to collect the amount of GST that it is required to return on the supply from the underlying supplier. 44 To provide relief in the situation where a marketplace operator is unable to collect from the underlying supplier the GST that it is required to return, the Bill proposes a special bad debt deduction rule that would apply only to marketplace operators. Under the proposed rule, a marketplace operator would only be able to claim a bad debt deduction in its GST return if it wrote off the full amount of money owed by the underlying supplier in relation to the supply, including the marketplace’s sales commission or facilitation fee. A marketplace operator that had claimed a bad debt deduction and later recovered all or some of the debt in a subsequent taxable period would be required to return GST to the extent of the recovery. Exception to electronic marketplace rule for suppliers that are both resident and non- resident The Bill proposes that an operator of a marketplace would be able to use a range of objective proxies to determine if an underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident or a non-resident. Explanation of these methods (contained in proposed new section 60G) is provided in a later sect ion of this Commentary. In the situation where a non-resident underlying supplier has a branch in New Zealand, there is a possibility that an operator of a marketplace using a method in proposed section 60G may conclude that the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident, and accordingly not return GST on supplies made by the underlying supplier. A limited exception to section 60C is therefore proposed to deal with this potential issue, so that the marketplace operator’s treatment of supplies made by the non-resident underlying supplier is validated in this situation. This is intended to ensure that there is clarity about which party (the electronic marketplace operator or the underlying supplier) has the liability to return GST on the supply. Background Requiring an electronic marketplace to register instead of its underlying suppliers may reduce overall compliance costs under the offshore supplier registration system, as this would mean that some non-resident suppliers would not be required to register for GST in New Zealand. It may be the case that without the proposed marketplace rules, a relatively large number of smaller suppliers making supplies to New Zealand consumers exceeding $60,000 annually would be required to register for GST. Requiring intermediaries to register for GST in this context has been a relatively recent international development. Australian legislation requires an operator of an “electronic distribution platform” to register for and return GST on supplies of imported services, intangibles and low-value goods. An operator of an electronic distribution plat form is required to account for GST on a supply made by a third party when the platform controls any of the key elements of the supply such as delivery, charging or terms and conditions. These proposed rules are modelled on similar rules currently in operation in a number of jurisdictions for imported services and intangibles. It is likely that many of the electronic marketplaces that would be required to register under the proposed rules will already be registered in Australia. Therefore, to avoid confusion and to promote compliance, the rules proposed are intended to be broadly consistent with the rules in Australia. 45 Detailed analysis Definitions of “electronic marketplace” and “underlying supplier” A marketplace is a medium that allows consumers and suppliers of goods and services to interact in order to facilitate the sale and purchase of the goods and services. “Electronic marketplaces” refers to virtual marketplaces where consumers and suppliers do not physically interact (typically, online marketplaces). The proposed definition of “electronic marketplace” requires that: • the marketplace allows underlying suppliers to make supplies of goods or remote services through the marketplace to customers; • the marketplace is operated by electronic means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace; and • supplies of remote services made through the marketplace must be made by electronic means, but this requirement does not apply to supplies of tangible goods made through the marketplace. As at present, providers that solely process payments will continue to be specifically excluded from the definition of electronic marketplace under the proposed amendments. Solely for the purpose of the marketplace rules, the Bill defines an “underlying supplier” as the person that would be the supplier of the goods and services in the absence of the marketplace rules in sections 60C and 60D. Electronic marketplace rule Section 60C currently treats the operator of an electronic marketplace as making a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity if the relevant supply is of remote services supplied by an underlying supplier to a recipient who is a New Zealand resident. In addition to this existing rule for remote services, the proposed amendments to section 60C would treat the operator of an electronic marketplace as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity in certain situations. This would apply when: • the goods are supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier; • the operator of the electronic marketplace or the underlying supplier makes, arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • the goods have individual entry values of $1,000 or less. This rule would also apply in situations where an electronic marketplace operator has elected to charge GST on goods with an entry value above $1,000 (discussed in an earlier section of this Commentary), meaning that the operator would be deemed to be the supplier of these high-value goods for GST purposes. 46 Consistent with the existing rules for remote services, the operator of the electronic marketplace would not be considered to have made the supply if it does not control any of the key elements of the supply, and the liability of the underlying supplier is made clear in the documentation relating to the transaction. Accordingly, under the proposed amendments to section 60C, the non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace would not be deemed to be the supplier if all the following conditions are satisfied: • the electronic marketplace does not authorise the charge to the recipient, or authorise the delivery of the supply, or directly or indirectly set any of the terms or conditions under which the supply is made; • the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the operator of the marketplace; and • the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed in writing that the supplier is liable for GST. As a result of being treated as making the supply, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be responsible for returning GST. The operator would include these supplies in its turnover for the purposes of determining whether the registration threshold is exceeded and, if it is exceeded, would be liable for the GST. The operator would also make any adjustments arising from the supply, for example, when incorrectly charged GST is refunded to a GST- registered business. Where multiple electronic marketplaces are liable for GST on a single supply of remote services or of distantly taxable goods, an existing priority rule in section 60C(3) provides that the first operator that authorises a charge or receives payment for the supply is treated as the supplier. If none of the marketplaces involved meet this requirement, the first operator that authorises delivery of the supply would be treated as making the supply. Approved marketplace rule Similarly to the rule that applies to electronic marketplaces, existing section 60D allows non- electronic marketplaces (such as a syndicate providing insurance services to New Zealand residents) to register as a marketplace subject to the Commissioner’s approval. The operator, and not the underlying supplier, is treated as making the supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Amendments to section 60D are proposed so that the rules for approved marketplaces may apply for goods supplied by non-residents, as well as supplies of remote services. New section 60D(2)(c) sets out that an approved marketplace for goods would be treated as making a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity in circumstances where: • the Commissioner approves an application made by the operator of the marketplace under subsection (2); • the goods are supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier; • the operator of the marketplace or the underlying supplier makes, arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand; and • the goods individually have entry values of $1,000 or less (if the marketplace operator has not elected to charge GST on high-value goods). 47 When exercising this discretion to approve a marketplace under section 60D, subsection (3) provides that the Commissioner may take the following into account: • whether the marketplace is best placed to determine whether the recipient of the supply of goods is a registered person; and • whether the number of underlying suppliers selling through the marketplace means that return requirements are better satisfied by the marketplace rather than the individual underlying suppliers. Residency of underlying suppliers As mentioned above, a marketplace operator would only be treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods if the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident. This is in contrast with the existing marketplace rules for remote services, which (as illustrated in Table 1) apply to supplies made by both resident and non-resident underlying suppliers. The proposed marketplace rules for goods would not require the marketplace operator to distinguish between goods that are outside New Zealand at the time of supply versus those that are already in New Zealand. This is because all goods that are treated by section 60C or 60D as supplied by a marketplace operator are included in the definition of “distantly taxable goods”, regardless of where the goods are situated at the time of supply.

Is the good supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier? Good is not deemed to be supplied by an operator of an electronic marketplace YesNo Does the good have a value of $1,000 or less at the time of supply? Does the marketplace do any of the following: • Directly or indirectly set a term or condition under which the supply is made? • Authorise the charge for the supply to the recipient? • Authorise the delivery of the supply to the recipient? Does the documentation provided to the recipient identify the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace operator? Have the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace agreed that the underlying supplier is liable for the GST? Good is not deemed to be supplied by the marketplace operator Good is deemed to be supplied by the marketplace operator NoYes Yes No Yes Yes Has the operator of the electronic marketplace made an election under section 10C to charge GST on goods with entry values above $1,000? No YesNo Good is deemed to be supplied by the marketplace operator No Yes No Good is not deemed to be supplied by the marketplace operator 49 Repeal of residency rule for marketplace operators The Bill proposes to repeal the rule in sections 60C(1)(b) and 60D(1)(b), which restricts the application of the marketplace rules to marketplaces operated by non-residents. This means that the marketplace rules for distantly taxable goods and remote services would apply to marketplaces operated by residents, in addition to those operated by non-residents. Specific rule for underlying suppliers Non-resident suppliers that make supplies of remote services and goods through marketplaces may already be registered for GST under existing rules. It is also possible that some non-residents selling goods through marketplaces may become liable to register in their own right under the proposed rules for distantly taxable goods if they also make non- marketplace supplies (for instance, through their own website or mail order). Some of these non-resident underlying suppliers may incur New Zealand GST on their inputs for making supplies of remote services and goods. If these suppliers were subject to the general rule under proposed section 60C(2) or proposed section 60D(2), they would not be entitled to make input tax deductions for their expenses in making these supplies, as the operator of the marketplace would have been treated as the supplier for GST purposes. This would mean that GST incurred by the underlying supplier in making these supplies would be unrecoverable. An amendment to existing section 60(1C) is proposed to treat the supply as two separate supplies – a supply of goods or remote services from the underlying supplier to the operator of the marketplace, and a supply of those same goods or services from the operator to the recipient. The first supply to the marketplace operator would be zero-rated under either existing section 11A(1)(jc) or proposed section 11(1)(jb). This will generally enable the non- resident underlying supplier to recover the GST costs incurred in making the supply. Another amendment to the wording of section 60(1C) would also mean that the underlying supplier can unilaterally choose to treat the supply as two separate supplies. The current wording of section 60(1C) requires the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace to agree to treat the supply as two separate supplies. Example – remote services Games Pty Ltd., an Australian app developer that is registered for GST in New Zealand, contracts with App Store Co., an operator of an app store, to distribute its smartphone games. App Store Co. collects payments from customers and authorises delivery of the app. App Store Co. is treated as the supplier under proposed section 60C, and therefore is responsible for GST on the supply. If, as a result of proposed section 60C, App Store Co. makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of remote services that are made through its marketplace to New Zealand-resident consumers. Even though App Store Co. is treated as the supplier of the app for GST purposes (because of proposed section 60C), under proposed section 60(1C), Games Pty Ltd. can treat its supply of the app as a zero-rated supply to App Store Co. (as a separate supply to the supply that App Store Co. is deemed to make). This will allow Games Pty Ltd. to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies of the app through App Store Co. 50 Example – distantly taxable goods Page Turners, a US-based book seller that is registered for GST in New Zealand, uses Books Marketplace, an electronic marketplace, to advertise and sell its books to customers in New Zealand. Books Marketplace sets some terms and conditions and collects payments from customers. Books Marketplace is treated as the supplier under proposed section 60C, and is therefore responsible for GST on the supply. If, as a result of proposed section 60C, Books Marketplace makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of goods that are made through its marketplace to customers with a delivery address in New Zealand. Even though Books Marketplace is treated as the supplier, under proposed section 60(1C), Page Turners can treat its supply as a zero-rated supply to Books Marketplace (as a separate supply to the supply that Books Marketplace is deemed to make). This will allow Page Turners to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies of books through Books Marketplace. Discounts provided by marketplace operators The Bill also proposes a special valuation rule to deal with the situation where an operator of a marketplace provides discounts for remote services or distantly taxable goods that it is deemed to be the supplier of. The scenario where a marketplace operator provides a discount for a product sold on its marketplace by an underlying supplier is illustrated in the example below. Example – marketplace provides discount for distantly taxable goods sold by underlying supplier Trev, a non-resident supplier of sporting goods and accessories based in Australia, sells goods to consumers around the world using the online marketplace A Co. Mali, a consumer in New Zealand, purchases a rugby league jersey priced at $50 plus GST if any from Trev on the A Co. platform. At the online checkout, Mali provides her home address in Auckland for the delivery of the goods. Because the entry value of the jersey is less than $1,000 (being $50) and because the delivery address for the supply is in New Zealand, A Co. is deemed to be the supplier of the jersey for GST purposes. This means that the jersey is a distantly taxable good (and therefore the supply of the jersey is subject to GST at the rate of 15%). The GST-inclusive price of the jersey is therefore $57.50 ($50 + $7.50 in GST). A Co. offers a discount of $5 on the price of the jersey, which Mali accepts at the checkout before paying for the goods. A Co. pays for the discount, so Trev still receives the GST-exclusive price of $50 plus $20 for shipping to New Zealand. The final price paid by Mali is $75.50, consisting of: • $52.50 for the jersey ($57.50 less $5); • $20 for shipping to New Zealand; and • $3 GST on the shipping charge. Given that A Co. is treated as the supplier of the jersey for GST purposes, one may expect the total amount of GST that A Co. would be required to return on the supply to be $9.85 (being 3/23 × $52.50 + $3). However, in the absence of a rule that treats the $5 discount provided by A Co. as a reduction in the total consideration for the supply, there is a potential argument that A Co. has provided $5 in third-party consideration for the supply (despite the fact that A Co. is deemed to be the supplier of the goods). If A Co. is considered to have provided third-party consideration, the amount of GST that A Co. would be required to return on the supply is $10.50 ($7.50 + $3). 51 To deal with the issue illustrated in the above example, proposed new section 10(7D) provides that where an operator of a marketplace is deemed to make a supply of remote services or distantly taxable goods, the consideration for the supply would not include the amount of a discount that is paid for by the marketplace operator for the recipient of the supply. This means that the amount of GST that the marketplace operator would be required to return on the supply would be 3/23 of the total GST-inclusive amount paid by the recipient. Bad debt deduction rule An operator of a marketplace may collect GST on a supply it is deemed to make in one of two ways: • The marketplace operator arranges for the payment from the customer to be split when the payment is processed, with the amount of GST and the marketplace’s facilitation fee or commission remitted to the operator and the sale price excluding GST and the amount of the fee or commission on the sale remitted to the underlying supplier of the goods or services. • Alternatively, the customer may pay the underlying supplier directly, and the marketplace operator collects the GST along with its fee or commission from the underlying supplier. In the second scenario, the marketplace operator may at times be unable to collect the GST from the underlying supplier. To prevent marketplace operators in this situation from being liable for GST that they are unable to collect, proposed new section 26AA would allow them to claim a bad debt deduction if: • the underlying supplier fails to pass on the GST paid to them for the supply; and • the operator of the marketplace has written off as a bad debt all amounts for the supply, including its fee or commission on the sale. Proposed section 26AA(1) specifies that the rule would apply to a marketplace operator that is treated by section 60C or 60D as making a taxable supply of goods or services if the underlying supplier of the goods is not an associated person, and the marketplace operator: • charges the underlying supplier a fee for making the supply through the marketplace; • accounts for output tax on the supply and files a return for the taxable period during which the supply was made; • has an agreement with the underlying supplier under which the underlying supplier is required to pay, from the consideration the underlying supplier receives from the customer, an amount that includes the GST on the supply that the marketplace operator has accounted for; and • the marketplace operator writes off as a bad debt the entirety of the amount referred to above (along with the entire amount of the marketplace’s fee, if not already included in this amount). 52 Proposed section 26AA(2) provides that the marketplace operator may make an input tax deduction (or account for a reduction in its output tax, if the marketplace has registered under the simplified “pay only” system, discussed later) equal to the amount of GST charged on the supply. In the situation where the marketplace operator recovers an amount of the bad debt that was written off in an earlier taxable period, proposed new section 26AA(3) would require the operator to account for an amount of output tax that is a fraction of the amount of the input tax deduction (or output tax reduction) claimed earlier. This fraction would be calculated by dividing the amount recovered by the total amount written off. Example – marketplace writes off amount owed by underlying supplier as a bad debt Derek, a consumer in New Zealand, purchases a vinyl record listed on the A Co. online marketplace from Retro Audio, a non-resident supplier. The price of the record, including shipping (but excluding GST) is $40. At the online checkout, Derek provides an address in New Zealand for the goods to be delivered. Consequently, A Co. is deemed to be the supplier of the vinyl record for GST purposes. The supply of the record is a supply of distantly taxable goods subject to GST at the rate of 15%. The GST-inclusive price of the record is therefore $46 ($40 + $6 in GST). Instead of paying by a method that would provide A Co. with some control over the processing of the payment (such as by credit card), Derek opts to pay Retro Audio directly by internet banking transfer. A Co. has an agreement with Retro Audio that if a customer pays Retro Audio directly, Retro Audio is required to pay A Co. the amount of GST on the sale, along with A Co.’s commission of five percent on the total sale price. The amount of the debt that Retro Audio owes A Co. is therefore $8.30 ($6 in GST, plus commission of $46 × 5% = $2.30). Retro Audio defaults in paying the debt to A Co, so A Co. writes off the full amount of $8.30 as a bad debt. A Co. can therefore claim a bad debt deduction of $6 in its GST return for the amount of the GST on the supply. If A Co. subsequently recovered any of the debt in a later taxable period, it would be required to return output tax in its GST return for that taxable period, to the extent of the amount of the recovery. For example, if A Co. managed to collect $4.15 from Retro Audio, the fraction given by section 26AA(3) would be 4.15 ÷ 8.30 = ½. A Co. would therefore be required to return $3 in output tax (½ × $6 = $3). If, instead of writing off the full amount as a bad debt, A Co. only wrote off a fraction of the amount as a bad debt, A Co. would not be able to claim a bad debt deduction in relation to the supply. Exception to electronic marketplace rule for underlying suppliers that are both resident and non-resident Applying the proposed marketplace rules for goods to just those supplies of goods made through marketplaces by non-resident underlying suppliers necessitates the inclusion of rules for marketplace operators to determine the residency of their underlying suppliers. Proposed new section 60G (discussed later in this Commentary) sets out a range of objective proxies that marketplace operators would be able to use to determine if an underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident or a non-resident. 53 The definition of “resident” in section 2(1) of the GST Act treats a person as a resident of New Zealand to the extent that the person carries on a taxable activity or other activity in New Zealand, and has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. For example, a non-resident company with a branch in New Zealand that carries on its New Zealand operations through a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand is New Zealand resident for GST purposes, but only to the extent of the activity carried on in New Zealand through its fixed or permanent place. There are two potential situations that may arise under the proposed marketplace rules in relat ion to a non-resident company that has a New Zealand branch and which makes supplies of goods to consumers in New Zealand through a marketplace: • The supply of goods through a marketplace to the customer in New Zealand may be part of the New Zealand branch’s taxable activity (that is, if the New Zealand branch is treated as a separate entity, it would be the person that makes the supplies). In this case there is no problem with the marketplace operator treating the underlying supplier as a resident, because in the context of this sales activity it is in fact a New Zealand resident under the GST Act, and is likely to already be registered for GST in New Zealand. • The supply of the goods is completely unrelated to the New Zealand branch’s activity (that is, an overseas branch or division of the company makes the supply). Under the proxies set out in proposed new section 60G (which include information that the marketplace operator may have in relation to its underlying suppliers, such as bank details, New Zealand GST registration numbers and physical addresses), it is possible that the marketplace operator may reach the conclusion that the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident. However, because the underlying supplier in the context of this particular supply is actually a non-resident, section 60C would (in the absence of a specific exception) treat the electronic marketplace operator as the supplier of the goods for GST purposes. This may mean that the underlying supplier of the goods is not the supplier for GST purposes, potentially resulting in zero GST being collected on the supply. To address the issue in the second scenario, proposed new section 60C(2C) contains a limited exception to the electronic marketplace rule in section 60C. Proposed section 60C(2C) provides that an operator of an electronic marketplace would not be treated as the supplier of goods that are actually supplied by a non-resident underlying supplier if all the following conditions are met: • the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident that has a branch in New Zealand; • the operator of the marketplace treats the underlying supplier as a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply (meaning that the operator does not return GST on the supply); and • in treating the underlying supplier as a New Zealand resident, the operator of the marketplace relies on a method for determining the underlying supplier’s residency that is set out in section 60G, or on an alternative method agreed with or prescribed by the Commissioner under section 60G (discussed later). 54 This would ensure that the liability for the GST would remain with the underlying supplier in this situation, validating the marketplace operator’s treatment of the supply if it has determined (based on a section 60G method) that it is not the supplier of the goods for GST purposes. Example – non-resident underlying supplier with New Zealand branch treated by marketplace as resident Clothes ‘N’ Stuff Pty Ltd is an Australian-incorporated company that is non-resident for income tax purposes. It carries on activity in New Zealand through a fixed or permanent place, being Clothes ‘N’ Stuff’s retail outlet in Auckland. To the extent of the activity carried on through or related to the Auckland retail outlet, Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is treated by the GST legislation as a New Zealand resident and accordingly is registered for GST in New Zealand. Clothes ‘N’ Stuff also carries on an activity of selling goods to customers in Australia and New Zealand through the A Co. online marketplace. In most cases the goods are shipped directly from a warehouse in Sydney, but in some cases goods sold to a New Zealand customer may instead be sourced from the retail outlet in Auckland in order to provide faster a delivery time. A Co. has on record a New Zealand GST registration number for Clothes ‘N’ Stuff, as well as the physical address of the Auckland retail outlet, the fixed landline number for the Auckland retail outlet, and a declaration from Clothes ‘N’ Stuff that it is a New Zealand resident under the GST Act. On the basis of the information that it holds and in accordance with the requirements in section 60G, A Co. determines that Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is a New Zealand resident for GST purposes. A Co. therefore does not collect and return GST on Clothes ‘N’ Stuff’s supplies to consumers in New Zealand. Although Clothes ‘N’ Stuff is likely to be a non-resident in relation to most of the supplies it makes through the A Co. marketplace (insofar as this sales activity is unrelated to the Auckland retail outlet), the liability for New Zealand GST on any supplies of distantly taxable goods to consumers in New Zealand would remain with Clothes ‘N’ Stuff. This is because section 60C would not apply to treat A Co. as the supplier of the goods (owing to the exception in section 60C(2C)). 55 REDELIVERERS (Clauses 5(5), 12(2), 15(2) and 37) Summary of proposed amendment Special rules are proposed to apply when a “redeliverer” brings (or assists in bringing) goods to New Zealand, and neither the actual supplier of the goods nor an operator of a marketplace delivers (or arranges or assists delivery) of the goods to New Zealand. The proposed rules would require the redeliverer to register and return GST on the supply of the goods. Key features Definition of “redeliverer” A proposed addition to section 2(1) of the GST Act defines a redeliverer as a person who, under an arrangement with the recipient of the goods, delivers the goods to New Zealand, or arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to New Zealand, and does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. Redeliverer rule Under the proposals, a redeliverer would be treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity if all the following conditions are satisfied: • if the redeliverer has not made an election under section 10C to charge GST on goods with entry values above $1,000, the goods individually have individual entry values of $1,000 or less; • no operator of a marketplace is the supplier under section 60C or 60D; and • the seller or actual supplier of the goods does not deliver, nor arrange or assist the delivery of the goods to New Zealand. Priority rule where multiple redeliverers are involved The Bill proposes a priority rule to provide certainty about which redeliverer is liable for GST in the situation where multiple redeliverers are involved in bringing distantly taxable goods to New Zealand. The proposed rule sets out that the redeliverer that first enters into an arrangement with the recipient of the goods would be the person that is treated as making the supply. If no such arrangement exists, the first redeliverer to enter into an arrangement with any other person acting on the recipient’s behalf would be treated as the supplier. 56 Special valuation rule for redeliverers’ deemed supplies of goods In situations where a redeliverer is deemed to be the supplier of distantly taxable goods, the price paid to the actual supplier will not include New Zealand GST. This means that the redeliverer should return GST on the supply on the basis that the price is GST-exclusive, which requires a special valuation rule for supplies of distantly taxable goods deemed to be made by redeliverers. Under the proposals, the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods by a redeliverer would be equal to the consideration paid by the recipient for distantly taxable goods, before the addition of GST. This means that the amount of GST to be returned by the redeliverer on the deemed supply of the goods would be 15% of the price paid by the recipient for the goods. Amendment to zero-rating rules for international transportation services The Bill proposes an amendment to ensure that services provided by redeliverers in relation to goods that are deemed to be supplied by the redeliverer will be subject to GST at the rate of 15%, provided that the supply of the goods themselves is also subject to GST at the rate of 15%. The value of the redeliverer’s services would be equal to the consideration for the supply of the services with the addition of GST (meaning that the amount of GST is 3/23 of the GST- inclusive price paid by the recipient). Background Redeliverers may be used by consumers when the supplier or marketplace does not offer shipping to New Zealand. Typically, the good is instead shipped to an overseas “hub” or mailbox, from which the redeliverer then ships the good to New Zealand. Since the supplier or marketplace in this situation may not know that the final destination of the good is in New Zealand, it would be unreasonable to require them to charge GST. Redeliverers would, however, know the final destination of the goods they are “redelivering”. They should also know the value of the goods to be redelivered to New Zealand, as the consumer is generally required to provide a value for their parcel as part of the arrangements with the redeliverer for payment and delivery of the goods to New Zealand. For these reasons, it is proposed that in these situations, redeliverers would be required to register and return GST instead of the actual suppliers or sellers of the goods, if the value of the redeliverer’s total supplies in New Zealand (including its deemed supplies under proposed section 60E) exceed the $60,000 registration threshold. Requiring redeliverers to collect and return GST instead of the actual supplier or a marketplace operator recognises that when consumers engage the services of a redeliverer to “redeliver” their goods to New Zealand, it is the redeliverer who would be best placed to know the location to which the goods are being delivered. 57 Detailed analysis Definition of “redeliverer” A redeliverer may be a person that provides a “mailbox” service, meaning that they provide the use of an overseas delivery address for consumers purchasing goods from offshore suppliers. These types of redeliverers would receive or collect the goods from the overseas address and deliver the goods to the consumer’s address in New Zealand, or arrange the collection and delivery of the goods to the customer in New Zealand. The proposed definition of “redeliverer” also includes persons that provide personal shopping services to consumers in New Zealand in relation to goods sold by offshore suppliers. The proposed definition of “redeliverer” requires that the person who is acting as a redeliverer has an arrangement with the recipient of the goods. Under this arrangement, the person either delivers the goods to New Zealand, or arranges or assists the delivery of the goods to New Zealand, and does one or more of the following: • provides the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • arranges or assists the use of an address outside New Zealand to which the goods are delivered; • purchases the goods outside New Zealand as an agent of the recipient; or • arranges or assists the purchase of the goods outside New Zealand. Redeliverer rule Proposed section 60E sets out that a person acting as a redeliverer would be treated as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity if all the following conditions are satisfied: • no operator of an electronic marketplace is the supplier of the goods under section 60C; • no operator of a non-electronic marketplace is the supplier of the goods under section 60D; • the actual seller or supplier of the goods does not deliver, nor arrange or assist the delivery of the goods to New Zealand; and • when the redeliverer is treated as the supplier of the goods, the supply the redeliverer is deemed to make is of distantly taxable goods (meaning that the goods, or some of the goods, have individual entry values of $1,000 or less, or the redeliverer has made an election under proposed section 10C to charge GST on goods with entry values above $1,000). This means that a redeliverer would only be treated as the supplier of the goods for GST purposes if neither the actual supplier, nor an operator of a marketplace, delivers or assists in delivering the goods to New Zealand. If either does deliver or assist in delivering the goods to New Zealand, one of these entities will be responsible for GST on the supply instead of the redeliverer. This is consistent with the policy intent that the redeliverer provisions apply in limited circumstances, where these other entities are unaware that the goods will be sent to New Zealand. 58 Priority rule where multiple redeliverers are involved In some circumstances, more than one person may meet the definition of a redeliverer in relation to a single supply of distantly taxable goods. This would occur when more than one redeliverer is involved in an arrangement to deliver goods to a place in New Zealand. For example, one entity acting as a redeliverer may contract with another entity to purchase the goods as an agent of the consumer. Proposed new section 60E(2) contains a priority rule to deal with the situation where multiple redeliverers may be liable for GST on a supply of distantly taxable goods to a consumer in New Zealand. The proposed rule sets out that the redeliverer that first enters into an arrangement with the recipient of the goods would be the person that is treated as making the supply. If no such arrangement exists, the first redeliverer to enter into an arrangement with any other person acting on the recipient’s behalf would be treated as the supplier and therefore responsible for GST. Special valuation rule for redeliverers’ deemed supplies of goods Proposed new section 10(7C) contains a special valuation rule for supplies of goods deemed to be made by redeliverers under section 60E. The rule sets out that the value of a supply of distantly taxable goods by a redeliverer is an amount equal to the consideration paid by the recipient for the goods before the addition of GST. This rule means that the amount of GST on the supply of goods that the redeliverer would be required to return would be equal to 15% of the price paid by the recipient to the supplier for the goods. This recognises that the price charged by the supplier of the goods did not include GST. Amendment to zero-rating rules for international transportation services Under the existing rules in section 11A(1) of the GST Act, the supply of international transportation and associated insurance services is zero-rated, as are services that are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. This generally means that services provided by redeliverers (which would largely consist of international transportation and handling, storage and logistics provided in relation to goods that are located offshore, or the arranging or facilitation thereof) are effectively not taxed, as the supply of these services would typically be subject to GST at the rate of 0% under existing rules. However, proposed new section 11A(1D) sets out that paragraphs (a), (c), (cb), (d) and (f) in section 11A(1) do not apply to a supply of services provided by a GST-registered redeliverer if those services are provided in relation to distantly taxable goods that section 60E deems the redeliverer to be the supplier of. This means that the redeliverer’s services would be taxed in the same way as the goods the redeliverer brings or assists in bringing to New Zealand (as any transportation or associated facilitation services provided by the redeliverer in relation to a supply of distantly taxable goods being delivered to an address in New Zealand would also be taxed at the rate of 15%). 59 The value of a supply of distantly taxable goods and related transport and facilitation services by a redeliverer would therefore be equal to: • the consideration paid by the recipient for the distantly taxable goods before the addition of GST (meaning that the amount of GST on the deemed supply of the goods is 15% of the price paid by the recipient for the goods); plus • the consideration for the supply of the redeliverer’s services with the addition of GST (meaning that the amount of GST on the supply of the redeliverer’s services is 3/23 of the GST-inclusive price paid by the recipient). Example – redeliverer providing a mailbox service Matt, a consumer in New Zealand, contracts a redeliverer called C Co. to pick up a laptop bag from a UK address that C Co. provided to Matt and deliver it to Matt’s home address in Wellington. Matt paid $40 for the bag including the amount charged by the supplier for shipping from its retail store in London to C Co.’s UK address. When arranging for the goods to be redelivered to Matt’s Wellington address, Matt tells C Co. that he paid $40 for the goods. C Co. charges $15 plus GST if any for its services as redeliverer in bringing the goods to New Zealand. As the entry value of the laptop bag is less than $1,000 (being $40), the laptop bag is a distantly taxable good. C Co. charges Matt $23.25, made up of: • $6 in GST, which is 15% of the $40 Matt paid the UK supplier for the goods; • $15 for C Co.’s redelivery services; and • $2.25 in GST, which is 15% of C Co.’s GST-exclusive fee for its services. C Co. returns $8.25 in GST to Inland Revenue when it files its GST return. Example – redeliverer providing a personal shopping service Marie is a redeliverer who regularly purchases clothes as an agent for Carolyn. Marie facilitates the delivery of the goods into New Zealand by arranging for a freight company to deliver the clothes to Carolyn’s address in Oamaru. The USA suppliers that sell the clothes have no role in bringing the goods to New Zealand. Carolyn paid $720 for a dress that Marie purchased as her agent. This included $20 for the cost of shipping from the USA stores to Marie’s address overseas. Marie charged Carolyn $40 (exclusive of GST) for her services as a redeliverer in bringing the dress to New Zealand. As the entry value of the dress is less than $1,000 (being $720), the dress is a distantly taxable good. Marie is registered for GST and determines the supply is a taxable supply. Marie charges Carolyn $874, made up of: • $720 to reimburse Marie for the purchase of the dress (including the $20 charge for delivery to Marie’s USA address); • $108 in GST, which is 15% of the $720 Carolyn paid for the dress; • $40 for Marie’s facilitation and delivery services; and • $6 in GST, which is 15% of Marie’s $40 GST-exclusive fee for her services. Marie returns $114 in GST to Inland Revenue when she files her GST return. 60 ADMINISTERING THE OFFSHORE SUPPLIER REGISTRATION SYSTEM (Clauses 7(3) to (9), 18, 32, 37, 38(2) and 39) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments contain several features to reduce costs for offshore suppliers, marketplaces and redeliverers in complying with their obligations under the rules. These measures will be complemented by simplified registration and return filing processes that Inland Revenue is developing for these customers. Many of these amendments are extensions of the existing rules applying to supplies of remote services. An amendment proposes that the Commissioner would have the discretion to require a person who has knowingly provided altered, false or misleading information to register for GST and to repay the GST that should have been charged, when their behaviour is repeated or when a substantial amount of GST is involved. Key features Misrepresentations by recipients of distantly taxable goods The Bill proposes amendments to sections 5(27) and 51B(7) that will extend a discretion for the Commissioner to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged on a supply of distantly taxable goods. This would apply when the person has knowingly provided incorrect information that leads to GST not being charged on a supply, and this behaviour is repeated or a substantial amount of GST is involved. Taxable periods Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods would have calendar quarterly taxable periods. Proposed section 15(7) provides that from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020, these suppliers would by default have a taxable period of six months, with the option to elect to have quarterly taxable periods right from the start of the rules. Simplified GST returns Simplified “pay only” GST returns will be available for use by non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods. However, non-resident suppliers that claim input tax deductions for any New Zealand GST costs will be required to file full GST returns. Expressing amounts in a foreign currency Amendments to section 77 are proposed that would allow a supplier of distantly taxable goods that are subject to the new rules to choose to express the amount of consideration for their supplies in a foreign currency at the time of supply, with the amounts being converted into New Zealand currency at a later date. 61 Holding records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English Section 75(3F) would be amended to provide an automatic exception for non-resident suppliers that only supply remote services or distantly taxable goods from the requirement to apply to the Commissioner for authorisation to keep and retain records in a language other than English or at a place outside New Zealand. Exception from the bank account requirement Existing section 24BA(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would provide an exception for non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods to the requirement for an offshore person to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account to obtain an IRD number. No amendments to section 24BA(1B) are required to achieve this. Methods for marketplace operators and redeliverers to determine GST treatment of supplies Proposed sections 60C and 60E would deem operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to be the suppliers of goods that are actually supplied by third parties in certain circumstances. This means electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers would need to rely on information provided by underlying suppliers or by customers to determine the GST treatment of these supplies. The Bill proposes some default rules (based on objective proxies) that electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers could use to determine how much GST they are required to return on supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers that are actually made by third parties. The Bill also proposes to provide the Commissioner with discretion to prescribe or agree to alternative methods for electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers to make conclusions relevant to whether they are treated as making a supply of goods under section 60C or 60E, and/or the amount of GST payable. These default rules and the proposed Commissioner discretion (contained in proposed new section 60G) would reduce compliance costs for electronic marketplace operators and redeliverers in situations where they are unable to strictly apply the proposed rules (owing to insufficient commercially available information), by allowing the person to use other relevant information that is commercially available. Discretion to register underlying supplier or consumer for GST Marketplace operators and redeliverers using a default method under proposed new section 60G or an alternative method under a “safe harbour” agreement would be protected from any additional GST liability in situations where they have (in good faith and consistent with the method set out in the legislation or in an agreement with the Commissioner) relied on incorrect or misleading information provided by another party. In these situations, the Commissioner would have discretion to register the person who provided the incorrect or misleading information (the underlying supplier or the consumer) and require them to pay the underpaid GST if the behaviour is repeated or the amount underpaid is substantial. 62 Detailed analysis Misrepresentations by recipients of remote services Existing sections 5(27) and 51B(7) provide the Commissioner with discretion to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged on a supply of remote services, when: • the person has knowingly provided information that is altered, false or misleading, which leads to a supply being treated as being zero-rated or as not being supplied in New Zealand; and • the person has repeatedly and knowingly provided altered, false or misleading information, or the amount of GST that was not charged is substantial. The Bill proposes to extend sections 5(27) and 51B(7) to also apply to supplies of distantly taxable goods. The existing “knowledge offences” are also expected to apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information for the purpose of avoiding GST by misrepresenting themselves as a registered business (section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994). A person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to $25,000 for a first-time offence, or $50,000 for repeated offences. Example – consumer knowingly provides incorrect information Luke purchases a number of low-value goods online from an overseas supplier, including electronics and clothing. To avoid paying GST, Luke has provided a false GST registration number. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to register Luke from the time the goods were supplied and requires him to repay the GST that was not charged, plus penalties and interest. Taxable periods Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods that would be subject to the proposed rules would have quarterly taxable periods. This is consistent with the existing rules applying to non-resident suppliers of remote services. Proposed section 15(7) sets out that non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods would, by default, have a taxable period of six months from 1 October 2019 to 31 March 2020, unless the supplier elects to file on a quarterly basis for the first six months of the rules. The supplier would be able to make this election by notifying the Commissioner of the election or by filing a return for the 1 October 2019 to 31 December 2019 quarter by the due date for that return. The six-month taxable period would only apply to non-resident suppliers that are required to register as a result of the new rules. Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods that also supply remote services or other taxable supplies would not be able to elect to have a taxable period of six months. 63 From 1 April 2020, all non-resident suppliers that only make supplies of distantly taxable goods and/or remote services would be required to have quarterly taxable periods (see the proposed amendment to section 15(6) in clause 18(1) of the Bill). Simplified GST returns Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods would be able to file pay-only GST returns. These returns are simplified and only include fields relevant to returning GST such as the amount of supplies to customers in New Zealand and the GST required to be paid. Non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods that want to claim New Zealand GST on any expenses they have incurred in making taxable supplies would need to file a full GST return. Expressing amounts in a foreign currency Existing section 77(1) requires that all amounts are expressed in New Zealand currency at the time of supply. This means that if a supply is paid for in a foreign currency, the value of the supply must be expressed as the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. However, section 77(2) provides non-resident suppliers of remote services with the option of expressing amounts at the time of supply in a foreign currency. Suppliers of remote services that opt to do this are required under section 77(3) to elect to convert the foreign currency amounts into New Zealand dollars on either: • the last day of the relevant taxable period; • the date the supplier files their return for the relevant period (or the due date for filing if the return was filed past the due date); or • another date agreed between the supplier and the Commissioner. Once a supplier has made an election under section 77(3), section 77(4) locks them into this election for two years. The Bill proposes to extend sections 77(2), (3) and (4) to also apply to non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods. Holding records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English Section 75(3F) provides an automatic exception to the requirement to keep and retain records in English or at a place in New Zealand for non-resident suppliers of remote services. The Bill proposes an amendment to section 75(3F) so that it also applies to non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods. The requirement to keep and retain records in English and at a place in New Zealand would therefore not apply to a non-resident whose only supplies are remote services and/or distantly taxable goods. 64 Exception from the bank account requirement The Tax Administration Act 1994 generally requires an offshore person to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number. This is to ensure that an offshore person has first been subjected to New Zealand’s anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules. However, existing section 24BA(1B) of the Tax Administration Act provides an exception to this requirement for a non-resident supplier who requires an IRD number solely because they are a non-resident supplier of goods and services. No amendments are required to section 24BA(1B) to enable the section to also apply to non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods. Methods for marketplace operators and redeliverers to determine GST treatment of supplies Proposed sections 60C and 60E would deem operators of electronic marketplaces and redeliverers to be the suppliers of goods that are actually supplied by third parties, but only if the goods are destined for a delivery address in New Zealand and, in the case of marketplace operators specifically, the underlying supplier of the goods is a non-resident. In some situations, an electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer may not have the precise information that is required to determine the GST treatment of a supply of goods, as this information may only be available to the underlying supplier and/or the recipient of the supply. In these situations, the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer would need to rely on information collected from the underlying supplier or the consumer to determine the GST treatment of these supplies. Proposed new section 60G(2), (3), (4) and (5) sets out a range of objective proxies that redeliverers and operators of electronic marketplaces would be able to use to determine if they are the supplier of distantly taxable goods under section 60C, and/or the amount of GST required to be returned on a supply of distantly taxable goods. These proxies (which are all based on information that may be commercially available to redeliverers or operators of electronic marketplaces) are explained below. Electronic marketplaces – proxies for determining residency of underlying suppliers An operator of an electronic marketplace that does not know the residency of an underlying supplier would be required under proposed section 60G(2)(a) and (5) to treat the underlying supplier as a New Zealand resident if the marketplace operator has any of the following: • information that the underlying supplier is a company that is incorporated in New Zealand or has its centre of management in New Zealand (see section 60G(2)(a)(i); • a New Zealand business number for the underlying supplier (see section 60G(2)(a)(ii); or • a declaration from the underlying supplier that it is a New Zealand resident, along with at least two of any of the following items of information that support the conclusion that the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident (see section 60G(2)(a)(iii) and (5): 65 – an address of a physical location for the underlying supplier, such as a mailing or billing address; – a New Zealand GST registration number for the underlying supplier; – bank details (including the account the underlying supplier uses for making payments, or the billing address held by the bank, or the account to which the marketplace operator makes payments of amounts owed to the underlying supplier); – the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the underlying supplier or another geolocation method; – the mobile country code of the international mobile subscriber identity stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the underlying supplier; – the location of the underlying supplier’s fixed land line; or – other commercially relevant information. Proposed section 60(2)(b) requires the marketplace operator to treat the underlying supplier as a non-resident if a conclusion that the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident is not supported by any of the three proxies outlined above. In other words, unless at least one of the three proxies described above supports the conclusion that an underlying supplier is a resident, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be required to presume that the underlying supplier is a non-resident. Electronic marketplaces – proxies for determining if delivery address is in New Zealand While it is expected that operators of electronic marketplaces would generally have information about the delivery address for a supply of goods, there may be some instances where the recipient of the goods does not provide the delivery address through the marketplace but instead communicates with the underlying supplier through another medium. In this situation, the best that an operator of an electronic marketplace may be able to do is to rely on proxies for the country or territory that the recipient’s delivery address is most likely to be in, based on the information that it does have. An operator of an electronic marketplace in this situation would be able to use objective proxies to determine whether the delivery address is most likely to be in New Zealand. Under proposed section 60G(3) and (5), an electronic marketplace operator that does not know the address to which the goods are to be delivered would be required to determine whether a supply of goods is made to the recipient at a place in New Zealand on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence (similar to the rule in proposed section 60G(2)(a)(iii) for determining the residency of an underlying supplier and the existing rule in section 8B(2) for remote services). Proposed section 60G(5) provides a list of indicators that can be used for these purposes: • an address of a physical location for the recipient, such as a mailing or billing address; • bank details (including the account the recipient uses for making payments, or the billing address held by the bank, or the account to which the marketplace operator makes payments of amounts owed to the recipient, if applicable); • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the recipient or another geolocation method; 66 • the mobile country code of the international mobile subscriber identity stored on the SIM card used by the recipient; • the location of the recipient’s fixed land line; • other commercially relevant information. The marketplace operator would be able to use one or more pieces of other commercially relevant information to determine whether a person is usually located in New Zealand, rather than using the specific indicators listed. This information might include the recipient’s trading history (such as a previous billing address) or the product purchased if it is linked to a geographic location (for example, some vouchers may only be used in a particular country). Information provided by a third party, such as by a payment service provider, could also be used if it is commercially relevant. Under proposed section 60G(3)(a)(ii), if the marketplace operator has more than one set of evidence that meets this test, where one set supports the conclusion that the recipient is usually located in New Zealand and the other supports the opposite conclusion, the marketplace operator is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Which specific items of evidence are considered to be more reliable will depend on the circumstances. Redeliverers – default method for determining entry value of goods Proposed section 60G(4) contains a default rule for redeliverers to determine the entry value of goods that they bring or assist in bringing to New Zealand. The proposed default rule would apply to a redeliverer who is not responsible for the purchase of goods that it brings or assists in bringing to New Zealand in its capacity as a redeliverer. This proposed rule would require the redeliverer to: • prior to the delivery of the goods to a place in New Zealand, obtain a declaration from the recipient of the amount paid for the goods; and • obtain confirmation of the amount paid by the recipient for the goods from the seller of the goods. The second requirement above would not require the redeliverer to have any interaction with the seller or actual supplier of the goods. If the actual supplier has included an invoice in the package in which the goods have been shipped to the redeliverer, checking the amount of consideration shown on the invoice against the amount declared by the recipient would be sufficient to satisfy the second requirement. Commissioner discretion to agree or prescribe alternative methods In some instances, a redeliverer or an operator of an electronic marketplace may not have sufficient commercially available information to apply the default methods described above, or another method that is not covered by the default rules may be more reliable. For additional flexibility, proposed new section 60G(6) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe or agree to methods for marketplace operators and redeliverers to make conclusions relevant to whether they are treated by section 60C or 60E as making a supply of distantly taxable goods in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, and/or the amount of GST payable. 67 Proposed section 60G(7) allows the Commissioner to take the following factors into account when exercising the discretion: • Commercially relevant information that is available to the marketplace operator or redeliverer and the reliability of this information. • Compliance costs of the marketplace operator or redeliverer in complying with the requirements of the default method. • The existing mechanisms the marketplace operator or redeliverer has to prevent and address situations where incorrect information is provided. Liability for GST if person has relied on a section 60G method Under proposed new section 60F, a marketplace operator or redeliverer that has relied on a default method set out in proposed section 60G (or that has a safe harbour agreement with the Commissioner under section 60G(6)), would be prevented from being held liable for GST that should have been returned if they have underpaid GST to Inland Revenue solely as a result of relying on incorrect or misleading information provided by another party. Proposed section 60F applies when a redeliverer or an operator of an electronic marketplace makes a return of a deficient amount of output tax for a taxable period as a consequence of relying on inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information provided by the recipient of a supply of goods or by the seller or underlying supplier of the goods. In this situation, proposed section 60F(2) provides that the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer has a reduction in its total output tax allocated to the relevant taxable period that is equal to the amount of the deficiency, provided that the requirements of section 60G are met. This means that in the situation where the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer has correctly relied on a method that is prescribed in the legislation or agreed with the Commissioner and discovers there is a shortfall in the amount of output tax returned, the person would not be liable to account for the output tax shortfall. Example – agreed method for determining residency of underlying suppliers A Co. is a marketplace operator, whose underlying suppliers may be resident in New Zealand or in other countries. A Co. agrees with the Commissioner on the method it will use to determine the residency of underlying suppliers, based on the information that is commercially available to it. As part of the agreement, A Co. has governance mechanisms to prevent mistakes, which include: • deploying technology to detect when underlying suppliers provide incorrect information relevant to their residency; • educating underlying suppliers on the consequences of providing incorrect information (which include tax penalties that may apply); • taking actions to remove the underlying supplier from its marketplace where incorrect information has been provided, if necessary; and • in agreed circumstances where a significant amount of tax is at stake, providing information to the Commissioner about underlying suppliers that have provided incorrect information, to allow the Commissioner to use her powers to collect GST from the underlying supplier. This agreement means that A Co. has certainty that it can rely on certain information to support conclusions that it is not responsible for GST on a supply because the underlying supplier is a New Zealand resident. If it is later discovered that the underlying supplier is not a New Zealand resident, A Co. will not be exposed to additional GST liability (as the amount of the output tax reduction given under section 60F(2) would offset the amount of output tax that should have been returned). 68 Discretion to register underlying supplier or consumer for GST Proposed sections 5(27)(b)(iii), 5(28), 51B(7) and 51B(8) would provide the Commissioner with discretion to register an underlying supplier or consumer and require them to pay the GST shortfall. Similar to existing sections 5(27) and 51B(7), the Commissioner would only be able to exercise the discretion in situations where: • either the underlying supplier or consumer provides altered, false or misleading information which has resulted in GST being underpaid; and • the amount of GST is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. However, unlike section 5(27), proposed new section 5(28) does not require the incorrect information to have been provided for the purposes of avoiding GST applying to the supply in the situation where an underlying supplier has provided altered, false or misleading information to an electronic marketplace operator. This is because the underlying supplier’s intention may be difficult to establish in practice. In cases where the discretion is exercised by the Commissioner, proposed section 5(27)(b)(iii) and (28) set out that the consumer or underlying supplier would be treated as making a supply charged with GST at 15%. Proposed section 51B(7) or (8) treats the person as being registered from the date on which the first supply the discretion is exercised for is made. This would ensure the Commissioner has the ability to collect unpaid GST in situations where the marketplace operator or redeliverer has correctly relied on a default or prescribed method or is protected by a safe harbour agreement. However, the discretion to require the underlying supplier or consumer to pay the GST shortfall would not apply if the electronic marketplace operator or redeliverer has not used a default method set out in section 60G or a method agreed with or prescribed by the Commissioner. This is intended to ensure there is a clear hierarchy where the marketplace operator or redeliverer is the supplier for GST purposes, and therefore ensure the person has an incentive to take reasonable precautions to prevent an incorrect GST treatment from arising. 69 VOUCHERS (Clause 7(1) and (2)) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is proposed to provide suppliers of face value vouchers (that may be redeemed for remote services or distantly taxable goods) with the option of treating the supply as arising on the redemption of the voucher. Another proposed amendment clarifies that if GST applies on the redemption of a voucher for goods and services, the party redeeming the voucher for goods and services is the party that is responsible for returning the GST. Key features Paragraph (a) is inserted into section 5(11G) to enable a supplier of a token, stamp or voucher with a face value to treat the supply of goods and services that the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for as the relevant supply for GST purposes if the goods and services are remote services or distantly taxable goods. This means that the seller of a face value voucher would have the option of treating GST as applying on the redemption of the voucher, if the voucher is (or could be) redeemed for remote services or distantly taxable goods. This option to treat the supply as arising on redemption would apply regardless of whether the issuer or seller of the voucher is a different person to the supplier of the goods and services that the voucher is redeemed for. Paragraph (b) of the amended section 5(11G) sets out the current rule that when a supply of goods and services that a face value voucher is redeemed for is not of remote services or distant ly taxable goods, the seller of the voucher may treat GST as applying on the redemption of the voucher if all of the following conditions apply: • It is not practical to treat the issue or sale of the voucher as a supply of goods and services. • The supplier of the goods and services and the issuer or seller of the voucher are, or could be, different persons. • The issuer and the supplier of the goods and services, or the seller of the voucher and the supplier agree that GST is payable on redemption of the voucher, or are parties to an agreement to that effect. An amendment to the introductory wording of section 5(11G) clarifies that if GST is payable on the redemption of a voucher, the party redeeming the voucher for goods and services is liable for the GST. 70 Background The GST Act contains special rules for vouchers, tokens and stamps. The default rule is that GST applies on the issue of a voucher (the issue basis). However, a significant exception provides the option for GST to apply on the redemption of a voucher (the redemption basis) if the voucher has a face value, and the issuer of the voucher and the supplier of the goods and services that it is redeemed for are separate persons and agree to use the redemption basis. Since the introduction of the GST rules for remote services, the GST treatment of vouchers in the cross-border context has not been clear. This problem would be exacerbated by extending the current voucher rules to vouchers that can be used for purchasing distantly taxable goods. It is possible that a New Zealand-resident consumer may use this type of voucher to purchase goods for delivery in another country, or in limited cases, goods that are over the $1,000 threshold, in which case New Zealand GST should not apply under the distantly taxable goods regime. While the redemption basis can be used when the issuer and redeemer of the voucher is not the same person, the issue basis is the only option if the issuer and redeemer is (or is treated as, such as in the case of an electronic marketplace) the same person. Therefore, the redemption basis ought to be able to be used for vouchers that can be redeemed for any remote services or distantly taxable goods. Further, in situat ions involving vouchers that can be redeemed for either domestic or cross- border supplies, where there are more than two parties involved (that is, where the issuer, seller and redeemer of the voucher are different persons), the GST legislation is unclear as to which party has the liability to return the GST. In line with common practice, this should be the party redeeming the voucher. 71 AGENCY RULE (Clause 34(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to extend the scope of an existing agency rule to provide agents acting for non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods the ability to agree with the supplier to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply. Key features An existing agency rule in section 60(1A) and (1AB) allows New Zealand-resident agents acting for non-resident suppliers that supply remote services to New Zealand-resident consumers to agree with the supplier to treat the agent (and not the principal) as making the supply in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by them. The bill proposes to extend the scope of the existing rule so that New Zealand-resident agents acting for non-resident suppliers of distantly taxable goods may agree with the supplier to treat the agent as making the supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. If this option is exercised, the agent would be required to register and return GST on the supplies of distantly taxable goods. Since the agent is a New Zealand resident, they would be treated as any other resident supplier of goods and services and, therefore, would be required to return GST on both supplies to New Zealand consumers and GST-registered businesses. 72 73 Ring-fencing 74 75 RING-FENCING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 49 and 65) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed rules in the Bill are intended to ensure that investors will no longer be able to deduct expenditure relating to their loss-making residential investment properties from their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income), to reduce their tax liability. This will be done by allocating deductions for residential land to the next income year, to the extent those deductions exceed income from residential land. Application date The rules are proposed to apply in full from the start of the 2019–20 income year. Key features The key features of the proposed new rules are as follows: • The rules are proposed to apply to “residential land”, using the same definit io n of “residential land” that already exists for the bright-line test. However, the rules would not apply to the taxpayer’s main home; property subject to the mixed-use asset rules; property that will be taxed on sale; property owned by widely-held companies; or certain employee accommodation. • The default position will be that the rules apply on a portfolio basis, meaning that investors would be able to offset deductions for one residential property against income from other properties – essentially calculating their overall profit or loss across their portfolio. However, taxpayers will be able to elect to apply the rules on a property-by- property basis. • Ring-fenced residential property deductions will be able to be offset against residential rental income from future years, and income on the sale of residential land, to the extent of reducing the taxable gain (after all other deductions) on the sale to nil. Any remaining unused deductions will generally continue to be ring-fenced. In some situations where residential properties end up being taxed on sale, remaining unused deductions may be released, so they can be offset against other income. • A rule is proposed to prevent interposed entities being used to circumvent the deduction ring-fencing rules. This rule would apply where someone has borrowed to acquire an interest in an entity, and in a particular income year over fift y percent of the entity’s assets are residential properties. 76 Background Under current New Zealand tax settings, tax is applied on a person’s net income. Deductions that relate to particular activities or investments are not generally ring-fenced. This means there is generally no restriction on deductions for a loss-making activity or investment reducing a person’s net income and therefore tax liability (although there are some exceptions to this general treatment). While rental housing is not formally tax favoured, there is an argument that it may be under- taxed given that tax-free capital gains are often realised when rental properties are sold. The fact that rental property investments are often persistently loss-making indicates that expected capital gains are an important motivation for many investors purchasing rental property. While interest and other expenses are fully deductible, not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. There is therefore an argument that, to the extent deductible expenses in the long-term exceed income from rents, those expenses in fact relate to the untaxed gain on sale, so should not be deductible unless the gain is also taxed. Currently investors (particularly highly-geared investors) have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by the reduced tax on their other income sources, helping them to outbid owner-occupiers for properties. The proposed rules ring-fence deductions from residential properties to the extent they exceed residential property income (including income on disposal). This effectively means that investors will no longer be able to offset residential property losses against their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income), to reduce their tax liability. Detailed analysis Property subject to the rules It is proposed that the deduction ring-fencing rules apply to “residential land”, using the same definition of “residential land” that already exists for the bright-line test. “Residential land” means: • land that has a dwelling on it; • land for which there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it; or • bare land that may have a dwelling built on it under the relevant operative district plan rules. “Residential land” does not include: • farmland; or • land used predominantly as business premises. 77 However, some land that would otherwise fall wit hin the definit io n of “resident ial land” for the purposes of the bright-line test would be excluded from the scope of the deduction ring- fencing rules. Main home The focus of the proposed rules is on lo ss-making rental properties, so it is proposed that a taxpayer’s main home be specifically excluded from the scope of the rules. The concept of a “main home” in proposed section DB 18AE is the same as for the purposes of the bright-line test. This would mean that a person can have only one main home, and that to qualify for the exclusion the property has to be used predominantly as the person’s main ho me. If a person has more than one house, like with the bright-line test, their main home is the property they have the greatest connection with. Under the ring-fencing rules, a property would qualify as a person’s main home for a particular income year if it was used predominantly as their main home for most of that year. A significant number of family homes in New Zealand are owned by family trusts. The “main home” exclusion therefore ensures that a home owned by a trust can be regarded as a main home. Like with the bright-line rules, it is proposed that a dwelling owned by a trust only be considered a main home (so not subject to the deduction ring-fencing rules) if it is the main home for a beneficiary of the trust, provided that a principal settlor of the trust does not have a different main home. This restriction would ensure that trust ownership cannot be used to claim multiple properties as main homes, and so not subject to the loss ring-fencing rules. Mixed-use assets The existing definition of “residential land” includes holiday houses that are sometimes used privately and sometimes rented out. Many such properties would be subject to the mixed- use asset rules. The mixed-use asset rules provide for the apportionment of expenditure. Notwithstanding the way expenditure is apportioned under those rules, a mixed-use asset can still be loss- making. This is more likely to occur when the income-earning use of the asset is low. Therefore, the mixed-use assets rules quarantine (or ring-fence) deductions in excess of income from a mixed-use asset where the income-earning use of the asset is low. Under the quarantining rules, a person who makes a loss from a mixed-use asset is not able to offset their excess deductions against other income in the current year, but can take those deductions against any future profits from the asset. However, a person who makes perpetual losses from an asset will never have future profits to offset the excess deductions against, and will therefore not be able to utilise them. Property subject to the mixed-use asset rules is scoped out of the proposed ring-fencing rules, because the quarantining rules for mixed-use asset rules will cover most (if not all) loss- making mixed-use assets. 78 Overseas property The existing definition of “residential land” is not limited to land in New Zealand – it extends to overseas land. It is proposed that the same approach be taken for the ring-fencing rules. This is because it would not be equitable for losses from overseas residential rental investments to be able to be offset against income in New Zealand, but losses from domestic resident ial rental investments not to be. Property that will be taxed on sale The proposed rules will not apply to land that is identified to Inland Revenue as being taxable on sale. This would include land held in dealing, development, subdivision, and building businesses, and land that was bought with the intention of resale. Where land will be taxed on sale, there is not the same concern about some of the deductible expenses relating to untaxed gains, as all of the economic income from the investment will be taxed. Section DB 18AF proposes that only land that will definitely be taxed on sale will be excluded, not land that may be taxed on sale if certain contingencies occur (for example, being sold within a particular time period – such as under the bright-line test). The exclusion for land that will be taxable on sale will be available if eit her: • the taxpayer is notifying the Commissioner of their rental income and expenditure for that property on a property-by-property basis; or • they are notifying the Commissioner of their rental income and expenditure on a portfolio basis and all of the properties within the portfolio are on revenue account. In both of those situations, the deductible expenses that relate to properties that will be taxed on sale are identified, which would not be the case where someone is applying the rules on a portfolio basis and some of the properties in the portfolio will be taxed on sale but some will not be. Property owned by widely-held companies The proposed rules would not apply to land owned by widely-held companies. This will avoid creating compliance costs for companies that hold residential land incidentally to their business (for example, as sites for future development), where there is not the same mischief of offsetting property losses against labour or other income with the expectation of tax-free capital gains. Employee accommodation The proposed rules would not apply to accommodation provided to employees or other workers where it is necessary to provide the accommodation due to the nature or remoteness of the business. This would avoid creating compliance costs for businesses where the mischief the ring-fencing rules are seeking to address is not present. 79 Portfolio basis by default with property-by-property application by election The proposed default position is that the loss ring-fencing rules would apply on a portfolio basis, meaning that investors would be able to offset deductions for one rental property against income from other rental properties – essentially calculating their overall profit or loss across their portfo lio. The alternative would be a property-by-property approach, where each property is looked at separately and deductions for one are not able to be offset against income from another. While in theory this would be more effective in reducing tax benefits to investors, in practice, a property-by-property approach could result in de facto portfolio outcomes. Taxpayers could potentially rebalance their debt funding to minimise the extent to which any particular property is loss-making. This taxpayer response would be inefficient, and may also mean that, in terms of the objective, a property-by-property approach may have no real advantage over a portfolio approach – adding complexity and increasing compliance costs for no gain. However, proposed section DB 18AG would allow taxpayers to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis. This would mean that each property would be looked at separately and deductions for one could not be offset against income from another. If this approach is taken and a particular property ends up being taxed on sale, the net profit or loss for that property would be known, and any ring-fenced deductions in excess of the income from the sale could be released. To apply the rules on a property-by-property basis, the taxpayer would need to notify the Commissioner of their rental income and expenditure for these properties on that basis. Use of ring-fenced deductions If the default portfolio basis is used, ring-fenced residential property deductions could be offset against: • residential rental income from future years (from any property); and/or • income on the taxable sale of any residential land, to the extent of reducing the taxable gain (after all other deductions) on the sale to nil. If the property-by-property basis is used, ring-fenced deductions relating the property could be offset against: • resident ial rental inco me fro m future years from that property; and/or • income on the taxable sale of that property, to the extent of reducing the taxable gain (after all other deductions) on the sale to nil. Generally, any remaining unused deductions would not be released when a property is sold. It is proposed that they continue to be ring-fenced, and carried forward to be used against any future residential rental income or income on other residential land sales (again, to the extent they reduce the taxable gain to nil, after all other deductions). However, it is proposed that ring-fenced deductions be released if a property ends up being taxed on sale and the taxpayer has: 80 • applied the rules on a property-by-property basis (proposed section DB 18AG(6)); or • applied the rules on a portfolio basis and all of the property within the portfolio is sold and was subject to tax on sale (proposed section DB 18AC(5)). In both of those situations, the deductible expenses that relate to properties subject to tax on sale are identified, so there is not the same concern about some of the deductible expenses relating to untaxed gains. All of the economic income from the property or properties will have been taxed (the rental stream and the capital gain). As such, it is proposed that in those situations, if the ring-fenced deductions exceed what is necessary to reduce the taxable gain on the sale to nil, the remainder of the deductions would be released and able to be offset against other income. Excess deductions would remain ring-fenced after a non-taxable sale of property, or after divestment of a portfolio where not all the properties that were in the portfolio were taxed on sale. A taxpayer can choose to treat those ring-fenced deductions as relating to another property (proposed sections DB 18AD and DB 18AH). However, if this is done, the deductions would “taint” the property (and any portfolio it is part of), such that any excess deductions on a taxable sale of that property or taxable divestment of the portfolio would not be released (proposed sections DB 18AC(8) and DB 18AG(9)). The excess deductions would still be able to be used to reduce the taxable gain to nil, but if there are excess deductions beyond that they would remain ring-fenced. Proposed section DB 18AI would allow ring-fenced deductions to be transferred between companies in a wholly-owned group. Often a corporate group will hold rental properties and trading business properties in different entities. It is proposed that the ability to transfer ring- fenced deductions be limited to companies in the same wholly-owned group, as the economic ownership is the same in that situation. Transferred deductions would remain ring- fenced, so they would only be able to be used in the relevant income year to the extent the transferee company has residential rental income or residential land sale income. Any remaining deductions would be carried forward and would remain ring-fenced. Interposed entities The issue Without rules to deal with interposed entities, taxpayers (particularly larger and more sophisticated taxpayers) could get around the ring-fencing rules by interposing an entity (for example, a company) to separate a loan (and interest deductions) from the residential rental property, so the interest deductions are not subject to ring-fencing. For example, a taxpayer could borrow money to buy shares in a company, which uses those funds to buy a residential investment property. Because the interest on the borrowings relates to the individual’s investment in shares in the company, not to the acquisit io n of a residential rental property, the individual would be able to claim deductions for the interest, and offset those deductions against income from other sources. This would be the case even if the residential rental property held by the company was loss-making, or would be loss-making if the interest expense were taken into account (which would be the case if the person had instead purchased the property directly). 81 Using an entity in this way to get around the deduction ring-fencing rules would undermine the credibility of the rules, neutrality, and fairness. As such, the Bill proposes specific rules (proposed sections DB 18AJ and DB 18AK) to deal with the interposing of entities, so this mechanism cannot be used to get around the ring-fencing rules. The proposed solution The interposed entity rules would apply for interest on borrowings to acquire an interest in an entity, if for a particular income year the entity is a “residential land-rich ent it y” – which would be where over fift y percent of the entity’s assets are residential properties. The fift y percent “residential land-rich entity” threshold would take into account all residential properties, not just those within the scope of the ring-fencing rules. This ensures that the interposed entity rule applies even if, for example, the main home was held in the same entity as a rental property (which would often be worth less than the main home). Where the land-rich threshold is met, part or all of the interest on the borrowings would be treated as residential rental property expenditure, and deductions would be ring-fenced. Under the proposed rules, the amount of the interest expenditure that would be treated as residential rental property expenditure would be calculated by reference to the level of the entity’s capital that is applied to acquiring residential property. Also, for companies that are not look-through, regard would be had to the person’s interest in the entity, and, for trusts, to the person’s interest in residential rental property that is trust property. This is illustrated in the example. 82 Example – proposed rules for interposed entities Company X has a $40,000 residential p ro per ty pr of it f o r the year Owns house worth $1m and other assets worth $50,000 Lo an $1 m Bank Company X $1m equity capital (from Ale x) $50,000 debt capital (borrowed from bank) $45,000 interest paid for the year Buys shares for $1m H as 1 00 % of the shar eho lder decision-making rights for Company X Alex More than fifty percent of Company X’s assets are residential property, so Company X is a “residential land- rich entity”. 95.24% of Company X’s capital ($1,000,000 ÷ $1,050,000) was used to acquire residential rental property (this is the “applied capital percentage” in the formula in proposed section DB 18AJ(3)). The “applied capital percentage” is multiplied by the interest expenditure Alex incurred for the year for the borrowings ($45,000), under the formula in proposed section DB 18AJ(3). The amount calculated under that formula is therefore $42,858 (95.24% × $45,000 interest). Alex’s voting interest in Company X is one hundred percent, as he has one hundred percent of the shareholder decision-making rights for Company X. That interest is multiplied by Company X’s residential property profit for the year ($40,000), under the formula in proposed section DB 18AJ(5). The amount calculated under that formula is therefore $40,000 (100% × $40,000). To the extent the amount calculated under the formula in proposed section DB 18AJ(3) exceeds the amount calculated under the formula in proposed section DB 18AJ(5), it is treated as an amount of deductions that relate to a residential rental property owned by Alex. This means that $2,858 of Alex’s interest expenditure is treated as an amount of deductions that relate to a residential rental property owned by Alex. Presuming Alex does not own any residential rental property, the result of the interposed entity rule is that Alex can deduct $42,142 ($45,000 − $2,858) of the interest expenditure. The remaining $2,858 is carried forward and allocated to the next year under the proposed ring-fencing rules. 83 Social policy matters 84 85 STUDENT LOAN DEDUCTIONS FROM WITHHOLDING INCOME (Clauses 83, 86, 91 and 92) Summary of proposed amendment Student loan borrowers who receive schedular, election-day, and casual agricultural income will have student loan repayments deducted from their income by their employer. Application date The amendment will take effect from 1 April 2020. Key feature New Zealand-based student loan borrowers who receive schedular, election-day and casual agricultural income will have student loan repayments deducted from their income by their employer in the same way a salary and wage earner does. As with salary and wage earners, 12% will be deducted from schedular income over the pay- period repayment threshold each payday. A flat rate of 12% will be deducted from election- day and casual agricultural income. An end-of-year calculation will still be required for these borrowers to confirm the correct amount has been repaid. Background Student loan borrowers who earn salary or wages have student loan repayments deducted fro m their inco me. The deductions of 12% are made on each dollar received above the pay- period repayment threshold each payday. If the borrower has other income, the end of the year student loan assessment determines whether additional payments are required. Some borrowers receive schedular, election-day or casual agricultural income which has a similar tax treatment to other employment income. Employers are required to withhold tax from that income in the same way as for PAYE. However, currently student loan obligations for schedular, election-day or casual agricultural income are calculated at year-end. It is proposed that borrowers who receive schedular, election-day or casual agricultural income will also have 12% student loan repayment deductions made from that income. Schedular income will be treated as a primary income source and 12% will be deducted for each dollar over the pay period repayment threshold each payday. Election-day income and casual agricultural income will be treated as secondary income where 12% is deducted from each dollar earned each payday. The amendment is aimed at improving the timeliness of student loan repayments for these borrowers and means end-of-year repayments are smaller or not required. It will also reduce the number of borrowers required to make interim instalments and reduce the number of borrowers getting into debt. 86 INTEREST-FREE STUDENT LOANS (Clauses 87 to 90) Summary of proposed amendment Student loans will transition to Inland Revenue’s new computer system from 1 April 2020. This provides Inland Revenue with an opportunity to stop charging loan interest to New Zealand based borrowers from this date. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2020. Key features Loan interest will not be charged on student loans for New Zealand based borrowers. Background The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2005 introduced interest-free student loans for borrowers living in New Zealand. Under section 134 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, loan interest is charged for all borrowers with a loan balance. Under section 137, the loan interest is reduced to zero for each day that the borrower is New Zealand based. Interest-free student loans were implemented in this manner as this was the best way it could be introduced into Inland Revenue’s systems at that time. The move to Inland Revenue’s new computer system from 1 April 2020 provides the opportunity to rectify this anomaly and stop charging loan interest for New Zealand based borrowers. 87 DEFINITION OF INCOME FOR STUDENT LOANS AND WORKING FOR FAMILIES (Clauses 57 and 93) Summary of proposed amendment The definition of “net adjusted income” that is used for student loan purposes and the definition of “family scheme income” that is used for Working for Families tax credits will be more closely aligned. Application date The amendment to the Income Tax Act will apply from Royal assent. The amendments to the Student Loan Scheme Act will apply from 1 April 2020. Key features For the definition of “family scheme income”, a separate legislative provision is proposed which will include non-beneficiary income from a trust as family scheme income when a person is not a settlor. For the definition of “net adjusted income”, the following are proposed: • The adjustment for major shareholders in a close company will be amended to take into account the interests of dependent children in the close company. • Certain contributions to retirement savings schemes will be excluded from net income. An amount of depreciation loss allowed in the 2002–03 or earlier years will be excluded from net income. Background One of the factors that determines social policy entitlements is the relevant definition of “income”. The current approach for social policy products, including the Student Loan Scheme, is to use a common definition of “income”, such as the Income Tax Act definition of “net income”, and to make adjustments to include or exclude other specific types of income as appropriate. 88 Changes were made to the Working for Families definition of “family scheme income” in 2011. These changes broadened the definition and were intended to improve the fairness and integrity of Working for Families by, for example, countering arrangements that have the effect of inflating entitlements beyond what people’s true economic circumstances justify. In 2014, similar amendments were made to align the definition of income used for student loan purposes with that used for Working for Families. A number of minor areas have been identified where the definitions are not aligned or where wording changes would improve clarity, reduce misunderstanding and prevent structuring. For the definition of “family scheme income”, a separate legislative provision is proposed which will include non-beneficiary income from a trust as family scheme income when a person is not a settlor. In relation to student loans, the following are proposed: • For the undistributed income from close companies adjustment, alignment of the voting interest percentage with the percentage used for Working for Families tax credits income. This will include an associated persons test to prevent opportunities to structure shareholdings in close companies to reduce student loan repayment obligations. • For the specific retirement savings contributions adjustment, alignment of the adjustment with the other social policy payments. This brings in a previously approved policy which was not implemented at the time. • Alignment for depreciation loss allowed on the sale of a building. 89 DAY COUNT TEST AMENDED (Clauses 84 and 85) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment clarifies the operation of the day count test in sections 22 and 23 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 for determining if a borrower is New Zealand or overseas- based. An unintended change occurred in the rewrite of the Student Loan Scheme Act in 2011, that omitted a tiebreaker provision which made it unclear if borrowers who return to New Zealand after more than five months but less than six months overseas are New Zealand or overseas-based. This amendment ensures that the law continues to operate as intended. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 April 2012, the commencement date of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. No student loan borrowers will be disadvantaged by this application date. Key features The proposed amendment to section 23 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 reinstates a tiebreaker provision to ensure that a borrower cannot be treated as absent from New Zealand for the purpose of the 184 day test for any day on which they are treated as being physically in New Zealand under section 22. That is, borrowers who return to New Zealand after being overseas for less than six months would not become overseas-based borrowers. Other minor drafting amendments are also made to sections 22 and 23 to incorporate the tiebreaker provisio n. Background Under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, borrowers are either overseas-based or New Zealand-based. This status effects their repayment obligations and their eligibility for an interest write off on their student loans. Under section 23 a borrower becomes overseas- based after spending 184 days overseas. Periods in New Zealand of up to 31 days in total over this period are treated as being overseas to prevent borrowers from returning for very short periods to sustain their New Zealand-based borrower status. Section 22 contains equivalent provisions that require overseas-based borrowers to return to New Zealand for 183 days to become New Zealand-based. 90 The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 contained a tiebreaker provision that specified that where there were periods that could qualify a borrower as being overseas-based or New Zealand-based, the borrower would be treated as New Zealand-based. This tiebreaker provision had the effect of clarifying that where borrowers returned to New Zealand within 31 days of the end of the 184 day period, they could continue to be New Zealand-based if they subsequently stayed in New Zealand for the 183 day qualifying period. An equivalent tiebreaker provision was inadvertently not included in the rewrite Bill. 91 CHILD SUPPORT (SEX OFFENCE VICTIM EXEMPTION) (Clauses 76 to 81) Summary of proposed amendment The amendments will give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to grant an exemption to the victim of a sex offence in cases when there is not a convicted offender. They will also give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to determine the most appropriate start date for the exemption. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of Royal assent. Key features The following changes are proposed to the Child Support Act 1991: • Amend section 89Y so that a liable parent who is a victim of a sex offence may apply for the exemption from paying child support when the liable parent believes another person has committed the offence (even if there is no finding that the person has committed the offence) (clause 76). • Amend section 89Z so that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has discretion to: – grant the exemption for child support if in the opinion of the Commissioner, it is likely that another person has committed the sex offence and the liable parent is the victim of that offence (clause 77(1) and (2)); and – determine the most appropriate start date for any exemption for child support (no earlier than 26 September 2006), provided it does not negatively impact on any parent, child or carer (clause 77(3)). • Amend section 89ZA: – so that the exemption for child support should be void from the beginning if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue granted the exemption through the use of discretion, and subsequently becomes aware the exemption should not have been granted (clause 78(3)); and – to allow that a liable parent may reapply for an exemption for child support payment even when a court has not directed for a retrial, and subsequently convicted an offender (clause 78(4)). 92 Background Under the Child Support Act 1991, liable parents who have been the victim of a sex offence are eligible to seek an exemption from payment of child support (in relation to a child) if they were the victim of a sex offence, and the child was born as a result of that offence. For the exemption to be granted, another person must have been convicted of the sex offence. However, very few sex offences are reported and, of those that are, few result in a conviction. In some cases, a conviction is not possible because the offender is never identified. Often, despite the lack of a convicted offender, there is little doubt that the person was the victim of a sex offence. Giving Inland Revenue the discretion to consider a wider range of factors when deciding whether or not to grant the exemption will better support the intent of the exemption that a person who has been the victim of a sex offence should not be further victimised by having legal obligations conferred upon them as a result. 93 Other policy matters 94 95 ANNUAL SETTING OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2019–20 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same that applied for the 2018–19 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2019–20 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2019–20 tax year will be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 96 SECURITISED PRE-1990 FOREST LAND EMISSIONS UNITS (Clauses 44, 45, 47, 48, 52 and 53) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 to address an issue in relation to the tax treatment of pre-1990 forest land emissions units. The issue arises when the units are securitised through a sale and compulsory buy back transaction, which is effectively a lease of the units in exchange for a loan. Specifically, the proposed amendment provides the following: • The sale of the emissions units and the return of the equivalent units would be ignored for both parties. Instead, there would be a loan between the two parties. The interest flows earned/paid by both parties on the borrowed/lent funds would be taxable/deductible. • The acquirer of the units may wish to on-sell them. If so, any gain or loss on selling the units to a third party would be taxable or deductible according to the ordinary rules that apply to the sales of forest land emissions units. Ignoring the sale transaction in this instance will also mean that the emissions unit s would retain their one-off tax-free status on disposal. Overall, these changes are intended to facilitate the monetisation of assets that might otherwise be locked away, so that the assets can generate income for their owners and the underlying beneficiaries. More general consideration of other securitised assets is planned as part of a tax policy programme project on financial arrangements. Application date The proposed amendment will apply to transactions entered into in the 2018–19 income year, or any subsequent income year, that involve the securitisation of pre-1990 forest land emissio ns units. 97 Background Pre-1990 forest land units New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) 3 places mandatory deforestation obligations on exotic forests that were first established before 1990, referred to as “pre-1990 forests”. This means if pre-1990 landowners choose to deforest, for example when converting forest land to a different use, they face “deforestation liabilities” under the ETS and have to report on emissions and surrender an equivalent amount of New Zealand emission units to the Government. When the ETS was introduced, owners of “pre-1990 forests” were able to apply for a one- off free allocation of New Zealand emissions units. This allocation was intended to recognise the possible impact on land values due to the cost the ETS places on deforesting, and the resulting reduction in land-use flexibility. A wide variety of owners applied for the pre-1990 forestry allocation of free units, including farmers with small forest holdings, regional councils, owners of large commercial forests, and Māori entities who received forest land as part of treaty settlements. In total, nearly 48 million New Zealand units were allocated in relation to pre-1990 forests, some of which have since been either sold or surrendered. Although there is a register of unit holders, those records do not allow information on current holders to be publicly identified. However, our expectation is that the current holders will largely be those who take a longer-term view to holding the underlying land, which is consistent with, but not exclusively, the view taken by those who focus on intergenerational sustainability and kaitiakitanga (guardianship). Tax implications The proceeds from the sale of pre-1990 forest land emissions units are generally non-taxable, to reflect the nature of the units. Any subsequent sales of these emissions units are, however, taxable. It is not appropriate to treat a transaction involving the sale and compulsory buyback of pre- 1990 forest land emissio ns units as a standalone sale as that transaction amounts to a securitisation of an asset in exchange for a loan. The purpose of the securitisation is to turn what would otherwise be a non-income earning asset into cash without losing ultimate control of the asset. The cash can then be invested to earn income, thereby generating income for the original owner and its underlying beneficiaries. The benefit to the other party to the transaction is that they can use the emissions units to offset some of the liability associated with their emissio ns. Similar tax rules are already in place to enable sales and compulsory buybacks of shares to, in effect, be treated as loans (see the share lending rules enacted in 2006 4 ). 3 The emissions trading scheme is currently being reviewed. 4 See Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin, Volume 18, No.5 (June 2006), pages 86–94. 98 Key features Various sections of the Income Tax Act are proposed to be amended to ensure a transaction is treated as a loan for income tax purposes. This is achieved by treating the arrangement as a financial arrangement with an attached excepted financial arrangement. The excepted financial arrangement is the assignment of the pre-1990 forest land emissions units by the holder to a person who is not an associated person (the lender) and the later assignment of the same or other New Zealand emissions units by the lender to the holder. Interest The financial arrangement rules will apply to the “interest” component only. For example, the “interest” paid by the original unitholder will be the difference between the amounts they receive from assigning the units and the total amounts they pay the lender under the arrangement. Under proposed section DB 17B, the lender is denied a deduction for the amount they have lent to the original ho lder of the unit s. Change in value of the collateral Because the same amount of units is being returned, changes in the value of the emissions units will be ignored. Under proposed section CX 54B, the amount that relates to the market value of an emissions unit under a transfer of the excepted financial arrangement is excluded inco me. Moreover, under section EW 52B4(c), the original unit and the returned unit are treated as having a value for the unit holder equal to the cost of the original unit for the unit ho lder. Sales to third parties Any gain or loss made by the lender from subsequently selling the units to a third party and later purchasing replacement units will be taxable. The lender will be taxed on all the proceeds from the sale of the units to a third party. Their cost base for the units they have sold will be zero (see proposed section EW 52B(4)(d)(ii)). However, the lender will be able to deduct the cost of the replacement units that they acquire in order to meet their obligation to return units to the original holder. Example The lender sells 1,000 units to a third party for $20 per unit. The lender will be taxed on $20 per unit as the cost base for the units will be $0. The taxable income will be $20,000. The lender subsequently purchases 1,000 units for $15 to meet their obligation to return units to the original holder. The lender is allowed a deduction of $15,000. Overall, the lender is taxed on the net gain of $5000 (that is, $20,000 − $0 − $15,000). This treatment parallels that under the share lending rules. 99 Preservation of the one-off tax free status of the units Provided the requirements of the arrangement are fulfilled, the original owner of the units is considered to hold the units throughout the arrangement (see proposed section EW 52B). This non-recognition of a disposal by the original owner means that the one-off tax free status of the units on disposal is preserved for the purposes of section CX 51B, because the units continue to meet the definition of a “pre-1990 forest land emissions unit”. When units are not returned by the agreed date Parties that have entered into a securitisation arrangement in good faith will be entitled to apply the new provisions on the assumption that the arrangement is fulfilled as agreed. However, if the units are not returned by the date that the parties have agreed, the arrangement is effectively unwound for tax purposes. This means that the original disposal of the units will be treated as an ordinary disposal on the date the arrangement began. 100 KEEPING TAX RECORDS IN TE REO MĀORI (Clauses 38(1), (3) to (5) and 68 to 71) Summary of proposed amendment Changes are proposed to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to allow tax records to be kept in te reo Māori. Application date The proposed changes apply from the date of the Bill’s enactment. Key features The proposed changes allow taxpayers to hold tax records in te reo Māori for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts (the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act and the GST Act) without first having to seek the approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The change is directed at internal documents held by taxpayers in compliance with the requirements and obligations of the Tax Administration Act and the GST Act. The proposed changes do not alter or affect taxpayer obligations to use: •the English phrases in the GST Act, for example, “tax invoice”; or •donation receipts in English (unless otherwise permitted by Inland Revenue to do so). The change codifies Inland Revenue operational practice that has been in effect since 1995. Background The proposed changes ensure the operation and effect of the Inland Revenue Acts are generally consistent with the spirit and intent of Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori Act 2016 (Māori Language Act 2016). The proposed changes are not intended to affect, replace, or alter existing taxpayer obligations or disclosures required, for example by section 24 of the GST Act or section 32 of the Tax Administration Act for tax documents that are relied on by third party taxpayers when they take a tax position. 101 PAYE AND EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES (Clause 61) Summary of proposed amendment New rules enacted by the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016 allow employers to choose to withhold tax on employment income an employee receives under an employee share scheme (ESS) on a grant-by-grant basis. Officials understand that for some emplo yers, the abilit y to withhold PAYE on a grant-by- grant basis can give rise to undesirable financial reporting consequences. Under International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share Based Payments (IFRS 2), it may mean that the scheme becomes partly “cash settled” from a financial reporting perspective. Some employers prefer from a financial reporting perspective for ESS to be treated as “equity settled” as the scheme cost is fixed and spread on a straight line, whereas the accounting treatment of “cash settled” schemes requires them to be revalued annually. This means the accounting expense can change year to year as the share price changes. An amendment to section RD 7B is proposed to allow an employer to make an irrevocable elect ion to withho ld PAYE in relat ion to a grant made under an ESS. This elect ion would then create a statutory obligation to withhold and return PAYE on that benefit, and ensure that tax can be withheld without undesirable financial reporting consequences. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2019–20 and subsequent income years. Key features The proposed amendment would allow employers the flexibility to elect into an irrevocable statutory obligation to withhold PAYE in relation to a benefit provided under an ESS. The proposed amendment would not disturb employers’ ability to elect to withhold PAYE on a grant-by-grant basis if they wish to do so. The irrevocable election would be available in addition to, not instead of, the elections available in the current section RD 7B. Background Section RD 7B(3) currently provides that an “employer may choose, in relation to the share purchase agreement, to withhold and pay an amount of tax for the benefit.” 102 The problem arises when IFRS 2 treats a scheme as being partly “cash settled” for financial reporting purposes. This results in a need to annually account for the PAYE (cash) element of the scheme on a market-to-market basis (meaning the cost of the scheme has to be revalued annually, to that extent). Officials understand that there is a way employers can ensure “equity settled” treatment on the entire benefit provided under an ESS which is subject to PAYE, but that this imposes unnecessary compliance costs on employers and this discourages them fro m wit hholding. IFRS 2 allows a scheme to be treated as wholly “equity settled” if a PAYE payment is made, but only if that payment arises by virtue of an obligation under tax laws or regulations to withho ld tax. Officials understand a contractual undertaking is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of IFRS 2. The issue is that section RD 7B does not currently impose a statutory legal obligation to pay PAYE at the time the benefit is granted, but rather it is an election the employer makes at the time the tax obligation arises. Accordingly, the current wording of section RD 7B does not satisfy this requirement. A tax obligation which arises by virtue of an irrevocable election at the time the offer is made to an employee would mean employers could treat a scheme as entirely equity settled. The proposed amendments to section RD 7B allow employers to make this irrevocable election and thus meet the requirements of IFRS 2 to treat a benefit provided under an ESS as wholly equity settled. 103 BENEFICIARIES AS SETTLORS (Clause 56) Summary of proposed amendment When an amount of income is allocated by a trust to a beneficiary but retained in the trust, and no interest is paid by the trust to the beneficiary, such a beneficiary may become a settlor. This is because they meet the definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act, by transferring value to the trust. This could be an overreach in some cases. The proposed change amends the Income Tax Act to ensure that, in certain circumstances, such beneficiaries do not become settlors. Application date The proposed application date is the date of the Royal assent. Key features The proposed amendment ensures that beneficiaries whose current account balances at the end of the income year are not greater than $25,000 do not become settlors. When market rate interest is paid by the trust to the beneficiary, such beneficiaries do not become settlors. For consistency with other legislative provisions, it is proposed that the prescribed interest rate is the same as the rate used to determine whether there is a fringe benefit in relation to a low-interest loan provided to an employee. The current prescribed rate is 5.77%. A resolution authorising the payment of interest to such beneficiaries should be passed no later than the date the trust files its return, stating that the payment has been backdated to the end of the relevant income year. This is to ensure there is no retrospective action in relation to such amounts. Background Under the current law, some beneficiaries of trusts may inadvertently become the settlors of such trusts. This can occur when: • trustees allocate an amount of money (for example, beneficiary income) to a beneficiary; • the money is not paid out to the beneficiary but is retained in the beneficiary’s current account with the trust, and is used as working capital of the trust; • the beneficiary does not receive interest or other return on the money retained by the trust. 104 Such beneficiaries become settlors in relation to the amount of interest that has not been paid to them, because they “transfer value” to the trust by leaving money in the trust interest-free and, therefore, meet the definition of “settlor” in section HC 27 of the Income Tax Act. The implications that may arise from treating such beneficiaries as settlors include affecting entitlements for Working for Families, making beneficiaries accountable for tax on the trustee income, and inadvertently increasing the number of persons associated with the trust. 105 COOPERATIVE COMPANIES: NON-DEDUCTIBLE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS (Clauses 51 and 58 to 60) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments clarify that a co-operative company may elect to make a fully imputed cash distribution of profits attributable to a specific group of shareholders of the company, provided: • the company’s constitution permits distributions to be made to a specific groups of members; and • the amount paid to each shareholder is determined by the level of trading activity between the members and the company. Application date The proposed amendment will apply to non-deductible cash distributions made on or after the date of Royal assent. Key features The proposed amendment will permit a co-operative company to choose to distribute to a specific group of its shareholders those profits that are attributable only to that group of shareholders as either: • an association rebate (tax deductible); or • a fully imputed cash distribution (non-deductible) which is treated as a dividend. The proposed amendment will improve the consistency of the imputation rules with co- operative business practices, such as the way in which co-operative companies use pool systems to incentivise a higher quality of supply from members. Detailed analysis The amendment seeks to improve consistency of the imputation rules and general tax settings for co-operative companies with both co-operative company law, and commercial practices in the co-operative sector. Currently, a co-operative company may choose to distribute its profits generated from co- operative activity either as: • a tax deductible distribution (the association rebate); or 106 • a non-deductible cash distribution (with imputation credits attached), which is treated as a dividend paid to the shareholder. This proposed outcome is mostly relevant to co-operative companies that adopt pool systems to incentivise a higher quality of supply from members to the co-operative. Typically, members may elect into such a pool system, and only those participating members can receive distributions of such pool profits. As tax payable on these pool profits is borne by those participating members, the proposed amendment will ensure that the benefit of the related imputation credits may be allocated proportionately only to those participating members. 107 CLARIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE COMMON REPORTING STANDARD (Clauses 73 and 74) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies that an entity does not have to be remunerated directly for its activities to be considered a financial institution for the purposes of the G20/OECD Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Section 185O of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be amended, with a Part 2 added to schedule 2, where all such clarifications can be located. Application date The clarification will apply from the original date of effect of the CRS rules in New Zealand, that is, from 1 July 2017. Key features The clear policy intent is that determination should be based on the nature of the business activities that the entity performs and the remuneration for those activities, irrespective of whether the remuneration is received directly or indirectly through another group entity. This policy intent matches the international consensus on the matter, and is consistent with other references in the Commentary and the applicable Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations. Additionally, the OECD has issued a draft clarification (FAQ) confirming the policy intent, this will be published sometime in the future. To give certainty to those administering CRS obligations in New Zealand and to ensure New Zealand complies with its international obligations, it is proposed amending the implementation legislation to clarify this point. At the same time, it is proposed to generally modify section 185O of the Tax Administration Act to insert a new Part 2 to schedule 2, where other clarifications that might be needed in future can all be located. Both the CRS and the Commentary to the CRS are products of the OECD. The clarification will actually be made to the application of the Commentary to the CRS, to avoid any international perception that New Zealand is modifying the CRS itself. Background The CRS is an international standard, and for which New Zealand enacted implementation legislation in 2017, primarily through amendments to Part 11B and schedule 2 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 108 That legislation requires financial institutions to collect and report information on non- residents holding financial accounts in New Zealand. The reported information will be exchanged with other countries under tax treaties, to help tax administrations detect and prevent offshore tax evasion. In return, New Zealand will receive reciprocal information from tax treaty partners on New Zealand residents with offshore accounts. Importantly, the 2017 implementation legislation directly incorporated the CRS into New Zealand law by reference, and provides that it must be applied consistently with the official OECD Commentary. Since 2017, a potential ambiguity has been detected in the wording of the CRS that has created some uncertainty for those determining whether an entity is a financial institution (and therefore whether the entity is subject to CRS due diligence and reporting obligations). The ambiguity arises from the wording of the definitions of two particular types of financial inst itution, Investment Entity and Custodial Institution. Both definitions refer to “the Entity’s gross income attributable to \[the activities/services provided\]...”. This reference could be read as requiring the entity to be remunerated directly in order to meet either definition. However, in a common New Zealand group structure, the entity itself may not necessarily be directly remunerated. 109 LOSS OF EARNINGS INSURANCE (Clause 42) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies that loss of earnings insurance proceeds are taxable in all circumstances, including when the rights to receive these proceeds are assigned to another company. Application date This amendment would apply retrospectively from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year, subject to a savings provision to protect taxpayers who have taken a tax position on the basis of the existing wording of the law. Key features An amendment is proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that a person who has been assigned the right to receive compensation proceeds, from an interruption or impairment of business activities, will be taxed in the same way that the assignor would have been taxed. Background Taxpayers manage risk of business interruption by taking out loss of earnings insurance. When a business experiences a period of economic loss due to an adverse event (for example, an earthquake or fire), it can receive a loss of earnings payout as compensation. Since these proceeds are income of the business, they are subject to income tax. After the Canterbury earthquake in 2011, a question arose about the tax treatment of amounts received from an assignment of the right to receive an insurance claim made under a loss of earnings policy. Due to the facts of the case and the wording of the current rule, the assignee was not taxable. This is contrary to the policy intent, which is to tax loss of earnings compensat ion, irrespective of whether the right to receive the compensation has been assigned to a third party. 110 TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE: REMEDIAL CHANGE TO THE TAX TRANSITIONAL RULES (Clause 54) Summary of proposed amendment Changes are proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007 to confirm tax transitional entitlements for life insurance policies that are sold as “level premium”. Application date The proposed changes apply from 1 July 2010 or the beginning of an income year that includes 1 July 2010. Key features Some changes are proposed to the conditions that need to be met for level premium life insurance policies in a low inflation environment. Background In 2010, the taxation of life insurance business was substantially reformed. Accompanying the reform was transitional relief for life insurance policies sold before the start of the new rules. Section EY 30(5)(b) allows life insurers tax transitional relief for life insurance policies that were sold as “level premium” on or before 30 June 2010. Section EY 30(5)(b) allows for increases in the base premium for such policies if the increase is a result of increasing the amount of life cover for movements in the consumer price index (CPI). The base premium is the premium agreed at the time the life insurance policy is sold. The rule did not deal with situations when, because of a low-inflation environment, premium increases under the formula were higher than CPI increases over the same period. Most level premium policies allow for an incremental increase in premiums over its contractual duration by a formula to reflect percentage changes in the CPI to maintain the real value of life insurance cover. These increases are typically framed by an increase of three percent or movement in the CPI index – whichever was higher. The proposed change preserves transitional relief for life insurance policies that provide for an increase in premiums as a direct result of an increase in the amount of life cover that does not exceed three percent or the percentage increase in the CPI (whichever percentage is higher). 111 Remedials and maintenance items 112 113 TREATMENT OF ARRANGING SERVICES RELATING TO GOODS OFFSHORE (Clause 15(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an amendment to correct an unintended change to the GST treatment of certain arranging services, which resulted from an amendment that was made in 2016 to allow the rules applying GST to supplies of remote services imported by New Zealand consumers to work properly. Application date The amendments are proposed to apply on and after 1 October 2016, being the date that the previous law change that inadvertently changed the GST treatment of certain arranging services came into force. Key features The proposed amendment concerns the arranging of services that are supplied directly in connection with goods situated outside New Zealand at the time the underlying services are performed. The issue is that the arranging services may not be zero-rated, even though the underlying services that they arrange (such as overseas storage, handling and logistics) will be clearly zero-rated under the rules in section 11A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The proposed amendment would ensure that services that consist of the arranging of underlying services supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property located outside New Zealand at the time the underlying services are performed are zero-rated, in line with the policy intent and the previous treatment that applied prior to 1 October 2016. Background The Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Act 2016 applied GST to supplies of “remote services” from non-residents to New Zealand-resident consumers with effect from 1 October 2016. It was recognised at the time that this policy change necessitated an amendment to the zero-rating rule for services that are physically performed outside New Zealand in order for the new GST rules to work as intended. “Remote services” are defined in the GST Act as services that, at the time of performance of the services, have no necessary connection between the place where the services are physically performed and the location of the recipient of the services. Section 8(3)(c) provides that a supply of remote services is subject to GST where the services are supplied to a person resident in New Zealand. This however excludes services that are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are 114 performed, as those services are already subject to GST under the law existing prior to 1 October 2016. The types of services which the GST on remote services rules were specifically designed to bring into the GST base are those which are physically performed outside New Zealand. This meant it was necessary to carve out remote services supplied to final consumers from the zero-rating provision for services performed outside New Zealand. The relevant zero- rating provision, section 11A(1)(j), was therefore amended so that services physically performed outside New Zealand, or that arrange services that are physically performed outside New Zealand, are zero-rated, provided that these services are not remote services supplied to a New Zealand resident who is not a registered person. The issue is that services which are provided in relation to goods located overseas may be remote services under the current definition in the GST Act, even though these services will be clearly zero-rated by section 11A(1)(f) if they are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand at the time of performance of the services. Hence, while the core underlying services that are supplied directly in connect io n with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand (such as overseas storage, handling and logistics) are zero-rated, the arranging of these services may only be zero-rated if the (New Zealand-resident) recipient of the services is a registered person. Detailed analysis Proposed new section 11A(1)(jbb) provides that services would be zero-rated if they are the arranging of underlying services that are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property. This zero-rating treatment would apply if the moveable personal property is situated outside New Zealand at the time the underlying services are performed, and would not be dependent on whether the recipient of the services is a New Zealand resident or a non- resident, nor whether the recipient is registered for GST. Example – arranging of storage of goods overseas and other associated services Sistinas Pty Ltd (Sistinas), an Australian company that is registered for GST in New Zealand, carries on a number of business activities related to e-commerce. One of these activities involves the facilitation of a range of underlying services related to goods stored in third-party warehouses in Australia (such as gift wrapping, handling, logistics and transportation) which are sold as bundled packages to customers resident in New Zealand. These customers are typically GST-registered e-commerce businesses selling goods into Australia, but may also include some non-registered microbusinesses and consumers. While most of the consideration paid by Sistinas’ customers relates to the core underlying services, Sistinas charges its customers a “preparation fee” relating to its facilitation services. Where one of these service packages is supplied to a person in New Zealand who is not a registered person, the underlying services will be clearly zero-rated under either section 11A(1)(a) or (f) as the supply of overseas transportation, or of services that are supplied directly in connection with moveable personal property situated outside New Zealand. If the arranging services are treated as supplied in New Zealand, section 11A(1)(jbb) would apply to zero-rate these arranging services. Where this is the case, the preparation fee would be subject to GST at the rate of zero percent. 115 CAPITAL RAISING COSTS (Clause 21) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are proposed to clarify the scope of the rules allowing businesses to deduct GST incurred on costs of raising capital. Application date The amendments are proposed to apply on and after 1 April 2017, being the date that the GST rules specifically allowing input tax deductions for capital raising costs came into force. A savings provision is proposed to protect tax positions taken prior to the date of enactment of the Bill in cases where taxpayers did not make a deduction of input tax for capital raising costs on the basis of the existing law. Key features The proposed amendments make remedial changes to the rules allowing GST-registered persons to deduct GST incurred on goods and services acquired for use in a capital raising exercise. In particular, the changes: • clarify that the relevant deduction available under the rules is of input tax on supplies of goods and services made to the registered person that are used for the capital raising transaction; • provide that a deduction is available for goods and services acquired by the registered person, to the extent that a deduction would be available under the ordinary rules, if the goods and services are used in the person’s usual business activity instead of being used in the capital raising activity; • clarify that GST-registered persons are entitled to claim input tax deductions for capital raising costs in situations where the funds raised are used to refinance a taxable activity of the registered person; and • ensure that input tax deductions for capital raising costs are also available in situations where the funds are ultimately used in a taxable activity by a different company in the same group of companies as the company that carried out the capital raising transaction. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 inserted new section 20H into the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to allow GST- registered businesses to recover GST on their costs of raising capital to fund a taxable activity. 116 Under the rules that applied prior to 1 April 2017 (being the date that section 20H came into effect), the exempt treatment of financial services posed a problem when businesses that principally made taxable supplies of goods and services incurred costs to raise capital, such as through the issue of bonds or shares. Examples of such capital raising costs include NZX listing fees, legal fees and costs associated with preparing a product disclosure statement. The GST incurred in relation to these costs was potentially unrecoverable because the provision of equity and debt securities is an exempt supply of financial services. The new rules ensure that businesses which principally make taxable supplies can recover the GST incurred on goods and services used to raise capital for their taxable activities. In line with the policy intent, the rules do not apply when a business principally makes supplies of financial services, or to the extent that they have elected to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services and a deduction is already available as a result of the business- to-business zero-rating rules. However, there are some minor technical ambiguities and errors in the rules as currently enacted. Amendments are therefore proposed to clarify the scope of the rules to ensure that the policy intent is achieved. Detailed analysis Reference to deduction of input tax for the supplies of financial services An amendment to section 20H(1) is proposed to rectify an inaccuracy in the introductory wording that a registered person has “a deduction under section 20(3)(hd) of input tax for the supplies of financial services”. The proposed amendment clarifies that the deduction would be for input tax on supplies made to the registered person (for example, legal services) that are used to make the relevant supplies of financial services (being the raising of debt or equit y). Refinancing a taxable activity The introductory words to current section 20H(1) refer to an “activity of raising funds that are intended for use by the registered person for expenditure in a taxable activity". Paragraph (d) of the current section also contains a similar phrase. In many cases, the funds that are raised through issuing debt or equity securities will be used to repay existing debt that was incurred to finance a registered person’s taxable activity. It is unclear that repayment of debt would be regarded as “expenditure in a taxable activity”. However, there was no policy intention to distinguish between capital-raisings where funds are used for that purpose and ones where funds are used for other “taxable activity” purposes, such as acquiring new assets. The proposed amendments to paragraphs (a) and (e) clarify that registered persons are entitled to claim input tax deductions for capital raising costs in situations where it is intended that the funds planned to be raised would be used to refinance the registered person’s taxable activity (provided that the other conditions of section 20H(1) are met). 117 Capital raising undertaken by different group company to that which uses the funds Where a capital raising transaction is carried out by a treasury company or a holding company, it may be another group company (such as the trading company) that ultimately uses the funds in a taxable activity (or to refinance a taxable activity). The wording of proposed paragraphs (a), (c) and (e) ensures that input tax deductions are available to the company that ultimately uses the funds (or to the representative member if the group of companies has group-registered under section 55) in such situations where the capital raising transaction is carried out by another group company. Apportionment of input tax deductions In situations where a registered person carries on both taxable and exempt activities, the intent behind the rules allowing input tax deductions for capital raising costs has always been that the amount of deduction claimed should be apportioned based on the extent to which the registered person makes taxable supplies as a proportion of their total supplies (excluding the capital raising supplies). However, this intended apportionment rule is not explicit in current section 20H. Proposed section 20H(1B) codifies this apportionment rule to make it explicit that registered persons that have an exempt activity (as well as a taxable activity) and who intend to use the funds raised for both activities are required to apportion input tax deductions for capital raising costs, where the apportionment ratio is based on their taxable supplies as a fraction of their total supplies (excluding the supplies of financial services made to raise capital). Example Pilkinton Properties is a property development company, and makes eighty percent taxable supplies and twenty percent exempt supplies. It issues a bond to raise capital in order to finance the purchase of land. In issuing the bond, it spends $11,500 in legal fees, including GST of $1,500. Pilkinton Properties claims a deduction of $1,200 (eighty percent of $1,500) based on Pilkinton Properties’ usual ratio of taxable to exempt supplies (excluding the bond issue itself). 118 APPORTIONING GST FOR MIXED-USE ASSETS (Clause 20) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed to amend the definition of input tax for the purposes of the formula for apportioning input tax in relation to assets that are used partly for business use and partly for private use, but which are also unused for a period. This will correct the exclusion from the formula for input tax relating solely to private use. Application date The amendment is proposed to apply from 1 April 2013, the main application date of the mixed-use asset rules. Key features It is proposed to amend section 20G(2)(a)(ii) of the Goods and Services Act 1985 by amending the exclusions from the input tax that needs to be apportioned under the provision for expenditure that is solely related to making taxable or non-taxable supplies. This would be achieved by removing the references in the exclusions to terms and provisions in the Income Tax Act relating to mixed-use assets, and instead using GST Act terminology when describing use. This means that the exclusion from input tax that can be brought into the mixed-use asset formula for solely private expenditure would be appropriately narrowed so as not to include use by persons associated with the supplier. Background Section 20G of the GST Act is a special apportionment method for mixed use assets that aims to apply a similar approach for GST as the approach that is used for income tax purposes under subpart DG of the Income Tax Act. A typical example is that of a family bach or holiday home which is used sometimes for family holidays and sometimes by members of the public for a fee whilst being unoccupied for the remaining period. The aim of subpart DG is to apportion the expenses relating to the unoccupied period according to the relative levels of private and income earning use. However, because of the way in which “private use” is defined in subpart DG, the exclusion operates more broadly than intended. 119 Detailed analysis Section 20G(1)(a) requires a dual use asset to be apportioned using the formula input tax for asset × total income earning days ÷ (total income-earning days + total private days). Sectio n 20(2)(b) defines “input tax for an asset” as the input tax on expenditure in relation to the relevant asset, excluding expenditure that is “solely related to the income-earning use of the asset” or solely related to the private use of the asset as that term is defined in section DG 4. The reference to section DG 4 gives rise to a problem in applying the formula to associated persons transactions. This is because section DG 4 treats the use of an asset by an associated person as private use as might be the case if, say the asset is held by a family trust. So, where an associated person uses a mixed-use asset, even if they pay market rent, there will be deemed private use that will not form part of the input tax calculation. Since input tax deductions are not otherwise available for private use, this could significantly limit the input tax deductions that ought to be able to be claimed to give the right economic result under the formula. It is therefore proposed to amend section 20G(2)(b)(ii) so that dual use by an associated person is not included in the exclusion from “input tax for asset”. 120 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS Summary of proposed amendments The following proposed amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes.

The flagship measures of this Bill build on the enhancements to the collection of more frequent, better quality employment and investment income information contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018, enacted on 29 March 2018. The proposals in this Bill were the subject of three recent public consultation documents: • Making Tax Simpler – Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act; • Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of individuals’ income tax; and • PAYE error correction and adjustment – an officials’ issues paper. Submissions on these documents have helped shape the final proposals contained in this Bill. Proposals relating to individuals mean that most people will pay what they need to and get what they are entitled to during the year without having to do anything. For instance, the changes for individuals in this Bill mean from April 2019: • refunds will be automatically paid out – where Inland Revenue is reasonably confident it has information about all a person’s income and the tax they have paid on it; • Inland Revenue can use the better information it has to help people pay and receive the right amounts during the year; and • Inland Revenue will automatically finalise end-of-year refunds or bills to pay for as many people as possible without them having to do anything. It will be easier for people to understand their obligations and entitlements and will take them less time to ensure they pay and receive the right amounts. Proposed improvements to the Tax Administration Act will help shift the tax system to be more taxpayer-focussed. The improvements range from streamlining how information is collected, used and shared, to simplifying the provision of tax advice to make it more accessible to small and medium enterprises. Minor amendments to PAYE error correction and adjustment supplement the proposed error correction regulations aimed at simplifying and clarifying how errors can be corrected. This Bill also enhances the new provisional tax option – the Accounting Income Method (AIM) which started on 1 April 2018. It allows taxpayers to join AIM from some other provisional tax options during an income year, making it more accessible to customers. 3 These legislative changes, combined with the technology improvements being made as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation, are intended to deliver significant benefits to taxpayers. They will, when transformation is complete, produce a fundamentally different revenue system that: • is based around taxpayers’ needs; • is easy to understand and interact with; • produces and uses near real time information; • is digital and highly automated; • uses systems and software do most of the work; • is more responsive, flexible and certain for taxpayers; • is future proofed to accommodate change; and • delivers services with others inside and outside government. In addition to the tax administration improvements, this omnibus Bill also introduces a number of other policy measures including: • introducing two new contribution rates for KiwiSaver; • opening up KiwiSaver to over 65s; • clarifying the tax status of crown controlled companies and the tax rules for deregistered companies; • adding 13 charities to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (those with overseas donee status); • amending the definition of market interest that banks and other money lenders can elect to use for valuing the fringe benefit of a loan provided to an employee; and • extending to the securitisations regime in the Income Tax Act 2007. The Bill also sets the annual tax rates for 2018–19 and implements a number of minor remedial changes to existing legislation. 4 Modernising tax administration – Individuals’ income tax 5 6 OVERVIEW Background The proposed changes to the administration of individuals’ income tax aim to simplify individuals’ year-end income tax filing obligations and ensure that more appropriate withholding rates are applied to income during the year. The key proposals in the Bill aim to: • enable Inland Revenue to proactively help individuals to use the most appropriate tax rates or codes; • enable the use of tailored tax codes to improve the way that secondary sources of income and irregular patterns of income earning are taxed; • simplify the year-end income tax obligations of individuals; • enable the automation of refunds of tax and amounts of tax to pay; and • improve the administration of donation tax credits. Application date The proposed changes are expected to come into force on 1 April 2019 and the proposed end of year processes will be applied for the tax year ended 31 March 2019. Summary of proposed amendments The general legislative provisions set out in the following five commentary items prescribe the way in which individuals will interact with Inland Revenue in relation to the income tax system. By receiving regular income information throughout the year, 1 Inland Revenue will be able to ensure individuals are on the appropriate tax code or rate, and about the right amount of tax is withheld throughout the year. Unnecessary compliance costs will be removed from individuals, and income tax filing obligations will be simplified so that they are easily understood. Current filing mechanisms, such as personal tax summaries and IR3 forms, will be replaced by a pre-populated account that includes all income information that Inland Revenue ho lds about the individual. People who only earn “reportable income” will not have to do anything unless they know that the reportable income information is incomplete. Only those people who earn income or have deductions that Inland Revenue does not already know about, will have to provide further information to Inland Revenue. 1 The recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–2018, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 will require employers to provide employment information to Inland Revenue on a payday basis and investment income payers to provide investment income information on a monthly basis. 7 Under the proposals, individuals will fall into one of three groupings and may move between groups over time as their income profile changes. The groupings are: • Group A (automated process) – the individual earns “reportable income” and Inland Revenue judges that the income information it holds for the person is correct. In these cases, the refund or tax to pay will automatically be calculated, assessed and actioned accordingly (that is, refund or tax bill issued). • Group B – the individual earns reportable income, but Inland Revenue considers based on previous returns and other information that the individual may have other income or deductions. In these circumstances, the individual will be requested to provide the additional information or confirm that income information held is correct. • Group C – the individual has no or very litt le reportable income. Individuals that fall into this category will then be required to provide income information – similar to the current IR3 process where a return of income is required. Group B and Group C can be considered subsets of each other depending on the amount of income information Inland Revenue holds or requires. Reporting of income information by individuals (new subpart 3B) New subpart 3B provides the administrative settings that underpin an individual’s obligations under sections BB 2, and BC 1 to BC 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to calculate and satisfy their income tax liability for a tax year. This background section explains the key terms that will apply for these new rules and the information to be included in the pre-populated account. The remaining sections that make up this subpart will be canvassed in detail under the subheadings “year-end income tax obligations of individuals” and “refunds of tax and amounts of tax to pay”. Key terms (proposed new section 22D) The key terms for these new rules are: • Meaning of individual – Section 22D(1) provides that, for the purposes of this subpart, and for a number of other specified sections in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that pertain to a taxpayer’s obligations, an individual means a living natural person. A natural person is deemed to include a person who is non- resident, but not a person whose only income for the corresponding income year is non-resident’s foreign-sourced income. In the situation where a natural person dies, they will be treated as an individual and will be subject to the individual’s tax rules up to and including the date of their death. Following death, their estate will be treated as a trust until it has been distributed. • Meaning of reportable income – Reportable income covers sources of income that Inland Revenue receives information on by way of third party reporting during the year, or shortly after the end of the year. For the purposes of subpart 3B and 8 section 33, this includes all PAYE income payments and resident and non-resident passive income. • Meaning of other income – Proposed new section 22D(3) provides that other income is income paid or payable to the individual for the corresponding income year that is not reportable income for the tax year. For the purposes of this subpart and section 33, the term “other income” is intended to cover all income that an individual earns that is not “reportable income”. • Meaning of pre-populated account – As per proposed new section 22D(4), a pre- populated account will contain details of the individual’s income for that tax year that are known to the Commissioner and this will be made available to the individual. It can include both “reportable income” and “other income”. • Meaning of adjusted account – An adjusted account, defined in proposed section 22D(5), is a pre-populated account that contains information the individual has provided on any other income they derived for the corresponding income year and any deductions or tax credits (see proposed schedule 8 table 2). The Commissioner can also amend information in the individual’s adjusted account to correct errors in the information and must inform the individual of the amendment (section 22H(2)). • Meaning of final account – The final account is the set of information that in some way (whether through confirmation, the Commissioner being satisfied, or the passage of time) becomes the final set of information that the tax assessment is based on. Where the Commissioner is not satisfied that the information in an individual’s account is complete, the Commissioner may issue a default assessment. Specifically, proposed section 22D(6) provides that a final account for an individual and tax year means: – a pre-populated account if the individual has confirmed it as correct and complete (section 22G(1)) or the Commissioner has notified the individual that the Commissioner is satisfied to that effect (section 22I(2)(b); – a zero pre-populated account referred to in section 22E(3), if, through the passage of time, the account is treated as an assessment under section 22I(2)(c); 2 or – an adjusted account if the individual has confirmed it as correct and complete (section 22G(2)) or the Commissioner has notified the individual that the Commissioner is satisfied to that effect (section 22I(2)(b)) or where, through the passage of time, the account is treated as an assessment under section 22I(2)(c). Information included in pre-populated accounts (proposed new section 22E) Under proposed section 22E(1), Inland Revenue must include in an individual’s pre- populated account all information it holds for the tax year relating to any reportable or other income that it considers the individual has derived for that year. As per proposed 2 An individual will be treated as having a “zero pre-populated account” where the Commissioner has no information on the individual’s reportable or other income for the relevant tax year. For the purposes of section 22I(2)(c), an assessment will arise when the Commissioner notifies an individual that the Commissioner is not satisfied that the information contained in their pre-populated or adjusted account is correct or complete and issues a default assessment under section 106. 9 section 22E(2), section 22E(1) only applies where the information is available or relevant for the individual in making an assessment for the tax year. If Inland Revenue has no information for a tax year on an individual’s reportable or other income, the individual is treated as having a zero pre-populated account (proposed section 22E(3)). The zero pre-populated account gives a basis for any future adjustments that may arise. 10 PROACTIVE ACTIONS (Clauses 28 and 30) Summary of proposed amendment Several amendments are proposed to enable Inland Revenue to proactively help people use appropriate tax rates or codes during the year to minimise year end debts and refunds. The proposed changes are: • Inland Revenue would monitor changes in a person’s earnings and identify where they may be using an incorrect or unsuitable tax code or tax rate. • Inland Revenue would contact individuals who use an unsuitable tax rate and recommend they change it. • Where Inland Revenue has contacted an individual regarding their use of an unsuitable tax rate for their investment income and the individual does not object within 20 working days, Inland Revenue will instruct the investment income payer to update the rate. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features Inland Revenue will use more frequently provided employment and investment income to determine whether people are using the most appropriate tax rates during the year. Where people are using tax rates that seem to be too high or too low, Inland Revenue will contact them and advise that another rate may be more suitable. 3 Inland Revenue will suggest the rate but will not require the individual to use the proposed rate as the individual has the best understanding of their likely income for the rest of the year and may therefore be happy to stay on their current rate. The exception to this is for investment income where Inland Revenue will instruct the payer to use the proposed withholding rate if the individual has not objected within twenty working days. Background Currently, if an individual is using a tax code which they are not entitled to use, Inland Revenue will contact their employer and instruct that the code be changed. If an individual is using a code that is not wrong per se, but does not reflect their likely year- end tax liability, Inland Revenue does not suggest corrective action. This means that individuals need to square up at the end of the year, resulting in a debt or refund. 3 This can include the recommendation of a tailored tax rate or code. Tailored tax codes will be covered in the “Tailored (special) tax codes” section. 11 The recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 will require employers to provide employment information to Inland Revenue on a payday basis and will require investment income payers to provide investment income information to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. By having access to this more timely information, Inland Revenue will be able to suggest corrective action when pro ject ions show that an individual is likely to end up with an under or over payment because of the withholding rate they are using. In order to understand what the proposed amendments are trying to achieve, it is important to appreciate the distinction between an “incorrect” tax code and an “unsuitable” tax code. Unsuitable tax codes are the focus of the proposed amendments relating to proactive actions. An individual’s tax code will be deemed incorrect where they are using a code that they are not entitled to use (for example, if an individual has a student loan but is on an “M” tax code, not “M SL”). The current position under the law will remain unchanged for incorrect tax codes and Inland Revenue will continue to contact the individual’s employer and instruct that the code be changed. An “unsuitable” tax rate or code is used in the proposed amendments to describe situations where an individual is using a code they are eligible to use, but where projections suggest that the individual is likely to end up with an under or overpayment of tax. Detailed analysis All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Use of unsuitable tax codes (proposed new section 24DB) Under the proposed amendment, if an individual who receives PAYE income is on an unsuitable tax code, Inland Revenue may recommend a change to the tax code, and with consent of the individual, notify the employer of this change. The policy intent behind this section is to assist individuals who are not on a wrong rate per se, but would benefit from changing to a different tax rate sooner. Changing to a different rate will better approximate the individual’s ultimate tax liability, and therefore reduce the size of a debt or refund position the individual would otherwise be in by year end. Although Inland Revenue may recommend that an individual changes their tax code, Inland Revenue will not notify the employer to make a change unless the individual accepts it. This is because an individual is better placed than Inland Revenue to know about their upcoming employment plans, such as time off work or variable hours. It therefore follows that, while Inland Revenue may recommend a change in code for an individual, it is more appropriate for the ultimate decision to lie with the individual. 12 Example 1 James earns a salary of $45,000 per year. His current tax code is “M”, which is a code that he is entitled to use. Given that James earns under $48,000, he is entitled to an independent earner tax credit of $520 per year. In order to obtain this tax credit James would need to be on an “ME” tax code, or, if he has a student loan “ME SL”. Under the proposed changes, Inland Revenue would contact James and let him know that an “ME” tax code would be a more appropriate code for him to be on. If James consents to the change, Inland Revenue will instruct his employer to update his tax code to “ME”. The new tax code would apply to PAYE income earned after the employer has been instructed to change the tax code or rate. Use of unsuitable RWT rates (proposed new section 25A) Inland Revenue may contact an individual regarding their use of an unsuitable tax rate for their invest ment inco me. If the individual accepts the suggested rate or no response is received within 20 working days, Inland Revenue will instruct the investment income payer to update the rate. It is noted that there is a difference between the treatment of an unsuitable PAYE code and an unsuitable RWT (resident withholding tax) rate. If an individual is on an unsuitable PAYE code, Inland Revenue will recommend a more suitable code, but will not instruct the employer to update the code unless the individual accepts it. For investment income, Inland Revenue will recommend a more suitable rate to the individual, but if no response is received within 20 working days, Inland Revenue will instruct the investment income payer to update the rate. The rationale behind a 20 working day rule for unsuitable RWT rates is that the amount of money involved is usually much smaller than with PAYE and therefore there is less risk of the proposed change leading to unsuitable amounts of withholding. Example 2 Thomas set up an interest bearing bank account ten years ago. He selected the 17.5% tax rate, which was right at the time. Thomas earns more now than he did ten years ago. In order to have tax deducted at the most appropriate tax rate he should have increased the tax rate, but he did not think of this. Thomas earned $1,000 of interest this year, from which his bank withheld $175 of tax. Because Thomas’ marginal tax rate has increased to 33%, $330 would have been a more appropriate amount to withhold (33% tax rate). Under current settings, as his tax rate was not updated, Thomas will be required to pay $155 of outstanding tax ($330 − $175) at the end of the year because less tax was withheld than is ultimately due on that interest. Under the proposed changes, Inland Revenue receives information from Thomas’ investment income payer and will contact Thomas and let him know that 33% is likely to be a more appropriate tax rate for his interest income and that they will instruct his bank to update it for him. Unless he objects to the rate being changed, Inland Revenue will instruct his bank to change the rate to 33%. Thomas would have no additional tax to pay at the end of the year anymore. 13 TAILORED (SPECIAL) TAX CODES (Clauses 27 and 28) Summary of proposed amendment Several amendments are proposed to enable Inland Revenue to help individuals use tailored tax codes to ensure that the rate of withholding tax on their income, including secondary sources of income, is appropriate during the year. The proposed changes are: • Inland Revenue would monitor changes in a person’s earnings and identify where a person may benefit from using a tailored tax code. • The process for applying for a tailored tax code would be simplified (including being able to apply online). • Inland Revenue would proactively contact individuals who may benefit from using a tailored tax code and recommend that they change their tax code. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features Inland Revenue will modernise the tailored tax code process by: • introducing an online application process; • notifying an individual’s employer of their updated tax code; and • proactively recommending tailored tax codes to individuals in relevant circumstances. This will improve the way that secondary sources of income, particularly employment income, are taxed by helping people to use an appropriate tax code so that about the right amount of tax is deducted during the year. The proposed legislative changes enable this by allowing Inland Revenue to contact individuals to suggest a tailored tax code and, in certain circumstances, contact the individual’s employer to advise them of this change. Background Under the current law, an individual wit h multiple jobs, or working while receiving a benefit from the Ministry of Social Development, should use either a secondary tax code or a special tax code. Secondary tax codes are intended to ensure that income from another job is taxed at the appropriate marginal rate. 14 Example 3 John John has one job with a salary of $53,000. He will pay $8,920 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 of tax paid on the first $14,000 of income at 10.5%, $5,950 from $14,001–$48,000 taxed at 17.5% and $1,500 from $48,001–$53,000 taxed at 30%. Mary Mary earns $48,000 from her main job and $5,000 from her second job ($53,000 total). She will also pay $8,920 in tax each year. This is comprised of $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $5,950 from $14,001–$48,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at a taxpayers marginal rate, the $5,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $1,500. Example 3 demonstrates that secondary tax codes will work as intended when an income tax threshold has not been crossed. However, as we have a progressive personal tax scale, secondary tax codes can result in more tax being withheld during the year than is necessary to satisfy the individual’s tax liability. This occurs when income from a second job takes a person’s total income over a tax threshold. Example 4 Sophie Sophie earns $35,000 from her main job and $18,000 from her second job ($53,000 total). She will pay $10,454 in tax each year. This comprises $1,470 tax paid on the first $14,000 at 10.5%, $3,675 from $14,001–$35,000 taxed at 17.5% and then, because a secondary tax code is applied at a tax payers marginal rate, the $18,000 from her second job will be taxed at 30%, resulting in $5,400. Sophie will be entitled to receive a refund of $1,534 at the end of the tax year. Example 4 results in an overpayment of tax because, by taxing at a person’s marginal tax rate, secondary tax codes prevent multiple claims of the lowest (or lower) tax rates for people with concurrent sources of PAYE income, which would result in tax owing at the end of the tax year. In order to limit instances of incorrect withholding, individuals that work multiple jobs who are able to estimate their likely annual income could opt for a special tax code. This would give them a withholding rate tailored to their personal circumstances. The disadvantages of the current rules on special tax codes are that an individual: • needs to know about special tax codes; • needs to realise that using one would benefit them; and • needs to be able to estimate their likely annual income. The process for obtaining a special tax code is also administratively burdensome. The individual must fill out an application and post it to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue 15 will then calculate the appropriate withholding rate and grant the individual a special tax code and a certificate that is only valid until the end of the tax year. The individual then has to advise their employer that they want the special tax code applied to their income. As a consequence, only about 8,000 individuals used a special tax code for the 2016 year (compared to about 570,000 secondary tax codes that were used). The proposed amendments aim to modernise special tax codes (to be replaced by “tailored tax codes”) and make them more accessible. This will largely be achieved by introducing an online application process, Inland Revenue proactively recommending tailored tax codes to individuals in relevant circumstances and informing their employers of the change. Tax codes provided by the Commissioner (amended section 24D) The section has been amended to allow the Commissioner to recommend a tailored tax code to an employee. This gives effect to the policy intent by helping people with uneven earnings throughout the year and/or secondary forms of income to use an appropriate tax code during the year, thereby minimising the extent of incorrect withholding. Consequential amendments have also been made to this section to indicate the terminology change from a “special tax code” to a “tailored tax code”. A “special tax code” under the old law, and a “tailored tax code” under the new law, both serve the same function of ensuring that a tax payer is on the most appropriate tax code during the year to minimise the extent of incorrect withholding. Use of unsuitable tax codes (proposed new section 24DB) This proposed amendment has been discussed under the “proactive actions” commentary item above but the section is also intended to apply to tailored tax codes. This section provides that if an individual who receives PAYE income is on an unsuitable tax code, Inland Revenue may recommend a change to the code, and with consent of the individual, notify the employer of this change. This section has been drafted broadly and allows the Commissioner to recommend a “more suitable or more accurate tax code”. If the more “suitable or accurate tax code” in any particular instance is a tailored tax code, then it is intended that the Commissioner may recommend a tailored tax code under this section. 16 THE YEAR-END INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS (Clauses 5(3), (21), (25), (26), (37), (43), (49), (60–62), 21, 69, 70 and 102) Summary of proposed amendment A number of amendments are proposed to set out the end of year income tax obligations of individuals and some of the processes that will be undertaken by Inland Revenue. The proposed changes are: • Inland Revenue will make a pre-populated account available to each individual containing the income information that Inland Revenue holds for the individual. • Where an individual confirms or Inland Revenue is reasonably satisfied that the information in the pre-populated account is all of the relevant information Inland Revenue would calculate the refund or tax to pay without the individual needing to provide any addit io nal information. (Group A). • Individuals will be required to provide any income information other than reportable income to Inland Revenue subject to some de minimis rules. (Groups B and C). • Individuals will be able to provide other relevant information such as deductible expenses and tax credit information to Inland Revenue. • Individuals will be required to provide or correct reportable income where they know or have reason to know that the reportable income information provided to Inland Revenue is incorrect. • An individual’s tax assessment will occur when they have confirmed the tax information is complete, when Inland Revenue is reasonably satisfied that the information is complete, or when Inland Revenue is not satisfied that the information is complete and issues a default assessment. • Individuals and Inland Revenue will be able to make corrections to the information held where they become aware that it is incorrect or incomplete and there will be error correction processes for adjustments made before and after an assessment has occurred. • The end of year income tax process will replace the current personal tax summary and will replace the IR3 tax return processes over time as the paper IR3 is phased out. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019 and will apply for the tax year-end processes for the tax year ended 31 March 2019. 17 Key features The end of year income tax process changes will mean that Inland Revenue provides as much information about an individual’s income 4 and tax credits as it can to form a basis for the calculation of the individual’s tax position (refund or tax to pay). Where Inland Revenue is reasonably satisfied that this is all of the relevant information for an individual this information will be treated as forming the individual’s self-assessment and their tax position will be calculated. Individuals will be required to provide information on their other income (income other than their reportable income) and will be able to provide information on deductions and tax credits. This additional information will be added to the individual’s pre-populated account (now their adjusted account) and will become the individual’s self-assessment. New error correction provisions will allow individuals and Inland Revenue to adjust the information where they become aware that it is incorrect. This can be done before an assessment has occurred and Inland Revenue can also make changes after the assessment subject to the time-bar rules. Changes can also be requested by an individual after the assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Background The current year-end processes involve Inland Revenue determining whether people who earn PAYE income should be issued with a personal tax summary (PTS) containing their PAYE income information or not. If people are not sent a PTS by Inland Revenue they can request one. If they do not get a PTS or do not file a tax return their tax position will not be squared up and any refund available will not be paid out. If they are issued with a PTS and their refund is less than $600 then it will be treated as confirmed after two months and the refund will be paid out. If the refund is greater than $600 then it will not be paid out unless they confirm their tax position with Inland Revenue. The PTS only includes wage and salary information so individuals need to add in income from other sources such as interest income or dividend income. They may need to gather this information from several payers and these payers may also be providing this information to Inland Revenue directly. Individuals are likely to have to file an IR3 tax return to provide this information if they have other types of income such as business income or foreign sourced income, or they wish to claim deductions or tax credits. A large number of individuals have chosen to interact with Inland Revenue through PTS Intermediaries mainly because of a lack of awareness of how to directly claim any available refund directly from Inland Revenue. These businesses assist taxpayers wit h refund claims and typically charge a percentage of the refund or a fixed fee for the service they offer. If people did not use a PTS intermediary but instead applied directly to Inland Revenue, they would receive the full amount of their refund. 4 This will be the income that is required to be reported to Inland Revenue by a third party within the year or shortly after the year end and known as “reportable income”. 18 Individuals can also work out whether they are due a refund or whether they would have tax to pay before they request a PTS by requesting a summary of earnings. Generally, they are not required to request the PTS if they are in a tax-to-pay position and as such are able to cherry pick refunds. Detailed analysis All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Inland Revenue to provide pre-populated accounts (proposed sections 22D(4) and 22E contained in new subpart 3B) Proposed new section 22D(4) defines a pre-populated account as an account provided by Inland Revenue to an individual for a tax year containing the information held by Inland Revenue on the reportable or other income derived by the individual. Proposed new section 22E requires Inland Revenue to include all of the information that Inland Revenue holds on reportable or other income derived by the individual for the tax year in the individual’s pre-populated account for the tax year. This requirement is limited to where the information is available and is relevant to the individual for the tax year. Section 22E(3) provides that where Inland Revenue holds no income information for an individual they will have a zero pre-populated account for the year. This is intended to provide a basis for adjustments should the individual or Inland Revenue become aware of further relevant information. When a pre-populated account becomes a self-assessment (proposed sections 22D(6), 22G(1) and 22I contained in new subpart 3B) (Group A individuals) Where Inland Revenue is satisfied that the information contained in the pre-populated statement is complete and correct, it will become a final account under proposed section 22D(6)(a)(ii) and therefore an assessment under proposed section 22I(1) when Inland Revenue notifies the individual (proposed section 22I(2)(b)). These individuals will not have to interact with Inland Revenue in any way for this to occur. Proposed new section 22G(1) allows an individual who only has reportable income for a tax year to confirm that their pre-populated account is full and complete at any time during the assessment period. It will become a final account under proposed section 22D(6)(a)(i) and therefore an assessment under proposed section 22I(1). Proposed section 22I(3) provides that the assessment period begins on 1 April immediately following the tax year and ends on 7 July of the year following the tax year or at a later date in the next tax year if the individual has an extension of time to file a return. Proposed section 22I(2) deems the assessment to arise when the individual confirms the pre-populated account is correct and complete. This allows an individual to make the confirmation sooner than Inland Revenue might or in circumstances where Inland Revenue has not initially been able to satisfy it self that the information in the pre- populated account is complete and correct. The assessment will determine whether an individual has a refund due or has to pay tax. The treatment of refunds or amounts of tax to pay is explained in the next commentary item (Refunds of tax and amounts of tax to pay). 19 Obligations to provide other income information: (proposed sections 22D(3) and (5), 22F, 22J, 22K and 22L contained in new subpart 3B and proposed schedule 8 table 1) (Group B and C individuals) Proposed new section 22F requires individuals to provide other income information to Inland Revenue (for all income that is not reportable income) subject to some de minimis rules discussed below. Proposed section 22D(3) defines other income as the income paid or payable to an individual for an income year that is not reportable income. Proposed new section 22K(1) specifies that a list of other income items is set out in proposed schedule 8 table 1. This table identifies these items as being included in other income: • New Zealand estate or trust income; • overseas income; • partnership income; • look-through company income; • rental inco me; • self-employment income; • employee share scheme income; and • other income, including income from a disposal of property that is not otherwise included in reportable income. Proposed new section 22J sets out the circumstances in which an individual will not have to provide other income information to Inland Revenue. Section 22J(1) provides that an individual will not have to provide information for a tax year if the individual derives other income of less than $200 (the de minimis rule). Section 22J(2) provides a list of exempt categories where a person will not have to provide income information to Inland Revenue for: • income derived by a non-resident seasonal worker; • income derived as a provider of standard-cost household services (that is exempt income under section CW 61(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007; • income derived from providing personal services for which personal service rehabilitation payments are made when the taxable income of the individual is not more than $14,000 for the income year and tax has been withheld from the personal service rehabilitation payment at 10.5%; or • non-resident passive income described in section RF 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and derived by a non-resident individual. These exceptions already exist under the current law, but have been codified in section 22J(2) to make it clear that the proposed changes do not create any unintended obligations for these types of income. 20 Proposed section 22L requires Inland Revenue to establish an electronic form and means of communication as well as a non-electronic form or mode of delivery for the delivery of other income information to Inland Revenue. This will enable people to submit informat ion either electronically or manually. Where an individual has provided information on their other income to Inland Revenue the income information will be added to the pre-populated account along with any tax deduction and tax credit information provided by the individual to form the individual’s adjusted account as defined in proposed section 22D(5). Provision of tax deduction and tax credit information (proposed sections 22D(5) and 22F(3), and proposed schedule 8 table 2) Proposed section 22F(3) provides that an individual may provide the following information to Inland Revenue on tax deductions and tax credits as set out in schedule 8 table 2: • deductions; 5 • tax credits carried forward under section LE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007; • tax loss balances, or tax loss components, other than a tax loss component under section LE 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007; • donations tax credits; or • amounts of income protection insurance. Under proposed section 22D(5) this information will be added to the information in the pre-populated account, and any other income information provided to form the individual’s adjusted account. Knowledge based requirement to correct missing or incorrect reportable income (proposed section 22F(2)) Proposed section 22F(2) confirms that an individual has no obligation to provide reportable income information that has not been included in their pre-populated account to Inland Revenue unless they know or might reasonably be expected to know that the informat ion in their pre-populated account is incomplete or incorrect. This section confirms that individuals are entitled to rely on the information in their pre-populated account unless they know it is wrong or they ought to have known that it was wrong. When an adjusted account converts into a self-assessment (proposed sections 22D(6)(c), 22G(2) and 22I contained in new subpart 3B) Under proposed section 22D(6)(c), an adjusted account will become final (and therefore an assessment under proposed section 22I(1)) when: • the individual has confirmed the adjusted account as correct and complete under proposed section 22G(2); or 5 A person is unable to claim a deduction for an expense or loss incurred in deriving income from employment, except if the expenses relate to determining one’s tax liability. 21 • Inland Revenue has notified the individual under proposed section 22I(2)(b) that Inland Revenue is satisfied that their adjusted account correctly and completely records their income for the corresponding income year. The assessment will determine the individual’s tax position as either a refund due or an amount of tax to pay. This treatment is explained in detail in the next commentary item. Assessments when Inland Revenue is not satisfied that information is correct and complete (proposed section 22I(2)(c) and amended section 106) Proposed section 22I(2)(c) provides that an assessment arises when Inland Revenue advises an individual that it is not satisfied that their information in their pre-populated account or their adjusted account is correct and complete and issues a default assessment under the proposed amended section 106. Proposed new section 106(1A) gives Inland Revenue the power to make an assessment of the amount of income subject to tax where Inland Revenue considers that the information provided in the individual’s final account for a tax year is not likely to be correct. Proposed section 106(1B) provides that tax assessed under proposed section 106(1A) is payable by the individual unless the individual disputes the assessment under section 89D. The proposed amendment to section 89D that replaces subsection 89D(2B) requires an individual to dispute a default assessment as described in 22I(2)(c) by making an adjustment to their final account for the tax year. Error correction before an account is confirmed or an assessment is made (proposed sections 22F(4) and 22H(2)) Proposed section 22F(4) allows an individual to change the information contained in their pre-populated or adjusted account at any time before the individual has confirmed the account under proposed section 22(G), or an assessment is made under section 22I(2). This assessment would occur where: • Inland Revenue was satisfied the information was correct and complete and notified the individual; or • where Inland Revenue was not satisfied that the information was correct and complete and issued a default assessment. Under proposed section 22H(2), Inland Revenue can amend information in the individual’s pre-populated account, or adjusted account for the tax year, to correct errors in the information and must immediately notify the individual of the amendment. 22 Error correction after an assessment is made (proposed sections 22H(3)and (4), and section 108(1)) Proposed section 22H(4) provides that an individual can ask Inland Revenue to amend the information contained in their final account under existing section 113 where they discover an error once an assessment has been made. Section 113 allows Inland Revenue to amend an assessment when it is necessary in order to ensure its correctness. Proposed section 22(H)(4) allows Inland Revenue to amend the information in an individual’s final account to correct errors in the final account at any time up to the end of the time bar period in section 108(1) and requires Inland Revenue to notify the individual of the amendment. Section 108(1) restricts Inland Revenue from amending a return if four years have passed since the end of the tax year in which the return was filed. However, this does not apply where the return is fraudulent, wilfully misleading, or omits all mention of income of a particular nature or derived from a particular source. 23 REFUNDS OF TAX AND AMOUNTS OF TAX TO PAY (Clauses 21, 44, 97, 98 and 206) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are proposed to improve the process for issuing refunds and advising individuals that they have tax to pay, or are due a refund. This should remove unnecessary compliance costs currently being incurred by individuals. The proposed changes are: • Inland Revenue would calculate whether people who are not expected to be required to provide information to Inland Revenue were entitled to a refund or had tax to pay. • Refunds would be paid out without individuals having to request them. • Inland Revenue would issue income tax refunds by direct credit, unless that would result in undue hardship or is not practicable. • Amounts of tax to pay arising from withholding tax regimes where tax was withheld in accordance with the PAYE rules, or where tax was withheld at the rate corresponding to the individual’s marginal tax rate, would not have to be paid. • Amounts of tax to pay arising from a withholding tax regime where less than $200 of income was taxed incorrectly would not have to be paid. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019, and will apply for the tax year-end processes for the tax year ended 31 March 2019. Key features Inland Revenue will automatically calculate whether an individual is entitled to a refund where it is reasonably satisfied that it has the necessary information. If the individual is entitled to a refund Inland Revenue will pay it out by direct credit automatically, regardless of the amount due. Similarly, amendments are proposed that will enable Inland Revenue to simplify compliance obligations for individuals with tax to pay who are subject to withholding tax regimes. Background Under the current law, individuals are responsible for determining whether they are required to file a return, or whether they need to take any action to finalise their tax 24 posit ion. 6 Taxpayers who are not required to file returns do not have their tax posit ions squared up automatically. If these taxpayers want to determine whether they have tax to pay or are due a refund, they must interact with Inland Revenue (for example, by requesting a personal tax summary). Non-filing taxpayers can be selective and, based on their summary of earnings, request a personal tax summary only in years where a refund is due. The current approach does not accord with the Government’s objective of making tax simpler for individuals, and there is an integrity issue with taxpayers being able to “cherry pick” refunds. The proposed amendments will simplify the rules so that more individuals can understand their obligations and meet those obligations with minimal effort. If an individual who is not required to provide additional tax information is due a refund or has tax to pay, then Inland Revenue will calculate this automatically. Refunds will be paid out without an individual having to interact with Inland Revenue to request them and Inland Revenue will contact individuals and inform them of any outstanding tax to pay. Amounts of a tax to pay arising from income of $200 or less that has been incorrectly taxed under a withholding tax regime will not have to be paid. Any amounts of tax to pay arising from withholding tax regimes where tax was withheld in accordance with the PAYE rules, or where tax was withheld at the rate corresponding to the individual’s marginal tax rate, would also not have to be paid. Detailed analysis All references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. No obligations to provide information: de minimis and certain other amounts (section 22J contained in new subpart 3B) Proposed new section 22J sets out the circumstances in which an individual will not have to provide income information to Inland Revenue. Section 22J(1) provides that an individual will not have to provide information for a tax year if the individual derives other income below a $200 de minimis threshold. Section 22J(2) provides a list of exempt categories where a person will not have to provide income information to Inland Revenue (for example, income derived by a non- resident seasonal worker). These exceptions already exist under the current law, but have been codified in section 22J(2) to consolidate the rules for individuals into Part 3B. Power of Commissioner in relation to refunds or tax payable (section 174AA(b) amended) The proposed amendment to section 174AA(b) removes the $5 refund threshold. Refunds will now be paid out by direct credit regardless of the amount. The proposed amendment also provides that the Commissioner will not require amounts of tax payable to be paid where the tax was withheld in accordance with the PAYE rules or where the 6 Currently a person is not required to file a return if they, in addition to satisfying a number of other criteria, derive $200 or less of certain types of income from which tax has not been withheld or not withheld incorrectly (see section 33AA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). 25 tax was withheld at the individual’s marginal tax rate. Amounts of tax to pay arising from a withholding tax regime where less than $200 of income was taxed incorrectly would also not have to be paid. The following examples demonstrate what would occur under the proposed amendment if an individual had the incorrect amount of tax withheld, but the tax was withheld in accordance with the PAYE rules. Example 5 Sam Sam is an employee earning salary income which is paid weekly and from which his employer deducts PAYE each pay day. Last year Sam’s annual salary was $78,000. Each week Sam earned $1,500 from which Sam’s employer withheld $320 PAYE (excluding ACC earners’ levy) each pay-da y. Because of the day on which his salary is paid, last tax year Sam received 53 weekly salary pays in the tax year (a standard tax year has 52 pay-days). Because the PAYE system is based on 52 weekly pay days occurring in a tax year, Sam has a tax shortfall of $175. (He received $79,500 salary income in the tax year, but his weekly PAYE was based on $78,000. Sam would not be required to provide any income information to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would consider what it knows about Sam. It would have no reason to believe that he needs to provide any information to Inland Revenue. As Sam’s tax has been withheld in accordance with the PAYE rules, he would not be required to pay the $175 tax shortfall. Ellis Ellis is an employee earning a salary of $75,000 and also during the year receives $500 of income from his employee share scheme. His employer deducts PAYE and other deductions from his salary each pay day but has not elected to deduct PAYE from the employee share scheme income. Inland Revenue will have available both salary and employee share scheme income information and it has no reason to believe that Ellis needs to provide any additional information to Inland Revenue. As PAYE has not been withheld from the employee share scheme income and the amount of income is over $200, Ellis will be issued a notice of tax to pay. While Ellis’ tax has been withheld in accordance with the PAYE rules, he has received income that was not subject to withholding. Section 174AA(b) also ensures that those receiving certain payments from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) are not subject to overpayments of tax. For example, if MSD make a lump-sum back payment to a client, but do not correctly gross up the tax payment to Inland Revenue, it will show at year-end that there is an underpayment of tax, despite the individual receiving the correct net entitlement. In this situation the client would not be liable for the amount of tax to pay. This section also preserves the current law in relation to payments to non-resident seasonal workers and providers of standard-cost household services. Similarly, the threshold set out in section 174AA(a), which provides that amounts of tax to pay of less than $20 will not have to be paid, will also be retained. 26 Refund of tax paid in excess made by direct credit to bank account (section 184A amended) Section 184A(2) will be amended to reflect that taxpayers will no longer need to claim refunds, as they will be issued automatically. Section RM 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 abolished (overpayment on income statements) This section applied where an income statement (personal tax summary) had been provided to a person and there was an amount of tax to be refunded exceeding $600. The section provided that the Commissioner could refund this amount only after the person confirms that the income statement was correct. It is proposed that this section is repealed as all refunds, regardless of amount, will now be issued automatically once an account is deemed final in accordance with section 22D(6) and has become an assessment. Section 43 – Income tax returns and assessments by executors or administrators Section 43(4) and 43(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which establish obligations on an executor for a deceased taxpayer’s tax liabilities, will also be repealed. These sections provided that the executor must request an income statement in some cases (section 43(4)), and may request an income statement if the taxpayer would have met the requirements of section 33AA(1) (section 43(5)). 27 REPEAL OF INCOME STATEMENT RULES AND OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 6, 13, 34, 35, 39, 40, 41, 43, 47, 48, 51, 52, 68, 69, 71, 74, 89, 92, 93, 94, 101, 127, 187, 188, 189, 200, 239, 240, 244 and 265) Summary of proposed amendment As a consequence of the changes to individual’s income filing, some of the current law governing individual’s income tax obligations will be repealed. Consequential amendments are also proposed to align the current law with the proposals in the Bill. The proposed changes are: • Part 3A (Income statements) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be repealed. • Section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be repealed. • Sections 33C, 33D along with 15B(h) and 15B(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be repealed. • A number of consequential amendments will be made to give effect to the new reporting of income rules for individuals in Part 3, subpart 3B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These consequential amendments will be made to the following Acts: – Tax Administration Act 1994; – Income Tax Act 2007; – Child Support Act 1991; – Student Loan Scheme Act 2011; and – Accident Compensation Act 2001. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Background The proposed legislative changes set out in the previous five commentary items prescribe the way in which individuals will interact with Inland Revenue in relation to the income tax system. This means that current mechanisms of filing, such as income statements (personal tax summaries) and IR3 forms, will be replaced by a pre-populated account that includes all information that Inland Revenue knows about the individual. People who only earn “reportable income” will not have to do anything, and only those people who earn income that Inland Revenue does not know about, will have to provide further information to Inland Revenue. In order to give effect to these changes some of the current law will need to be repealed and amended. 28 Detailed analysis The following section provides an overview of the law in the Tax Administration Act 1994 that is proposed to be repealed. Part 3A repealed (income statements) Part 3A sets out the law on income statements and comprises of sections 80A to 80I inclusive. It is proposed that Part 3A is repealed. Sections 33AA repealed (exceptions to requirement for return of income) Section 33AA provides that an individual will not be required to file a return if they, in addition to satisfying a number of other criteria, derive $200 or less of certain types of income from which tax has not been withheld or not withheld incorrectly. It is proposed that section 33AA is repealed. Under the new proposals in subpart 3B, an individual who earns reportable income will not have to provide income information to Inland Revenue, and only those who earn income that Inland Revenue does not know about (“other income”) will be obliged to provide information to Inland Revenue. This information will be used for the purposes of determining a final account under proposed section 22D(6)(a)(ii), and therefore an assessment under proposed section 22I(2)(c). Proposed section 22J(1) replaces section 33AA(2) and provides that an individual will not have to provide information for a tax year if the individual derives other income of less than $200 (the de minimis rule). Section 15B (h) and (i) repealed (taxpayer’s tax obligations) Section 15B(h) and (i) imposes obligations on taxpayers in relation to income statements. These sections are proposed to be repealed. Sections 33C and 33D repealed (returns not required for certain providers of personal services and for non-resident seasonal workers) Section 33C and 33D exempts certain categories of income earners from filing a return. These sections are proposed to be repealed. These exempt categories are now provided for in proposed section 22J(2) under new subpart 3B. Consequential amendments This section list s consequential amendments that are proposed to support the substantive changes on individual’s income tax in the Bill. Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 4A amended (Construction on certain provisions) Section 33 amended (Returns of income) Section 37 amended (Dates by which annual returns to be furnished) Section 38 amended (Returns to annual balance date) Section 41 amended (Annual returns by persons who receive family assistance credit) Section 42C amended (Income tax returns by undischarged bankrupt) 29 Section 80KM amended (Summary of instalments paid) Section 89C amended (Notices of proposed adjustment required to be issued by Commissioner) Section 89D amended (Taxpayers and others with standing may issue notices of proposed adjustment) Section 92 amended (Taxpayer assessment of income tax) Section 106 amended (Assessment where default made in furnishing returns) Section 110 amended (Evidence of returns and assessments) Section 111 amended (Commissioner to give notice of assessment to taxpayer) Section 120C amended (Definitions) Section 139A amended (Late filing penalty for certain returns) Section 141JA amended (Application of Part 9 to non-filing tax payers) Section 143 amended (Absolute liability offences) Section 143A amended (Knowledge offences) Schedule 5 amended (Certain tax codes and rates) Income Tax Act 2007 Section CX 27 amended (Assistance with tax returns) Section RA 13 amended (Payment dates for terminal tax) Section RB 3 amended (Schedular income tax liability for filing taxpayers for non- resident passive income) Section RC 3 amended (Who is required to pay provisional tax?) Section RD 22 amended (Providing employment income information to Commissioner) Child Support Act 1991 Section 35 amended (Adjusted taxable income) Section 81 amended (Notification requirement of parents) Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Section 34 amended (Repayment codes for New Zealand-based borrowers) Section 35 amended (Borrowers with “SL” repayment code must notify employers) Section 36 amended (Employer or PAYE intermediary must make standard deductions from salary or wages) Section 57 amended (Consequences of exemption from standard deductions) Section 60 amended (Where exemption from standard deductions ceases to apply) Schedule 2 amended (Application of PAYE rules for purposes of section 70) Accident Compensation Act 2001 Schedule 4 amended (Deductions on account of earner levies) 30 THE ADMINISTRATION OF DONATION TAX CREDITS (Clause 42) Summary of proposed amendment Several amendments are proposed to enable Inland Revenue to simplify the administration of donation tax credits. The proposed changes are: • Donation receipts would be able to be submitted during the year, and could be submitted electronically. • Donation tax credits would be able to be claimed as part of the income tax year- end process. • If an individual has already submitted receipts during the year, these will automatically be taken into account without the individual having to fill in a separate claim form. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features Inland Revenue will simplify the process for claiming donation tax credits by updating its operational practice to accept donation receipts which are submitted electronically via myIR, and submitted during the year. People will still be able to file a separate donation tax credit claim if they choose to do so. Background Currently, credits for donations can be claimed at the end of the tax year by filling in a tax credit claim form (IR526), or during the year through Payroll Giving, where the credits are received immediately. An IR526 is a paper based form, and paper versions of receipts must be saved and submitted with this form at the end of the year. The proposed amendment will simplify the process for claiming donation tax credits and make it more flexible for individuals. Under the proposal, individuals will have the option to submit receipts electronically when they receive them, which reduces the risk that they could be forgotten or lost before being able to be submitted. The tax credit claim process (currently the IR526) will be retained as an option for those who prefer to file their donation tax credit claim separately. At year-end, if a person has submitted donation receipts during the year and Inland Revenue considers the person is entitled to the donation tax credit, the refund will be issued without the need to submit a tax credit claim request. 31 Returns by persons with tax credits for charitable or other public benefit gifts (section 41A amended) Proposed new subsection 41A(1) prescribes the ways in which a person may apply to have their tax credit refunded. In practice, a person may: • upload donation receipts through myIR during the year; • complete the relevant donation section when providing other income information through the pre-populated account; • complete a separate return online through myIR (that is, if done after other income information is provided); or • complete a paper based form. A consequential amendment has also been made to section 41A(5). The phrase “be signed by a person” has been omitted to reflect the fact that receipts can now be submitted electronically. Section 41A(6B) ensures that donation tax credit claims are subject to the same time bar rules that apply to income tax returns. This means that the Commissioner cannot amend a tax credit claim (either adjust up or down) after four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer submits the donation tax credit claim. Section 41A(6) provides that all of the above changes for section 41A will take effect for the 2018–19 and later income years. 32 Modernising tax administration – Core aspects of the Tax Administration Act 33 34 OVERVIEW The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the rules and processes for collecting and disbursing the revenue and payments administered by Inland Revenue. It plays a significant role in ensuring the right incentives are in place to influence compliance with tax laws. The efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration rules and processes is crit ical to maintaining fairness in the tax system. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme provides an opportunity to step back and review the core settings in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure they are continuing to operate in the most efficient and effective manner. The work to review and modernise these settings focuses on the core dimensions of the Tax Administration Act 1994, namely the roles of the Commissioner, taxpayers and intermediaries (such as tax agents), as well as the rules around information collection, use and disclosure. These core aspects of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been the subject of two Government discussion documents, Making Tax Simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act (November 2015) and Making Tax Simpler – Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act (December 2016). Making Tax Simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act provided a high level view of the future framework for tax administration focusing on the core concepts and roles set out in the Act as they relate to the “right from the start” concept and Inland Revenue’s new compliance model both of which aim to ensure a faster, more efficient yet flexible tax system. Through the development of Making Tax Simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act it became clear that the issues were wide-ranging and complex, and would require further detailed discussion. This would also provide the opportunity to take public submissions into account when developing detailed proposals. Two key themes that emerged from public submissions on Making Tax Simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act were that: • while there is a need for the Commissioner to have some flexibility in the application of the law, this should not be at the expense of transparency in her decisio n-making; and • the need for greater information-sharing within government was understood but this should not be detrimental to taxpayers’ rights to privacy and confidentiality. A second document, Making Tax Simpler – Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, was released in December 2016. This document detailed legislative proposals for a wider application of the Commissioner’s care and management function and more relevant informat ion-sharing and confidentiality rules. It also outlined measures to provide taxpayers with better tools to ensure the correctness of their tax affairs and to allow a greater range of intermediaries to interact with Inland Revenue’s systems. Following the proposals set out in the second discussion document, the proposed legislative changes in this Bill are grouped into four key areas: 35 • Collection, use and disclosure of information – in particular, modernising the rules around confidentiality and information-sharing. • In keeping with the “right from the start” framework, allowing greater taxpayer access to binding rulings with a new short process rulings system and improving the process for taxpayers to deal with minor errors. • Permitting a wider group of intermediaries to have access to new services provided by Business Transformation. • Subject to clear safeguards in keeping with the rule of law, allowing the Commissioner some flexibility under care and management responsibilities to respond to obvious legislative anomalies. Following the receipt of submissions, further consultation was carried out with representatives from key stakeholder groups Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the New Zealand Law Society and the Corporate Taxpayers Group. This further consultation, together with the submissions received on both discussion documents, informed the final policy recommendations for the proposed amendments. The merits of the proposed changes are analysed in the regulatory impact assessments, available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2018-ria-armtarm-bill/overview : • Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information; • Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – rulings, amendments and tax intermediaries; and • Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies. Each area is covered in more detail in the following sections of this commentary. 36 INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE Information is critical to Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver services. Much of that information is provided by taxpayers. This may be information about themselves (such as in an individual or business income tax return) or about other taxpayers (such as in an emplo yer mo nthly schedule). Inland Revenue can enforce the provision of information that is not received through regular channels, and has significant powers to do so, but the use of these powers is the exception rather than the rule. Inland Revenue’s information collection powers are long-established, and generally work well. There is an established standard that where the Commissioner is using compulsory powers, this is only for information considered “necessary or relevant” to the Commissioner’s functions. This gives an assurance that Inland Revenue will only use its powers to obtain information that is needed. This Bill proposes to rewrite the information collection provisions in order to make them clearer and more navigable, however, there are no proposed changes of substance with the exception of two areas: • The introduction of a regulation-making power to govern the repeat collection of third-party datasets. This will provide a more efficient and transparent process for this type of collection, as distinct from the current ad hoc collection of such information using existing powers. • Clarifying explicitly in the legislation that information collected for one Inland Revenue purpose can be used for the department’s other functions. For taxpayers to be comfortable providing their information, they need to feel the information requested is reasonable and is treated appropriately by Inland Revenue. Currently, this assurance is given by what is often referred to as the “tax secrecy” rule, set out in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – which essentially states that information provided to Inland Revenue will only be used for revenue purposes. Rules about the confidentiality of tax (and taxpayer) information are common across revenue agencies internationally. For most public sector agencies the primary rules governing collection, use and disclosure of information are set out in the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982. However, for Inland Revenue, the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the primary rules. The confidentiality of tax information is important for three key reasons: • It is seen as a balance for Inland Revenue’s information gathering powers. Revenue agencies are generally granted wide information-gathering powers so they can ensure that taxpayers are meeting their obligations. • Confidentiality has traditionally been considered necessary to promote compliance – taxpayers will be more willing to provide information to Inland Revenue if they are assured it will go no further. • Taxpayer privacy has also more recently been referred to by the Courts – and the right of taxpayers to have their affairs kept confidential is also recognised in 37 section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in defining the integrity of the tax system. “Tax secrecy”, or at least the part that relates to the confidentiality of a taxpayer’s individual affairs, is seen as a critical component of the integrity of the tax system, as reflected in the definition of integrity in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, the current rules can lead to tensions, particularly between: • confidentiality and wider government objectives, including the more efficient operation of government and the provision of services that can be achieved through increased cross-government information sharing; and • confidentiality and the Official Information Act 1982 principle of open access to information held by government. Inland Revenue already shares considerable amounts of information with other agencies. The aim of the proposed amendments is to modernise and clarify the rules, to better provide for confidentiality and sharing in the future, and more clearly balance the trade- offs inherent in decision about whether information should be shared. The key proposed amendments relating to confidentiality comprise: • Narrowing the confidentiality rule from its current coverage of all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts, to more clearly target information about taxpayers. • Providing a clearer exceptions framework, grouping the exceptions into categories and improving the navigabilit y o f the legislat ion. • Introducing a more flexible regulatory framework for information sharing to assist with the provision of public service (building on existing rules). • Allowing Inland Revenue to enter into agreements for information-sharing without need for regulations where the sharing will be done with customer consent. Again this is linked to information-sharing for public service provision. The next six commentary items (Information co llect ion, Informat ion use, Confidentiality, Confidentiality exceptions framework, Information sharing, Penalties for misuse for information) improve the framework by which Inland Revenue can collect, use and disclose information. 38 INFORMATION COLLECTION (Clauses 15, 99 and 102) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments modernise the existing information collection provisions by updating the language and removing some existing repetition. These amendments do not represent a policy change with the exception of one aspect, detailed further below. A transitional provision is included to make clear there is no policy change intended by the rewrite of these provisions. One policy change is included in the proposed amendments – introducing a new regulat ion-making power for repeat collection of certain data. This builds on the existing power to collect information on an ad hoc basis by providing for regulations to be made where bulk data is considered necessary or relevant on a regular basis, providing greater clarity and transparency in these situations. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features As part of the modernisation of the Tax Administration Act 1994, provisions governing the collection use and disclosure of information are proposed to be brought together in a new subpart 3A and rewritten in a more modern, navigable style. Overarching purpose and principle sections have also been added to improve navigability and clarity. These new purpose and principle sections do not represent any policy change, rather they draw together the purpose and principles already contained in the existing provisions. One new provision is included within the proposed changes – introducing a regulation- making power where information is to be sought on a regular, repeating basis, as distinct from using existing powers to collect information on an ad hoc basis. Background Inland Revenue’s existing powers to collect information generally work well and no significant change is proposed. Broadly, Inland Revenue has the ability to collect information to carry out its various functions and, where necessary, to compel the provision of information that is considered “necessary or relevant”. This is a long- established standard and gives the assurance that Inland Revenue will only use its information-gathering powers to obtain information that is needed. The current rules, while currently generally working well, were designed for a time when information was stored and exchanged in paper format. The rules, however, continue to work well in most situations where information is collected on a one-off or 39 ad hoc basis. This applies equally to individual taxpayer data and wider datasets comprising information about many taxpayers. As the digitisation of the economy increases, so too does the availability and usefulness of large datasets. Data matching is becoming increasingly common in both the public and private sector. In the tax context, the use of large datasets for compliance and educative work has been part of the toolkit for revenue agencies around the world for some time. Such data is used for a range of purposes, including education, targeted publicity and support, targeting compliance work to high risk cases, pre-populating returns, and tailoring service approaches. In New Zealand, the existing information-gathering powers in the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been recognised by the Courts as enabling the collection of large datasets. However, it is proposed to provide more specific rules for situations when such information is required on a regular, repeating basis. This will provide greater transparency about those situations where data is being routinely and regularly collected. The proposed new provision is a clarification for specific circumstances and therefore does not affect the existing information collection powers set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Detailed analysis Clause 15 inserts a proposed new subpart 3A into the Tax Administration Act 1994, containing provisions relating to collection, use and disclosure of revenue information. This, combined with clause 102 inserting a proposed new schedule 7, would replace the existing sections 16–21 and Part 4 of the Act. Proposed new section 16 sets out the purpose of the subpart, which is to: • provide the Commissioner with the necessary powers to carry out her duties and collect all the taxes under the Inland Revenue Acts; • enable the Commissioner to collect revenue information, including accessing property, removing, retaining, copying and reviewing documents; • require the production of documents or access to information; • set out the Commissioner’s powers in relation to documents; • provide a regulation-making power for regular collection of bulk data (new); • describe how revenue information may be used (new); • protect the confidentiality of sensitive revenue information; and • facilitate efficient and effective government administration and law enforcement through permitted disclosures of sensitive revenue information for certain purposes. Proposed new section 16B then sets out the principles upon which the subpart is based, in particular: • the purposes for collecting revenue information; 40 • that accessing property or documents may occur only where it is necessary or relevant; • that revenue information must be protected with appropriate security safeguards; and • that sensitive revenue information may not be disclosed otherwise than in accordance with the permitted disclosure rules set out in the subpart and proposed new schedule 8. A number of key terms are set out in proposed new section 16C. These distinguish between “revenue information” and “sensitive revenue information” for the purposes of the subpart, and linked to the new confidentiality rule. “Revenue officer” and “revenue law” are also both defined, being modernised drafting of concepts from the existing legislation. Proposed new sections 17–17K then set out, in rewritten format, the information collection rules currently contained in sections 16–19 and 21 of the Act. This is a drafting improvement rather than a policy change. Proposed new section 227F is included to make clear that there is no change of meaning with regard to these sections. New regulation-making power for datasets Proposed new section 17L inserts a new regulation-making power into the Tax Administration Act 1994. This would enable regulations to be made by Order in Council, authorising the collection, on a regular basis, of bulk data, where that collection is necessary or relevant for revenue purposes. A regulation would specify: • the type of information to be collected; • the person, or class of persons from whom it would be collected; • the frequency of collection; and • the form and specifications for the collection of the information. The proposed provision has a number of safeguards built in. Before recommending regulations the Minister of Revenue must be satisfied that: • the regulations are necessary for the administration or enforcement of any of the Inland Revenue Acts or any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner; • the proposed use of the information is consistent with the Inland Revenue Acts; and • a consultation process has been undertaken with those the Commissioner considers it is reasonable to consult, including consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. Consultation would include provision of draft regulations and an explanation of why they are considered necessary and how the proposed use of the information is consistent with the Inland Revenue Acts. The proposed provision also contains a statutory review requirement. This would require the Commissioner to conduct a review of the operation of the proposed provisio n, in 41 consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. This review would be required to be carried out five years after the proposed provision comes into force. 42 INFORMATION USE (Clause 15) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment provides an express clarification that information gathered for one revenue purpose can be used for any other revenue purpose. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment Detailed analysis Inland Revenue has a very broad range of functions. In many cases interactions with a customer may be for a particular purpose, or in relation to a particular product type, for example personal income tax or Working for Families tax credits. However, the information obtained may also be relevant for other purposes, for example the customer’s student loan or child support accounts. Customers, both personal and business, have a range of different interactions with Inland Revenue and therefore information can be relevant for a range of purposes linked to Inland Revenue’s various functions. The Tax Administration Act 1994 charges the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the care and management of the taxes and with other conferred functions. The care and management responsibility encompasses the requirement that the Commissioner carry out her functions in a way that makes the most efficient use of her resources. This requirement, coupled with the overarching requirement to protect the integrity of the tax system, suggests that the Commissioner should be able to make the most efficient use of information at her disposal in order to fulfil her various functions and responsibilities. To make it clear that information gathered for the purpose of one revenue function is also able to be used for any of Inland Revenue’s other functions, the proposed amendment includes this principle in proposed new section 17M. A similar approach is taken in the equivalent United Kingdom legislation which expressly provides that “information acquired by the Revenue and Customs in connection with a function may be used by them in connection with any other function”. 7 The principle that information obtained under the Tax Administration Act 1994 or any other Inland Revenue Act can be used for any revenue purpose includes reuse of information and use of the information in permitted disclosures pursuant to Inland Revenue’s various information sharing provisions. 7 Commissioners of Revenue and Customs Act 2005, section 17. 43 CONFIDENTIALITY (Clause 15) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed amendments to the current “tax secrecy” rule more clearly focus on the core information to be protected, namely information that identifies, or relates to, taxpayers. It is also proposed to modernise and restructure the confidentiality rules to improve the clarity and navigability of the legislation. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Under the proposed amendment the confidentiality rule is reframed from covering all matters relating to revenue legislation, to being clearly focused on information about, or relating to, taxpayers. Background In order to administer the tax system and associated social policy products, Inland Revenue collects and holds information on virtually all New Zealanders, as well as most corporate and other entities, such as trusts and partnerships. This is information that taxpayers are compelled to provide to Inland Revenue, and therefore it must be treated with care. While the Privacy Act 1993 provides a framework for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, much of the information held by Inland Revenue is non- personal, and no equivalent legislative framework exists. Given the breadth of the information Inland Revenue holds, and the sensitivity of some of this information, specific rules about confidentiality for Inland Revenue must be retained. A key issue with the current rules about tax information is the difference between Inland Revenue and other government agencies in relation to official information. The Official Information Act 1982, which defines “official information” as including any information held by a department, provides a presumption of availability of information – that official information will be available to requestors unless there is a good reason for it to be withheld. In contrast, the starting point of the rule relating to tax information is that Inland Revenue officers must maintain the secrecy of “all matters relating” to the Inland Revenue Acts. While the precise limits of the rule are not clear, it is apparent that this rule is not limited to information about taxpayers. 44 The breadth of the current rule means that a wide range of information, including information relating to procurement, analysis and statistics, information technology, finance and planning, policy development and even publicly available information is subject to the tax secrecy rule, unless a subsequent exception applies. Much of this information would not be considered confidential in the hands of any other agency. As set out in the introduction to the information section, there are generally three key reasons given for confidentiality of tax information. Each of these reasons has at their core the protection of information about the taxpayers or entities that provide information to Inland Revenue. Each of the concerns – the impact on voluntary compliance, balancing information collection powers and the protection of privacy – is focused on the harm that would result from the disclosure of taxpayer (or entity) information. There does not appear therefore, to be a clear reason for the breadth of the current secrecy rule and the inconsistency this creates for Inland Revenue as compared with other agencies. The broad approach is also inconsistent with that taken in other jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Detailed analysis Proposed new section 18 sets out the new confidentiality rule. Rather than “all matters relating to” the Inland Revenue Acts, the new rule would cover “sensitive revenue information”. Sensitive revenue information is defined in proposed new section 16C as information that relates to the affairs of a person or entity that: • identifies or could identify a taxpayer, whether directly or indirectly; • might reasonably be regarded as private, commercially sensitive or otherwise confidential; or • the release of which could result in loss, harm or prejudice to a person to whom or which it relates. The rule therefore aims to protect information about taxpayers, including where it might be commercially or personally sensitive. A protection is also proposed to be retained (proposed new subsection 18(3)) for information that, while not specifically about taxpayers, is still highly sensitive and the release of which could adversely affect the integrity of the tax system or prejudice Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce the law. This would include information about matters such as audit or investigative techniques or strategies, compliance information, thresholds, analytical approaches and so on. The release of such information, if not protected, could affect the Crown’s ability to collect revenue. As with the current tax secrecy rule, proposed new section 18 sets out confidentiality requirements for Inland Revenue officers and for others who have access to Inland Revenue information. Proposed new section 18B sets out a requirement that before accessing information, officers and others must certify (or in the case of officers, complete a declaration) that they will comply with their confidentiality obligations. Previous declarations and certificates would be treated as continuing to be valid under the new rule. 45 CONFIDENTIALITY EXCEPTIONS FRAMEWORK (Clauses 15 and 102) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments restructure the existing exceptions to confidentiality into a clearer framework. Under the proposed new structure the overarching rules would be contained in the main provisions (proposed sections 18C–18J) and the detail of most exceptions set out in proposed new schedule 7. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments set out the categories of exceptions to the proposed new confident ialit y rule. The legislation is restructured to contain the main rules within the primary sections and the detail of the exceptions within these categories in proposed new schedule 7. Other than as specifically identified in the following sections of this commentary, the exceptions are merely restating existing rules rather than introducing new ones. Background While there has long been a rule of confidentiality applied to tax information, that protection is not absolute. There are a considerable number of exceptions allowing disclosure of information. Over time the number of exceptions has increased which has led to a legislative framework that could be seen to lack clarity and clear unifying principles. The proposed amendments aim to collect the exceptions into a clearer, more cohesive framework. Broadly the current exceptions can be grouped into four main categories: • disclosures for purposes related to the tax system; • disclosures to the taxpayer or their agent; • disclosures relating to international agreements; and • disclosures to other government agencies for non-tax-related purposes. The proposed amendments group the existing exceptions as set out above, providing a clearer outline of the categories where exceptions are provided and then setting out the detailed exceptions in a proposed new schedule. 46 Detailed analysis Proposed new sections 18C–18J contain the overarching framework for exceptions to the rule o f confident ialit y or “permitted disclo sures”. Further detailed rules regarding each category of exception are set out in proposed new schedule 7. Carrying into effect The first category of exceptions, set out in proposed new section 18D, relates to disclosures made in carrying tax laws into effect. Further details of each exception are set out in proposed new schedule 7 part A. Proposed new section 18D encompasses the existing exceptions in sections 81(1) (carrying into effect), 81(1B) (disclosures relating to a duty of the Commissioner), 81(1BB) (disclosures in a co-located environment), and 81(3) (disclosures for court proceedings). The exceptions specified in clauses 3 to 13 of proposed new schedule 7 comprise existing exceptions that are also for purposes related to carrying into effect revenue laws. Information sharing Proposed new sections 18E and 18F relate to information sharing for public service provisio n. These provisions provide for such sharing in three ways: • Under an Approved Information Sharing Agreement pursuant to Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993 (current section 81A). • Under an agreement between agencies where information is to be shared with the consent of the taxpayer to whom it relates (new provision). • Under regulations made under proposed new section 81F – this proposed section is a modified version of the regulation-making power currently contained in sectio n 81BA. Further detail about each of the proposed information-sharing methods is contained in the next commentary item (Information sharing). Disclosures to persons or their representatives Proposed new section 18G authorises disclosures to the taxpayer themselves or their representative(s). Further detail is contained in schedule 7 part B. The relevant clauses in the schedule replicate existing exceptions in section 81(4), specifically 81(4)(j) (statistical information), 81(4)(l) (disclosure to the taxpayer or their representative), 81(4)(lb) (tax pooling intermediaries) and 81(4)(ld) (software packages). Clause 16 brings together and broadens the existing exceptions in 81(4)(lb) and 81(4)(lc) (information regarding tax agents) to include the wider class of representatives covered by the proposed intermediary changes in clause 79 of this Bill (see the commentary item Third party providers and intermediaries on pages 64–68). This category also contains a proposed new exception for disclosures to digital services providers. New clause 18, schedule 7 would enable customers to use digital services to communicate with Inland Revenue, where the digital service is one that the Commissioner has listed as an accepted provider. This proposed new provision is similar to the existing software clients provision (proposed new clause 17, schedule 7, currently 47 section 81(4)(ld)) in that it permits disclosure to the provider of the service (in that case an accepted software package) as a consequence of a customer using that package or service to communicate with Inland Revenue. Disclosures to other agencies Proposed new section 18H and schedule 7 part C set out specific legislative exceptions involving disclosures to other agencies. The exceptions set out in the schedule mirror those in the current Part 4 of the Act with no changes other than: • minor changes for flow to combine provisions where an exception was contained in both section 81(4) and a subsequent section in Part 4; • minor amendments to the sharing provision with Statistics New Zealand (proposed new schedule 7, clause 21). This exception has been updated to modernise the language, as unlike most other agencies, it is considered appropriate to retain this sharing arrangement in legislation, rather than moving to a regulatory model. Retaining this as a legislative exception reflects the quantity and breadth of information shared, the nature of the sharing (for statistical and research, rather than operational purposes) and the statutory independence of both the Government Statistician and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; • two proposed new authorisations arising from previously legislated rules. In both cases Parliament has already legislated for the information sharing in other statutes and the proposed amendments insert a parallel authorisation into the Tax Administration Act 1994: – Proposed new schedule 7, clause 24 would enable the Commissioner to disclose information to a government agency or an Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism supervisor for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (see section 140(1) and 140(2)(k), (l) and (v) of that Act). – Proposed new schedule 7, clause 25 would enable the Commissioner to disclose information to the New Zealand Customs Service in relation to a transfer price arrangement for the purpose of assessing the suitability of any such arrangement in relation to the use of provisional values under the Customs and Excise Act 2018 (see section 102(8) of that Act). Disclosures for international purposes Proposed new section 18I and schedule 7 part D set out existing exceptions (sections 81(4)(k) and 88) for international disclosures. The exceptions set out in the schedule relate to double taxation agreements and reciprocal arrangements and are unchanged from the current legislation. Disclosures for risk of harm purposes Proposed new section 18J contains an exception not currently expressly set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposed section replicates the disclosure exception set out in the Privacy Act 1993 for situations where there is a serious threat to health and safet y. The proposed exception applies to allow disclosure where it is necessary to 48 prevent or lessen a serious threat to public health or public safety, or to the life or health of a person. The degree of how serious threat is, considers takes the event’s likelihood, severity and immanency. Any disclosure under this exception should only to be made to the person, body or agency which is able to do something to prevent or lessen the threat. An example given by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is a situation where a staff member is dealing with a customer who has made comments or threats leading the staff member to think the customer may harm themselves or others. In such a situation, information could be disclosed to Police so they can take appropriate steps to prevent the harm. 49 INFORMATION SHARING (Clause 15) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed new sections 18E and 18F relate to information sharing for public service provisio n. These would enable information sharing in three ways: • Under an Approved Information Sharing Agreement pursuant to Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993 (current section 81A). • Under an agreement between agencies where information is to be shared with the consent of the taxpayer to whom it relates (new provisio n). • Under regulations made under proposed new section 18F – this proposed section is a modified version of the regulation-making power currently contained in section 81BA. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendments build on Inland Revenue’s existing rules for information sharing authorised by regulation and agreement. They provide for information sharing to be authorised by regulation either: • by way of an approved information sharing agreement under Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. This is an existing exception currently set out in section 81A of the Tax Administration Act 1994; or • by way of an Order in Council under proposed new section 18F. This section is an amended version of the current section 81BA. The proposed amendments introduce greater consistency with the Privacy Act framework by extending the provision to enable sharing for the provision of public services, rather than being limited to government agencies. A new provision is also proposed, allowing the Commissioner to enter into agreements for information sharing, where the consent of the customer will be obtained. These agreements will not require authorisation by order in council. Similar to the regulation- making sharing provisions, this type of sharing is limited to situations where the sharing is to facilitate the provision of public services. 50 Background Taxpayers are compelled to provide their information to Inland Revenue for reasons of public good – the administration of the tax system and other social policy provisions. In considering the broader use of data, the Government is essentially balancing private rights (in the privacy or confidentiality of information) against the wider public good of efficient government, upholding the law and ensuring that people receive the correct entitlements at the appropriate time. Legislation already permits a considerable amount of cross-agency information sharing. However, it might be argued that there is no readily apparent consistent principle to these exceptions. Some are narrow, others broader, and in many cases legislative change has been made for the avoidance of doubt, even for minor changes to information exchanges. The newer exceptions (in current sections 81A and 81BA) are broader and allow sharing that meets certain conditions to be authorised by order in council. These exceptions allow a greater degree of transparency, as the Order in Council and underlying agreement are generally published. Such arrangements can also provide for public reporting on the information transfers. The proposed amendments build on these broader regulation-making exceptions, and aim to make information sharing for public service provision more flexible, principled and transparent. Regulatory models allow greater flexibility and timeliness of implementation and amendment of information sharing arrangements. Consideratio n was given as to whether the new rules should require an order in council or simply be managed by agreements between agencies. Given the importance of taxpayer confidentiality, the regulatory model was considered more appropriate as it will retain Cabinet and Regulations Review Committee oversight of proposed agreements. The one exception to this is agreements for information sharing where the consent of the customer concerned will be obtained prior to sharing – in that case it is proposed that an agreement model (without need for an Order in Council) would be appropriate. Detailed analysis The proposed amendments would provide for information sharing arrangements for the provision of public services to be entered into in three alternative ways: • An approved agreement under Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993 (proposed section 18E(2)). This replicates an existing provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorising the use of the Privacy Act rules. This provision would generally be used where the information to be exchanged is primarily personal information. • An agreement between agencies under proposed section 18E(3) where consent will be obtained from the customer for the sharing – no Order in Council or regulation is required under this proposed provision. This form of sharing could be used for situations where the agency receiving the information from Inland Revenue is providing services to a customer and, in the course of doing so, the customer consents to their information being obtained from Inland Revenue. This could also be used for optional services such as initiatives to simplify updating contact details across government agencies. 51 • A regulation, made by Order in Council, pursuant to proposed new section 18F, authorising information sharing. This is a proposed update to the regulation- making power currently in section 81BA. This provision would generally be used in situations where the information to be shared was primarily non-personal (entity) information or the Privacy Act 1993 Part 9A rules were otherwise not considered suitable. Each of the alternatives relates to information sharing for public service provision. This is defined in proposed new section 18E(4) and mirrors the definition in the Privacy Act 1993 with regards to information sharing under Part 9A of that Act. This improves consistency across the rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Privacy Act 1993, regardless of which mechanism is chosen. A “public service” is defined as a public function or duty that is conferred or imposed on an agency by or under law, or by a policy of the Government. An agency may include a private sector agency if they are delivering a public service as defined. This could include, for example, non-government organisations delivering public services under contract with a government department to also have access to the information if appropriate. Consent agreements In many cases information sharing is undertaken to improve the services offered by Government to New Zealanders, and the expectation is that those affected would consent to their information being shared. Under the Privacy Act 1993, individuals may authorise their information being shared, as privacy is theirs to waive. In contrast, confidentiality of tax information is an obligation imposed on Inland Revenue officers and the consent of the person to whom the information relates is no defence to breaching the obligation of confidentiality. In the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act it was proposed that taxpayers be able to consent to the disclosure of their information to other government agencies. This proposal was supported by most submitters, provided it was limited to within government. It is important to note that such arrangements do not mean that all information sharing requires consent – non-consented sharing would continue to occur where alternative legislative or regulatory authority exists. It is important that this is clear for customers and might suggest that consented arrangements should generally only be used where there is not also the possibility of non-consented sharing occurring under a different arrangement. Alternatively it should be made very clear to customers the situations in which information-sharing could occur independently of the consented agreement. Consent agreements under proposed section 18E(3) must set out the conditions for security and use of the information provided under the agreement. The agreement must also stipulate a process to ensure consent is properly obtained and recorded. Regulations under proposed new 18F Proposed new section 18F is an updated version of the regulation-making power currently contained in section 81BA. The proposed new provision enables sharing when: • the sharing is for public service provision, rather than the current limit to sharing with “government agencies” (new); 52 • the sharing is intended to improve the ability of the Government to deliver efficient or effective services or to enforce the law (new criterion); • the information is more easily or more efficiently obtained from or verified by Inland Revenue (existing criterion); • it is not unreasonable or impractical to require the Commissioner to deliver the informat ion (exist ing criterion); • the nature of the sharing is proportionate, taking into account the purpose for which the information is proposed to be shared (new criterion); • the person, entity, or agency receiving the information has adequate protection for the information (modified existing criterion); and • the sharing of the information will not unduly inhibit the future provision of information to the Commissioner (existing criterion). Regulations under the proposed new section would prescribe the classes or types of information to be shared, how it would be provided, accessed, stored, secured, disposed of, and used. They would also specify whether any further disclosure of the information was permitted, and whether the agreement was subject to review requirements, including where any breaches occur. Before recommending any regulations under this proposed provision, the Minister of Revenue must be satisfied that the regulations are necessary for their proposed purpose and that a consultation process has been undertaken. This process must include distribution of draft regulations and an explanation of the way in which the proposed information sharing is necessary to achieve its stated purpose. Consultation must include the Privacy Commissioner and other persons or organisations with whom the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers it reasonable to consult, and must run for a period of at least four weeks. 53 PENALTIES FOR MISUSE OF INFORMATION (Clause 96) Summary of proposed amendment These proposed amendments restate the existing penalty provisions relating to collection and use of information that apply to persons other than Inland Revenue officers. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Both Inland Revenue officers and persons other than Inland Revenue officers who have access to sensitive revenue information are required to keep that information confidential and only disclose it in accordance with the Tax Administration Act 1994. If a person knowingly breaches their confidentiality obligations they are subject to a penalty of either imprisonment for a maximum of six months or a fine of up to $15,000 or both. The obligation of confidentiality and the penalties are also contained in the current law. Proposed new sections 143D, 143E and 143EB restate the existing penalties for persons other than revenue officers (for whom the penalty applies under section 143C). The provisions are a modernisation of the current rules to ensure they continue to clearly apply to all persons given access to sensitive Inland Revenue information, and do not represent a policy change. 54 RULINGS AND AMENDING ASSESSMENTS A key objective in modernising the tax administration system is to make tax compliance simpler, especially for the small businesses sector. The objective can at least in part be met by adopting the OECD’s “right from the start” framework which suggests a more proactive rather than merely reactive approach to tax administration. One goal under the “right from the start” framework is first time accuracy so that the need to make subsequent adjustments to a return is reduced. The ability for a wider range of taxpayers to obtain reliable advice from Inland Revenue on their tax positions will assist in the goal of first time accuracy. Therefore, the Bill proposes to extend the ability to obtain private binding rulings to a wider range of taxpayers who are in practice excluded from this because of the complexity of the process and the fees charged for obtaining a binding ruling. While the focus of the modernised tax administration is based on the right from the start concept, there will still be situations when the taxpayer or the Commissioner will seek to amend or correct an assessment. The current process for amendment is complicated and does not align with taxpayers’ accounting processes for dealing with minor errors. Having to adopt a different process for tax purposes for minor errors imposes compliance costs. The Bill will provide a larger and more certain threshold for making adjustments in a current return rather than the return in which the error arose combined with a new materialit y thresho ld. The next three commentary items (Short process rulings, Extending the scope of binding rulings, and Amending assessments) improve the ability of Inland Revenue to help taxpayers get their tax obligations right from the start. 55 SHORT PROCESS RULINGS (Clauses 61 and 272–276) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill extends the ability to obtain private binding rulings to a wider range of taxpayers by simplifying the requirements for applying for a binding ruling and by allowing Inland Revenue to reduce the fees for smaller entities and/or transactions. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The key features of the proposals are: • a person with annual gross income below a prescribed level ($5,000,000) and a tax question involving tax below a prescribed level ($1,000,000) can apply for an abbreviated ruling; • removal of the requirements in applying for a binding ruling to state the taxation laws and the propositions of law for which the ruling is sought; and • the application and hourly rate fees for private binding rulings will be lower for short process rulings at rates determined and published by the Commissioner. Background The binding rulings system is a fee-based service provided by Inland Revenue and governed by Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. There are a number of different types of binding ruling, most commonly private and public rulings and, once issued, the Commissioner (but not the taxpayer) is bound by their outcome. The Bill’s proposals concern private binding rulings. The binding rulings system is intended to provide certainty to taxpayers usually on commercial arrangements they have either entered into or are contemplating. The main problem that the Bill seeks to address is that, in practice, rulings are generally only available to large taxpayers as SME taxpayers are priced-out because of the advisor costs and the fees involved. The fees charged for rulings are determined on a cost-recovery basis but the overall cost can be reduced at Inland Revenue’s discretion. Since the introduction of the regime in the mid-1990s these have involved an application fee of $280 (plus GST if any) for the costs of receiving and reviewing the ruling application and a fee of $140 (plus GST if any) per hour spent by Inland Revenue in research and analysis. In the year ended 56 30 June 2017, the average fee charged was $11,200 which reflects that most of the rulings issued are for large taxpayers involved in large, complex transactions. The Government discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act contained proposals to make binding rulings easier to obtain, especially for SMEs, by simplifying the process for applying for a ruling and reducing the fees. Submissions on the discussion document welcomed these changes although views differed about how much the simpler rulings regime would be used and it is therefore difficult to estimate the likely level of use in advance. Detailed analysis It is proposed in the Bill (clause 61), proposed sections 91EK–91ET, that the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to allow a person to apply for a short process ruling if: • their annual gross income for the tax year before that in which the application is made is $5,000,000 or less; and • the person is seeking the ruling on a matter concerning a tax (other than provisional tax), duty, or levy that is expected to amount to less than $1,000,000. Application for and issue of short process ruling The application must be in a form prescribed by the Commissioner and must: • identify the person applying for the ruling; • describe the circumstances on which the ruling is sought; • disclose all relevant facts and documents; and • state the general tax outcome in relation to which the ruling is sought. These requirements are much simpler than those currently required in ruling applications as they do not, for example, require the applicant to set out the taxation laws and the propositions of law for which the ruling is sought. Other requirements for obtaining a binding ruling or obligations on Inland Revenue when considering or issuing a short process ruling largely mirror the current rules for private rulings. These include: • an exclusion from ruling on an issue that is the subject of a dispute under the tax disputes process; • the ability for Inland Revenue to provide conditions on which the ruling is based; • the content that the ruling must include and the period or tax year for which the ruling applies; 57 • a requirement that Inland Revenue provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity to be consulted if the content of the proposed ruling differs from that for which the application is made; and • the ability for Inland Revenue not to apply a ruling if there has been a material omission or misrepresentation in the application. Fee reduction Clauses 272–276 amend the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 by providing that, for a short process ruling, an application fee and further fees are payable at rates that are lower than the current rates – $280 and $140 per hour, plus GST if any, – as determined and published by the Commissioner. As it is difficult to accurately estimate the level of demand for short process rulings it is preferable to allow the Commissioner to set the lower rates than to prescribe them in the regulat ions. In this way, the lower rates can be set and adjusted once the levels of demand for short process rulings, and the time taken by Inland Revenue to prepare the rulings, are more established. Currently Inland Revenue will provide an applicant with an estimate of the cost of a ruling and this is expected to continue if required for short process rulings. 58 EXTENDING THE SCOPE OF BINDING RULINGS (Clauses 54–60 and 64–67) Summary of proposed amendment Consistent with the “right-from-the-start” framework, greater up-front certainty will also be available for taxpayers through proposals in the Bill to extend the scope of matters that can be ruled on – both under the current binding rulings processes and for short form rulings. These extensions include: • removing the prohibition on ruling on a taxpayer’s purpose under certain provisio ns; • allowing more factual questions, such as a person’s residence status, to also be able to be ruled on; and • expanding the ability to rule on financial arrangements. Aligned to these expansions will be clarifications on the role of conditions and assumptions in the rulings processes. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The key features of the proposals are: • allowing rulings to be made on a taxpayer’s purpose in certain circumstances, such as whether the taxpayer has the purpose of selling a property when they acquire it; • allowing more factual questions not involving “arrangements”, such as whether a person is a New Zealand resident, to be ruled on; • allowing the Commissioner to rule on a financial arrangement question for which she can currently only issue a determination; and • clarifying the difference between an assumption and a condition and when a ruling ceases to apply because a condition or assumption is breached. Background As noted earlier, the binding rulings system is currently more accessible to larger or more sophisticated taxpayers with more complex transactions. This can be attributed to the costs of the system, including both the complexity of the application process and the fees involved. However, the system was also to some extent designed with co mplex 59 transactions in mind which is why it is restricted to “arrangements” and largely legal rather than more fact-based questions. Under the “right-from-the-start” framework it is appropriate that a wider range of matters should be able to be ruled on, in order to provide more up-front certainty for taxpayers. Detailed analysis Section 91C sets out a broad range of matters on which the Commissioner may issue any form of binding ruling (public, product or private). Section 91C also contains a limited number of exclusions. A private ruling can only be made, however, for a taxpayer and an “arrangement” which precludes applications for rulings on matters that are about the taxpayer’s status such as their residence status or the taxpayer’s purpose such as their intent when land is disposed of. Clause 55, proposed section 91CB, will allow these sorts of rulings – whether regular or short process – to be made. Proposed section 91CB(1) contains a comprehensive list of matters on which a private ruling and a short process ruling can be made, including whether a person is: • resident in New Zealand or has a permanent establishment in New Zealand; • an income-earning trustee or society or institution for charitable purposes; • a look-through company; • a portfolio investment company; • a public authority; or • an associated person. In the same way as proposed section 91CB(1) but for things rather than persons, proposed section 91CB(2) allows the Commissioner to rule on whether an item of property is trading stock or revenue account property. Proposed section 91CB(3) allows the Commissioner to rule on a person’s intention with regards to disposing of personal property or land or with regards to making taxable supplies under certain GST provisions. Proposed section 91CB(4) reiterates that an “arrangement” is not required for a ruling to be made under any of these new provisions. Proposed section 91CC allows the Commissioner to make binding rulings on these matters relating to financial arrangements: • whether an amount is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement; • the use of certain spreading methods; and • the value of certain property or services. 60 Clauses 54, 56–60 and 62–67 contain some further clarifications to the binding rulings legislation including: • that the date a private ruling ceases to apply is the date the event (misrepresentation, material omission or incorrectness) that causes cessation occurs unless the ruling expressly provides otherwise; and • the term “assumption” is in most places replaced with the term “condition” as this is more reflective of practice. 61 AMENDING ASSESSMENTS (Clause 73) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed to replace the current criteria that determine whether an error can be included in a later tax return with a combination of a monetary threshold and a materialit y thresho ld. Taxpayers would have the option of including an error in a subsequent return if the amount of the error is equal to or less than both $10,000 and two percent of the taxpayer’s taxable income or GST output tax liability. The current $1,000 threshold would be retained but apply without qualification as to the type of error involved. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The Bill repeals and replaces section 113A relating to the correction of minor errors in subsequent returns so that: • taxpayers can include an error in a subsequent return if the total amount of errors for the relevant return are equal to or less than $10,000 and two percent of the taxpayer’s taxable income or GST output tax liability; and • taxpayers can automatically include an error in a subsequent return if the total errors for the return (including a fringe benefit tax as well as an income tax or GST error) are equal to or less than the current threshold of $1,000. Background There are several key reasons why the tax system requires taxpayers to make adjustments to the original assessment or return in which the error arose: • The tax collected by the government includes the time value of money as well as core tax payments which is why use-of-money interest usually applies to underpayments of tax. • It is fairer to taxpayers who get their assessments/returns right from the start. • It is more transparent for Inland Revenue allowing for valuable information about the types of errors being made by taxpayers to be obtained. 62 However, the reasons for requiring amendments to be made to the original assessment are not so relevant when the error is minor. In those cases, the compliance costs can outweigh the benefits of requiring taxpayers to amend the original assessment. The proposal to extend and simplify the process for minor errors will provide better alignment with taxpayers’ accounting processes and will also complement the simplified process under Inland Revenue’s new computer system (START). Detailed analysis Clause 73 repeals and replaces section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Currently, if a person has made one or more errors in an assessment for an income tax, FBT or GST return and: • the error was caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight or mistaken understanding; and • for a single return the resultant total discrepancy in the assessment is $1,000 or less; • the error can be corrected in the next return following discovery of the error. Proposed new section 113A allows taxpayers to make an adjustment in a later return to an income tax or GST return if the total errors in the original return are equal to or less than $10,000 and two percent of the taxpayer’s taxable income or output tax liability. It retains the current $1,000 total discrepancy amount, but now makes this automatically available – as the requirement that the error be caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight or mistaken understanding is removed. 63 THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS AND INTERMEDIARIES (Clauses 5(36), 5(59), 14, 36, 79 and 213(27)) Summary of proposed amendment The amendments clarify the types of third party service providers (in addition to tax agents) that Inland Revenue may offer “special” or extended service offerings to in order to assist with their clients’ tax and social policy obligations, or with claiming entitlements to social policy assistance administered by Inland Revenue. The Bill does this by setting out the eligibility requirements that a person must satisfy in order to be approved by Inland Revenue as a “representative”. The amendments would also allow Inland Revenue to withhold approval or disallow a person as a representative or nominated person when this action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Proposed new section 124D sets out that a person is eligible to be a representative if they: • have signed authorities to act for 10 or more other persons in relation to their tax affairs, or in relation to their entitlements and obligations arising under social policy that is administered by Inland Revenue; and • are in a business, occupation or employment in which they act on behalf of others in relation to their tax affairs or social policy entitlements and obligations; or • are carrying on a professional public practice dealing in matters relating to tax and social policy assistance; or • are in a business, occupation or employment in which they provide budget advisory services to other persons or claim entitlements to social policy assistance on behalf of other persons. Inland Revenue must approve the person as a representative if it considers that the person meets the above requirements and that approving the person as a representative would not adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Proposed section 124G provides Inland Revenue with the ability to revoke approval if it considers that the person does not meet the relevant eligibility requirements, or that continuing to allow the person to act as a representative for others would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Similarly, Inland Revenue may disallow a person’s 64 status as another’s nominated person where continuing to allow the person to be a nominated person would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Background As part of Inland Revenue’s modernisation programme, Inland Revenue intends to offer more online services to tax agents as well as to other third party providers of tax services. A concern is protecting the revenue base and the integrity of the tax system against any potential risks arising from providers’ use of these services. Inland Revenue currently provides a range of services specifically for tax agents, including a dedicated phone service and the E-File software package which allows tax agents to file their clients’ tax returns electronically. The statutory definition of a “tax agent” is used to determine who can access these services. This means that other tax service providers (such as those who only file GST returns and employer monthly schedules for their clients, or who provide budget advice and assist with tax return preparation and claiming social policy entitlements) are not at present given access these services, even though it would be desirable in many cases to do so. These providers can still look after their clients’ tax and social policy affairs as “nominated persons” (with similar access to the client through Inland Revenue’s online services, including return filing), but without the services specifically for tax agents. Restricting additional services to persons who are listed as tax agents is not required by law, but is an administrative decision that has been made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner can offer these services as widely or narrowly as she considers appropriate. However, it is not clear that Inland Revenue can revoke a nominated person’s access to these services after such access has been granted, even if the nominated person had previously been removed from the list of tax agents or had criminal convictions for fraud. This is because a person who is nominated by a taxpayer to act on their behalf is the agent of the taxpayer under common law. Therefore, even if Inland Revenue has reasonable tax integrity concerns about allowing a person to act for other taxpayers, Inland Revenue can neither refuse to deal with that person nor disallow their access as a taxpayer’s nominated person because it is up to the taxpayer whether the nominated person should act (or continue to act) on their behalf. The amendments would allow Inland Revenue to withhold approval, or disallow a person as a representative or nominated person when the action is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. Detailed analysis Clause 79 of the Bill inserts new Part 7B into the Tax Administration Act 1994. Proposed Part 7B sets out the classes of persons who may: 65 • apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to be listed or approved as a provider of services to other persons in relation to their tax affairs or their entitlements and obligations arising under social policy administered by Inland Revenue (tax agents, representatives, PAYE intermediaries, tax pooling intermediaries and approved AIM providers); • be nominated by a person to act on their behalf in relation to their tax affairs or social policy entitlements and obligations (nominated persons); or • notify the Commissioner of their intermediary status in relation to certain tax types (RWT proxies). These classes do not exhaustively cover the types of persons who may provide tax advice or other tax compliance services. These classes instead focus on the categories of providers that: • prepare and file tax returns on behalf of other persons; • manage tax payments for other persons, such as tax pooling and PAYE intermediaries; • are the approved providers of a particular tax compliance service which requires them to hold or have access to the information of taxpayers using their service; • manage a person’s correspondence with Inland Revenue in relation to their tax obligations, or their entitlements and obligations arising under social policy administered by Inland Revenue, such as Student Loans; and/or • otherwise have access to Inland Revenue’s online services on behalf of other persons. The amendments are not intended to restrict a person’s ability to appoint an agent to only the classes listed in proposed section 124B. For example, a tax advisor (who is not the tax agent, representative or nominated person of the applicant) may prepare and submit a binding ruling application for a taxpayer. The tax advisor would not be required to become a tax agent, representative or nominated person in order to be able to discuss the details of the arrangement covered by the ruling or other relevant matters with Inland Revenue on behalf of the applicant. Existing provisions for various third party providers In addition to the proposed new sections for representatives and nominated persons (sections 124D and 124F), the Bill re-numbers or re-drafts a number of existing sections in the Tax Administration Act 1994 so that these provisions come within new Part 7B: • Sections 15C to 15M, dealing with PAYE intermediaries and listed PAYE intermediaries, are re-numbered as sections 124H to 124R. • Section 15N, dealing with RWT proxies, is re-numbered as section 124ZF. • Sections 15O to 15T, dealing with tax pooling intermediaries, are re-numbered as sections 124S to 124X. 66 • Sections 15U to 15Z, dealing with approved AIM providers, are re-numbered as sections 124Y to 124ZE. • Section 34B, dealing with tax agents, is re-drafted as proposed sections 124C, 124E and 124G, where section 124E also deals with representatives and section 124G deals with the Commissioner’s ability to remove a person’s status, or to refuse to approve or allow a person as a tax agent, representative or nominated person. Information requirements for tax agents and representatives if non-natural persons Proposed section 124E sets out that if a person who is applying to be a representative or tax agent is not a natural person, they must provide Inland Revenue with the names of the following: • for an entity that is a body corporate other than a closely-held company, each person who has the duties of tax manager, chief financial officer, chief executive officer, or director; • for a closely-held company, each shareholder; • for a partnership, each partner; or • for an unincorporated body, each member. This information is also required if it has not previously been provided to Inland Revenue at the time of making the application, or, where the information was previously provided, is no longer accurate. This extends the existing information requirements for tax agents who are non-natural persons to representatives that are not natural persons. Nominated persons Proposed section 124F sets out that a person may nominate another person to act for them in relation to their tax affairs or social policy entitlements by informing Inland Revenue of the nomination and providing the following information (requested by the IR597 form Elect someone to act on your behalf): • the name of the person making the nomination, along with their contact address and IRD number; • the name, contact address, IRD number, and date of birth of the nominated person; • the relevant tax types or social policy entitlements and obligations in relation to which the nominated person will act on behalf of the person making the nomination; and • the relevant start and end dates, as applicable, between which the nominated person will act in relation to the named tax types and social policy entitlements and obligations. Where the person making the nomination is not a natural person, there is an additional information requirement for the name and position of a natural person who is associated with or related to the entity, such as an employee. 67 Commissioner’s ability to refuse or remove tax agents, representatives and nominated persons Consistent with existing section 34B(7), proposed section 124G(1) requires the Commissioner to refuse to list a person as a tax agent if the Commissioner is satisfied that: • the person does not meet the requirements to be a tax agent (listed in proposed section 124C(3); and/or • listing the person as a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Proposed subsection (2) sets out the Commissioner’s discretion to remove a person from the list of tax agents or to disallow a person’s approval as a representative if she considers that the person does not meet the relevant eligibility requirements, or if continuing to allow the person to act on behalf of another person in relation to their tax or social policy affairs would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Similarly, proposed subsection (3) states that the Commissioner may disallow a person’s status as a nominated person if she considers that: • the person is acting in a fee-earning or other professional capacity, or if the person is acting for multiple persons whether in a fee-earning or other capacity; and • continuing to allow the person to act on behalf of another person in relation to their tax or social policy affairs would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. However, the proposed discretion to disallow a person’s status as a nominated person is more limited than the Commissioner’s existing discretion to remove a person from the list of tax agents, as well as her proposed discretion to disallow a representative for adversely affecting the integrity of the tax system. The discretion to disallow a person’s status as a nominated person would not apply when the person they are acting for is their spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, or a person connected to them within two degrees by either blood relationship or adoption. Notification of refusal, disallowance or removal from list Proposed sub-sections 124G(5) and (6) require the Commissioner to notify a person of her refusal to list them as a tax agent, or of the reasons for an exercise of her discretion to disallow the person as a representative or nominated person or to remove them from the list of tax agents. The Commissioner is required to consider any arguments against her refusal (or against the exercise of her discretion) that are provided within 30 days of the notice. However, the Commissioner may extend the stipulated 30-day period to a later date set by her if this is appropriate in the circumstances. Proposed subsection (7) states that the requirement to notify the person of the reasons for their removal from the tax agent list, or for disallowing their status as a representative or nominated person may be disregarded if the Commissioner considers it necessary in the circumstances to protect the integrity of the tax system. 68 COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE’S CARE AND MANAGEMENT ROLE (Clause 9) Summary of proposed amendments The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is responsible under the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the care and management of the Inland Revenue Acts. The Commissioner’s care and management responsibility has been interpreted as limited to providing her with administrative flexibility regarding allocating her resources to fulfil her statutory duties. It does not provide her with administrative flexibility when there is a legislative anomaly that does not reflect the clear policy intent of the legislation. At times, however, both Inland Revenue and taxpayers have a clear understanding of the policy intent of a provision and have applied that intent in practice. If a legal interpretation determines that the legislation does not in fact reflect this outcome because there is an anomaly or gap in the relevant provision, significant compliance and administrative costs can be involved before the situation is rectified. Consistent with the aim of Inland Revenue’s business transformation of reducing compliance costs through a faster, more efficient tax administration, the Bill proposes some new processes that can be adopted to address these situations where no other option is available. Among other safeguards for taxpayers, the outcomes of these processes are limited to a three year application period and cannot be unfavourable to taxpayers. The Bill proposes to extend the Commissioner’s care and management role by providing more tools for addressing gaps or inconsistencies in the legislation that do not reflect the clear policy intent of a provisio n. These are: • an Order in Council process; • a Commissioner determination-making process; or • a Commissioner administrative action process. The aim of these tools is to allow for such anomalies to be addressed more quickly and thus provide earlier certainty to taxpayers until legislative amendments can be made. Taxpayers will not be disadvantaged by the proposal as it will include a number of safeguards including limiting the application period of the regulation, determination or administrative action to three years and providing the option for the taxpayer to apply or not apply the measure. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. 69 Key features The key features of the amendments are: • they apply to a “legislative anomaly” as defined; • they allow a modification to be made to address the legislative anomaly in the form o f eit her an order-in-council, a Commissioner’s binding determination or a Commissioner’s administrative act ion; • the Commissioner must be satisfied about the necessity for the modification including its impact on tax integrity and the compliance cost burden on the affected class of taxpayers of not taking the action; • the modification is limited to a three year application period during which Inland Revenue must consider if legislative change is required; and • the taxpayer may choose whether or not to apply the modification. Background A key aspect of care and management of the tax system is applying and explaining the law to taxpayers. Generally, tax law can be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the policy intent – the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act noted that usually adopting a purposive approach to interpreting the relevant provisio n(s) will result in an interpretation consistent with the policy intent. However, it also noted that there will be occasional cases when this is not possible. The consultation on this and a second discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, have led to a recommended extension to the care and management provision to deal with these occasional situations by allowing for an Order in Council process or Commissioner determination-making or administrative action process all of which would be based on specific criteria and guidelines. Examples of when the discretion could be used include when a drafting error means that the provision is inconsistent with the intended policy and when a gap in the legislation is discovered that creates uncertainty about whether the legislation is consistent with the policy intent. In these situations the amendments would provide a temporary bridge to allow taxpayers to adopt an approach that is consistent with the intended policy. This would avoid the Commissioner and taxpayers having to commit resources to the unintended outcomes until a law change can be progressed to address the anomaly. The Commissioner’s discretion would not be able to be used to modify the application of a tax law for a particular taxpayer, but rather limited to groups or classes of taxpayers. This will ensure that the discretion is used to remedy objectively determined legislative ano malies and will prevent it fro m being used in an arbitrary or inconsistent way. 70 Detailed analysis Proposed section 6C(4) defines a legislative anomaly as an unintended outcome caused by a gap or inconsistency in the legislation that arises in relation to either the purpose or the object of a specific provision/s or by a gap or inconsistency between the legislation and Inland Revenue practice which produces the result that the wording does not sufficiently reflect the purpose of the legislation; and does not materially affect the intended scope or the operation of the legislation. Proposed section 6C(5) provides that in determining the intended purpose of the legislation regard may be had to extrinsic material that is not part of the legislation itself and primacy is not required to be given to the text of the legislation. The proposed processes for an interim response to a legislative anomaly (called modifications in the legislation) are set out in proposed section 6C(1). These are: • an Order in Council as recommended by the Minister of Revenue; • a binding determination by the Commissioner of the treatment to be applied; and • an administrative action by the Commissioner either notifying a class of persons of a proposed treatment, an exemption for a class of persons to remove a compliance burden or a declaration of the validity of an established administrative practice. Before seeking to apply one of these processes, the Commissioner must be satisfied about a range of matters including that the action does not cause any detriment to the tax system, the impact of the action on the public and the relevant class of taxpayer, the cost of complying with the unmodified legislation and whether the issue can be addressed in any other way. Once the modification is made, proposed section 6F provides that the document relating to the modification must: • include a statement explaining the reason for the modification; • be expressed to apply for a period of not more than three years; • be reviewed by the Commissioner during the three year period to determine if it should be proposed as a legislative amendment; and • be tabled in Inland Revenue’s annual report to Parliament. Proposed section 6H states that a modification must conform to any relevant determination of a hearing authority and that a person can choose whether to apply a modification. 71 72 Modernising tax administration – Other items 73 74 OVERPAID PAYE INCOME NOT REPAID (Clauses 119, 194–198, 213(24) and 213(33)) Summary of proposed amendments This amendment provides that an overpayment of emplo yment income subject to PAYE which is not repaid remains taxable as PAYE income. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 1 April 2019. Key features Proposed amendments include overpayments of employment income subject to PAYE that are not repaid in the scope of sections CE 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (amounts derived in connection with employment) and RD 3 (PAYE income payments). An “unrepaid PAYE income overpayment” is defined in proposed new section RD 8B. A further amendment is proposed to section CE 1 to make it explicit that where a PAYE-related overpayment is repaid it is not income of the person. Background Employers prioritise paying staff on time over complete accuracy. Overpayments can occur for a number of reasons, including the late receipt of information and anticipated leave where the employee resigns before the leave is due. In most situations the overpayment is repaid by the employee and the employer notifies Inland Revenue of an adjustment to the previously filed information. Notification results in a refund or credit of the PAYE and other deductions to the employer and a reduction in the employee’s record of income and associated tax credits. In some circumstances, the overpayment is not repaid. The proposed amendment deems that where a PAYE-related emplo yment overpayment is not repaid the amount is income subject to PAYE. While the current legal position is that overpayments not repaid are not amounts derived in connection with employment and should be treated as a tax free windfall many overpayments arise from anticipated leave which may be a condition of employment. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify the taxable status of all employment overpayments in a way which minimises employer compliance costs and accords with the common-sense view that overpaid salary or wages, extra pays or schedular payments, were paid in connection with employment. This is understood to be how some employers already treat overpayments which are not repaid. As a consequence of the proposed changes, the employer would be unable to recover PAYE on overpayments 75 not repaid and the unrepaid amounts will remain on the employee’s record of income for social policy purposes. Detailed analysis All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated otherwise. Under current law, an overpayment of emplo yment inco me subject to PAYE is not considered to be an amount derived in connection with employment. It is therefore neither employment income under section CE 1 employment income under section RD 3. An amendment is proposed to the scope of section CE (1)1 so that an unrepaid emplo yment inco me overpayment is income of the person. The proposed amendment also states that a repaid overpayment is not income of the person. A proposed amendment to section RD 3 includes an “unrepaid PAYE inco me overpayment” as a PAYE income payment, to which the PAYE rules apply. Amendments are proposed to each of sections RD 5 (Salary or wages); RD 7 (Extra pay) and RD 8 (schedular payments) to include in the scope of the provision an unrepaid PAYE income overpayment that was originally treated as a payment in the relevant category. A PAYE-related overpayment is defined in proposed new section RD 8B as an amount paid in error to which the employee is not entitled or, an advance payment to which the employee does not subsequently become entitled (such as can happen with anticipated leave if the employee leaves before being entitled to the leave). The definit io n also requires that the amount was originally paid as salary or wages, an extra pay or a schedular payment. An unrepaid employment income overpayment is defined in proposed section RD 8B(3) as a PAYE-related overpayment that has not been repaid to the employer. Emplo yer’s superannuation contributions, other than those the employee has chosen to have treated as salary or wages, are excluded from this definition as are amounts that are income of the person under section CB 32 (property obtained by theft). 76 OVERPAYMENTS AND EMPLOYMENT RELATED LOANS (Clause 126) All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated otherwise. Summary of proposed amendments The Bill proposes to amend section CX 10 so that an overpayment of employment income subject to PAYE does not amount to an employment-related loan on which a fringe benefit arises. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 1 April 2019. Background Frequently, when an overpayment is made the employer and employee will agree that it will be repaid over time. Technically an overpayment could be regarded as a loan to the employee until it is repaid. The amendment clarifies that the scope of employment related loans which give rise to a fringe benefit excludes a PAYE-related overpayment. Key features An amendment is proposed to add new section CX 10(2)(bb). The amendment would exclude a PAYE-related overpayment from the scope of “employment-related loans” in section CX 10(1). Under the proposed amendment no liability for fringe benefit tax would arise because of the overpayment, even if the employer allowed an interest free period for it to be repaid. 77 MID YEAR ENTRY TO THE ACCOUNTING INCOME METHOD (Clauses 190–192) Summary of proposed amendment Currently taxpayers who are otherwise eligible to pay provisional tax under the accounting income method (AIM) can only elect to use AIM prior to their first payment date under AIM. Once the income year has commenced this is likely to mean they will have to wait until the next income year to use AIM. This amendment allows those taxpayers who currently use another provisional tax method (other than the estimation method) to switch to AIM at any time during an income year prior to the final payment due under AIM for that person. Application date The proposed amendment will apply fro m the start of the 2019–20 income year. Key features The proposed amendment allows a taxpayer, who otherwise meets the criteria to use AIM to switch to that method from either the standard or GST ratio method at any time during the income year prior to the final due date for AIM for that taxpayer as long as they have made the required payments under that prior method. Background The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 inserted a new provisional tax method into the Income Tax Act 2007. The accounting income method (AIM) allows taxpayers who meet the requirements within section RC 5(5B) to calculate their provisional tax payments on a pay-as-you-go basis. Where a taxpayer who meets the criteria of section RC 5(5B) elects to use AIM they must make that choice “on or before the first instalment date for them under the AIM method”. This allows new businesses to commence using AIM during an income year (as long as they choose to do this prior to their first AIM payment due for that year). Existing businesses must wait until the following income year to choose to use the AIM method. In order to make the transition to AIM more attractive to taxpayers, it is proposed to allow those, who otherwise meet the criteria to use AIM, to switch to AIM during the income year rather than having to wait until the following income year. 78 Detailed analysis Taxpayers who otherwise meet the criteria in section RC 5(5B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be permitted to switch to the AIM method at any time prior to the final AIM payment where: • they use another concessionary provisional tax method (that is, either the standard or the GST ratio method); and • they have made all payments due under those methods prior to the date of switching to the AIM method. Example 6 McGarrett Enterprises Limited (McGarrett) is the maker of flower leis for tourist operators. McGarrett has historically made their provisional tax payments under the standard method. After talking with a number of other small business owners Steve, McGarrett’s owner, decides that because of the seasonality of the lei business it would be better using the AIM method. McGarrett is part way through its 2020–21 income year. It has a March year end and has made its first two provisional tax payments totalling $5,000 on the 7 th of August and 15 th of January in full and on time. McGarrett has already been using an AIM capable software product but has not turned the AIM function on. He does that at the end of January. This will mean his first AIM payment is due on the 28 th of February. McGarrett switches on the AIM calculation part of his accounting software and it calculates that at the end of January McGarrett owes $6,200 in provisional tax. McGarrett makes an AIM payment of $1,200. Because McGarrett is switching from the standard method to AIM and has made all its payments due under the prior method, it can then make the switch to the AIM method during the year. McGarrett meets all the other requirements to use the AIM method. Example 7 Dr Max’s Malasadas Limited (DMM) is the manufacturer of specialty Hawaiian donuts. It has a turnover of $3.5m and uses accounting software to maintain its business records. That software is AIM capable and because of the volatility of DMM’s sales, Dr Max, the owner, decides that it would be better to use the AIM method for provisional tax rather than the current standard method. DMM is part way through their 2021–22 income year and is just completing the September month end. It has a March balance date and DMM’s first instalment of provisional tax was due on 7 th of August. Unfortunately because of some cashflow issues DMM did not make that payment. DMM decides to switch to the AIM method and turns on the AIM capability in the software. However, as DMM has not made the payments required under the standard method it will be prohibited from switching to AIM during the year and will need to wait until the following income year to make the switch. Taxpayers who pay, or fund their provisional tax through a tax pooling intermediary will need to transfer any funds from the pooling entity to Inland Revenue prior to the switch fro m the previous method to the AIM method. 79 Example 8 Kono Kameras Limited (Kono) sells travel cameras which take photos that make the subjects always look like they are on Waikiki beach. This is a limited market but can be volatile as people see photos taken by a Kono Kamera on the internet and then want a Kamera rather than actually travelling to Waikiki. Because of cashflow difficulties Kono uses a tax pooling intermediary to finance its provisional tax payments. During the 2020–21 income year Kono decides that using the AIM method would better suit its cashflow situation and decides to make the switch. Kono already uses accounting software to keep its accounts in order and that software is AIM capable. Kono has financed its first instalment of provisional tax which was due on the 7 th of August 2020, those funds have not yet been credited to Kono’s account at Inland Revenue. Prior to making the switch to AIM, Kono will need to transfer those funds to Inland Revenue as otherwise it will appear that Kono has not made the payments required under the prior method and it will not be permitted to switch. 80 AMENDING THE PAYMENT ALLOCATION RULES (Clause 75) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment alters the current payment allocation rules to allow Inland Revenue to continue to apply payments towards use-of-money interest (UOMI) first but to the oldest debt within a period first. This method will result in a larger proportion of payments being allocated to core tax liabilities which will reduce any overall UOMI cost to taxpayers. It is required to facilitate a change to the way in which Inland Revenue’s computer system allocates billing items wit hin a period. In no case will the new method of allocation result in a greater charge for UOMI than under the current allocation rule. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 17 April 2018, the date when the second tranche of Inland Revenue’s processes transit ion to its new technology platform. Key features This proposed amendment requires the Commissioner to allocate payments in a specific order first towards UOMI and then core tax but clearing the oldest UOMI and debt first within a tax period. The amendment allocates a larger proportion of payments to core tax liabilities than UOMI when compared to the current rule. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains a payment allocation rule in section 120F which deals with how a taxpayer’s payment is allocated to amounts payable within a period. This rule requires that where the taxpayer has unpaid tax and they are liable to pay UOMI on that unpaid tax then payments are allocated to interest liabilities first and then core tax and penalties. This is primarily driven by the fact that UOMI is charged on a “simple” basis in that interest is not compounding (that is, interest does not accrue on interest). If there were a balance of UOMI outstanding on a taxpayer’s account, there is little incentive to pay that amount as it is “interest free” debt. This payment allocation rule works well when you consider tax liabilities within a period balance in that there is one liability within a period. Where there are multiple liabilities within a period this allocation rule can be problematic. 81 Inland Revenue’s current technology platform uses a reverse and replace model for reassessments. When a taxpayers’ assessment of tax is amended, the current system reverses the old assessment and replaces that with the new assessment. This means there is only one liability within a period for a taxpayer. A decision has been made to move away from this reverse and replace model to a new method termed a “delta” model. Instead of replacing the original assessment it adds the difference, or delta, as an additional billing item within the tax period. The delta model only applies to debit (or additional) assessments. The reverse and replace method continues for credit (or reduced) assessments. For billing purposes taxpayers will not necessarily see these delta amounts as they will appear as a combined liability within a period. This change to a delta model necessitates a change in the way that payments are allocated to avoid any billing issues for taxpayers. Detailed analysis The difference between the “reverse and replace” and the “delta” models is that instead of the initial assessment being “reversed and replaced” with the new assessment amount under the delta model, the original assessment is left in the period and the addit ional amount, or delta, is added to the period. This amount may have the same or a different due date than the original assessment. 82 Example 9 A taxpayer files their return for the March 2018 goods and services tax period which has a tax payable amount of $100. In April the Commissioner amends that return and increases the tax payable amount to $136. Under a reverse and replace model the following occurs. Amended assessment $1 00 $1 36 Original assessment March 2018 The original assessment in blue is replaced with the new assessment in red within the March 2018 period. Under a delta model the following occurs: Original assessment D elt a $36 $1 00 March 2018 The original assessment remains with the additional assessment (in red) added. This additional amount may, or may not, have a different due date but is treated as a separate billing item within the system. In either scenario the taxpayer will see an assessment amount for $136 (although that amount may have sub-amounts due at different dates which will be stated). Under the reverse and replace method there is only one billing item per tax period and the current payment allocation rules work well to ensure there is no leftover UOMI. Also the billing to taxpayers is simple to understand as it displays one amount payable. The delta model can have presentational and billing issues where payments received are not allocated to the oldest billing item within a period balance first. The result can be multiple statements issued for separate billing items with small balances within a period which can cause confusion for the taxpayer. It can also result in amounts changing because of payment reallocations to reflect the “interest first” rule. 83 This could, in certain circumstances, result in an increased amount of interest being charged to taxpayers over the current position. An amendment is required to the payment allocation rule that continues with the concept of interest first but within billing items rather than the period balance. This essentially means a first-in-first-out system whereby the oldest billing item is settled first. This model will simplify the system design and also the impact on the taxpayer as the recalculation of interest, where there are multiple adjustments, will be eliminated. The payment allocation will continue to ensure there is no balance of “interest only” within a tax period as the payment will still apply to interest first within a billing item rather than the period. Example 10 Dannos Drivers Limited (Danno) is a New Zealand ride sharing company. Danno has been in business for a few years and files its July 2018 GST return to Inland Revenue. During a routine review of Danno’s tax return, Inland Revenue finds than Danno has under declared the GST owing for the period. Inland Revenue issues Danno with a reassessment for that amount. Danno has already paid the amount of the original assessment a few days late and pays the remaining GST and resulting UOMI by the due date required by Inland Revenue. Under the delta model the reassessment delta is illustrated as follows: Ju ly 2018 U OM I 1 D elt a U OM I 2 Original assessment Under the proposed payment allocation model the payment order would be: UOMI 1 Original assessment UOMI 2 Delta The current rule would require the following payment allocation: UOMI 1 and UOMI 2 Original assessment and Delta 84 Clause 75 replaces existing section 120F(1) which provides for a rule as to how payments are allocated. The current section provides for payments to be allocated to UOMI first and then core tax debt. With the change to a delta model the current payment allocation rule can create some difficulties with billing which could be confusing to taxpayers. The new section 120F(1) will continue with the general rule of applying payments to UOMI first but will do this to the oldest debt within a period first. For most taxpayers there will be no difference from the change in the payment allocation method but for some it will result in less UOMI being charged than currently. This is because of a larger portion of a payment being allocated to core tax rather than UOMI. The new provision also includes an example to illustrate how the new rules will work. Example 11: New section 120F(1) On 1 September 2019, an assessment of $100 tax to pay is raised for the 2018–19 tax year. This amount incurs $5 use-of-money interest. On 1 September 2020 a re-assessment of $120 tax to pay is raised for the 2018–19 tax year along with an additional amount of $3 UOMI. The taxpayer pays the balance of $128. Payments are applied against the $5 use-of-money interest (that is, interest on the earliest unpaid amount), then against the $100 tax. Next, payments are applied against the $3 use-of-money interest on $20 tax to pay, then against the $20 tax. 85 CORRECTION OF UNINTENDED CHANGE IN THE PROVISIONAL TAX AND USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST RULES (Clause 76) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment corrects an unintended change to the application of the use-of-money interest (UOMI) rules to taxpayers who are not new provisional taxpayers but who are only required to pay provisional tax in one or two instalments. This amendment restores the intended policy position to that prior to the unintended change and includes a savings provision for a very limited number of taxpayers who have requested and received cancellation of UOMI under the unintended legislation. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 October 2007 – the date the unintended change was enacted. Key features The amendment restores the correct policy position on the application of UOMI to taxpayers who are not new provisional taxpayers but pay tax in one or two instalments instead of the usual three instalments. It was always intended that UOMI would apply across the three instalments of provisional tax notwithstanding a taxpayer may only have one or two instalments. Background An unintended change to the policy intention of the rules which calculate UOMI was made when the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 was enacted that may have had the effect of changing the well-established position that UOMI was charged over an entire income year for all but new provisional taxpayers. This amendment clarifies the legislation to ensure it continues to reflect the correct policy intent. Detailed analysis The Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 included changes to align the payment dates for provisional tax and goods and services tax with effect from 1 October 2007. As part of that Bill, section 120K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was repealed and replaced with sections 120KB–KE. Section 120K(1) clearly stated a general rule for the calculation of UOMI on provisional tax which applied unless any of the subsections within it modified that position. It read: 86 “Except where this section requires otherwise, in a tax year, other than a transitional year, a provisional taxpayer’s residual income tax is due and payable in equal instalments on each of the 3 instalment dates for the year” There were a number of exceptions to this rule and in particular new provisional taxpayers, safe harbour taxpayers and those in a transitional year had their own special rules. Section 120K was essentially replaced with section 120KB(2) which reads: “A provisional taxpayer’s residual income tax is due and payable as set out in RC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007” Again this general rule does not apply to new provisional taxpayers, safe harbour taxpayers or those in a transitional year. For most taxpayers this change in wording has no impact in that most provisional taxpayers will pay their provisional tax over three instalments. However, for a small subset of taxpayers who have not yet furnished their tax return for a prior income year, because of an extension of time, and who in the year previous to that year had residual income tax of less than $2,500 (and consequently were not a provisional taxpayer in that year) may interpret the wording differently. This wording change can arguably be read as suggesting that their residual income tax should only be apportioned over the number of instalments given by section RC 13 or 14 rather than over three instalments as intended. At the time of the change there was no discussion of the change in policy for those particular taxpayers in any consultation process, nor was any change to that policy indicated in any Taxation Information Bulletin at the time. In addition, Inland Revenue systems were not altered to reflect any policy change at that time. This amendment clarifies the legislation to reflect the intended policy position of residual income tax being due and payable over three instalments where, because of those criteria, a person only has one or two instalments of provisional tax due. Fro m the 2018–19 year, when changes were made to the standard method of provisional tax, which in most cases will result in taxpayers only being subject to UOMI from their final instalment date, the scope of this issue arising has reduced but it is not eliminated. As this change in the wording of this section was untended, the amendment to clarify the wording will apply at the same date the wording was changed. However, officials are aware of a very limited number of cases where taxpayers have challenged this position and may have had UOMI cancelled to reflect this alternative interpretation. Therefore, for those taxpayers who have received a cancellation of UOMI, a savings provision will be inserted to preserve that treatment for taxpayers who have challenged that position prior to the introduction of this Bill and received a cancellation of UOMI. 87 Example 12 Kamekona Shrimp Trucks Limited (Kamekona) owns a fleet of shrimp trucks that sell world famous garlic shrimp and poke around New Zealand using a fleet of trucks. Kamekona started business in the 2010 year, and it struggled to earn substantial amounts and thus was never a provisional taxpayer in those years. In 2014 its residual income tax was $2,200 for example. In the 2015 income year, as Kamekona’s poke won the prestigious Chin Ho award for the best Hawaiian cuisine outside the Hawaiian Islands, sales from the trucks took off and the company had residual income tax of $120,000 for the 2015 year, making it a provisional taxpayer for that year. Kamekona uses a tax agent to manage its tax affairs and the company has an extension of time to file its tax return for the 2016 year. Kamekona is not a new provisional taxpayer (as they had derived income from a taxable activity in the four years prior to the 2017 year) and it has an extension of time which means it does not need to file its 2016 tax return until 31 March 2017. Section RC 9(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 states that Kamekona does not need to pay provisional tax in three instalments. Section RC 9(10) then says that Kamekona can pay provisional tax in one instalment following the rules in section RC 14. Kamekona pays $200,000 in provisional tax on 7 May 2018 (the third instalment date) for the 2017 income year. For the 2017 income year Kemekona’s residual income tax actually works out to be $300,000. This amount should be apportioned over the three provisional tax instalment dates (Period 1 to Period 3) for the 2017 year and UOMI should be charged accordingly. At Period 1 and Period 2 UOMI should be calculated on $100,000 less the amount paid of zero from the respective payment dates through to Period 3 and then on $100,000 from Period 3 being the difference between the $300,000 residual income tax and the $200,000 paid. It is arguable the current wording of the legislation would only apportion the residual income tax to Kamekona at Period 3, although this was not the policy intent as UOMI is a use of money charge and the taxpayer had the use of those funds throughout the entire yea r. The amendment clarifies the policy intent. 88 UPDATE OF OBSOLETE CROSS-REFERENCES (Clauses 207–210) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment corrects some cross-references in the Income Tax Act 2007 which refer to repealed section 120K of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amendment references those sections more generally to Part 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 October 2007 – the date section 120K was repealed. There are no adverse implications that officials can see from this application date for taxpayers. Key features The following four sections in the Income Tax Act 2007 refer to section 120K of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which has been repealed: • RM 16(3); • RM 22(5); • RM 25(3); and • RM 31(3). The amendment references these sections to Part 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 89 90 Other policy matters 91 92 ANNUAL SETTING OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2018–19 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same that applied for the 2017–18 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2018–19 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2018–19 tax year will be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 93 KIWISAVER ENHANCEMENTS (Clauses 216 and 231–237) Summary of proposed amendments A number of enhancements are proposed to KiwiSaver legislative settings, based on recommendations made in the Retirement Commissioner’s December 2016 review of retirement income policies. Application date The proposed amendments to allow over 65 year olds to opt-in to KiwiSaver and the repeal of the lock-in period apply on and from 1 July 2019. All other proposed amendments apply on and from 1 April 2019. Key features The proposed amendments give effect to the following changes to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 by: • introducing additional KiwiSaver contribution rates of 6% and 10%; • reducing the maximum contributions holiday period from five years to one year; • changing the name of the “contributions holiday” to “savings suspension”; • allowing over 65 year olds to opt-in to KiwiSaver; and • removing the lock-in period (which currently affects members who join KiwiSaver between the ages of 60 and 65). Background The Retirement Commissioner reviews retirement income policies every three years. Her most recent review, published in December 2016, included recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of KiwiSaver in helping New Zealanders save for their retirement and to make KiwiSaver accessible to more New Zealanders. The proposed amendments to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 are based on recommendations made in this review. Detailed analysis Additional 6% and 10% KiwiSaver contribution rates An employee can choose to contribute 3%, 4%, or 8% of their gross salary and wages to their KiwiSaver account. This is provided for in section 64 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 94 It is proposed this section be amended to introduce additional 6% and 10% rates that employees can choose to contribute at. The additional 6% and 10% rates are intended to give KiwiSaver members more flexibility to self-select onto a contribution rate more specifically aligned with their particular circumstances and the retirement outcomes they want to achieve. Reducing the maximum contributions holiday period and changing the name of the contributions holiday Section 104(3)(b)(i) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides the maximum contributions holiday a member can take is the shorter of the period specified in the contributions holiday application, or five years. The effect of this provision is the maximum period a member can take a contributions holiday for is five years. Taking a five year contributions holiday can have significant impact on members’ long- term savings. For many members five years is longer than necessary for their financial position to improve to a point where they could resume contributing to KiwiSaver. It is proposed that section 104(3)(b)(i) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is amended so the maximum permitted contributions holiday period is reduced from five years to one year. This would apply to all contributions holiday applications made after the change comes into effect (that is, 1 April 2019). This means that an existing contributions holiday would continue unt il it expires. It is proposed the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is amended to replace all references to “contributions holiday” with “savings suspension”. This name change more accurate describes what actually happens when a member takes a break from contributing to their KiwiSaver account. Allowing over 65 year olds to opt-in to KiwiSaver The law does not currently permit over 65 year olds to join KiwiSaver. It is proposed section 33(a) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is repealed, so that over 65 year olds would no longer be prevented from opting-in to KiwiSaver. This amendment would give over 65 years the benefit of access to KiwiSaver as a provider of low-cost managed funds. No changes would be made to the existing law relating to automatic enrolment in KiwiSaver or the upper age of eligibility for the member tax credit and compulsory employer contributions. Consequential amendments to the KiwiSaver invalid enrolment rules (in sections 59A and 59B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) will provide that an over 65 year old opting-in to KiwiSaver under section 33 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 would no longer be an invalid enrolment. A consequential amendment to schedule 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will remove the rule that complying funds are required to prevent over 65 year olds from joining. 95 Removing the lock-in period Excluding other permitted withdrawals, members are eligible to withdrawal their savings when they reach the KiwiSaver end payment date referred to in schedule 1 clause 4(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The end payment date is the later of the date the member reaches the New Zealand Superannuation qualification age (which is 65 years old) or the five year qualification date. The five year qualification date (referred to commonly as the lock-in period) only affects members who join KiwiSaver after the age of 60 (and therefore have not been a member for five years when they reach the New Zealand Superannuation qualification age). The purpose of the lock-in period was to prevent people in the 60–65 age bracket from joining KiwiSaver to receive the $1,000 kick-start payment and then withdrawing their funds soon after. As the kick-start was repealed as part of Budget 2015, the lock-in period is no longer necessary. Allowing over 65 year olds to opt-in to KiwiSaver provides a further catalyst for removing the lock-in period, as over 65 year olds joining KiwiSaver may require access to their funds within the first five years of joining (such as if they become unable to support themselves through paid employment, or to address age-related needs). It is proposed that schedule 1 clause 4 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 enables members to withdraw their funds when they reach the New Zealand Superannuation age, regardless of how long they have been a KiwiSaver member (therefore effectively repealing the lock-in period). Transit ional provisions provide that over 60 year olds who join KiwiSaver prior to the repeal of the lock-in period (that is, 1 July 2019) would remain locked-in for the duration of the five year period. As over 65 year olds remain entitled to compulsory employer contributions and the member tax credit while they are locked-in to KiwiSaver, this would ensure these members are subject to the same conditions and entitlements as they were when they joined KiwiSaver. 96 TAX STATUS OF PUBLIC PURPOSE CROWN CONTROLLED COMPANIES AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES (Clauses 33, 124, 213(26), 213(27), 222, 224 and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed to give certain Crown controlled companies listed in schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 their own income tax exemption, and a goods and services tax (GST) provision comparable to that of public authorities to help ensure that GST input credits can be claimed back. The qualifying public purpose Crown controlled companies (PPCCCs) will be listed in a new schedule to the Income Tax Act 2007, and there will be an Order in Council mechanism to facilitate amendments to this schedule. For similar reasons, it is also proposed to explicitly include a number of Crown/Parliamentary entities in the definition of “public authority” in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The purpose of these amendments is to effectively reinstate the tax outcome that the companies had before a Crown Law interpretation reduced who qualifies as a “public authority”. This reinstatement will reduce compliance costs without reducing government revenue or creating economic distortions. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. In the interim, Inland Revenue is applying its administrative discretion to treat the companies as if they were still public authorities until the legislative changes have been made. Background Based on advice from Crown Law, in 2015 Inland Revenue revised its interpretation of the definition of “public authority” for tax purposes. This resulted in fewer entities qualifying as public authorities, including most of the Crown controlled companies listed in schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989. For a company to be listed in schedule 4A, it must meet all of the following criteria: • the Crown holds more than fift y percent of the company’s issued ordinary shares; • the company’s shares are not listed on a registered market; and • the company is not a Crown entity or a State Owned Enterprise. In response to the revised interpretation, tax policy officials undertook to review whether the schedule 4A companies should be given their own income tax exemption, and a GST provision comparable to that of public authorities to help ensure that GST 97 input tax can be claimed back. This review concluded that it was appropriate to have such provisions when the companies, or their subsidiaries, also meet the following requirements: • The only other shareholders, if any, in the company are local authorities, that is, there are no private sector shareholders; and • Their primary purpose is to carry out one of the Government’s public policy objectives. This does not preclude their making a profit, but any profit has to be subsidiary to the public policy objective. This requirement distinguishes such companies fro m state-owned enterprises (SOEs), whose primary purpose is to make a profit. Eleven companies meet these criteria. In addition, a number of other entities were identified as warranting being deemed to be public authorities. Key features Public purpose Crown controlled companies amendments Proposed new section CW 38B provides a specific income tax exemption for those companies listed in the proposed new schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The schedule lists the following eleven companies that are either fully Crown owned or Crown controlled, shareholding being measured through the standard voting interest test: • Cit y Rail Link Limited; • Crown Asset Management Limited; • Crown Infrastructure Partners Limited; • Education Payro ll Limited; • Otakaro Limited; • Research & Education Advanced Network New Zealand Limited; • Southern Response Earthquake Services Limited; • Tamaki Redevelopment Company Limited; • Tamaki Regeneration Limited; • THA GP Limited; and • The Network for Learning Limited. Nine of these companies are listed on schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989, with the remaining two being subsidiaries of a section 4A company. To expedite future changes, companies will subsequently be added to or removed from the schedule by Order in Council, which is consistent with the way companies are added to and removed from schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989. Section CW 38B includes a power to make such Orders in Council. The policy criteria for an Order in 98 Council will still be that the company is listed in schedule 4A or it is a subsidiary of a schedule 4A company, has no private sector shareholders and its primary purpose is to carry out one of the Government’s public policy objectives. An amendment is also being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to extend section 6(1)(b) to include PPCCCs, so as to ensure a GST treatment comparable to that for public authorities. This will help ensure that the companies can claim back the GST paid on their purchases. Finally, a consequential amendment is proposed to section 32E(2)(k) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 so that PPCCCs will, like public authorities, be eligible for a RWT exemption certificate. Public authority amendments The definition of “public authority” in the Income Tax Act 2007 is being extended to specifically include: • The New Zealand Lottery Grants Board; • The Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives; • The Ombudsman; • The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment; and • The Parliamentary Service. For the purposes of the definition of “public authority” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, it is only necessary to amend that definition to include the Lottery Grants Board. 99 SCHEDULE 32 OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 218 and schedule 32) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that 13 charities are added to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 April 2018. Key features It is proposed that 13 charitable organisations are added to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to these charities will be eligible for tax benefits on their donations. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33 1 / 3 % of the monetary amount donated, up to the amount of their taxable inco me. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. Detailed analysis The 13 charitable organisations being added to schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: Books for Cambodia Trust Books for Cambodia Trust was established in 2007 to promote literacy and develop a culture of reading in Cambodia with a view to improving educational outcomes for children. The Trust’s activities include establishing/refurbishing libraries in schools, purchasing books to ensure libraries are adequately stocked, and provide training and support for librarians. Children of the Light Children of the Light has been active in Ghana’s eastern region since 2005, and in 2010 its New Zealand founder formalised the operation by registering a New Zealand charitable trust. The charity runs year-round educational programmes, including one-on- 100 one and small group tuition, with a strong emphasis on developing literacy and numeracy skills. The charity has, unusual for the region, an extensive library to assist developing reading skills. The charity’s activities are primarily directed at children who, because of reasons of poverty, are not achieving proficiency in reading, writing or mathematics. The Trust is registered as an international non-governmental organisation (NGO) with the Ghanaian government. Effective Altruism New Zealand Charitable Trust The Effective Altruism New Zealand Charitable Trust was established in 2015 and is based on the international effective altruism social movement. Effective altruism organisations seek to use evidence to determine the most effective way to benefit others. Acting as a conduit, the Trust is primarily focused on alleviating global poverty by identifying effective international charities and directing New Zealand donor support to them. Flame Cambodia Flame Cambodia was set up in 2016 to assist children and young persons affected by poverty and living in the slum environments in Cambodia. The charity is active in Phnom Penh, and its objective is to integrate children affected by poverty into formal school education and maintain school attendance over the longer term. The charity also supports tertiary and vocational training for school leavers. It is registered as an international NGO with the Royal Government of Cambodia. Forgotten Sherpas of Nepal The Forgotten Sherpas of Nepal (the Trust) has been operating informally since 2001 and was formally set up in 2013 with the objective of improving the health and well- being of the people living in the Nepal Himalayas. The Trust funds primary healthcare services (particularly maternal and child health), education in hygiene and sanitation, and general improvements in living conditions (for example, safe lighting, smoke-free houses, clean water and access to schools). The Trust sends volunteers to Nepal who work in close association with members of a registered local NGO formed by villagers in the area. The Trust is registered as an international NGO with Nepalese central and local governments.

The Foundation’s core values centre on activities and projects that improve healthcare and education outcomes in developing countries, including projects that have an innovation or technology component. 103 FRINGE BENEFIT TAX ON EMPLOYMENT RELATED LOANS – MARKET INTEREST RATE (Clause 201) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment would provide an alternative definition of market interest that banks and other money lenders can elect to use for valuing the fringe benefit of a loan provided to an emplo yee. The new definition of market interest for a given employee and loan type would be the lowest rate given around the same time by their employer in the ordinary course of business to a customer with a similar profile to the emplo yee. The amendment is intended to address the over-taxation of employment related loans that occurs under the status quo definition of market interest. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force for FBT payment periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019. Key features The amendment will add a second option to the current market interest definition. Banks and other employers eligible to use the market interest rate for calculating FBT on employment related loans will be able to use either the current definition or the new definition of market interest. The new definition of market interest for a given employee and loan type would be the lowest rate given around the same time by their employer in the ordinary course of business to a customer with a similar profile to the employee. Background A fringe benefit arises when an employer provides a loan to an employee. There are two ways in which the benefit of an employment-related loan can be valued. Emplo yers not in the business of lending money are required to use a prescribed interest rate provided by legislation to value the benefit of employment related loans. However, banks and other money lenders may instead elect to value the benefit of employment related loans using the market interest rate as they have the data to accurately calculate the market rate readily available. The market interest rate for a group of employees is currently defined as the rate their employer would offer to an arm’s length group of persons with a comparable credit risk to the group of employees. Different money lenders will therefore have different market rates as the market rate is based on the rates a given lender offers to its customers. 104 The market interest rate rules were based on the practices banks and other lenders were using at the time the rules were developed. Money lenders would advertise rates and, in general, customers would receive these rates if they met the necessary conditions for a loan. However, some lenders would also offer discounts to certain groups of customers. For example, a bank may have offered employees of a local respected employer a discount of 0.3 percentage points below the advertised rates. The market interest rate rules would allow either the advertised rates or the group discount rates to be offered to employees as the market interest rate without banks and other similar lenders incurring FBT. However, it is now common practice for banks and other similar lenders to individually negotiate loan rates with customers. Individually negotiated loans cannot be used for determining the market rate as the rates received by customers through this process have not been offered to a group. As such, the true market rate, being the interest rate an arm’s length customer receives, is likely lower than the market rate calculated under the current legislation. This can result in the over-taxation of employment related loans. Furthermore, because of this over-taxation many employees of banks and other money lenders may be able to receive better loan rates from lenders other than their employer. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment would give employers the choice between using the existing market interest definition or a new market interest definition. The existing definition would be contained in section RD 35(5)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the new definition would be contained in section RD 35(5)(b). As noted above, the new definition of market interest for a given employee and loan type would be the lowest rate given around the same time by their employer in the ordinary course of business to a customer with a similar profile to the employee. The various aspects of this definition are explained below. Similar profile The amendment would only allow loans made to customers with similar profiles to the given employee receiving a loan to be used for calculating market interest. An employee and a customer would have similar profiles if, on the factors considered by the money lender as relevant to the interest rates it offers to customers, they have similar characteristics. Factors a money lender may consider when offering loans include, but are not limited to, a customer’s risk profile, amount of security or loan to value ratio. Ordinary course of business The amendment would only allow loans given to customers in the ordinary course of business to be used for calculating the market rate. Whether a particular loan has been made in the ordinary course of business will always be a matter of fact and degree. However, some examples of what constitutes the ordinary course of business are detailed below. 105 Example 13: Loan made in the ordinary course of business Carlos, an employee of Third Man Bank, wants to receive a fixed rate home loan from his employer. The lowest rate Third Man Bank has offered on this type of loan to customers who meet similar lending criteria as Carlos is 4%. Only one customer has received this rate, however, a number of other customers with similar profiles have all received loans close to this rate (4.01–4.05%). The loan made at the rate of 4% will therefore be considered as having been made in the ordinary course of business. As such, the market rate for Carlos will be 4% and FBT will only be payable if Carlos receives a rate below this. Example 14: Loan not made in the ordinary course of business Fernanda, a customer of Square Leg Bank, has received a home loan rate of 2% as part of a special promotion giving one lucky customer an extraordinarily low interest rate. The rate received by Fernanda has therefore not been given in the ordinary course of business and cannot be used for determining the market interest rate. Example 15: Loan made in the ordinary course of business Caroline, a customer of Mid-Wicket Bank, has received an interest rate of 3.5%. No other customers with a similar profile to Caroline have received a rate that low or close to it. However, the loan was made using Mid-Wicket Bank’s ordinary processes and Caroline received no special treatment compared to other customers. This loan has therefore been made in the ordinary course of business. Around the same time The amendment would require employers to calculate the market rate based on loans given to customers around the same time a loan was given to an employee. In calculating the market rate for a given employee, employers would generally be required to use loans given to customers in the same quarter that a loan was given to the emplo yee. However, if the employer lacks the ability to calculate the market rate using loans given to customers in the same quarter that a loan was given to the employee, they would instead be able to calculate the market rate using loans given to customers in the quarter immediately prior to the quarter in which the loan was given to the employee. 106 SECURITISATIONS (Clauses 169–173, 213(9), 213(13) and 213(20)) Summary of proposed amendment These amendments will extend the current securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act 2007 beyond financial institutions to other corporate securitisations, with appropriate modifications, and extend the scope of the regime for financial institutions. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The amendments will extend the securitisation regime so it does not just apply to financial institutions. The aim of the amendments is to reduce compliance costs and tax disincentives to undertaking securitisations, by taxing them in accordance with their economic substance – treating qualifying securitisation special purpose vehicles (SPVs) as transparent. The key features of the amended regime are: • it will cover securitisations involving financial arrangements as well as other assets; • the consolidation requirement will be met if the securitised assets are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the either the originator or another company in the same wholly-owned group; and • the regime will be elective. Background A securitisation is a funding mechanism that involves issuing marketable securities that are backed by the expected cash flows from specific assets. Securitisations can have a number of commercial benefits compared with other funding mechanisms, such as risk management, balance sheet improvement, and lower cost of funding. New Zealand businesses with assets such as large books of trade credits or other receivables may wish to raise funding by way of securitisations. To undertake a securitisation, a company (referred to as the originator) that owns income-producing assets transfers those assets to an SPV. The SPV (typically a trust in New Zealand) is usually structured to be bankruptcy remote from the originator, so that the SPV’s assets cannot be accessed by the originator’s creditors. The SPV then borrows from third parties on the strength of the assets that have been transferred to it. An important commercial objective of a securitisation is maintaining tax neutrality while ensuring the SPV is bankruptcy remote from the originator. It is particularly important to 107 ensure that the vehicle itself is not exposed to a tax liability, as this can affect its credit rating. There is a concern that the current tax rules for trusts may not achieve tax neutrality for the vehicle, and so may discourage securitisations. The financial arrangement rules can also trigger a tax liability on any receivables transferred into the vehicle. There is also concern about the compliance costs the tax rules impose on securitisations. There is currently a securitisation regime in the Income Tax Act 2007 (sections HR 9 – HR 10) that applies for certain securitisations undertaken by financial institutions. Those rules were introduced as a result of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s response to the global financial crisis. The effect of the rules is that no tax consequences arise from the securitisation transactions between the financial institution and the vehicle used in the securitisation. The proposed amendments will extend this securitisation regime to other corporate securitisations. Detailed analysis Under the proposed rules, the securitisation SPV would simply be treated as part of the originator for tax purposes. This would mean that the transfer of assets to the SPV would be ignored, and the SPV itself would not be subject to tax (with any tax on its act ivit ies being payable by the originator instead). This would remove a disincentive to securitisations, in that transfers to an SPV that is economically within a wholly-owned group of companies would not have tax implications. Extension to assets that are not financial arrangements Given the context in which the current rules were developed, the current regime is limited to particular financial arrangements – New Zealand residential mortgages or loans secured by such mortgages. Non-financial institution securitisations may involve a broader range of assets, and indeed assets that are not financial arrangements, such as trade receivables and operating leases. The amended regime will, therefore, apply to securitisations irrespective of the assets that are securitised. Consolidation requirement The current rules for securitisations by financial institutions require that the securitised assets are treated as held by the originator (the financial institution) in its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. While this requirement is suitable for securitisations involving the financial arrangements covered by the current rules, it would be too restrictive for other securitisations. Often in corporate securitisations the securitised assets are de-recognised by the originator but are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of another group company. Therefore, under the expanded rules, the consolidation requirement will be met if the securitised assets are recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the originator or another company in the same wholly-owned group. Also, if the group 108 entity that recognises the securitised assets in its consolidated financial statements is separate from the originator, the transfer of the receivables by the originator will also be disregarded. These settings will mean the benefits of the regime can apply more broadly. Elective regime The current regime is not framed as being elective; however, there is no particular policy reason why it should not be as it removes a tax barrier. The proposed expanded regime will be elective for financial institutions and other corporates alike. 109 LAND TAINTING AND HOUSING NEW ZEALAND CORPORATION (Clauses 105–109, 120, 121, 154 and 155) Summary of proposed amendment The Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to exclude the Housing New Zealand Group (HNZ) from the land tainting rules. Application date The proposed amendments will apply from 1 July 2017. Key features Land tainting Proposed new section CB 15D of the Income Tax Act 2007 will mean Housing New Zealand Corporation and companies in the same wholly-owned group as Housing New Zealand Corporation are excluded from the land tainting rules in sections CB 9(2), CB 10(2) and CB 11(2). Wholly-owned and consolidated groups Amendments are proposed to section CV 1 and proposed new section CB 15D to ensure that income does not arise under the wholly-owned group rules for transactions that would otherwise be exempt under section CB 15D(1). A similar amendment is proposed to sections CV 2, FM 9 and proposed new section CB 15D to prevent income from arising under the consolidated group rules. Transactions between associated persons Proposed new section CB 15D excludes Housing New Zealand Corporation and companies in the same wholly-owned group as Housing New Zealand Corporation from the application of section CB 15(1). Amortising property and revenue account property An exclusion from section FM 15 is proposed for Housing New Zealand Corporation and companies in the same consolidated group as Housing New Zealand Corporation. 110 Background Land tainting The land tainting rules in sections CB 9(2), CB 10(2) and CB 11(2) provide that land owned by an associate of a person who deals in, develops, subdivides, or improves land is “tainted” if the land is acquired or improved at the time the dealer, developer, sub- divider or builder was in business. The “taint” means that this land will be taxable if disposed of within 10 years of acquisition or improvement, despite not ordinarily being taxable. The rules were introduced to prevent taxpayers from undermining the land sale rules, but are leading to an incorrect policy result for the HNZ group by imposing tax on sales that are not a policy concern. For example, a sale of a property in HNZ’s rental portfolio may become taxable under the land tainting rules because of the development or building activities of another group member, despite not being ordinarily taxable under the land sale rules and there being no concern that HNZ is trying to undermine the rules. This could impede HNZ’s ability to implement the Government’s building programme, as well as distorting the decision-making of the group and imposing excessive compliance costs. Wholly-owned and consolidated groups Section CV 1 applies to treat an amount as income when a company that is part of a wholly-owned group derives an amount that would not ordinarily be income of the company but would be income of the wholly-owned group if it were one company. Section FM 9 does the same thing as section CV 1, but for consolidated groups. The amount is then income of the company under section CV 2. These provisions are intended to prevent intra-group arrangements where assets are transferred and re-characterised to avoid tax. The effect of these sections is that any land sold by an entity in the Housing New Zealand Group (wholly-owned group or consolidated group, as applicable), even if excluded from the land tainting rules under proposed new section CB 15D, would be taxable to the group because of the development or building activities of another group member. The amendments to these sections outlined above prevent this from happening. Transactions between associated persons Section CB 15 governs the transfers of land between associated persons. It was introduced to ensure that the substantive provisions which render land disposals taxable are not circumvented by transfers between associated persons. It provides that where there is a transfer of land between associated persons, any amount that the transferee of the land derives from its subsequent disposal (if that amount is greater than the cost of the land to the transferee) will be taxed to the transferee under whichever of sections CB 6 to CB 14 would have applied to the transferor had the intermediate transfer not taken place. In May 2018, HNZ established a subsidiary, called Housing New Zealand Build Limited, to undertake its building activities. Without this proposed amendment, all capital gains derived by HNZ since the purchase of social housing properties from 111 Housing New Zealand Build Limited would be subject to tax on disposal under sections CB 7 (business relating to land) and/or CB 11 (building business), despite not being taxable if HNZ purchased the properties from a non-associated party. Amortising property and revenue account property The consolidated group rules in subpart FM are intended to ensure that a consolidated group of companies are treated as a single company for tax purposes. This enables tax- free intra-group asset transfers to take place and is designed to simplify the tax administration of a group of companies. Section FM 15 provides that where property is transferred between two companies in a consolidated group, the transferee is treated as acquiring the property at the original acquisition cost and acquisition date of the transferor. Without an amendment, capital gains accrued by HNZ would effectively become taxable in the hands of the group’s building company (New Co) on a later disposal of that property by New Co to a third party. This is because the deduction available to New Co on land acquired from HNZ and held on revenue account will be limited by section FM 15 to HNZ’s original acquisition cost of the land. 112 AMENDMENT TO THE BANK ACCOUNT REQUIREMENT – APPLICATION DATE (Clause 46) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 gives the Commissioner discretion to issue an IRD number to an offshore person without a New Zealand bank account if she is satisfied with their identity and background. The amendment replaced section 24BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 with new section 55B. This amendment was primarily made to assist taxpayers with meeting their New Zealand tax obligations. This Bill proposes to change the application date of this amendment to 15 October 2015, the date of the original requirement that offshore persons need to provide the Commissioner with their New Zealand bank accounts to obtain an IRD number. Application date The proposed amendment will apply for applications for IRD numbers made by or for offshore persons on or after 15 October 2015, under section 24BA or 55B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 113 NOISE MITIGATION EXPENDITURE (Clauses 115, 130, 139–143, 213(6) and 215) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will ensure that the expenditure incurred by businesses for remediating noise is deductible under section DB 46 of the Income Tax Act 2007, on the same basis as other pollution remediation expenditure. Application date The proposed amendment will apply to expenditure incurred from the 2018–19 and later income years. Background Section DB 46 states that certain expenditure incurred for pollution is deductible. Currently, noise pollution is not included – as a result, businesses incurring expenditure to remediate the effects of noise cannot use this provision to deduct such expenditure. This effect is created through the combination of section DB 46, schedule 19 and the definition of “contaminant” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Addit ionally, the expenditure may not create an asset for the taxpayer, so would not be depreciable. Therefore, noise remediation may result in “black hole” expenditure, being business expenditure that taxpayers are unable to deduct for income tax purposes, either immediately or over time. Key features To remedy this inconsistency between noise and other pollut ion remediatio n expenditure, it is proposed to amend sections CB 28, DB 46, EK 2, EK 11, EK 12, EK 20, EK 23, YA 1 and schedule 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In accordance with current section DB 46, the proposed deduction will be spread over the expenditure’s useful life under the pollution remediation rules. Taxpayers using the provision will be required, from the application date, to spread the cost of new remediation expenditure. 114 REPEAL OF ADVERSE EVENT SCHEME (Clauses 114, 128, 131, 135–138, 152, 185 and 213) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments repeal the adverse event scheme and transfer existing balances in the scheme to the main income equalisation scheme. Application date The proposed amendments will apply to the first income year that commences after the date of enactment. Key features The adverse event scheme is a tax relief mechanism for farmers who are forced to dispose of livestock as a result of a localised adverse event (for example, damage caused by a flood on a farming unit). The scheme is based entirely on the action of a farmer (person carrying on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand) that involves the farmer: • self-assessing that a localised adverse event has occurred; and • disposing of livestock because of that self-assessed adverse event and does not replace that livestock in the same “accounting year” (a defined term). A review of the provisions of the adverse event scheme relating to deposits and withdrawals indicted they are inflexible when compared to the corresponding provisions in the main scheme. As a result, few farmers have used the adverse event scheme, instead preferring to make income equalisation deposits into the main scheme to take advantage of its more flexible terms for deposits and withdrawals. The amendments propose that: • future deposits as a result of forced sales be made under the main scheme from the application date; • existing deposits in the adverse event scheme be transferred to the main scheme on the application date; and • some minor clarifications be made to the mechanics of the main income equalisation scheme for certain deposits and withdrawals that relate to the replacement of livestock following a localised adverse event. 115 116 Remedial items 117 118 PIE AND UNIT TRUST REMEDIALS (Clauses 167, 213(18), 214 and 217) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill makes two remedial amendments to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules and a remedial amendment to the public unit trust rules. Application date The proposed amendments to the PIE rules will come into force on the date of enactment. The proposed amendment to the public unit trust rules will apply for the 2008–09 and later income years to align with the start of the Income Tax Act 2007. Key features Wind-up of a listed PIE A listed PIE is an entity type for companies that are listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand and meet a number of other requirements. Like other types of PIEs, a listed PIE has a number of benefits over a non-PIE, such as the ability to distribute income, including capital gains, without further tax in the hands of the investor. The eligibility requirements to become a listed PIE include a two-year transit ional period for an entity intending to become a listed PIE. This transit io nal period allows an entity that is not listed on a recognised exchange to become a listed PIE provided it: • has 100 shareholders or more; • has resolved to become a company listed on a recognised exchange in New Zealand if it were to obtain the required consents; • has applied to the Financial Markets Authority for an exemption from disclosing in a product disclosure statement its intention to become a listed company; and • satisfies the Commissioner that the company would apply to become a listed company if it were to obtain the required consents. If the company becomes a listed PIE under these criteria but is not listed on a recognised exchange within two years, it will lose its listed PIE status unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue considers it is reasonable to grant an extension. The listed PIE rules do not include an equivalent provision for a listed PIE delisting as part of the process of winding up. The consequence of this is a distribution by a listed PIE while it is listed on a recognised exchange and a distribution by a former listed PIE once it is delisted will be subject to different tax rules. 119 It is not possible for a PIE to remain listed on a recognised exchange until after it has made its final distribution. For a listed PIE that seeks to continue without being listed on a recognised exchange, there are other options available, such as becoming a multi-rate PIE. However, compliance wit h the mult i-rate PIE rules requires systems and investor information that would not typically be available to a listed PIE so this option is not practical for a listed PIE that intends to wind-up. The Bill proposes to allow a listed PIE to retain its PIE status for up to two years, or longer if the Commissioner considers it reasonable, after it ceases to be listed on a recognised exchange if this cessation is part of the wind-up process. This would be achieved by replacing section HM 28 so that a listed PIE can elect under existing section HM 29, prior to delisting, that it will cease to be a PIE at a future date. This will provide the PIE with up to two years, or longer if the Commissioner considers it reasonable, to distribute its remaining assets. PIE status for a listed PIE using this method will be lost at the earlier of: • two years (or longer) from the date the listed PIE is delisted; • the date specified in the HM 29 election; or • when the number of shareholders reduces below 100. The Bill also proposes two changes to the definition of a listed PIE in section YA 1: • paragraph (a) is extended to include a listed PIE going through the wind-up process described above; and • paragraph (c) and (d) are to be repealed as they duplicate conditions that are already covered by section HM 7. This change is not intended to alter how the rules operate. These amendments are proposed to apply to listed PIEs removed from a registered exchange after the date of enactment. PIE maximum investor interest exemption for Northland Regional Council The Bill proposes to add Northland Regional Council to schedule 29 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This will allow the council to own up to one hundred percent of a PIE without the PIE breaching their minimum number of investor or maximum investor interest requirements, which are normally 20 investors and no investor with more than twenty percent respectively. Northland Regional Council invests for the benefit of Northland ratepayers and therefore it’s holding of a majority interest in a PIE is equivalent to the PIE itself being widely held. Schedule 29 already includes a number of similar vehicles including Auckland Council and Quayside Holdings Ltd which is the investment arm of Bay of Plent y Regio nal Council. This amendment is proposed to apply to investments by Northland Regional Council after the date of enactment. 120 Notional single person concession for public unit trusts Minimum shareholder continuity requirements are imposed on companies, including unit trusts, for the carry forward of tax losses and imputation credits. Exemptions to these continuity requirements apply when shareholding changes are between less than ten percent holders and a number of other requirements apply – referred to as the notional single person concession. A public unit trust is a defined term that covers unit trusts meeting one of a number of criteria indicating the unit trust is widely-held by unassociated persons. This definition was introduced to further extend the shareholder continuity exception to unit trusts by treating a public unit trust as being held by a notional single person that: • is not a company; • exists as long as the unit trust exists; and • holds nothing other than the shares in the unit trust. However, the notional single person concession applies only where the public unit trust chooses to apply it. This optionalit y was included so that a public unit trust would not be disadvantaged by introducing the concession, for example if the existing unit holders in the public unit trust were deemed as selling all their units to this notional single person and therefore breaching shareholder continuity. The current legislation assumes that a public unit trust will choose to apply the notional single person concession where it is advantageous to do so. However, the notional single person concession is also intended to apply to a chain of companies (or other entities) owned by that public unit trust including where the public unit trust is not a New Zealand tax resident. In this circumstance the public unit trust may not have chosen to apply the notional single person concession as they do not have a New Zealand tax liability and obtain no direct benefit from making this choice even though an entity they own would benefit. Example 16 A widely-held unit trust meets the definition of a public unit trust but has no association with New Zealand other than wholly owning a New Zealand incorporated company. During a certain period, there have been no ownership changes in the New Zealand incorporated company but the unit trust has had a number of ownership changes. The New Zealand company can rely on being owned by a public unit trust that is owned by a notional single person, and therefore not forfeiting losses or imputation credits because of a breach of shareholder continuity, but only if the public unit trust chooses to apply the notional single person concession. As the unit trust has no dealings with the New Zealand tax system they have not chosen to apply the notional single person concession even though there is no disadvantage in doing so. The Bill proposes to allow a taxpayer who is, directly or indirectly, wholly or partially owned by a public unit trust to choose the treat the public unit trust as applying the notional single person concession without the public trust having to separately choose to apply it. 121 As this change is consistent with the existing policy intent and some taxpayers owned by public unit trusts may have already been applying the rules in this manner, the amendment is proposed to apply for the 2008–09 and later income years to align with the start of the Income Tax Act 2007. 122 WORKING FOR FAMILIES ABATEMENT RATES AND THRESHOLDS (Clauses 179, 183, 184, 260 and 261) Summary of proposed amendment The average abatement rate, threshold and family tax credit rate should be repealed as they are no longer required. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 July 2018, the date the changes to Working for Families take effect. Key feature The Working for Families tax credit average abatement rate, threshold and family tax credit rates for the 2019 tax year would be repealed. Background The Families Package legislation increased the Working for Families tax credit abatement rate from 22.5% to 25% and the abatement threshold from $36,350 to $42,700 a year from 1 July 2018. The family tax credit rates for most children also increase from 1 July 2018. The changes are effective part way through the 2018–19 tax year. The Act sets out an average abatement rate, threshold and family tax credit rates for that year. The average rates assume that the family earns income evenly across a year and claims tax credits for the whole year. The end-of-year reconciliation (or square up) ensures the correct amount of tax credits have been paid relative to the family’s actual income and circumstances over the year and uses the average annual figures. However, the end-of-year process is being built in START, Inland Revenue’s new computer system. This means that it is possible to make the reconciliation process more accurate. It is proposed that the actual income earned before 1 July will be reconciled using the old abatement rate and threshold and the income earned from 1 July will be reconciled using the new rate and threshold. This means that the average annual rates are no longer required. 123 INTERACTION BETWEEN BEST START AND PAID PARENTAL LEAVE (Clause 178) Summary of proposed amendment A clarification is proposed to ensure that a person can receive paid parental leave and the Best Start tax credit for the same child. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 July 2018, the date the Best Start tax credit takes effect. Key feature It is proposed when a person receives paid parental leave for a child, they would also be entitled to receive any Best Start payments for that child. Background The Families Package legislation includes the introduction of the new Best Start tax credit. It was intended that a person could receive paid parental leave and once it ceases to be payable, Best Start payments should be made for the rest of the eligible period. This prevents a person getting paid Best Start and paid parental leave at the same time for the same child. However, as currently drafted, if a person receives paid parental leave, they are not entitled to receive any Best Start payments for that child. It is proposed that the legislation be amended to reflect the policy intent. 124 PARENTAL TAX CREDIT CLARIFICATION (Clauses 180–182, 263, 264 and 269) Summary of proposed amendment A minor retrospective technical amendment is required to enable the parental tax credit to be paid on a pro-rata basis to qualifying persons to reinstate the original policy intent. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 July 2002, the date the amendment took effect. Key feature The parental tax credit would be paid on a pro-rata basis to qualifying persons. Background In implementing the Families Package, an issue has been identified with the current wording of the parental tax credit. The Families Package repeals the parental tax credit for children born on or after 1 July 2018 but is still available for children born before that date. The issue is an unintended consequence of an earlier amendment. In 2002, an amendment inadvertently resulted in the removal of the ability to pay the parental tax credit on a pro-rata basis. The parental tax credit is not available if the person is in receipt of a specified payment (for example, a Ministry of Social Development benefit), or has a suspended entitlement to such a benefit, or if they claim paid parental leave. However, the original policy intent was to permit the payment of the parental tax credit for the days when there was no such payment of a Ministry of Social Development benefit. Inland Revenue has continued to make pro-rata payments to qualifying persons inadvertently, contrary to the effect of the 2002 amendment. A minor retrospective technical amendment is recommended to enable the parental tax credit to be paid on a pro-rata basis to qualifying persons to reinstate the original policy intent. 125 GST REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 223 and 225–228) Summary of proposed amendment A number of minor amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are proposed where the legislation does not technically give effect to the policy intent, or where there are obvious errors. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment, with the exception of clauses 228 and 225. Clause 228 will apply on and after 1 April 2011. Clause 225 will apply on and after 1 October 2016. Key features The following proposed amendments clarify the relevant legislation, or correct a clear error. Exemptions to the requirement to make an adjustment (clause 226) Section 21(2) currently states that a person is not required to make an adjustment if one or more of the criteria listed in paragraphs (a) to (d) apply. Inland Revenue’s interpretation of this current drafting is that it prohibits a person from making an adjustment if any of the criteria listed apply. However, it is possible that some are interpreting the section as meaning that it allows but does not require adjustments when any of the criteria listed apply. The amendment clarifies that a person may not make an adjustment if one or more of the criteria listed in section 21(2) apply, consistent with Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the current drafting. Notification to the Commissioner of a change in company constitution (clause 227) A registered person is required to notify the Commissioner within 21 days of a change in status. Changes in status include changes to a registered person’s name, address, constitution or principal taxable activity or activities. The amendment will remove the requirement for a registered person to notify the Commissioner of a change in constitution, as this information is generally not necessary or relevant to Inland Revenue’s operations and it would only be in extremely rare circumstances where a change in a company’s constitution may have an impact on its GST posit ion. 126 Outdated references to the former principal purpose test in section 55(7) (clause 228) Section 55(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 contains the rules for GST groups. Under the previous apportionment rules (which were based on the “principal purpose” test for deducting input tax), section 55(7)(db) treated a change in use as having occurred when a member of a group of companies (not being a member of the GST group at that time): • acquired or produced goods or services for the “principal purpose” of making taxable supplies; • later joined the GST group; and • any other member of the GST group subsequently used the goods and services for non-taxable purposes (that is, for private purposes or for the making of exempt supplies). Section 55(7)(dc) treated a change of use as having occurred in the reverse situation when a group member acquired or produced goods or services which they principally intended to use for non-taxable purposes, joined the GST group, and any other member of the GST group used the goods and services for making taxable supplies. The apportionment rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 were significantly reformed in 2011 to allow input tax deductions “to the extent” that goods and services are used for (or are available for use in) making taxable supplies. The amendment therefore removes the outdated references to the former “principal purpose” test, clarifying that a change in use adjustment is required to be made by the representative member of a GST group when: • a person (the “new member”) who previously acquired goods and services for their business or private use joins the GST group; and • the extent of taxable use of those goods and services by any group member differs fro m the new member’s previous percentage of taxable use of those inputs. Cross-references Finally, the Bill will address two cross-referencing errors and oversights: • Sections 10(3C) and (3D) link to services treated as being made in New Zealand by section 8(4B). Services treated as being made in New Zealand by section 8(4B) are subject to a reverse charge under section 5B. However, sections 10(3C) and (3D) are not linked to zero-rated remote services that are instead subject to a reverse charge under section 20(3JC). The amendment inserts this cross-reference (clause 225). • Section 2A(4) aggregates the interests of two associated people for the purposes of paragraphs 2A(1)(a) and (b). However, section 2A(4) does not aggregate the interests of two people associated under paragraph 2A(1)(bb). The amendment inserts this cross-reference (clause 223). 127 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT RULES – TREATMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF GOODS AND SERVICES (Clause 149) Summary of proposed amendment The taxation of financial arrangements broadly follows accounting principles which can occasionally produce results outside the policy intent. This can happen when a foreign exchange denominated agreement for the sale and purchase of goods and services (ASAP) (being a business combination under NZ IFRS 3) has a contingent amount (an amount payable or receivable depending on a future event, say future performance). Accounting treats adjustments for these as being on revenue account, and as a result contingent payments are automatically treated as “interest” under the Income Tax Act 2007 (and assessable or deductible). This outcome is inconsistent with policy intent and changes are proposed so these adjustments have regard to the underlying transaction. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force for existing agreements on the date of enactment, with savings provisions for taxpayers who have taken tax positions relying on the current law. Key features The proposed amendments will: • exclude amounts recognised in the Income Statement of purchasers and sellers from contingent payments for businesses acquired from being treated as interest for tax (being deductible or assessable) under the financial arrangements rules; • for purchasers, exclude the amounts from the value/cost of property acquired under the business acquisition, except when the property is the shares of an entity acquired to obtain the business. The amounts excluded from the value of property are effectively positive or negative goodwill on acquisition; and • for sellers the contingent amounts increase/decrease the sale price of the assets/liabilities or shares sold, which may result in adjustments to depreciation on sale of assets or income/expenditure for assets held on revenue account. Background The taxation rules for foreign ASAPs were substantially amended in 2014 to follow their accounting treatment. Subsequent analysis of the accounting treatment by officials has revealed the unintended tax treatment of contingent payments under foreign ASAPs. We are unaware of any transactions that have been subject to the unintended treatment. 128 RESIDENTIAL AND MAIN HOME EXCLUSIONS (Clauses 110–113) Summary of proposed amendment Remedial amendments to the residential and main home exclusions from the land sale rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 will: • ensure that the residential exclusion in section CB 17(2) applies whether or not the taxpayer has a family member living with them, and align the wording in the various residential exclusions; and • ensure that the “regular pattern” carve outs from the residential exclusion in section CB 16 and the main home exclusion in section CB 16A operate as intended, so that a pattern of transactions will only prevent the exclusions being available if it involves buying and selling, or building and selling, houses that were the person’s residence or main home. Application dates The proposed amendments to sections CB 16, CB 17, and CB 18 will apply from the start of the 2008–09 income year, the first year to which the Income Tax Act 2007 applies. The proposed amendment to section CB 16A will apply from 1 October 2015, when the bright-line test came into force. Background Family members Prior to the rewrite of the income tax legislation, the wording of what is now section CB 17(2) would clearly have allowed a person without a family member living with them to use the residential exclusion. However, this is not clear on the rewritten wording of the provision. The amendment to section CB 17(2) reinstates the pre-rewrite posit ion, restoring the original policy intent. The rewrite also inadvertently introduced slight wording differences between the various residential exclusions, and these are being amended for consistency. “Regular pattern” The residential exclusion in section CB 16 cannot be used if the person has engaged in a regular pattern of transactions. Prior to the rewrite, it was clear from the legislation that to be disqualified from using the exclusion, the transactions in the regular pattern had to involve dwellings used mainly as the taxpayer’s residence. This is not apparent from the wording of the rewritten legislation, which suggests that regular pattern of buying and 129 selling houses or building and selling houses, whether or not they were the taxpayer’s residence, would disqualify the taxpayer from using the exclusion. The amendment to section CB 16 restores the original policy intention that the regular pattern carve out will only apply if the taxpayer has a regular pattern of buying and selling or building and selling dwellings that they occupied mainly as a residence. The above issue was inadvertently replicated in the wording of the main home exclusion (section CB 16A) from the bright-line test, when those rules were introduced, as the wording in the main home exclusion was based on the residential exclusion in section CB 16, which contained the unintended rewrite change discussed above. The amendment to section CB 16A is to clarify that the regular pattern carve out will only apply if the taxpayer has a regular pattern of buying and selling residential land that was used predominantly, for most of the time the taxpayer owned the land, for a dwelling that was their main home. 130 FIF COST METHOD (Clause 151) Summary of proposed amendment The cost method in the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules is being amended to ensure it works as intended, so the ability for a person to reset their cost base every five years through independent valuation is optional not mandatory. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from 1 April 2007, when the cost method provisions came into force. Background The FIF rules provide for the taxation of equity investments that New Zealand tax residents hold in foreign entities they do not have a controlling interest in. There are five different calculation methods for determining the amount of FIF income a person has for the year. The starting point is that the “fair dividend rate” method must be adopted. But if that method is not practical to apply because the market value of the FIF can only be determined by an independent valuation, a person may use the “cost method”. Generally an independent valuation is required on entry into the cost method. The cost method then taxes 5% of the “opening value” of the person’s interest in the FIF, plus an adjustment for shares bought and sold within the same income year. The “opening value” is uplifted by 5% each year as a proxy for an increase in the value of the investment. It was intended that investors in FIFs who use the “cost method” for calculating their FIF income would have the ability to reset their cost base (the “opening value”) once every five years through an independent valuation. It was intended that such a revaluation would be optional. However, the legislation as enacted appears to make the five-yearly revaluation mandatory, not optional. This outcome is not consistent with the policy intent, so an amendment to section EX 56(3)(b) will ensure the legislation operates as intended. 131 RESETTLEMENTS OF TRUSTS (Clauses 159, 160(1), 161(3) and 161(6)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments relate to a resettlement of property by the trustee of one trust (the head trust) onto a new trust (the sub-trust). The proposed amendments clarify: • the relationship between foreign sourced trustee income derived by the sub-trust and the exempt income rule in section CW 54; • if the head trust is a foreign trust, the extent to which the value of the resettled property is corpus of the sub-trust; and • if the head trust is a foreign trust, the classification of gains deemed to be derived by the trustee of the head trust, as a result of the rules applying to distributions, transmissions, and gifts of property. The proposed amendments do not affect the general operation of the settlor definition. In addition, the proposed amendments do not affect the requirement that a settlor of a foreign trust must not have been resident in New Zealand since the current trust rules were originally enacted. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. A transit io nal provisio n is also proposed to validate tax positions taken prior to the date of enactment, but only for those tax positions taken that are consistent with the outcome given by the amendments. Key features The amendments propose to clarify that a resettlement of property by the trustee of a head trust on another trust does not affect the entitlement of that sub-trust to the exemption from tax under section CW 54 for foreign sourced trustee income if: • at least one trustee of the head-trust is resident in New Zealand; • the head trust has only non-resident settlors at the time of the settlement; and • the sub-trust satisfies the requirements of sections CW 54 and HC 26 when it derives the foreign sourced trustee income. In addition, the amendments propose to clarify that a resettlement of property by a foreign trust on a sub-trust is included in corpus of the sub-trust (and consequently not treated as trustee income). However, if the head trust is a foreign trust and the settlor was a controlled foreign company, but no New Zealand resident is deemed to be a settlor 132 of that trust (section HC 28(3), (4)), part of the value a resettlement of property may be excluded from corpus of the sub-trust. Background The proposed amendments address some technical issues relating to a trustee of a foreign trust that settles property of that trust (the head trust) onto a sub-trust (a resettlement). Under current law, the trustee of the head trust is treated as a settlor in relation to the resettled property. If there are multiple trustees of the head trust and at least one trustee of the head trust is resident in New Zealand, the sub-trust will be taxable on its world-wide trustee income under the settlor regime. This is an unintended outcome as it is intended that the settlor of the head trust would be the settlor of the sub- trust. The proposed amendments clarify the law. In addition, an administrative review of the trust rules identified that the valuation rules for distributions, transmissions and gifts of property in subpart FC of the Income Tax Act 2007 result in: • the trustee of the head-trust being treated as having disposed of the resettled property at market value; and • the trustee of the sub-trust being treated as having acquired the resettled property at market value. The application of these valuation rules to a resettlement can result in a capital gain being deemed to be derived from an associated person. A capital gain derived by a foreign trust from an associated person can result in part of the resettlement being excluded from the corpus of the sub-trust and also treated as trustee income of the sub- trust. Detailed analysis Under the current income tax rules, there can be some unintended consequences when there is a resettlement of trust assets by the trustees of a foreign trust on a sub-trust. Exempt income for trusts which do not have a New Zealand resident settlor Under current income tax law, a resettlement of trust property of a trust will result in the trustee of the head trust being treated as a settlor of the sub-trust. Prior to the resettlement, if the head trust is a foreign trust, foreign-sourced income derived from that trust property would be exempt income of the foreign trust under section CW 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Consequently, after the resettlement, if at least one trustee of the head-trust is a New Zealand resident, the sub-trust will have a New Zealand resident settlor. This will result in trustee income derived by that sub-trust being taxable in New Zealand on a world- wide basis. The resettlement of property of a foreign trust on a sub-trust is not intended to have this outcome. 133 The proposed amendments ensure that where a resident trustee of a head-trust resettles property on a sub-trust and no settlor of that head trust is resident in New Zealand at the time of resettlement: • the trustee of the head trust is not treated as a settlor of the sub-trust; and • the settlors of the head trust are treated as the settlors of the sub-trust; • the trustees of the sub-trust will be entitled to the exemption from tax for foreign- sourced trustee income from the time of resettlement, provided the sub-trust meets the ongoing requirements of sections CW 54 and HC 26. Resettlements and the valuation rules applying to distributions A valuation rule (in subpart FC) applies to a resettlement of property on a sub-trust. For income tax purposes, this rule treats the resettlement of property on a sub-trust as a disposal and purchase at market value. If the head trust is a foreign trust, this could result in the head trust: • deriving a capital gain from an associated person (a tainted gain) for the purpose of the definition of taxable distribution for a foreign trust; and • to the extent the value of resettlement includes such a tainted gain, that gain would be excluded from the corpus of the sub-trust and taxed as trustee income in the sub-trust. The proposed amendments ensure that, in most circumstances, when a foreign trust resettles property on a sub-trust, the valuation rules applying to a resettlement of property on a sub-trust: • do not result in a tainted gain being included in the value of the resettlement; and • provide that the full value of the resettlement is corpus of the sub-trust. 134 BINDING RULINGS AND RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS (Clause 54) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may make a binding ruling for any record-keeping requirement in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has a power to rule on the record-keeping requirements of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. However, no such explicit power exists in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for other revenue types. For consistency, the amendment proposes that the Commissioner be able to rule on record-keeping requirements for all tax types. 135 TRUST RULES (Clauses 158, 160(2) and 162–164) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments: • ensure there is internal consistency within the Income Tax Act 2007 in relation to the tests for tax residence and some trustee elections; • correct unintended legislative changes arising from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 2007; and • clarify internal cross-references and relationships with other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Background The proposed amendments relate to some matters identified in an administrative review of a 1989 Tax Information Bulletin item on the taxation of trusts. Key features Transitional residence and election to be a complying trust A foreign trust loses its status as foreign trust when a settlor of that trust migrates to New Zealand. That trust may then choose to become a complying trust. If that choice is not made, the trust becomes a non-complying trust, which affects the taxation of distributions made from the trust that are not beneficiary income. A period of time is given to make this election (a grace period). There is an inconsistency between two provisions referring to this grace period. This inconsistency results in uncertainty about the correct starting date of the grace period if the migrating settlor is a transit ional resident. The policy intent is that the start of that period is: • if the migrating settlor is a transitional resident, the first day following cessation of the transitional residence status; or • if the migrating settlor is not a transitional resident, the first day of residence in New Zealand. The proposed amendment clarifies that the start date for a transitional resident is the first day the migrating settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. 136 Transitional residence, ordering rules, and distributions At present, the law is unclear about the tax treatment of distributions from trustee income derived by a foreign trust in the year in which a migrating settlor ceases to be a transit ional resident. This uncertainty could result in such a distribution being subject to economic double taxation because: • the foreign trust becomes taxable on world-wide trustee income from the beginning of the income year in which the migrating settlor ceases to be a transitional resident; and • if the distribution is a taxable distribution to a New Zealand resident beneficiary, that distribution is taxed at the marginal rate of the beneficiary with no credit for the New Zealand tax paid for income derived in the part-year before the settlor ceases to be a transitional resident. The policy intent is that a distribution from such accumulated income in that part-year period should not be subject to economic double taxation. The proposed amendments clarify this by treating a distribution from this part-year period as being from a complying trust (that is, not taxed to the beneficiary). Election to be a complying trust The proposed amendments to section HC 16: • relate to the election for a foreign trust to become a complying trust when a settlor migrates to New Zealand; and • correct an unintended legislative change arising from the rewrite of the provision by clarifying that this election may be made by any settlor, trustee, or beneficiary of the trust. Capital gains derived from an associated person and the ordering rules The ordering rules are clarified to correct an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of the provisio n. The proposed amendment ensures that a capital gain derived from an associated person is treated as income derived by the trustee for the purpose of the ordering rules. This restores the intended timing effect for when such a capital gain is treated as distributed. Minor beneficiary income The proposed amendments correct an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of the minor beneficiary rules. The broad intent of these rules is to tax beneficiary income distributed to minors at the trustee rate of 33%. There is intended to be an exclusion from this broad intent if certain requirements (in sections HC 36 and HC 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007) about the trust are satisfied (for example, in so me circumstances, minor beneficiary income derived that relates to a protected person under the Domestic Violence Act 1995). 137 However, the current law does not work as intended as it presently requires all listed circumstances to be satisfied before the exclusion applies. The proposed amendment clarifies that the exclusion applies if the requirements of either section HC 36 or HC 37 are satisfied. No value in the beneficiary relationship for the purpose of section HC 14 There is an inconsistency between the rules applying to distributions, transmissions and gifts in subpart FC and the definition of distribution. The issue is that under subpart FC, a distribution of property may be treated as a purchase and disposal of that property at market value; whereas, in the definition of distribution, the beneficiary receiving property is treated as providing no value for a distribution by virtue of the beneficiary status. The main purpose for the rules in subpart FC is to ensure that, for the trust making the distribution, the value of transferred revenue account property is correctly taken into account in calculating the trust’s trustee income. The amendment proposes that the rules in subpart FC do not apply for the purpose of applying the definition of distribution. This will ensure that a distribution will continue to be determined by whether a transfer of value has been made to a beneficiary. 138 TAX RULES FOR DEREGISTERED CHARITIES (Clauses 174) Summary of proposed amendment Six remedial changes to the tax rules for deregistered charities are proposed in this Bill. They are intended to protect the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that if an entity has claimed tax exemptions as a charity and has accumulated assets, these assets should always be destined for a charitable purpose, even if the entity is deregistered by the New Zealand charity regulator, the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services, under the Charities Act 2005. Key features and application dates The proposed remedial amendments will better align the legislation with the policy intent of the tax rules for deregistered charities. These proposed amendments will have retrospective effect from 14 April 2014 (when the tax rules for deregistered charities were first enacted): • Addressing the tax treatment of land owned by deregistered marae charities. • Preventing potential double-deduction for monetary gifts made within one year of deregistration. These proposed amendments will apply to charities deregistered on or after 1 April 2019: • Preventing potential over-taxation of deregistered charities in group structures in circumstances where multiple members in the group deregister together. • Addressing the disposal of wholly-owned subsidiaries by a charitable group for market value. • Clarifying the valuation of assets and liabilities at the date of deregistration. • Introducing a de minimis threshold for charities with a low value of accumulated assets. Background Under the charity deregistration tax rules, the net assets of a deregistered charity must be transferred or disposed of for charitable purposes or in accordance with the charity’s rules contained on the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) Charities Services register, within 12 months; otherwise it will be subject to income tax on the value of its net assets. The calculation of net assets excludes assets received from the Crown in relation to a Treaty of Waitangi settlement claim or in accordance with the Maori Fisheries Act 2004, and any non-cash assets which were gifted to the organisation when it was exempt from income tax. 139 Detailed analysis Deregistered charities in group structures Large charities will often operate as part of a group, with charitable entities holding equit y investments in other registered charities. If a parent entity and its subsidiaries are deregistered by DIA Charities Services, then the deregistration rules apply to each of those entities and each entity must pay tax based on the value of its net assets. The value of the underlying assets could therefore be taxed more than once. This is an over-reach of the policy intent of the deregistration tax rules, and it is appropriate to allow the deregistered charitable parent entity to make an adjustment in its net asset calculation. Amendments are proposed to ensure that if a parent entity and one or more members of a charitable group deregister at the same time, the value of the parent’s shares in the subsidiary is ignored for the purposes of calculating the parent’s income under the deregistration tax rules. Disposal of assets by a charitable group for market value If a charity acquires one hundred percent ownership of an investment company, it will typically register that company as a charity in its own right. When it later sells its shares, then that subsidiary may be required to deregister and therefore be taxed on the value of its net assets. However, if the subsidiary is sold at arm’s length for market value, no value leaves the charitable group and it is an overreach to impose the deregistration tax on the subsidiary. It is not appropriate to apply the deregistration tax in these circumstances, because the charitable group has simply replaced a certain amount of value in shares with the same amount in cash. In addition, the deregistration tax liability is likely to be reflected in the sale price of the shares, which would mean that the charitable group bears the economic burden of the tax liability. An amendment is proposed to ensure that if a charity sells an interest in a subsidiary at arm’s length for market value, the deregistration tax does not apply to that subsidiary if it is deregistered as a result of the sale. Carve-out for marae assets Generally, a deregistered charity can reduce the amount of tax payable under the deregistration rules by disposing of or transferring their assets within one year of the day they were deregistered. However, “reservation” land, upon which marae are built, cannot be disposed of or transferred to pay the resulting tax bill because of restrict ions on alienation of reservation land under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. This means that marae that are registered as charities are unable to reduce their deregistration tax liabilities, unlike other deregistered charities. Amendments are proposed to ensure that for marae built on reservation land established under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993, the value of the land and improvements on 140 the land will be excluded from the net asset calculation. This would ensure that they are no longer taxed on the value of assets which they are legally unable to dispose of or transfer. Valuation of assets and liabilities The legislation currently refers to a deregistered charity being taxed on its “net assets”. However, there is no indication in the Income Tax Act 2007 as to what valuation method should be used to measure the entity’s net assets. Providing a valuation method in the legislation will help provide more certainty for taxpayers. Using the historical cost of the asset does not provide the desired deterrent effect against deregistration, as sometimes what is today a very valuable asset could be recorded at a much lower historical cost value. This is inconsistent with the policy intent of the deregistration tax rules, which is to provide an incentive for charitable assets to remain in the charitable sector. It is proposed that the legislation specify that assets and liabilities should be valued at their market value. Market value refers in general terms to the price an asset would be sold for in an arm’s length transaction. This is usually determined from market-based evidence by appraisal. Under the accounting standards for charities, the market value for an asset can also be established by reference to other items with similar characteristics, in similar circumstances and location – for example, by accepting the council ratings valuation as a market valuation for land. Prescribed valuation methods for certain assets (premises, plant, equipment, and trading stock) are already contained in the deregistration rules. It is proposed that the market value requirement applies only to those assets which do not already have a prescribed valuation method. Monetary gifts made within one year of deregistration Under current law, a deregistered charity that is a company or Māori authority may make a monetary donation to another charity within 12 months of deregistration and this donation will both reduce its deregistration tax liability and be eligible for a gift deduction under the charitable giving rules. Example 17 A deregistered charity holds $1 million worth of funds in its bank account at the date of deregistration. It donates half of that amount to another charity within 12 months of deregistration. This has the effect of excluding $500,000 from tax under the deregistration tax rules. However, as the deregistered charity is now subject to normal income tax rules, it can also receive a $500,000 income tax deduction for the gift. The one donation of $500,000 is therefore eligible for two tax concessions, despite not adding any new funds to the charitable sector. This double benefit is not consistent with the policy intent, as the assets are effectively already in the charitable sector. 141 An amendment to the charitable giving rules is proposed to clarify that assets transferred to another charity in accordance with the deregistration rules do not also qualify for a gift deduction. De minimis threshold for small deregistered charities Small deregistered charities with limited resources may find it difficult to value assets for the purposes of the deregistration tax. It is inefficient for Inland Revenue to dedicate compliance resources to these small charities as the potential tax liability would be very low. A “de minimis” threshold of $5,000 in net assets is proposed to exclude small charities from the deregistration tax rules. A $5,000 net asset threshold would remove about half of all deregistered charities from the deregistration rules. It is also consistent with the settlement de minimis threshold used in relation to minor beneficiaries under the trust rules. 142 NOT-FOR-PROFITS REMEDIALS (Clauses 5(52), 5(58), 42(16)–(18), 125, 134, 157, 176 and 213(32)) Summary of proposed amendments A number of remedial changes to the tax rules for not-for-profit entities are proposed in this Bill. They are intended to improve the integrity and coherency of the tax system, as it applies to these entities. Application date The application dates for these proposed amendments are set out under their respective sect ions below. Key features Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 are proposed to ensure that: • the charitable business income tax exemption applies only to charities registered under the Charities Act 2005; • the deemed disposal provision for depreciation recovery income applies when a taxable entity becomes a registered charity; • the disclosure requirements which apply to foreign trusts also apply to foreign trusts that are registered charities; • organisations seeking donee status for donation tax credit, gift deduction or fringe benefit tax exemption purposes must be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; • organisations with charitable purposes must be registered charities in order to obtain donee status; and • relevant penalty, interest and avoidance provisions apply to donation tax credits. Detailed analysis Application of the charitable business income exemption Registration under the Charities Act 2005 carries with it a number of reporting obligations, which improves transparency and promotes public trust and confidence in the charitable sector. Entities are generally required to be registered as a charity in order to access the charitable tax exemption for non-business income. 143 However, an entity is not always required to be registered as a charity in order to access the charitable exemptions for business income under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Business income is exempt if it is derived by a registered charity, or by a separate business “carried on for, or for the benefit of” a registered charity. This ability to claim a charitable income tax exemption without being subject to the public reporting requirements of registered charities is contrary to the policy intent. A small but increasing number of businesses are seeking to take advantage of the business income exemption without being registered charities themselves. This risks undermining public trust and confidence in the charitable sector. It also increases the extent to which Inland Revenue is involved in charity oversight and regulation. This does not align with the government policy that regulation of the charitable sector should sit primarily with the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services. An amendment is proposed to section CW 42 to ensure that the business income exemption applies only to organisations that are registered under the Charities Act 2005. The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Application of the deemed disposal provision for depreciation recovery income Under the depreciation rules, a change in the use of an asset is treated as if that asset was disposed of for the market value of the asset. One of the events which could trigger this deemed disposal occurs when a business changes its constitution or rules in order to meet the legal requirements for an exemption from income tax (for example, if a registered charity buys one hundred percent of the shares in a business, and that business registers as a charity under the Charities Act 2005). Once there has been a deemed disposal, any excess depreciation deductions are clawed back as depreciation recovery income arising in the following income year. However, if the change is from a taxable use to being used for exempt purposes (for example, for charitable purposes), then it is not possible to claw back the excess depreciation deductions because by the following income year the entity will be exempt from income tax. An income tax exemption should not extend to depreciation recovery income, which is attributable to income years before the entity became exempt. Such an outcome is contrary to policy intent. Amendments are proposed to ensure that depreciation recovery income arises immediately before the entity is treated as being exempt from income tax, to ensure that excessive depreciation deductions are clawed back. The proposed amendment will apply from the date this Bill was introduced. Disclosure requirements for charities that are foreign trusts If a New Zealand registered charity is also a “foreign trust” (a tax term, being a trust established in New Zealand but where no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time), then it is not subject to the foreign trust disclosure requirements in the Tax Administration Act 1994, including the new foreign trust disclosure requirements implemented by the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017. The historic reason for this exclusion has been that such foreign 144 trusts are already subject to public disclosure and regulation requirements under the Charities Act 2005, so no further disclosure requirements were considered necessary. However, the new foreign trust disclosure requirements now require some information that is not collected under the Charities Act 2005. The additional information involves identifying particulars and contact details for settlors, trustees and beneficiaries. Amendments are proposed to the definition of “resident foreign trustee” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that registered charities are not exempted from the foreign trust disclosure requirements. Foreign trusts that are also registered charities will be required to make annual disclosures to Inland Revenue like any other foreign trust. The proposed amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Donee status – approved donee list At present it is possible for an organisation to self-assess whether it satisfies the criteria in section LD 3(2) for donee status. Such an organisation can issue donation receipts to donors that qualify for a donation tax credit or gift deductions without being on Inland Revenue’s list of donee organisations. To ensure public transparency and to strengthen the integrity of the tax system, it is proposed that organisations that want to qualify for donee status must be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section LD 3(2)(a). No changes are proposed for organisations registered under the Charities Act 2005 that are currently on the Inland Revenue’s list of donee organisations. Similarly, organisations with benevolent, cultural or philanthropic (but not charitable) purposes that are currently on the Inland Revenue’s list of donee organisations, will continue to have donee status. A requirement for the Commissioner’s approval for donee status is also proposed for funds, public funds, and public institutions, under sections LD 3(2)(b), (c), and (d), for consistency. The proposed amendment will apply from 1 April 2019. Donee status – application to organisations with charitable purposes At present, organisations with charitable purposes can obtain donee status without being registered under the Charities Act 2005. The proposed amendment will require all entities with charitable purposes to be registered under the Charities Act 2005 in order to qualify for donee status. This will ensure that all charitable organisations that can issue donation receipts that qualify for a donation tax credit or gift deductions are subject to the same reporting and regulatory requirements. Entities with charitable purposes that are not registered under the Charities Act 2005 but are on Inland Revenue’s approved donee list will be required to register under the Charities Act 2005 by 1 April 2020 if they wish to retain their donee status. 145 As noted above, this change will have no impact on organisations on the Inland Revenue’s approved donee list that have only benevolent, cultural or philanthropic (but not charitable) purposes. The proposed amendment will apply from 1 April 2020. Application of penalties, interest and avoidance provisions Under the current law, use-of-money interest and some penalties cannot be applied when donation tax credit claims are overstated. Avoidance provisions also do not apply to overpaid donation tax credits. This is contrary to policy intent. Amendments are proposed to the definition of “tax” in the Tax Administration Act 1994, as well as inserting a new anti-avoidance provision (section GB 53) in the Income Tax Act 2007, to ensure that relevant penalty, interest and avoidance provisions apply in relation to donation tax credits that are overpaid. The proposed application date is 1 April 2019. 146 Rewrite remedials 147 148 LAND SALES – ASSOCIATED PERSONS (Clause 108) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment clarifies the two associated person rules that apply to disposals o f land to ensure that: • under an anti-avoidance rule applying to a disposal of “tainted land”, the income derived on disposal is not income under any of the main land sales rules (sections CB 6 to CB 14); and • a relief provision for associated persons applies only if the test of association applies in relation to a single transaction and not multiple transactions. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. A savings provision is proposed to protect tax positions taken on the basis of the existing law prior to introduction of the Bill. Key features An amendment is proposed to section CB 15 to clarify that its two subsections apply in different circumstances for a disposal of land and are not interdependent. The different circumstances are: • a disposal of land that was acquired at an earlier time from an associated person of the vendor who would have been taxed on the disposal had the associated person retained the land and made the disposal themselves; • a disposal of land that would be taxed under one of the land sales rules if the land is sold within 10 years of acquisition (or, in the case of the land sales rule applying to builders, sold within 10 years of commencing making improvements to the land). The amendment proposed to the anti-avoidance rule for land sales (section CB 15(1)) will clarify that the income derived on disposal is income of the vendor under the anti- avoidance rule, rather than under any of the main land sales rules. This will ensure that the anti-avoidance rule does not apply where there is a series of transactions between associated persons, and also clarifies that the vendor cannot use any of exclusions from the main land sale rules. The amendment proposed for the associated persons relief rule (section CB 15(2)) will clarify that the vendor is not taxed on the disposal of land if there is a combined period of actual ownership exceeding 10 years between: 149 • the vendor; and • in certain circumstances, an associated person from whom they acquired the land. Detailed analysis Section CB 15 contains both an anti-avoidance rule and a relief rule relating to a disposal of land, which the vendor of the land has acquired from an associated person. Under some recent interpretations of this provision, a disposal of land could be taxed incorrectly. Independent operation of the two rules One interpretation is that the relief rule applies only if the anti-avoidance rule applies. That is not how the provision is intended to operate. The proposed amendment clarifies that the two rules operate independently of each other. Anti-avoidance rule The anti-avoidance rule is intended to apply to a vendor who disposes of land to a third party if: • the vendor had acquired the land from an associated person; and • the associated person would have been taxed on the disposal of land to the third party, had they kept the land and disposed of it themselves to the third party. One interpretation of the anti-avoidance rule argues that the associated person’s requirements in the anti-avoidance rule can apply to a series of transactions between associated persons. This interpretation: • arises fro m the anti-avoidance rule stating that the vendor is taxable under one of the main land sales rules; and • results in over-taxation of disposals of land. The proposed amendment clarifies the rule’s intent by providing that the vendor is taxed under the anti-avoidance rule, rather than under the main land sales rules the associated person would have been taxed under. The income is derived in the year it is incurred unless a specific timing rule applies to the sale of the land. A second interpretation is that the vendor of the land is entitled to the benefit of the exclusions from the land sales rules because they are taxed under one of the main land sales rules rather than under the anti-avoidance rule. An example of a disposal of land to which this interpretation might result in unintended consequences is for land that: • was acquired by a property developer for the development business; • was later transferred by the developer to his or her spouse; • the spouse builds a home on the land and lives in it; and 150 • later, the spouse on-sells the land to a third party and leases back the home. As the property was acquired for the purpose of the property development business, it is intended that the disposal of that land to a third party is always subject to tax (revenue account property). The anti-avoidance rule is intended to tax a disposal of land that is revenue account property that has been transferred to an associated person before disposal to a third party. However, under this interpretation, because the anti-avoidance rule makes the disposal of land taxable under one of the main land sales rule, the vendor is entitled to the exclusions from the land sales rules (for example, the residential home exclusion). This outcome is not intended and the proposed amendment will ensure that this interpretation is not available. Associated persons’ relief rule The associated persons’ relief rule is intended to apply to a person who disposes of land if the disposal of land would be taxable because it was disposed of within 10 years of the person acquiring the land. Typically, the associated persons’ relief rule is relevant to a vendor who disposes of land within 10 years of acquiring it from an associated person and any of the following apply: • The associated person is a builder, or a land dealer or a land developer. • The value of the land has increased during vendor’s actual period of ownership because of land zoning changes. • Within the vendor’s actual period of ownership, a scheme of development or subdivision has been carried out on that land. In counting the 10-year period for the purpose of the associated persons’ relief rule, the proposed amendment will permit the vendor of land to combine their actual period of ownership of the land with the actual period of ownership of the associated person from whom they acquired the land. The intent is that the disposal would not be taxed if this combined period of ownership was 10 years or more. One interpretation is that the associated person’s relief rule can be applied to a series of sequential transfers of land between associated persons (a circle of association). This interpretation results in the 10-year period being determined from the first date the land was acquired within that circle of association. This interpretation is inconsistent with the policy intent and can result in under-taxation. The proposed amendment clarifies that the relief rule applies only to a combined ownership period of the vendor and the associated person from whom the vendor acquired the land. 151 CALCULATION OF AVERAGE TAX RATE FOR AN EXTRA PAY (Clause 199) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment corrects an unintended legislative change in section RD 17 that potentially results in too much PAYE being withheld from an extra pay. Application date The proposed amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Key features The calculation of PAYE to be withheld from an extra pay (for example, a performance bonus) is determined by a calculation of an average rate of tax on an annualised amount of PAYE income payments based on: • the amount of the extra pay; and • all regular wages and salaries paid in the four weeks prior to the date of the extra pay. This annualised calculation is not intended to take into account any other amounts of extra pay that may have been made in that four week period. The rewrite of this provision into the Income Tax Act 2007 inadvertently includes all previous amounts of extra pay within that four week period when calculating the annualised amount. This inadvertent drafting change could result in too much PAYE being withheld. The proposed amendment restores the intended effect and confirms current practice. 152 PRE-CONSOLIDATION IMPUTATION CREDITS (Clause 186) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment provides a savings provision for tax positions relating to: • the transfer of a pre-consolidation imputation credit from an individual company’s imputation credit account (ICA) to the ICA of a consolidated imputation group; and • the law as it was prior to amendments made to section OP 22 (use of pre- consolidation imputation credits) of the Income Tax Act 2007 by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 (the EII Act). Application date The amendment proposes a savings provision for tax positions taken for the transfer of pre-consolidation imputation credits for tax years beginning before 29 March 2018 (the date of enactment of the EII Act). Key features The proposed savings provision relates to amendments made to section OP 22 by the EII Act (retrospective to the beginning of the 2008–09 income year) that: • confirm the Commissioner’s application of section OP 22; • correct a minor unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of the provision; and • ensure the law works as intended. The proposed savings provision applies if a pre-consolidation imputation credit is transferred to a group ICA prior to 29 March 2018 in excess of the amount that is allowed under the amended section OP 22. The amount of the transferred pre- conso lidation credit must meet all o f the fo llowing requirements: • the group ICA has a debit entry in a tax year; • the amount of the pre-consolidation imputation credits transferred to the group ICA is limited to the amount of that debit entry to the group ICA; and • shareholding continuity is satisfied for the pre-consolidation imputation credits transferred up to the time of the transfer. 153 If the amount transferred exceeds the limit on the amount being transferred, the excess amount is treated as not being transferred to the group ICA (that is, the debit and credit entries would need to be retrospectively adjusted to achieve the correct outcome). A transitional rule is proposed which will provide: • retrospective debit and credit adjustments are to be aggregated and combined with the closing balance of the group ICA at 31 March 2018; • further income tax that becomes payable as a result of these retrospective adjustments will have a due date 60 days after the enactment of the bill; and • imputation penalty tax will not be imposed on this amount of further income tax. If payment of the further income tax is not made by the due date, normal late payment rules will apply. Detailed analysis Amendments to section OP 22 in the EII Act: • corrects an unintended legislative change in the rewrite of the section; • ensures the law works as intended; and • applies retrospectively to the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The amendments to section OP 22 in the EII Act confirmed that pre-consolidation imputation credits may only be transferred to a group ICA if the group ICA does not have sufficient imputation credits to offset an imputation debit to the group ICA and shareholding continuity was satisfied for the transferred credits (example 18). This outcome is consistent with the policy for the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No. 1 February 2004, pages 56–57. “As with the original consolidation provisions, the existing pre- consolidation balances of the members’ balance of the members individual ICAs are not transferred to the imputation group’s consolidated imputation credit account but remain separate until such time as the ICA of the consolidated imputation group has a debit to its ICA which it cannot offset by an existing credit in the group ICA.” “... subject to shareholder continuity being maintained, a credit may be transferred from a member’s individual imputation credit account to the ... group ICA, to the extent of the ICA’s debit balance.” 154 Example 18: Policy intent for the use of pre-consolidation imputation credits Date Group ICA Member Company Company B 7 September 2014 (credit carried forward to 1 April 2015 and 1 April 2016 under amended section OA 7(1)) 70,000 7 April 2015 (credit carried forward to 1 April 2016 under section OA 7(1)) 10,000 7 September 2016 (imputation credit attached to dividend paid by Company A) (50,000) 7 September 2016 (transfer from Company B) 40,000 (40,000) 31 March 2017 (calculated balance) 0 30,000 Prior to the EII Act amendments to section OP 22, some taxpayers argued, based on comments made in a 1992 business discussion document about the use of pre- consolidation imputation credits, that: • pre-consolidation credits could be transferred to the group ICA if a debit entry had been made to the group ICA during a tax year, even if the group ICA had imputation credits made in the same tax year prior to that debit. The amount of the transfer would be limited to the debit entry to the group ICA (see example 19); and • in some cases, the argument was that the amount of the transfer of pre- consolidation credits was not limited to the amount of the debit to the group ICA (see example 20). Example 19: Tax position advocated by taxpayers to transfer pre-consolidation imputation credits to the extent to which a debit is made to the group ICA Date Group ICA Member Company Company B 7 September 2014 (credit carried forward to 1 April 2015 and 1 April 2016 under section OA 7(1)) 70,000 7 April 2015 (credit carried forward to 1 April 2016 under section OA 7(1)) 10,000 7 September 2016 (dividend paid by Company A) (50,000) 7 September 2016 (transfer from Company B) 50,000 (50,000) 31 March 2017 (calculated balance) 10,000 20,000 155 Example 20: Tax position advocated by some taxpayers (full amount of pre-consolidation credit is transferred to the group ICA) Date Group ICA Member Company Company B 7 September 2014 (credit carried forward to 1 April 2015 and 1 April 2016 under section OA 7(1)) 70,000 7 April 2015 (credit carried forward to 1 April 2016 under section OA 7(1)) 10,000 7 September 2016 (dividend paid by Company A) (50,000) 7 September 2016 (transfer from Company B) 70,000 (70,000) 31 March 2017 (calculated balance) 30,000 0 Savings provision proposed The savings provision proposed is to protect tax positions taken by taxpayers that are consistent with example 19. For tax positions that reflect the outcome in example 20, past debits and credits will be adjusted to reflect the approach taken in example 19. The retrospective adjustments to debits and credits are to be aggregated and treated as being combined with the ICA balance at 31 March 2018. If an amount of further income tax becomes payable because of these retrospective adjustments: • the due date for payment of the further income tax is 60 days after enactment of the Bill; and • imputation penalty tax is not imposed on this increased amount of further income tax. 156 DEFINITIONS OF SETTLOR AND SETTLEMENT (Clause 161(1), (2) and (5)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments: • correct an unintended legislative change arising in the rewrite of the trust rules relating to services provided to the trust for less than market value; and • clarifies that incidental services provided by a trustee (such as bookkeeping and trustee services) for less than market value are not a transfer of value, which aligns the general meaning of settlement with current practice. Application date The proposed amendment for the unintended legislative change will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. The amendment to the meaning of settlement and transfer of value for incidental services provided for less than market value is proposed to apply from the date of enactment. Key features Rewrite amendment The rewrite of the trust rules rationalised a number of provisions relating to definitions of “settlor” and “settlement”, into the definition of “transfer of value”. A transfer of value, in relation to a settlement on a trust, is defined generally as a transfer of money (or money’s worth) to or for the benefit of a trust, without adequate consideration being given in return from the trust. In addition, other transactions are specifically included in the definition of settlor and settlement as they do not represent a transfer of value under ordinary principles. For example, a person who provides an “on demand” loan to a trust is treated as a settlor if the right to demand payment is either deferred, or not exercised. However, under ordinary principles, a transfer of value-for-money’s worth normally requires the amount transferred to the trust to be convertible into money. For example, the gifting of property to a trust is a transfer of value to the trust because, under ordinary principles, the property is readily convertible into money. However, the provision of services to, or for the benefit of, a trust for less than market value is not an amount that is readily convertible into money. Therefore services provided at less than market value do not come within the definition of transfer of value and would not be a settlement under the Income Tax Act 2007. 157 In contrast, the value of these services for less than market value was specifically treated as a settlement in the Income Tax Act 2004. The proposed amendment restores the position of the Income Tax Act 2004 into the rewritten provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. Incidental services provided to a trust The minor beneficiary rules, which apply to tax trustees at 33% on income distributed to minor beneficiaries, recognise that incidental services such as bookkeeping and trustee services provided to the trust should not be counted as settlements. The purpose of that exclusion is to simplify compliance. However, as a result of the proposed rewrite amendment, such incidental services will be counted as settlements under the more general meaning of settlement. On analysis this results in different rules relating to a settlement on a trust applying depending on whether the trust has minor beneficiaries. Aligning the two rules is more consistent with current practice. The proposed amendment ensures that the incidental services provided to trusts (such as bookkeeping and trustee services) will not be treated as a transfer of value on a prospective basis. 158 MAINTENANCE AMENDMENTS (Clauses as per the table) Summary of proposed amendments The following proposed amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of income tax legislation and subsequent changes.

It does so by amending the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The Government’s goal is to increase the amount of business R&D undertaken in New Zealand. It has set a target of raising the amount of R&D undertaken in New Zealand to two percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2028. By providing a tax incentive in the form of a tax credit, the Government will lower the cost to businesses of performing R&D. This will create an incentive for firms already performing R&D to do more, and for other firms to start undertaking R&D. The rationale for providing R&D tax credits to businesses is that there is under- investment by businesses in R&D because the investing firm does not capture all the benefits of the investment. The wider societal benefits of knowledge created through business R&D tends to be distributed widely rather than staying with the firm. The Government considers the wider benefits to New Zealand when businesses invest in R&D warrant the provision of a subsidy. A tax credit has been selected as the instrument for providing the subsidy because of the wide reach of the tax system. The tax system also provides certainty because firms are able to access support based on predefined rules. The Bill sets out the conditions which need to be satisfied for a firm to receive an R&D tax credit. The corollary of providing an incentive for R&D is ensuring that firms that are not performing R&D do not receive R&D tax credits. The Bill therefore establishes boundaries around categories of expenditure so that routine business as usual expenditure does not qualify for the R&D tax credits. The Bill also introduces the ability for the Government to set rules by Order in Council, to ensure business as usual expenditure does not qualify. A discussion document on the proposed policy was released in April 2018. Submissions on that document have influenced the policy. The Government has also been guided by the New Zealand experience of an R&D tax credit in 2008–09 (2008 regime), changes in the business environment since then, and how such schemes operate in other countries. The Government will monitor operation of the R&D tax credit regime and adjust it to ensure it continues to meet the policy intent. For more detail on the policy underpinning the Bill, see the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s website, 1 which has links to various policy documents. This includes briefing documents and submissions on the discussion document.

For the core components of the policy and how they operate see the flow charts in appendix 2. Application dates The credit will apply from the 2019–20 income year. The in-year approval requirements of the Bill apply from the 2020–21 income year. Summary of key features Eligibility There are various tests that must be satisfied before a person can receive an R&D tax credit. The tests cover:  the person who is claiming the credit;  the type of activity that qualifies as eligible R&D; and  the type of expenditure that qualifies as eligible R&D expenditure. Defining an eligible person The Bill proposes requirements for who is eligible for an R&D tax credit. The key requirements are that a person:  performs a core research and development activity (“core activity”) in New Zealand, or a contractor performs a core activity on their behalf;  carries on a business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; and  has R&D controlling rights over their research and development activities (“R&D activities”). It is also proposed that the person must satisfy one of the following to be eligible:  the person owns the results of their R&D activities;  the person is able to use the results of their R&D activities for no further consideration; or  a company in the person’s corporate group owns the results of the person’s R&D activities, and the company is resident in a jurisdiction with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. 5 Defining R&D activity There must be a core activity for an R&D activity to be eligible. A core activity is an activity that:  is conducted using a systematic approach;  has the purpose of creating something new; and  has the purpose of resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. An activity that is not a core activity will only be eligible if it is in support of a core activity. Some activities are explicitly excluded from being core or supporting activities. Defining eligible research and development expenditure Eligible research and development expenditure (eligible expenditure) is expenditure incurred on an R&D activity, and includes things like employee salaries, expenditure on consumables used in an R&D process, and depreciation loss for assets used in R&D. A person may claim an R&D tax credit where they contract another party to undertake R&D on their behalf. Ineligible expenditure must be removed from the contracted amount. Also, the remaining total is reduced by twenty percent. Where R&D is performed on contract, only the party (that is, the principal) paying for the work may claim the credit. Primarily, R&D tax credits are only available for expenditure on R&D that occurs in New Zealand. Nevertheless, up to ten percent of an R&D claim can be for eligible expenditure incurred on R&D activities that are performed outside New Zealand. Where expenditure is incurred on an R&D activity performed in the course of commercial production, a person’s claim is limited to the additional expenditure incurred because of that R&D activity. Calculating R&D tax credits The R&D tax credit regime operates with a minimum threshold and an expenditure cap. In general, to be eligible for R&D tax credits, the Bill stipulates that a person must have at least $50,000 of eligible expenditure in a given income year. The maximum expenditure that is eligible for R&D tax credits is $120 million, unless a person has obtained the Commissioner’s approval to exceed the cap. The R&D tax credits a person receives are equal to 15% of their eligible expenditure. Orders in Council The Bill adds two schedules to the ITA. The first is a schedule of activities that are ineligible for the R&D tax credit regime. The second is a schedule of categories of eligible and ineligible expenditure. 6 To ensure these schedules remain current as the type of R&D performed by businesses changes over time, and to close off problem areas that could impact on the fiscal sustainability of the R&D tax credit regime, the Bill allows the Governor- General, by Order in Council made on the joint recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation, to amend the schedules. Evaluation The Bill requires the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation to commission a review of the R&D tax credit regime every five years to evaluate the regime in terms of the delivery of the policy intent, the compliance costs, and the administration of the regime. Communication by Inland Revenue to other government departments and agencies The Bill allows for Inland Revenue to communicate information to relevant people within specific state sector agencies so that they can evaluate, administer, report on, and develop policy for the R&D tax credit regime. In-year approval Starting from the 2020–21 income year, persons wanting to receive a tax credit will be required to seek approval that their R&D activities meet certain criteria in the year they are undertaking or contracting for the R&D activities. If granted, this approval will be binding on the Commissioner. A person who expects to spend more than $2 million on R&D activities, or is part of a group of companies that expects to spend more than $2 million on R&D activities in a given year, can opt out of the general approval process. A person who opts out of the general approval process must notify the Commissioner of their intention to opt out, and is required to submit an R&D certificate alongside their R&D supplementary return. Refunding R&D tax credits When a person has more R&D tax credits than their income tax liability, their R&D tax credits are refunded up to a maximum of $255,000, provided the person meets certain criteria. R&D tax credits that are not refunded are carried forward, subject to the same continuity rules as apply to losses in the ITA. The criteria that define eligibility for refunds have been taken from the R&D tax loss cash out regime (in subpart MX of the Income Tax Act 2007). Apart from this linkage, in the first year the R&D tax credit regime and this scheme will operate separately. The Government is committed to further work examining the policy on refunds and harmonisation of the two regimes, with potential changes effective from 1 April 2020. 7 Eligibility 8 9 ELIGIBLE PERSONS Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 3) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that people must satisfy certain general criteria to be eligible for R&D tax credits. Certain persons are excluded from the R&D tax credit regime. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features General eligibility criteria Proposed new section LY 3 provides the general criteria that a person must satisfy to be eligible for R&D tax credits. These criteria are in addition to the requirements that a person’s activities must be R&D activities (see proposed new section LY 2) and their expenditure must be eligible (see proposed new sections LY 4, 5, 6, and 7). The general criteria in section LY 3(1) require a person to:  perform a core activity in New Zealand, either themselves or through an R&D contractor;  carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand; and  have R&D controlling rights in relation to their core activity. In addition, the person, or a member of the person’s corporate group that is situated in a jurisdiction with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA), must own the results of the person’s R&D activities. If the person (or a member of their corporate group) does not own the results of the person’s R&D activities, then the general criteria are nevertheless satisfied provided the person has the right to use the results of their R&D activities for no further consideration. Eligible persons All types of New Zealand businesses are eligible, whether they are incorporated or not. This includes individuals, companies, partnerships, charities, levy bodies, and trusts. For partnerships and look-through companies (LTCs), sections HB 1 and HG 2 (the transparency provisions) apply unless otherwise specified. 10 Ineligible persons Excluded entities A person is excluded from the R&D tax credit regime if:  they receive a Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant (Growth Grant) for the relevant income year;  they are an R&D contractor in relation to the relevant R&D activity;  they are, or are associated with or controlled by, a Crown research institute, district health board or tertiary education organisation; or  they are a partner in a partnership or an owner of an LTC, and they are not a New Zealand tax resident for the relevant income year. Failure to file causing ineligibility A person is ineligible for R&D tax credits for an income year if they fail to file an income tax return within one year of the latest date for them to file their income tax return. Background General eligibility criteria Core activity performed by an R&D contractor A person is eligible even if their core activity is performed by an R&D contractor, because the person is funding and directing the R&D activities. Also, in the absence of the person contracting their core activity to the R&D contractor, it is unlikely that the R&D contractor would have performed the core activity. Carry on a business and have a fixed establishment in New Zealand R&D tax credits are intended to be offset against the income tax liability of persons making claims. To ensure R&D tax credits are only provided to persons with some presence in New Zealand, a person is required to carry on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand to be eligible for the R&D tax credit regime. R&D controlling rights The R&D controlling rights requirement is intended to ensure that R&D contractors are not able to claim for R&D activities they are being contracted by another person to perform. It is expected that only principals will have R&D controlling rights. 11 Ownership of the R&D results Similar to the R&D controlling rights requirement, the ownership and right to use requirements are intended to ensure that R&D contractors are excluded from the R&D tax credit regime to the extent they perform R&D activities for other people. Where the ownership requirements are not met, the right to use requirement ensures a person is able to nevertheless access the results of their R&D for no further consideration at a future date. It is envisaged that people will, for the most part, satisfy the ownership requirements. It is expected that most people will either own the results of their R&D themselves or the results will be owned by someone in their corporate group that is located in a jurisdiction with which New Zealand has a DTA. The right to use and ownership requirements are similar to the requirements of the 2008 regime. The requirements in proposed new LY 3(1) are more inclusive than 2008. This is to ensure that R&D performed by a person that leads to results owned by someone else in the person’s corporate group is nevertheless eligible for the R&D tax credit regime. No explicit risk requirement There is no explicit requirement for a person to bear the financial risk associated with their R&D activities. This means that R&D activities undertaken by a New Zealand subsidiary at the request of, and on a fee for service basis for, its foreign parent will be eligible. Ineligible persons Filing deadline R&D supplementary returns are due within 30 days of the usual date prescribed by section 37 of TAA for income tax returns. A person may not apply for R&D tax credits if they have not filed an income tax return for the relevant income year (containing their R&D tax credit claim) within one year after the latest date for them to file their income tax return. As a result, where a person files their return late, it may only be up to a year late if the person wishes to claim an R&D tax incentive. The rationale for this rule is to reduce taxpayers’ ability to retrospectively reclassify expenditure. See the section on Deadlines for filing and amending assessments (page 91) for more information. Growth Grants A person who receives a Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant for the whole, or a part, of an income year is not eligible for the R&D tax credit regime for that year. This is a broad exclusion and even applies to R&D expenditure for which the person hasn’t received a Growth Grant. The R&D tax credit regime serves as a replacement to the Growth Grant regime. For administrative and compliance reasons, firms currently receiving a Growth Grant must choose which scheme they operate under. For more 12 information about transition from the Growth Grant regime, see Callaghan Innovation’s website. 2 R&D contractors A person who is an R&D contractor, and is paid to perform an R&D activity on behalf of another person, is ineligible for R&D tax credits in relation to that activity. The intent is that only principals receive the credit. Principals decide whether to invest in R&D activities, so it is appropriate for principals to receive R&D tax credits to recognise their investment in R&D and to incentivise further R&D. An R&D contractor may be eligible if they are acting in a different capacity. For example, if a person contracted to perform R&D was also doing some R&D that they were not contracted to perform, then they would not be an R&D contractor in relation to that second activity and may be eligible to receive an R&D tax credit as a principal. Certain Crown entities and their associates Crown research institutes (CRIs), district health boards (DHBs) and tertiary education organisations (TEO), their associates and entities controlled by them are not eligible for R&D tax credits. The R&D tax credit regime is designed to target private sector business R&D. The Government has more effective and appropriate ways to increase the amount of R&D that CRIs, DHBs, and TEOs undertake. The policy to exclude CRIs, TEOs, and DHBs from the R&D tax credit regime would be ineffective if associates of these entities were not excluded. While these entities are excluded, they are able to nevertheless perform R&D for other people as R&D contractors. It is expected that some of excluded entities will apply to be approved research providers. See the section on Approved research providers (page 65) for more information. Non-resident partners and non-resident owners of LTCs A person who is a partner in a partnership, or an owner of an LTC, must be a tax resident for the relevant income year to claim an R&D tax credit for that year. This is to ensure that only people with sufficient presence in New Zealand receive R&D tax credits. Detailed analysis General eligibility criteria Carry on a business in New Zealand To be eligible, a person must carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. This requires their activities to be a profession, trade, manufacturing, or undertaking and they must have an intention to make a pecuniary profit. Charities and levy bodies, which are referred to as “non-business researchers” 2 https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/news-and-events/rd-tax-incentive-final-design-announced 13 in the Bill, are treated as carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. It is important to note that this requirement does not require a person’s R&D to relate to their New Zealand business. It is sufficient if the person carries on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment. This is different from the 2008 rules, which required a person’s R&D to relate to their New Zealand business. Example 1: R&D does not relate to existing New Zealand business PONZ Ltd is a New Zealand-based company with clothing manufacturing facilities in Hamilton. It has been asked by its Australian parent company, which owns other companies that sell parachutes, to branch out into making parachutes. PONZ Ltd needs to do some R&D before producing parachutes because it needs to ensure its parachutes have an “edge” to distinguish them from other parachutes already on the market. PONZ Ltd satisfies the “in business” and fixed establishment requirements in proposed new section LY 3. It does not matter that PONZ Ltd’s R&D does not relate to its existing clothing manufacturing business. R&D controlling rights R&D controlling rights include the sole right to start, stop, or change the direction of a core activity. They also include the sole right to choose whether results are followed up on. 14 R&D ACTIVITIES Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 2), 21(6), 21(14) and 21(16) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that R&D activity is defined to mean core activities and supporting activities. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 2 defines an R&D activity to include core activities and supporting activities. Core activity Proposed new section LY 2(1) defines a core activity as an activity that is: (a) conducted using a systematic approach; (b) has a material purpose of creating new knowledge, or new or improved, processes, services, or goods; (c) has a material purpose of resolving scientific or technological uncertainty; and (d) has its day to day management conducted in New Zealand. An activity is excluded if the knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty in (c) is:  publicly available; or  deducible by a competent professional in the relevant scientific or technological field. Activities performed outside New Zealand cannot be core activities. There is also a schedule of activities that cannot be core activities. For more information see schedule 21, part A, and the section on Excluded activities (page 19). Supporting activity An activity is a supporting activity (proposed new section LY 2(3)) if it is only or mainly for the purpose of, required for, and integral to, a core activity. Activities listed in schedule 21, part B are excluded from being supporting activities. 15 Background Core activity The core activity definition is expected to apply to a wide range of R&D activities in a variety of industries, and is not limited to basic research. It draws on elements of the R&D core and supporting activity definitions from comparable jurisdictions, the OECD’s Frascati manual, the definition from the 2008 regime, and Callaghan Innovation’s experience with its R&D grants regime. Requiring the use of a systematic approach instead of a scientific method The proposed core activity definition is broader than the 2008 definition. This is to address concerns that many New Zealand businesses conducting R&D do not follow traditional scientific methods. Requiring the use of a systematic approach recognises the different methods used by these businesses while still requiring a planned, logical approach to R&D. Reference to “advance science or technology” removed The 2008 core activity definition required “an advance in science or technology by resolving scientific or technological uncertainty”. The proposed core activity definition does not explicitly require an advance in science or technology, but does imply an advance through the inclusion of limbs (b) and (c). The requirement for (b) contemplates an intended advance, because people are required to undertake an activity for a material purpose of creating:  new knowledge; or  new or improved processes, goods or services. The requirement for (c) also contemplates an intended advance, because it requires an activity to have a material purpose of resolving scientific or technological uncertainty. If an activity resolves uncertainty, it must also by implication advance science or technology. New requirements: performed in New Zealand and day to day management in New Zealand An R&D activity’s day to day management must be conducted in New Zealand. This is consistent with the requirement that core activities must be performed in New Zealand. Supporting activity The supporting activity definition ensures a very high level of connection between a person’s core and supporting activities. 16 Detailed analysis Core activity Systematic approach (limb (a)) A person will need to demonstrate that their R&D process followed a planned, logical progression of work. A systematic approach includes scientific methods, so may involve hypothesis, experiment, observation and evaluation. An agile approach to R&D (such as the approach used in some software R&D) may also be considered a systematic approach, provided the R&D activity is planned, occurs logically, and tests whether a proposed solution (or solutions) resolves what is scientifically or technologically unknown. Prototyping, and the type of planned and logical testing that occurs in a test kitchen or similar environment, may also be sufficiently systematic to meet the requirements for a systematic approach. The requirement for a systematic approach will, however, exclude anything discovered or produced as a result of random trial and error. Creating new things (limb (b)) To qualify as core activities, R&D activities must be undertaken for a material purpose of creating new knowledge or creating new or improved processes, goods or services. The material purpose test means that the R&D need not be successful to qualify for the credit. To establish whether something is new, it should be compared with what is already available in the public arena on a reasonably accessible worldwide basis at the time in the relevant field. A person may satisfy this requirement where another firm is undertaking the same R&D simultaneously but independently. An R&D activity may also satisfy this requirement where another firm has already created the new knowledge but has kept it secret, and the person is undertaking the R&D to create equivalent knowledge. Improvements to existing products or processes may qualify as R&D. In addition to improving a product or process, the core activity definition requires a claimant to have a purpose of resolving scientific or technological uncertainty, so any improvements must go beyond routine maintenance to be eligible as core activities. Scientific or technological uncertainty (limb (c)) Scientific or technological uncertainty exists when a competent professional who has access to the publically available information on a topic does not know whether something is possible. The uncertainty can relate to whether something is possible or achievable at all, or whether something is achievable within constraints such as cost. If a competent professional can deduce an answer or can identify an approach to take in advance, without a systematic process of testing, analysis or prototyping, there is no technological or scientific uncertainty. 17 A competent professional:  is knowledgeable about the relevant field;  possesses the relevant qualifications and/or experience to participate in the relevant field with a reasonable level of skill;  is aware of the current state of knowledge in the field; and  has access to publicly available knowledge from around the world such as the internet, relevant industry journals, and to other professionals. The requirement to resolve uncertainty also assists in defining the extent of the R&D activity. As a general rule, the R&D activity will finish once the uncertainty has been resolved. The test is an objective test on a worldwide basis. It is not enough that the business does not have the knowledge or that no one in New Zealand has yet done what the business is trying to do. Day to day management in New Zealand (limb (d)) and activity performed in New Zealand A person must have a fixed establishment in New Zealand and must manage their R&D activities from New Zealand. Day to day management is separate from the R&D controlling rights specified in proposed new section LY 3(1)(c)(i) to (iv). Day to day management is intended to encompass smaller decisions that the person must make to perform their R&D activities effectively. R&D controlling rights refer to more substantive decisions, such as the right to start or stop an activity, or change its direction. A person satisfies this requirement if, for example, they are deciding how their R&D activity is carried out in their New Zealand based factory. Limb (d) aims to ensure that an activity that qualifies as a core activity is actually carried out in New Zealand and, in conjunction with proposed new section LY 2(1)(c), means that R&D activities carried out overseas cannot qualify as core R&D activities. Supporting activities Supporting activities are activities that are only or mainly for the purpose of, required for, and integral to a core activity. If “supporting” activities are not in support of a core activity, they are not eligible R&D activities for the R&D tax credit regime.  Mainly requires that at least seventy five percent of a supporting activity is for the purpose of, required for, and integral to, a core activity.  Required for means a supporting activity must be only to the degree necessary to support a core activity. For instance, once a core activity is complete, other activities will not be supporting activities because scientific or technological uncertainty has been resolved.  Integral to means that a supporting activity must be essential to a core activity. That is, the core activity could not be performed or completed without the supporting activity. 18 An activity that is conducted overseas cannot be a core activity, but may be eligible as a supporting activity if it satisfies the supporting activity definition. Indirect activities, such as cleaning and administrative activities, may be eligible as supporting activities. Examples of supporting activities include:  mathematical analysis or modelling used to analyse the results of experiments;  development of specialised software to assist in the design of the experiments;  planning core activities, developing hypotheses, defining technological objectives, and planning trials; and  constructing prototypes for use in testing. 19 EXCLUDED ACTIVITIES Clause 22 (proposed new schedule 21, part A and part B) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that certain activities are expressly excluded from the R&D core and supporting activity definitions. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new schedule 21 excludes certain activities from the core and supporting activity definitions. Part A provides for exclusions from the core activity definition and part B provides exclusions from the supporting activity definition. The table summarises the exclusions and whether they apply to core and supporting activities. # Activity exclusion Core Supporting 1. Preproduction activities, including demonstration of commercial viability and tooling up. Excluded 2. Routine de-bugging of existing computer software. Excluded 3. Supporting or making minor improvements to existing computer software, using known methods. Excluded 4. Routine software and computer maintenance. Excluded 5. Prospecting for, exploring for, or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy. Excluded 6. Market research and market testing. Excluded Included 7. Market development or sales promotion, including consumer surveys. Excluded 8. Commercial, legal, or administrative aspects of patenting, licensing, or other similar activities. Excluded 9. Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards for existing processes, services, or goods. Excluded 10. Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards for new processes, services, or goods. Excluded Included 11. Management studies. Excluded 12. Activities relating to organisational design. Excluded 13. Internal software development relating to ordinary administrative functions of a business. Excluded 20 # Activity exclusion Core Supporting 14. Research in social sciences, arts, or humanities. Excluded Included 15. Quality control or routine testing of processes, services, or goods. Excluded Included 16. Routine collection of information. Excluded Included 17. Minor adaption of, or improvement to, existing processes, services, or goods. Excluded Included 18. Testing. Excluded Included 19. Converting existing systems to new software platforms. Excluded Included 20. Making cosmetic or stylistic chances to processes, services or goods. Excluded Included 21. Reproduction or a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications, or publicly available information. Excluded Included 22. Carrying out routine operations on data, including presentation of data. Excluded Included 23. An activity that hasn’t been approved by the Commissioner under section 68CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Excluded Not applicable Background Certain activities are routinely excluded from R&D tax incentives. An activity may be excluded from an R&D tax credit regime for a number of reasons, including:  To clarify that the activity does not amount to R&D because the knowledge required to resolve the uncertainty the activity is seeking to resolve is publicly available or deducible by a competent professional.  To clarify that the activity does not amount to R&D because it occurs before any scientific or technological uncertainty is identified, or after any uncertainty has been resolved.  There are inadequate spill over benefits.  The fiscal cost associated with the activity is too high.  The Government may not want to incentivise the activity through an R&D tax credit regime.  Incentives other than an R&D tax credit regime may be better suited to supporting the activity. Comparison with 2008 core activity exclusions The following items have been added to the core activity exclusions list since 2008:  routine debugging of existing computer software; 21  supporting or making minor improvements to existing computer software, using known methods;  routine software and computer maintenance;  activities relating to organisational design;  internal software development relating to ordinary administrative functions of a business;  minor adaption of, or improvement to, existing processes, services, or goods;  bug, beta, system requirements, user acceptance and data integrity testing;  data mapping and data migration testing;  testing or comparing the efficiency of algorithms that are already known to work;  testing security protocols or arrangements;  converting existing systems to new software platforms;  carrying out routine operations on data, including presentation of data; and  an activity that has not been approved by the Commissioner under section 68CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (if a person is required to obtain general approval). The list of excluded core activities demonstrates the greater prevalence of software- related activities compared with the situation in 2008. The core activity definition has been amended to more explicitly incorporate software activities, but in turn the exclusions clarify what is not R&D. New supporting activity exclusions The 2008 excluded activity list only applied to core activities. Proposed new schedule 21 also contains a list of supporting activity exclusions. Excluding activities from the supporting activity definition provides clarity on which activities are ineligible for the R&D tax credit regime, so is expected to reduce compliance and administrative costs. Detailed analysis Exclusions from both the core and supporting activity definitions Preproduction activities, including demonstration of commercial viability and tooling up (parts A and B, clause 1) Preproduction activities typically occur after R&D is complete but before a product is made publicly available. In general, they are not undertaken to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty, and are unlikely to satisfy the core or supporting activity definitions. They have been included in schedule 21 for clarity. 22 Examples of preproduction activities include:  demonstrating commercial viability;  tooling-up;  planning the production process;  developing control systems; and  undertaking start-up procedures. If a problem arises during preproduction activities that a competent professional working in the relevant field cannot resolve, a separate R&D activity might commence. Routine software and computer activities (parts A and B, clauses 2 to 4) Schedule 21 excludes:  routine debugging of existing computer software;  supporting or making minor improvements to existing computer software, using known methods; and  routine software and computer maintenance. These activities are considered business as usual activities, so are excluded from both the core and supporting activity definitions. A competent professional would be expected to resolve any uncertainty presented by these activities through the application of publicly available knowledge, including identifying in advance the approach to adopt, and/or by deductive reasoning. Mining activities (parts A and B, clause 5) Mining activities include prospecting, exploring, or drilling for:  minerals;  petroleum;  natural gas; or  geothermal energy. Prospecting, exploring, and drilling activities in and of themselves are unlikely to satisfy the core activity definition. “Looking for stuff” does not resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Therefore, the activities are excluded from both the core and supporting activity definitions. Market development or sales promotion, including consumer surveys (parts A and B, clause 6) Market development, sales promotion, and consumer surveys are excluded from the core and supporting activity definitions. They are undertaken to assist with commercial decision making and objectives rather than resolving scientific or 23 technological uncertainty. Such activities are likely to take place once an R&D project is complete, or is nearing completion. They may signal that scientific or technological uncertainty has come to an end. Note that market research and market testing have only been excluded from the core activity definition. They may be permitted as supporting activities. Commercial, legal, or administrative aspects of patenting, licensing, or other activities (parts A and B, clause 7) Patenting and licensing activities would not, even in the absence of the exclusion, qualify as core activities. They have a commercial or legal focus and do not seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards for pre- existing processes, services, or goods (parts A and B, clause 8) Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards for pre- existing processes, services, or goods do not qualify as core activities as they do not resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. These activities are also ineligible as support activities because they are not required to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards for new products are covered below. Management studies and activities relating to organisational design (parts A and B, clauses 9 and 10) Management studies and activities related to organisational design do not qualify as core activities. They are not the types of activities that the R&D tax credit regime is intended to incentivise. Even without this exclusion, many management studies would be excluded because their subject is the social sciences. Internal software development relating to ordinary administrative functions of a business (parts A and B, clause 11) This clause is covered in the section on Internal software development (page 27). Exclusions from the core R&D activity definition only Market research and market testing (part A, clause 6) Market research and market testing have been excluded from the core activity definition as they are undertaken to support commercial objectives. Market research and market testing may be eligible as support activities where they are used to check whether the scientific or technological objectives of an R&D project have been achieved. In the food industry, for example, consumer testing to determine the sensory properties of a product may be an eligible supporting R&D activity. 24 Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards (part A, clause 8) Activities involved in testing compliance with statutory requirements or standards do not qualify as a core activity as they do not resolve scientific or technological uncertainty. Activities to test compliance with the relevant standards for new processes, services or goods may be eligible as a support activity if compliance with the relevant standard is necessary to validate that the scientific or technological objectives of the R&D have been met. Research in social sciences, arts, or humanities (part A, clause 12) Research in social sciences, arts or humanities is excluded (research in social sciences) from the core activity definition but can qualify as a supporting activity. Most other jurisdictions exclude research in social sciences. The focus of the R&D tax credit regime is on scientific and technological R&D. Research in other areas is funded by other means. The exclusion covers areas such as economics, classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, history, religion, as well as visual and performing arts. Examples of activities excluded include psychological and sociological research, the study of the historical development of a language, the role of family in society, or writing a novel. A business developing a product for use in the arts or humanities may qualify despite the exclusion. For example:  If a business develops computer software for use in the film industry, in a process that satisfies the core activity definition, the software development may be eligible.  If a business develops and manufactures innovative ceramic glazes for use in the visual arts, the development may be eligible. Research in social sciences is excluded from being a core activity only. If, for example, research into human behaviour is required for product development that meets the test of a core activity, the research may be an eligible supporting activity. Quality control or routine testing of processes, services, or goods (clause 13) Quality control and routine testing of processes, services or goods are excluded as core activities because the activities do not resolve scientific or technological uncertainty in and of themselves. The development of new or improved quality control or testing methods may qualify as a core activity, however, provided the R&D activity satisfies the core activity definition. Quality control or routing testing can be eligible as supporting activities. For example, an eligible supporting activity might include checking that products in a trial run meet a certain level of quality, where a person’s core activity is the development of a new manufacturing process. 25 Routine collection of information (part A, clause 14) The routine collection of information in and of itself is not expected to satisfy the core activity definition but it is included in schedule 21 for clarity. Examples of excluded activities include the routine collection of data and information:  to monitor change from the application of routine engineering or routine technical procedures;  to provide a baseline against which to monitor naturally occurring change;  for the purpose of quality control or inventory control; and  to establish whether a product’s characteristics are within usual boundaries. Minor adaption of, or improvements to, existing processes, services, or goods (part A, clause 15) Minor changes or improvements to existing processes, services or goods are unlikely to satisfy the core activity definition so are included in schedule 21 for clarity. Testing (part A, clauses 16 to 19) Schedule 21 proposes to exclude various testing activities from the core activity definition:  bug, beta, system requirements, user acceptance, and data integrity testing;  data mapping and data migration testing;  testing or comparing the efficiency of algorithms that are already known to work; and  testing security protocols or arrangements. Testing itself is unlikely to satisfy the core activity definition. It does not seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty but identifies problems that need to be resolved. Testing is included in proposed new schedule 21 for clarity. Testing that is required to assess whether the scientific or technological uncertainty has been resolved may qualify as a supporting activity. Converting existing systems to new software platforms (part A, clause 20) Converting existing systems to new software platforms is included in proposed new schedule 21 for clarity. This activity is unlikely to satisfy the core activity definition and its spill-over benefits are likely to be minimal. Making cosmetic or stylistic changes to processes, services, or goods (part A, clause 21) This clause excludes changes which affect the appearance of something without changing its substance. Changes that are purely cosmetic or stylistic, such as changes to colour or pattern, are excluded from the core activity definition as they do not involve the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. Cosmetic changes 26 that resolve scientific or technological uncertainty may be eligible, for example, changing the colour of a piece of fruit. Reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications, or publicly available information (part A, clause 22) Reproducing or reverse engineering an existing product or process is not R&D. It is not creating any new knowledge, product or process. Carrying out routine operations on data, including presentation of data (part A, clause 23) Routine operations on data are unlikely to meet the core activity definition as they are able to be readily performed by a competent professional. This activity is included in proposed new schedule 21 for clarity. The presentation of data relates to human behaviour which is a social science and therefore excluded. Activities that have not been approved by the Commissioner (part A, clause 24) From 2020–21, the general approval and significant performer in-year approval regimes will come into force. The effect of these regimes is that a person’s activities will not be eligible as core activities unless:  the Commissioner has approved the person’s core activities under the general approval process (see proposed new section 68CB); or  the person has opted out of the general approval process and into the significant performer process, and complies with the requirements in proposed new section 68CC. See the section on Approval: general approval process (year two) (page 95) for more information. 27 INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT Clauses 21(10) and 22 (proposed new schedules 21 and 21B) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that expenditure on internal software development is subject to a $3 million cap. It also proposes that such expenditure is excluded altogether where it relates to the ordinary internal administrative functions of a business. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that:  Expenditure incurred on internal software development is not eligible for the R&D tax credit regime where it is undertaken for the purpose of using the resultant software to perform common internal business functions (such as payroll, HR or accounting).  Other internal software development expenditure (that is, software developed for in-house use) is only eligible up to a maximum of $3 million. Background The rationale for excluding or limiting claims for internal software development is the limited spill-over benefits and fiscal risk associated with internal software development activities. Limited spill-over benefits There is likely to be limited public benefit from internal software development related to the ordinary administrative functions of a business, such as a firm upgrading its internal HR system. This kind of upgrade is specific to the firm and is unlikely to reflect the circumstances that the policy recognises. It is recognised however that there may be some spill-over benefits from internal software development for non- standard business administration. As a result, it is an eligible activity, although is subject to a $3 million cap. Fiscal risk Projects to upgrade internal business processes can be very expensive in some industries. The Government is cautious about the fiscal consequences of including these activities within the scope of the R&D tax credit regime. This is a further reason 28 for the outright exclusion of standard administrative functions and the $3 million cap for non-standard administrative functions. Detailed analysis Ordinary administrative functions (schedule 21, part A, clause 11) Internal software development undertaken by a person for the purpose of the producing software for use in their business, or an associate’s, is ineligible if it relates to any of the following systems:  payroll;  accounting;  executive or management information;  human resources;  enterprise resource planning;  invoicing; or  inventory. $3 million cap (schedule 21B, part B, clause 17) A person is only able to claim up to $3 million of internal software development expenditure for the R&D tax credit regime. The cap groups the person’s expenditure with internal software development already claimed by the person’s associates. The rationale behind applying the cap to associated persons is to prevent the cap from being circumvented by the person splitting their expenditure across associates to effectively exceed the cap. For partnerships and look-through companies, the cap is applied at the partnership or look-through company level (rather than the partner or individual owner level). Example 2: Associated persons with internal software development expenditure SL Ltd incurs $2 million of internal software development expenditure and XW Ltd incurs $1.5 million. SL Ltd and XW Ltd are wholly owned by Nayana Ltd. As XW Ltd and SL Ltd are associated persons for tax purposes, their combined claim may not exceed $3 million. Definition of internal software development expenditure (YA 1) Internal software development expenditure is defined as expenditure incurred on developing software for the purpose of:  the internal administration of a person’s, or the person’s associate’s, business; or  providing services to customers, unless the main reason the customers use the services is to use the software or technology developed by the person. 29 Example 3: Internal software development expenditure subject to cap Mohammed runs a courier business and develops software that enables his customers to pinpoint the exact location and condition of their packages. This satisfies the definition of internal software development expenditure, because Mohammed’s customers are using his services to receive the goods he delivers, not to use the software Mohammed has developed. The expenditure Mohammed’s business incurred to develop the software is subject to the $3 million cap. Internal software development expenditure does not include expenditure incurred for the purpose of developing software if:  the person’s main purpose is to sell the software, or a right to use the software, to third parties; or  the software is an integral part of goods that the person sells. Example 4: Software development expenditure not subject to cap Jane runs a software business and develops software that she sells to Mohammed’s firm and other courier companies. The expenditure is not internal software development expenditure, so is not subject to the $3 million cap. 30 ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURE Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 5), 21(7) and 22 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that certain expenditure on R&D be eligible for R&D tax credits. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Eligible expenditure Proposed new section LY 5(1) defines eligible expenditure for the R&D tax credit regime. Eligible expenditure includes expenditure or loss described in proposed new schedule 21B, part A, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred on an R&D activity in the relevant income year. Schedule 21B, part A lists the categories of expenditure and loss that are eligible for R&D tax credits. See Eligible and ineligible expenditure: schedule 21B (page 39) for more information. Categories of expenditure or loss listed in schedule 21B, part B, are not eligible expenditure for the R&D tax credit regime. There are rules for expenditure incurred on R&D activities performed in the course of commercial production. In this case, expenditure on the activities is only eligible if it would not have been incurred in the absence of a person’s R&D activities. With respect to employees, the eligible amount is based on the employees’ contribution to the R&D activities. Contracted and foreign R&D Proposed new section LY 5(2) provides that the following amounts are only eligible to the extent provided by proposed new sections LY 6 and 7:  amounts paid by to R&D contractors; and  amounts incurred on foreign R&D, including amounts paid to non-residents for work or services performed in New Zealand. 31 Background Eligible expenditure Similar to the 2008 regime, proposed new schedule 21B lists categories of expenditure and loss and their eligibility for the R&D tax credit regime. Instead of providing nexus and apportionment rules in the schedules, a “to the extent” test is provided in section LY 5(1)(a), which applies to expenditure on all R&D activities except those performed in a commercial production environment. An alternate apportionment rule applies to expenditure incurred on R&D activities performed in the course of commercial production. This rule is necessary to prevent business as usual expenditure being recharacterised as R&D expenditure. The rule does not apply to employee expenditure incurred on R&D activities performed in the course of commercial production. A person can apportion expenditure on employees who perform both business as usual and R&D functions. Example 5: R&D performed by jelly manufacturer Jellatine Ltd has a factory in East Tamaki, where it produces a variety of food products that contain gelatine. It has been working on a new type of jelly injected with protein, vitamins, and minerals. The aim is to make this new jelly temperature resistant, so that it is able to stay gelatinous despite extreme heat or cold. Jellatine Ltd hopes that its new range of temperature impervious jellies will be attractive to participants in extreme endurance sports and long distance runners. After completing initial R&D on the new jelly, Jellatine Ltd decides to start trial-runs in its factory to determine whether the new range of jellies can be mass produced on its usual production line. Every Saturday for two months, its entire factory (which is normally closed on weekends) is used to produce the newly developed jelly. For the two months in which R&D takes place in Jellatine Ltd’s factory, the overheads and consumable costs of the factory increase by twenty percent. The test jelly is disposed of at the end of each day, because it hasn’t undergone sufficient testing to be sold for human consumption. Jellatine Ltd pays its staff extra to come in on the weekend. Jellatine Ltd purchases a building nearby, where it installs a heavy duty air-conditioning unit to test the new jelly’s responsiveness to temperature fluctuations (“temperature simulator”). The temperature simulator is used solely for R&D activities. Two employees who would normally be responsible for monitoring the quality of all factory outputs for commercial sale are tasked with also monitoring the new jelly in the temperature simulator. Jellatine Ltd’s eligible expenditure, after it starts trial runs in its factory and acquires the temperature simulator, is made up of:  The extra twenty percent of expenditure incurred for consumables and factory overhead costs, because these costs would not have been incurred in the absence of the Jellatine Ltd’s R&D activities.  Expenditure on the staff who come in each Saturday when R&D is performed in Jellatine Ltd’s factory.  Expenditure on Jellatine Ltd’s staff who monitor the jelly in the temperature simulator, to the extent to which the staff are monitoring the new jelly rather than carrying out their usual duties in relation to Jellatine Ltd’s business as usual activities.  Expenditure on services and non-depreciable property incurred in relation to the temperature simulator, and its depreciation loss on the depreciable property that makes up the temperature simulator, because the temperature simulator is used solely for Jellatine Ltd’s R&D activities. 32 Contracted and foreign R&D See the sections on Contracted expenditure (page 33) and Foreign expenditure (page 35) for more information on expenditure and losses incurred for R&D contractors and foreign R&D. 33 CONTRACTED EXPENDITURE Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 6) and 21(15) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes a formula for calculating eligible expenditure where a person pays an R&D contractor to perform R&D activities on their behalf (“contracted expenditure”). Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 6 sets out the formula for calculating a person’s eligible expenditure where the person (the principal) contracts another person (the R&D contractor) to perform R&D activities on their behalf. The contracted expenditure formula is: 0.8 × (contract amount – ineligible expenditure) Background Profit margin The 0.8 figure is designed to prevent the principal from getting an R&D tax credit on the contractor’s profit margin. For simplicity, a twenty percent profit margin has been chosen. A person doing R&D in their own right is not able to claim R&D tax credits for any profit margin. Therefore, it is considered appropriate that principals are not able to claim R&D tax credits for profit derived by R&D contractors that they pay to perform R&D activities on their behalf. Ineligible expenditure Ineligible expenditure must be removed from the contract amount. It is expected that some contracts may be for activities that are not exclusively R&D activities, and that R&D contractors may incur expenditure that is ineligible expenditure. See the section on Eligible and ineligible expenditure: schedule 21B (page 39) for more information. 34 Detailed analysis Contracted R&D Proposed new section LY 6 defines a person’s contracted expenditure (referred to in the legislation as contracted research and development expenditure) as an amount for an R&D contractor to perform R&D activities for them. An R&D contractor is defined in section YA 1 as a person who performs an R&D activity on behalf of another person. The definition excludes industry organisations which receive levies from their members to fund their R&D activities. These bodies are eligible for the tax incentive in their own right. Contracted expenditure forms part of a person’s eligible expenditure. It is calculated using the formula: 0.8 × (contract amount – ineligible expenditure) Contract amount means the amount that a principal pays an R&D contractor to perform R&D activities on the principal’s behalf. Ineligible expenditure is the amount of the R&D contractor’s expenditure or loss that would be ineligible under proposed new section LY 5, treating the R&D contract as the person under section LY 5. See the section on Eligible expenditure (page 30) for more information. Example 6: Rice producer pays R&D contractor to develop chocolate rice Richard’s Rice Ltd is the largest producer of rice in New Zealand. Richard’s Rice Ltd is thinking of branching into desserts, and contracts Steph to produce rice that tastes like chocolate. Richard’s Rice Ltd pays Steph $1 million to develop chocolate rice. Steph incurs $120,000 of expenditure that is ineligible under proposed new section LY 5. Richard’s Rice Ltd has the following eligible expenditure: 0.8 × ($1,000,000 – $120,000) = $704,000 Contracted R&D performed overseas (proposed new sections LY 6(4) and LY 7) If an R&D contractor performs R&D activities overseas, then a person must calculate their eligible expenditure in accordance with proposed new section LY 7. This is instead of applying the contracted expenditure formula in proposed new section LY 6. See the section on Foreign expenditure (page 35) for more information. 35 FOREIGN EXPENDITURE Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 7) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that foreign expenditure that would otherwise be eligible expenditure only be eligible to the extent it comprises no more than ten percent of a person’s overall R&D tax credit claim. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 7 provides that foreign expenditure is eligible expenditure, capped at ten percent of a person’s overall R&D tax credit claim, to the extent it is:  expenditure incurred on an R&D activity performed outside New Zealand, if the R&D activity is only or mainly for, required for, and integral to, conducting a core activity (note that activities performed overseas cannot be core activities);  a payment of salary or wages to a non-resident person performing an R&D activity in New Zealand; or  a payment for services performed by a non-resident person, where the services are performed in New Zealand. Only eighty percent of amounts paid for contracted services (under the first and third bullet points above) are eligible, less any amounts that are ineligible under schedule 21B, part B. While the proposed rule affects payments to non-resident persons and for R&D activities performed overseas, expenditure on imported materials is considered domestic expenditure (so is not restricted by sections LY 5(2)(b) and LY 7). Background The R&D tax credit regime aims to primarily incentivise R&D activities performed in New Zealand because the wider benefits are more likely to be gained by New Zealand companies. The Government recognises, however, that in some circumstances R&D activities cannot be fully performed in New Zealand. Experts in certain scientific or technological fields may only be available overseas, suitable populations for testing or trials may be located outside New Zealand, or the type of R&D activity a claimant needs to undertake may be cost prohibitive if performed in New Zealand. 36 The 2008 regime was broadly similar but also required foreign expenditure to account for less than half the expenditure on a relevant R&D project to be eligible. This secondary requirement has been relaxed. Detailed analysis Foreign expenditure (section LY 7(1)) Foreign expenditure (referred to as “foreign research and development expenditure” in the legislation) is defined as expenditure or loss:  incurred on R&D activities performed outside New Zealand with the only or main purpose of, that is required for, and integral to, conducting a core activity;  that is a payment of salary or wages to a non-resident person for activities performed in New Zealand; or  that is a payment for services performed by a non-resident person in New Zealand. Eligible expenditure (section LY 7(2)) Eligible expenditure, for proposed new section LY 5(2)(b), includes foreign expenditure equal to the lesser of the person’s actual overseas expenditure and their capped overseas expenditure. Actual overseas expenditure Actual overseas expenditure is made up of expenditure a person incurs themselves on an R&D activity carried out overseas, and amounts contractors incur on an R&D activity carried out overseas on the person’s behalf. Proposed new section LY 7(3) sets out the formula for calculating actual overseas expenditure: (0.8 × (contract amount) – ineligible expenditure) + foreign in-house amount Proposed new section LY 7(4)) defines the components of the formula. Contract amount means the amounts paid to a foreign contractor to perform R&D activities on a person’s behalf (essentially an R&D contractor as defined in YA 1, but for activities performed outside New Zealand). Ineligible expenditure means the expenditure or loss incurred by a foreign contractor that would be ineligible under schedule 21B, treating the foreign contractor as though they were the person claiming R&D tax credits. Foreign in-house amount means expenditure or loss incurred by a person on activities performed overseas, to the extent these activities are performed by the person themselves (rather than by a foreign contractor). 37 For the rationale behind only allowing eighty percent of amounts paid to foreign contractors see the section on Contracted expenditure (page 33). Capped overseas expenditure Proposed new section LY 7(5) sets out the formula for calculating capped overseas expenditure: 0.1 × total New Zealand R&D expenditure ÷ 0.9 Proposed new section LY 7(6)) defines total New Zealand R&D expenditure as a person’s total eligible expenditure, less any amounts that are foreign expenditure as defined in section LY 7(1). This formula means the capped amount of overseas expenditure is equal to ten percent of the total eligible expenditure. Example 7: Speakers in emergency radio systems Tamaki Ltd is in the business of producing high quality audio devices for use in portable electronic equipment. It has a team of 200 staff working on R&D in its purpose-built R&D facility in the Wairarapa. Once it has a workable concept, it then sends a delegation of its R&D staff to Thailand, where Tamaki Ltd has a factory dedicated to producing audio devices. In Thailand, Tamaki Ltd reconfigures its manufacturing facilities temporarily, so that they can be used to produce its new prototype, and then sends those prototypes back to New Zealand for further testing and analysis. In November 2018, Tamaki Ltd begins R&D on a new type of speaker, which it would like to use to replace the speakers in its existing emergency radio systems. Tamaki Ltd has developed a concept, but it needs to test whether it will work in the emergency radio systems produced in its Thailand manufacturing facility. Tamaki Ltd has incurred $1 million of eligible expenditure on R&D performed in New Zealand to date, which includes a mixture of eligible core and supporting activities. In January 2019, Tamaki Ltd sends a team of engineers to Thailand to configure its plant and oversee the production of a prototype of the emergency radio system incorporating the new speaker design. Tamaki Ltd spends $300,000 on its R&D in Thailand. Actual overseas expenditure The formula is: (0.8 × (contract amount) – ineligible expenditure) + foreign in-house amount), where:  the contract amount and ineligible expenditure = nil, as Tamaki Ltd performed all of its foreign R&D in-house; and  the foreign in-house amount = $300,000. Applying the formula: (0.8 × (0) – 0) + $300,000 = $300,000. Capped overseas expenditure The formula is: 0.1 × total New Zealand R&D expenditure ÷ 0.9, where the total New Zealand R&D expenditure = $1,000,000. Applying the formula: 0.1 × $1,000,000 ÷ 0.9 = $111,111. Eligible expenditure (for proposed new section LY 5) 38 Tamaki Ltd’s eligible foreign expenditure is $111,111, which is the lesser of its actual overseas expenditure ($300,000) and its capped overseas expenditure ($111,111). 39 ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE EXPENDITURE: SCHEDULE 21B Clauses 6, 21 and 22 (proposed new schedule 21B) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that certain types of expenditure are eligible for the tax credit, and that some types are ineligible. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new schedule 21B, part A provides that only the following expenditure, to the extent the expenditure is incurred on R&D, is eligible for the R&D tax credit regime:  depreciation loss for items used in performing R&D;  expenditure or loss on acquiring goods and services used in performing R&D; and  amounts paid to employees. Proposed new schedule 21B, part B provides that the following expenditure is ineligible for the R&D tax credit regime:  amounts incurred by a person and their associates on R&D to the extent the amounts exceed $120 million;  expenditure incurred in acquiring depreciable property;  expenditure that contributes to the cost of depreciable tangible property;  depreciation loss for depreciable property, to the extent to which the cost of the property is eligible R&D expenditure;  depreciation loss on items in a pool of depreciable property where an item in the pool is not used solely in performing R&D;  certain amounts of depreciation loss on assets acquired from associates;  profits on R&D services and property provided by associates;  amounts in excess of market value for leasing property from associates;  expenditure on employee recruitment, relocation, bonuses, and employee share schemes;  interest and other financing costs; 40  professional fees in determining whether a person qualifies for the R&D tax credit regime;  expenditure on acquiring an interest in intangible property other than software;  expenditure on bespoke software;  internal software development expenditure incurred by a person and their associates, to the extent it exceeds $3 million (see the section on Internal software development (page 27) for more information);  expenditure on goods or services to the extent it exceeds the market value of the goods or services;  gifts;  the cost of acquiring technology that is used as a basis for further R&D activities;  expenditure to commercialise the results of an R&D activity;  expenditure that relates to a government or local authority grant;  expenditure on inputs used, or subject to a process or transformation, to the extent the expenditure does not exceed the value of the output from that expenditure (feedstock rule);  expenditure for which a person has received an R&D tax credit from another country; and  if a person’s eligible expenditure is less than $50,000, expenditure or loss under $50,000 that is not for an approved research provider to perform an R&D activity on behalf of the person. Background Expenditure that is eligible for the R&D tax credit regime must have a direct link to a person’s R&D activities. Expenditure is excluded via schedule 21B to:  clarify when expenditure will have insufficient connection with an R&D activity;  reduce compliance and administrative costs;  prevent double dipping;  prevent abuse of the R&D tax credit regime; and  limit fiscal risk. 41 Detailed analysis Eligible expenditure Depreciation (schedule 21B, part A, clause 1 and proposed amendment to section EE 6(1)(b)) Depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property is eligible expenditure to the extent to which the depreciable property is used in performing an R&D activity. An R&D tax credit is therefore not available on an asset which is available for use in R&D but not actually used in the relevant income year. The capital cost of assets used in R&D is not eligible expenditure, because the capital cost is unlikely to reflect the actual expenditure incurred on R&D. An asset that is initially purchased for use in R&D activities may subsequently be sold or used for non-R&D activities. Depreciation loss calculated for each year an asset is used in R&D is a better measure of cost, and reflects the fact that an asset has value over its useful life, not just the year it was purchased. The proposed amendment to section EE 6 ensures that tax exempt entities, such as charities, are able to claim R&D tax credits for depreciation loss on assets used in their R&D activities. Expenditure or loss to acquire goods and services used in performing R&D (schedule 21B part A, clause 2) Expenditure on non-depreciable goods and services is eligible expenditure to the extent the goods and services relate to performing an R&D activity. This inclusion is broad and intended to cover expenditure such as:  the cost of goods consumed in R&D activities;  overheads, to the extent they relate to R&D activities. For example, rates, utilities, insurance, and lease payments; and  the cost of materials incorporated into prototypes. Amounts paid to employees (schedule 21B, part A, clause 3) Salaries and wages paid to employees are eligible expenditure to the extent an employee’s employment relates to performing an R&D activity. Some other employment related costs are ineligible. Ineligible expenditure Amounts exceeding $120 million (schedule 21B, part B, clause 1) Expenditure on R&D that would otherwise be eligible is ineligible to the extent it is greater than $120 million for the income year. The $120 million cap takes into account the eligible expenditure claimed by associated persons, to prevent the cap being circumvented by a person splitting their expenditure amongst associates. See 42 the section on Expenditure cap (including approved R&D caps) (page 51) for more information. Expenditure incurred in acquiring depreciable property (schedule 21B, part B, clause 2) Expenditure or loss on acquiring depreciable property is ineligible. Depreciation loss is the better measure of cost to a person, and is eligible to the extent to which depreciable property is used in R&D activities. Expenditure or loss that contributes to the cost of depreciable tangible property (schedule 21B, part B, clause 3) Expenditure or loss that contributes to the cost of depreciable tangible property is ineligible, unless the depreciable tangible property is used solely in performing an R&D activity. An example of eligible expenditure is expenditure on producing a prototype that is solely used in a person’s R&D activities. Note that expenditure incurred in the research phrase of creating depreciable tangible property, which would be deductible for tax purposes, is eligible expenditure. Such expenditure is not considered part of the cost of creating the depreciable tangible property. The depreciable tangible property exclusion is to prevent expenditure with a different purpose being characterised as R&D. There are also concerns about the potential fiscal cost of allowing such expenditure. This is the same approach as was adopted in 2008. It is similar to Australia’s R&D rules, which also explicitly exclude expenditure on producing depreciable tangible property. Depreciation loss where cost of depreciable property was eligible expenditure (schedule 21B, part B, clause 4) Depreciation loss for an item of depreciable property is ineligible for the credit to the extent the cost of producing the property was eligible expenditure. This exclusion aims to prevent a person from getting R&D tax credits more than once for the same expenditure. Pooled property (schedule 21B, part B, clause 5) Depreciation loss on depreciable assets in a tax depreciation pool is ineligible, unless the pool consists solely of assets used wholly in conducting R&D activities. This exclusion aims to prevent a person from receiving R&D tax credits for depreciation loss on assets used in non-R&D activities. Certain depreciation deductions on assets acquired from an associate (schedule 21B, part B, clause 6) A person’s depreciation loss on an item of depreciable property acquired from an associate is ineligible, to the extent:  the person purchased the property for more than the property’s adjusted tax value (“ATV”) (in the hands of the associate); and 43  the property was used in the associate’s R&D activities. Example 8: Depreciable property acquired from associate at above ATV Webb Ltd sells an asset that was used in R&D, which cost $200 and has an ATV of $100, to its associate, Wood Ltd, for $130. Wood Ltd’s depreciation loss on the $30 above the asset’s ATV is ineligible. The rationale for this rule is to prevent associated entities from claiming R&D tax credits twice for what is essentially the same amount of depreciation loss. In the above example, absent this rule, Webb Ltd and Wood Ltd would both have claimed depreciation loss on the asset’s decline in value from $130 to $100. Profits on R&D services and property provided by associates (schedule 21B, part B, clause 7) An amount of expenditure or loss for goods or services acquired from an associate is ineligible to the extent the consideration paid to the associate is more than the lowest cost of the goods or services to an associate. This rule is designed to prevent expenditure from being eligible to the extent it is on goods or services that are overpriced. Property leased from an associate (schedule 21B, part B, clause 8) Expenditure on leasing property from an associate is ineligible to the extent a person is paying in excess of market value. This exclusion aims to prevent a person from claiming R&D tax credits on excess cost. Expenditure on employee recruitment, relocation, bonuses, and employee share schemes (schedule 21B, part B, clauses 9 to 11) Expenditure on employee share schemes, recruitment, relocation and bonuses is ineligible because the extent to which these payments actually relate to R&D may be unclear. Example 9: Expenditure on employee relocation and bonuses Zoomboom Ltd employs Nicola to assist them in the R&D of the world’s fastest rocket, the Zoom 2. Zoomboom Ltd pays Nicola a sign on bonus and reimburses her for relocation costs. These costs are not eligible expenditure. Interest and other financing costs (schedule 21B, part B, clauses 12 and 13) Amounts of expenditure under financial arrangements and deductions under sections DB 5 to DB 15, which relate to financing and financial arrangement adjustments, are ineligible. This is to ensure R&D tax credits are not provided for interest, or amounts in the nature of interest, related to financing the R&D activities. 44 Professional fees (schedule 21B, part B, clause 14) Professional fees are not eligible for the credit. This exclusion covers fees paid to determine the eligibility of a person, activity, or amount of expenditure, and amounts paid to a tax agent to prepare a person’s R&D claim. Professional fees are excluded because they do not relate to resolving the scientific or technological uncertainty. Expenditure on acquiring an interest in intangible property (schedule 21B, part B, clause 15) Expenditure for acquiring an interest in intangible property, other than software, is ineligible. This expenditure is excluded to reduce fiscal risk. Costs associated with creating intangible assets from R&D activities, however, may be eligible. Expenditure on bespoke software (schedule 21B, part B, clause 16) Expenditure incurred on acquiring bespoke software, or software that is not widely commercially available, is ineligible. Expenditure on software that is widely available, such as Microsoft Excel, may be eligible expenditure. Internal software development expenditure exceeding $3 million (schedule 21B, part B, clause 17) Internal software development expenditure incurred by a person or their associates is ineligible to the extent it exceeds $3 million. See the section on Internal software development (page 27) for more information. Above market value goods or services (schedule 21B, part B, clause 18) Expenditure on goods or services is ineligible to the extent it exceeds market value. This provision is intended to apply broadly, so applies to transactions with associates and third parties. This exclusion targets arrangements where a person deliberately attempts to increase their eligible expenditure by paying above market value for a good or service. Gifts (schedule 21B, part B, clause 19) Expenditure or loss on gifts is ineligible. Only amounts incurred directly on R&D activities are eligible expenditure. Gifts are ineligible because they are discretionary. Ineligible technology expenditure (schedule 21B, part B, clause 20) Expenditure or loss on technology expenditure that is defined in section YA 1 as “ineligible technology expenditure” is ineligible. The exclusion targets the cost of acquiring technology that is used as a basis for further R&D. The Government does not want to give R&D tax credits to a person for the results of R&D that the person has not created. Otherwise, there is a risk the Government may give the credit twice for the same R&D. 45 Expenditure to commercialise the results of an R&D activity (schedule 21B, part B, clause 21) Expenditure or loss for plant, machinery, or materials to commercialise the results of an R&D activity is ineligible. Commercialisation of R&D generally happens after scientific or technological uncertainty has been resolved. Expenditure incurred to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty that arises during the commercialisation stage of R&D may, however, be eligible for the credit. Expenditure that relates to a government or local authority grant (schedule 21B, part B, clause 22) Expenditure or loss that relates to a government or local authority grant is ineligible. A local authority or government grant amount received by a person that is then spent by the person on eligible R&D activities is ineligible expenditure. Expenditure is also ineligible when it is from funds required as a condition of a grant (known as required co-funding). Such expenditure is ineligible because the expenditure has either already been subsidised by the Government or relates to an activity that the Government has already subsidised. Example 10: Expenditure funded by and required by government grant Watts Ltd receives an R&D grant of $500,000 from the Government to subsidise its R&D salary costs. As a condition of the grant, Watts Ltd is required to contribute $500,000 of its own funds towards the project. Watts Ltd uses the $1 million to fund its R&D activities. This includes paying for R&D salaries and constructing prototypes used solely in R&D activities. While this expenditure would normally be eligible, it is ineligible expenditure because the grant exclusion in proposed new schedule 21B, part B, clause 22. Feedstock rule (schedule 21B, part B, clause 23) The feedstock rule applies to inputs that are used in, processed, or transformed as part of a person’s R&D activities, where the activities result in goods acquired or produced by the person. The rule provides that expenditure on inputs is ineligible to the extent the person’s inputs are less than the market value of the person’s outputs from their R&D activities. Inputs includes expenditure on energy, such as electricity and gas. Only the net cost of inputs used in R&D activities are eligible. That is, the excess of the cost of a person’s inputs over the market value of their outputs. 46 Example 11: Feedstock rule Mike’s Mountain Bikes Ltd is developing a new coating for bike frames which will be more durable than paint. The company has painted some frames to test the coating, and incurs the following costs: Expenditure on inputs Amount Cost of inputs (value of steel frames and coating) $2,000 Electricity used in the process $500 Total cost of inputs $2,500 The total cost of Mike’s Mountain Bikes Ltd’s inputs is $2,500, which is made up of the cost of the steel frames and the electricity used in the R&D process. The company incurred $1,000 on other production costs, like labour and overhead costs, but these costs are not considered inputs for the feedstock rule. Once Mike’s Mountain Bikes Ltd completes its R&D activities, the market value of the coated frames is $2,500. The cost of the company’s inputs and the value of its outputs net out at zero, so none of Mike’s Mountain Bikes Ltd’s input costs are eligible. The $1,000 incurred on other production costs is, however, eligible expenditure despite the application of the feedstock rule. The feedstock rule ensures a business only gets a tax credit for the extra costs associated with their R&D. Costs of inputs which are recouped are therefore ineligible. Energy was not included in the feedstock rule under the 2008 tax credit, but is now included. Expenditure for which a person has received an R&D tax credit from another country (schedule 21B, part B, clause 24) Expenditure is ineligible to the extent a person has received a credit of a similar nature to the R&D tax credit for the expenditure from another country. It is not appropriate to have two credits for the same expenditure. Expenditure or loss under $50,000 (schedule 21B, part B, clause 25) See the section on the Minimum threshold (page 49) for more information on this exclusion. 47 Calculating the tax credit 48 49 MINIMUM THRESHOLD Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 4) and 22 (proposed new schedule 21B, part B) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that claimants must have at least $50,000 of eligible expenditure, or have approved research provider expenditure, to be eligible for the R&D tax credit regime. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 4 provides that a person is only eligible for the R&D tax credit regime if the person has at least $50,000 of eligible expenditure or has approved research provider expenditure. See the section on Approved research providers (page 65) for more information. A person who only satisfies the minimum threshold because they have approved research provider expenditure is restricted to only claiming their eligible approved research provider expenditure (see clause 25 of proposed new schedule 21B, part B). For partners in partnership and owners of look-through companies (LTCs), the minimum threshold can be satisfied by assessing the total eligible expenditure of the partnership or LTC as a whole. Background A minimum threshold ensures that the combination of compliance and administration costs do not outweigh the value of the credit. Example 12: Partners with less than $50,000 of eligible expenditure Emma and Luke are in partnership together. Emma has $20,000 of eligible expenditure, and Luke has $35,000 of eligible expenditure. Individually, Emma and Luke are unable to satisfy the minimum threshold. Since they are in partnership, their expenditure can be grouped (proposed new section LY 4(1)). As a result, Emma and Luke are able to satisfy the $50,000 minimum threshold. 50 Example 13: Person with approved research provider expenditure Dockery Ltd is a business that sells electronic deck shadings. In the 2020–21 income year it has performed activities that satisfy the core and supporting activity definitions, and has done some of its R&D itself and contracted the rest out to an approved research provider. Dockery Ltd: 2020–21 income year Eligible expenditure Amount In-house $10,000 Approved research provider $35,000 Total R&D expenditure $45,000 Dockery Ltd is unable to satisfy the $50,000 minimum threshold, as it has only incurred $45,000 of eligible expenditure. It is nevertheless eligible for the R&D tax credit regime because it has approved research provider expenditure. Its eligible expenditure, however, is limited to the approved research provider amount. Dockery Ltd: 2020–21 income year Expenditure type Amount Total R&D expenditure $45,000 Ineligible expenditure ($10,000) Eligible expenditure $35,000 51 EXPENDITURE CAP (INCLUDING APPROVED R&D CAPS) Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 4), 21(2), 24(2) and 30 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that an expenditure cap of $120 million apply to restrict the maximum R&D tax credit that can be claimed by any one person (including any associates of the person). It is also proposed that the Commissioner have discretion to allow businesses to exceed the cap in some circumstances. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 4(3) provides that the maximum amount of eligible expenditure that a person can claim in any income year is $120 million. If a person’s expenditure exceeds $120 million, then their eligible expenditure for the R&D tax credit regime equals $120 million. The cap includes expenditure claimed by the person’s associates, so that the combined claim of a person and their associates is limited to $120 million. Applying to exceed the cap Proposed new section 68CD enables people who expect to have more than $120 million of eligible expenditure in an income year to apply to the Commissioner to exceed the expenditure cap. If approved, a person’s total R&D expenditure (for calculating their R&D tax credit under proposed new section LY 4) equals their cap as approved by the Commissioner (approved R&D cap). Applications to exceed the cap must be made by the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year (for a person with a standard balance date in the year ended 31 March 2021, their application to exceed the cap would need to be filed by 7 May 2021). The Commissioner can only approve applications to exceed the cap if satisfied that an applicant’s R&D activities will give rise to a substantial net benefit for New Zealand. The Commissioner is also required to consult with the Chief Executive of MBIE. Background The expenditure cap of $120 million for each income year equates to a maximum credit of $18 million, based on a 15% R&D tax credit rate. The cap contains the fiscal risk associated with the R&D tax credit regime. 52 The Government believes it is important, however, for businesses to be able to apply to exceed the $120 million cap if their R&D is expected to result in a substantial net benefit for New Zealand. The information that is likely to be required to demonstrate a substantial net benefit for New Zealand includes:  impacts on New Zealand based economic activity;  impacts on job opportunities and skills of New Zealanders;  enhancements to market competition, efficiency, productivity, and service levels in New Zealand;  wider benefits to New Zealand; and  the durability and sustainability of the benefits to New Zealand. Example 14: Associated persons with expenditure in excess of the cap Muff Ltd and Mungnip Ltd are associated. Their combined R&D expenditure for the year ended 31 March 2022 totals $150 million. They were not able to apply to exceed the $120 million cap, because their R&D will not result in a substantial net benefit for New Zealand. Muff Ltd and Mungnip Ltd 31 March 2022 Claimant R&D expenditure Muff Ltd $80 million Mungnip Ltd $70 million Total $150 million Muff Ltd filed its income tax and R&D supplementary returns on 1 October 2022. Mungnip Ltd intends to file its returns by 31 March 2023. The returns of both Muff Ltd and Mungnip Ltd are prepared by tax agents, so they both have an extension of time for their returns. Applying the aggregation rules in clause 1, schedule 21B, part B: Muff Ltd and Mungnip Ltd 31 March 2022 Description Amount Muff Ltd’s claimed expenditure (as returned) $80 million Mungnip Ltd’s gross eligible expenditure $70 million Total $150 million Mungnip Ltd’s gross eligible expenditure $70 million Mungnip Ltd’s ineligible expenditure ($150,000,000 less $120,000,000) ($30 million) Mungnip Ltd’s net eligible expenditure $40 million Mungnip Ltd’s eligible expenditure that it can claim in its income tax and R&D supplementary returns is $40 million. This is because $80 million (Muff Ltd’s claimed expenditure) plus $40 million (Mungnip Ltd’s eligible expenditure) equals $120 million. 53 TAX CREDIT RATE AND CALCULATION Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 4), 21(7) and 21(15) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that a person’s R&D tax credit equals 15% of their eligible expenditure, subject to a minimum threshold and expenditure cap. Special rules apply for contracted and foreign expenditure. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 4 provides the formula for calculating a person’s R&D tax credits for an income year. The formula is 15% multiplied by a person’s total eligible R&D expenditure (restricted by a $120 million expenditure cap, for more information see the section on Expenditure cap (including approved R&D caps) (page 51)). Total eligible R&D expenditure is defined to mean:  $120 million if a person has exceeded the expenditure cap in proposed new section LY 4(3)(a) but has not received approval to exceed the cap;  a person’s approved R&D cap, if the person has received approval from the Commissioner to exceed the expenditure cap (see sections LY 3 and 68CD); or  if a person’s expenditure is less than $120 million, the person’s actual eligible expenditure, as defined in proposed new section LY 5 (see the section on Eligible expenditure (page 30) for more information). 54 STRIPPING OUT GST INPUTS Clause 10 (proposed new sections LY 1(5) to (7)) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that a person cannot receive R&D tax credits for expenditure to the extent the person is able to claim GST input tax credits in relation to the expenditure. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new sections LY 1(5) to (7) provide that a person’s eligible expenditure is:  reduced by the amount of input tax the person may claim for the expenditure;  reduced by the amount of an adjustment made under section 20(3)(e) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; and  increased by adding a relevant amount of deductible output tax the person has for the income year. Background R&D expenditure need not be tax deductible to be eligible expenditure (see the section on Eligible expenditure (page 30) for more information). As a result, section DB 2, which denies a person a deduction for the GST input tax portion of expenditure, does not apply to R&D tax credit claims. Proposed new sections LY 1(5) to (7) are intended to achieve the same effect as section DB 2 in the context of the R&D tax credit regime. The rationale is to ensure a person does not receive an R&D tax credit for expenditure which is then refunded to them through claiming a GST input tax credit. Detailed analysis GST inputs (section LY 1(5)) Proposed new section LY 1(5) reduces a person’s eligible expenditure by the amount of input tax credit applying to the relevant goods or services purchased by the person. 55 Example 15: GST input amount excluded from eligible expenditure Alison purchases $10,000 of oil for use in her R&D activities. Alison is GST registered, so she can claim an input tax credit of $1,304.34, which is refunded to her by Inland Revenue. The true cost of the oil to Alison is $8,695.66, and she may only include this amount in her eligible expenditure for the R&D tax credit regime. Deductions from output tax (section LY 1(6)) A person’s eligible expenditure is reduced by the amount of any adjustment made under section 20(3)(e) of the Goods and Services Act 1985. Example 16: Deductions from output tax James purchases $20,000 worth of oil. He originally intended to use 2/3 of the oil in his R&D process and take 1/3 home for his Ferrari. James ends up using all $20,000 of the oil in his R&D process. As James thought he would be using 1/3 of the oil for private use when he purchased it, he only claimed an input tax credit of $1,739. Because James used all of the oil for taxable purposes, he could have claimed an input tax credit of $2,609. James may deduct from his output tax $870, being the additional input tax credit he could have claimed. When James files his tax return and claims his R&D tax credit, this $870 must be deducted off his eligible expenditure to reflect the fact that the true cost of the oil to James was $17,391. Adjustments for output tax (section LY 1(7)) A person’s expenditure or loss is increased by adding the relevant amount of deductible output tax the person has. 56 REFUNDABILITY Clause 9 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that R&D tax credits be refundable for companies in loss or with insufficient income tax liability to use all of their R&D tax credits in an income year, provided certain criteria are met. A company may receive a maximum of $255,000 refundable R&D tax credits. Any credits that are not refunded may be carried forward by the company to the next income year, provided shareholder continuity requirements are met. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LA 5(4B) provides that a company’s R&D tax credits are refundable if the company:  is in a tax loss position, or has insufficient income tax liability to utilise all of its R&D tax credits in the relevant income year;  satisfies the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria in sections MX 2 and 3;  does not derive exempt income and is not associated with a person who derives exempt income;  is not a listed company and is not associated with a listed company; and  does not have an outstanding tax liability. Only the first $255,000 of the company’s R&D tax credits is refundable, which is the equivalent of $1.7 million of eligible expenditure. Any remaining R&D tax credits may be carried forward to the next income year provided the shareholder continuity requirements in proposed new section LY 8 are met. Background Many R&D intensive firms operate at a loss, especially in their early years. For the R&D tax credit regime to encourage more businesses to undertake a greater amount of R&D, proposed new section LA 5(4B) ensures that eligible companies are able to receive the benefit of up to $255,000 of their R&D tax credits each income year. The corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria (LA 5(4B)(a)(i) and (ii)) are intended to target the refundability of R&D tax credits to start-up firms heavily 57 engaged in R&D. New section LA 5(4B) uses the R&D tax loss cash-out corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria. R&D tax credits cannot be refunded under LA 5(4B) for non-corporate entities and companies that do not satisfy the requirements of LA 5(4B)(a)(i) to (vi). The Government intends to undertake further policy work on refunding R&D tax credits, and the policy may change for year two. Detailed analysis Criteria for refundable R&D tax credits A person who has received R&D tax credits may only have their credits refunded under new section LA 5(4B), up to a maximum of $255,000, if they meet certain criteria. These criteria are in addition to the general eligibility criteria in proposed new section LY 3, which require, among other things, that a person carries on business through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Corporate eligibility criteria must be met ((a)(i)) The corporate eligibility criteria are met if a person:  is a company (this includes companies incorporated part way through an income year);  is tax resident in New Zealand;  is not treated as tax resident in another country under a double tax agreement;  does not have fifty percent or more of its shares held by a public or local authority, a CRI , or a State enterprise;  is not an entity established by, or subject to, the Education Act 1989, the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000, or the Crown Entities Act 2004; and  is not a listed company or otherwise listed on a recognised exchange. Example 17: Joint venture partially owned by Crown ineligible A tertiary education organisation and a State enterprise each have a twenty five percent share of a joint venture company set up to do R&D on a new method of generating electricity through wind turbines. The other fifty percent is owned by Brya, who is a private investor. The joint venture company is unable to receive a refund of its R&D tax credits under new section LA 5(4B) because it is fifty percent owned by the Crown. 58 Example 18: Residence of shareholders James is a pumpkin grower who has an idea to develop purple pumpkins that can glow in the dark. James thinks that “glow in the dark” purple pumpkins will appeal greatly to the US market, especially over Halloween. Stephanie, who is an Australian resident, agrees to provide funding for initial research and development on the idea. James and Stephanie incorporate Purple Pumpkin Ltd (PPL) in New Zealand. James holds thirty percent of the shares in PPL, and Stephanie holds the remaining seventy percent of shares. PPL commences R&D on the idea. PPL is eligible for refundable R&D tax credits under new section LA 5(4B) because:  the residence of its shareholders does not affect PPL’s New Zealand tax resident status;  PPL is in a tax loss position; and  PPL satisfies the other requirements of LA 5(4B)(a). Wage intensity criteria must be met ((a)(ii)) The wage intensity criteria are set out in section MX 3. To be eligible, twenty percent or more of a firm’s labour costs must be R&D related. If the company is part of a group of companies, the amount calculated for the R&D group (in the aggregate) should be 0.2 or more. Wage intensity for the R&D tax credit regime is calculated in the same way as for the R&D tax loss cash-out regime. Company must not derive exempt income Companies that derive exempt income, or are associated with an entity that derives exempt income, are not eligible for refundable R&D tax credits. These entities will, however, be able to carry their R&D tax credits forward in accordance with section LY 8. Company must not be a listed company Listed companies and entities associated with listed companies will not be eligible to refund their R&D tax credits. R&D tax loss cash-out regime The R&D tax loss cash-out and the R&D tax credit regimes have different criteria and definitions for eligible R&D activity. A company which cashes out its losses under the R&D tax loss cash-out regime is also able to claim R&D tax credits in the same income year. The provisions relating to the R&D tax loss cash-out regime in subpart MX are only relevant to the R&D tax credit regime to the extent they are brought into LA 5(4B) for determining a company’s eligibility for refundable R&D tax credits. Other aspects of eligibility for the R&D tax credit regime are determined solely by reference to the requirements in subpart LY. 59 CARRYING FORWARD SURPLUS R&D TAX CREDITS Clause 10 (proposed new section LY 8) and 21 Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that a taxpayer may carry forward any surplus R&D tax credits to the next tax year. Companies must meet certain shareholder continuity requirements in order for R&D tax credits to be carried forward. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Under proposed new section LY 8, a taxpayer may carry forward any remaining R&D tax credits to the next tax year. A company may carry forward those credits if it meets the continuity requirements. Background The test proposed above for whether a company can carry forward its remaining R&D tax credits is the same as the test that currently determines whether a company can carry forward its losses. The rationale behind the continuity requirement is to ensure that substantially the same people who incurred the expenditure giving rise to the R&D tax credit are able to benefit from it when the credit is ultimately applied in satisfaction of a tax liability, or refunded. Detailed analysis Under proposed new section LY 8, a person’s remaining R&D tax credits for a tax year may be carried forward to the next tax year. If the taxpayer is a company, the remaining tax credits are extinguished and must not be carried forward unless a group of persons has, for the continuity period:  minimum voting interests in the company of forty nine percent or more; and  if a market value circumstance exists for the company in the continuity period, minimum market value interests in the company of forty nine percent or more. 60 Continuity period The continuity period starts from the beginning of the income year in which the R&D tax credits arises, and ends on the last day of the income year to which the R&D tax credit has been carried forward to. Minimum voting interest A minimum voting interest is the lowest voting interest that a person has in the company. A person’s voting interest in a company is determined by the percentage of the total shareholder decision making rights, ascertained from shares or options over shares, the person holds for the company. Market value circumstance A market value circumstance exists where a person’s voting interest in the company does not accurately reflect their economic interest in the company. The market value interest takes into account debentures, shares, options or other arrangements which could affect the balance of interests within the company so that a simple examination of voting power would be misleading. Example 19: Company with market value circumstance R&D Ltd has an R&D tax credit of $100,000 for the 2019–20 income year. R&D Ltd is a standard balance date taxpayer, and wishes to carry forward its R&D tax credit to the 2020–21 income year. R&D Ltd’s shareholding for the relevant period is as follows: R&D Ltd Shareholders Shares held as at Minimum voting interests as at 31 March 2021 1 April 2019 31 March 2021 James 45 20 20 Steph 30 20 20 Richard 15 35 15 Alison 10 25 10 Total: 65 The continuity period runs from 1 April 2019 the beginning of the income year in which the R&D tax credit arises) to 31 March 2021 (the end of the income year to which the credit is being carried forward to). The minimum voting interests in the company for the period total sixty five percent. This is greater than the required forty nine percent, therefore R&D Ltd may carry forward its $100,000 R&D tax credit to the 2020–21 income year. 61 Example 20: Company with minimum voting interests below forty nine percent Using the same example as before, but the shareholding is now as follows: R&D Ltd Shareholders Shares held as at Minimum voting interests as at 31 March 2021 1 April 2019 31 March 2021 James 45 0 0 Will 0 45 0 Steph 30 20 20 Richard 15 35 15 Alison 10 25 10 Total: 45 The minimum voting interests in R&D Ltd for the continuity period total forty five percent, so R&D Ltd cannot carry forward its R&D tax credit to the 2020–21 income year. 62 63 Other matters 64 65 APPROVED RESEARCH PROVIDERS Clauses 21(3), 24(3), 25 and 36 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that a person can apply for the Commissioner’s approval to be an approved research provider for the R&D tax credit regime. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section 15ZB provides that a person is an approved research provider if they apply, the Commissioner approves their application, and the person keeps appropriate records. The Commissioner will only approve a person if the person is:  capable of performing R&D activities on behalf of other people;  has facilities in New Zealand to perform R&D activities;  is available to perform R&D activities on behalf of third parties; and  performs, or will perform, R&D activities for other people for market value consideration. If a person receives approval, the Commissioner has to notify the person and publish their name in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. The Commissioner is able to revoke approval at her discretion, although if she does revoke an approval she must provide the person with the reason for the revocation and specify the date from which the revocation takes effect. A decision made by the Commissioner under the proposed new section cannot be challenged, except through judicial review. Background Some businesses may not have sufficient expenditure to satisfy the minimum threshold of $50,000. These businesses are nevertheless able to be eligible for the R&D tax credit regime if they have approved research provider expenditure. This is to ensure the R&D tax credit regime is accessible to businesses of all sizes. It is expected that approved research providers will have robust processes in place and will have experience performing R&D activities for other people. For more information on approved research providers and how they interact with the minimum threshold, see the section on Minimum threshold (page 49). 66 PROVISIONAL TAX Clause 21(17) Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that the R&D tax credit will reduce a person’s future provisional tax payments. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features The definition of residual income tax has been amended so that R&D tax credits are taken into account in determining a person’s residual income tax. Background A person’s residual income tax is their tax to pay after all available tax credits have been subtracted. Payment of provisional tax is generally based on the taxpayer’s residual income tax for the previous year. For example, under the standard method for paying provisional tax the amount payable is 105% of the person’s residual income tax for the preceding tax year. By ensuring that R&D tax credits are taken into account in calculating a person’s residual income tax, taxpayers using this method will have reduced provisional tax payments in the following year. Taxpayers who wish to benefit from R&D tax credits via reduced tax payments in the current year may use the estimation method for paying their provisional tax. 67 ORDERING RULES Clause 8 Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that R&D tax credits are used fourth, in the order of utilising tax credits to satisfy a taxpayer’s income tax liability, after credits for imputation credits and before refundable tax credits. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that section LA 4 is amended so that a person’s R&D tax credit is applied to satisfy a person’s income tax liability after imputation credits, and before refundable tax credits. Background Where a person’s tax credit for a tax year is greater than their income tax liability for the tax year, excess tax credits are currently used according to the following order: 1. First, a non-refundable tax credit. 2. Second, a tax credit for a supplementary dividend. 3. Third, a tax credit for an imputation credit. 4. Fourth, a refundable tax credit. Detailed analysis The proposed amendment to section LA 4 puts R&D tax credits into fourth place. The rationale behind this is that imputation credits are more likely to be lost than R&D tax credits due to the fact that sixty six percent continuity of shareholding is required to carry imputation credits forward (compared with forty nine percent for R&D tax credits), and therefore should be used before R&D tax credits. 68 Example 21: Person with imputation credits and tax credits Keith has an income tax liability for the 2020 tax year of $50,000. He has $10,000 of imputation credits and $50,000 of R&D tax credits. His imputation credits would be first applied to his tax liability, followed by his R&D tax credits. Keith’s remaining $10,000 R&D tax credits would either be carried forward to a future tax year, or refunded (if Keith met the requirements – see the section on Refundability (page 56) for more information). 69 IMPUTATION AND MĀORI AUTHORITY CREDITS Clauses 11–20 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that companies and Māori authorities performing R&D have an imputation credit or Māori authority credit respectively, equal to their R&D tax credit. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that:  new section OB 9C grants a company an imputation credit for the amount of R&D tax credits the company is entitled to;  new section OK 6C grants a Māori authority a Māori authority credit for the amount of R&D tax credits the Māori authority is entitled to;  new section OP 11C grants a consolidated imputation group an imputation credit for the amount of R&D tax credits the group company is entitled to; and  the imputation credit or Māori authority credit, as applicable, is credited on the day the relevant entity files its R&D supplementary return for the income year. Background Unless an imputation or Māori authority credit (as applicable) is given for an R&D tax credit, the R&D tax credit will be “clawed back” when a company or Māori authority makes a distribution. 70 Example 22: Company with ICAs but no R&D special credits Company income: $200 R&D expenditure: $100 Taxable income: $100 Tax at 28%: $28 R&D tax credit ($15) Tax to pay: $13 ICA result: Tax paid: $13 R&D special credit: $0 $13 Retained earnings Pre-tax income: $100 Less tax expense: $13 $87 Dividend to 28% shareholder Cash dividend: $87 Imputation credits $13 $100 Tax at 28%: $28 Less ICs: $13 Shareholder tax to pay: $15.5 71 By issuing the company with an imputation credit equal to the R&D tax credit, the value of the tax credit is substantially preserved following a distribution. Example 23: Company with ICAs and R&D special credits Company income: $200 R&D expenditure: $100 Taxable income: $100 Tax at 28%: $28 Tax credit ($15) Tax to pay: $13 ICA result: Tax paid $13 R&D special credit: $15 $28 Retained earnings Pre-tax income: $100 Net tax expense: $13 $87 Dividend to 28% shareholder Cash dividend: $87 Imputation credits $28 $115 Tax at 28%: $32.2 Less ICs: $28.0 Shareholder tax to pay: $4.2 Detailed analysis Companies Proposed new section OB 9C grants a company an imputation credit equal to the R&D tax credit it is entitled to. This is credited on the date the company files its R&D supplementary return. Proposed new section OP 11C achieves the same effect but for consolidated imputation groups. An amendment to section OB 4 ensures that a company does not receive an imputation credit for tax paid by crediting an R&D tax credit. This ensures a company does not receive double the amount of imputation credits that was intended – that is, the first amount when the company filed its R&D supplementary return, and the second amount when the company used the R&D tax credit to satisfy a tax liability. A similar amendment has been made to OP 7 to ensure consolidated imputation groups do not receive the imputation credits twice. 72 Māori authorities Proposed new section OK 6C grants a Māori authority a Māori authority credit equal to the R&D tax credit it is entitled to. This is credited on the date the Māori authority files its R&D supplementary return. An amendment to section OK 2 ensures that a Māori authority does not receive a Māori authority credit for tax paid by crediting an R&D tax credit. The rationale is the same as that explained above in relation to companies. 73 Administrative requirements 74 75 RECORD KEEPING Clause 26 Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that taxpayers must keep sufficient records to support their claim for an R&D tax credit. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that:  persons who receive an R&D tax credit be required to keep sufficient records to support their R&D claim;  approved research providers be required to keep sufficient records to show: - they meet the requirements to be an approved research provider; and - the amounts derived and incurred by them in performing R&D activities on behalf of other persons. The records must be kept for seven years after the end of the income year to which the records relate. Inland Revenue will provide further guidance on the records firms are required to keep. Background The rationale for requiring taxpayers to keep records is so that they are able to substantiate their claim. Detailed analysis Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which sets out the keeping of business and other records, is being amended to require persons receiving an R&D tax credit and approved research providers to keep, for seven years, sufficient records so that the Commissioner may readily ascertain:  the amount of the person’s credit; or 76  in the case of approved research providers, their compliance with the requirements to be an approved research provider, and the amounts incurred by them in performing R&D activities on behalf of others. For Inland Revenue to calculate and approve the R&D tax credit, the claim must be based on records which identify the creator and the date of creation, not records which are backdated or created at year end. These record keeping requirements go beyond the general financial records that businesses must keep under section 22. Claiming an R&D tax credit A person claiming an R&D tax credit will need to keep records for seven years to substantiate the following:  eligibility;  R&D activity; and  R&D expenditure. The type of evidence required to substantiate the above will include project documentation (such as log sheets, project plans and test results), as well as minutes of meetings, internal reports, receipts and contracts. The onus is on the person claiming the credit to have sufficient records. This means that where the person has engaged a contractor to perform the R&D activities, the person will need to ensure that the contractor provides them with the required evidence, of the activities undertaken and the expenditure incurred. Business eligibility Records will need to be kept to evidence the following:  an R&D activity is performed in New Zealand;  the person carries on business in New Zealand;  the person, or a company in the same corporate group has the R&D controlling rights over the R&D activity; and  that: - the person, or a company that is in the same group of companies as the person and is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement, owns the results of the R&D activity; or - the person has the ability to use the results for no further consideration. R&D activity It is proposed that a person must keep records to demonstrate that the activities they undertook met the definition of R&D activity. The type of records that must be kept include records which show: 77  the purpose of the R&D;  the scientific or technological uncertainty the R&D intends to resolve;  why that uncertainty could not be resolved by information that is publicly available or deductible by a competent professional;  the systematic approach that was undertaken to try resolve the uncertainty; and  the nature of any supporting activities, and evidence to show they were integral to the core R&D activity. R&D expenditure Records kept in relation to expenditure will need to be sufficiently detailed to show:  the connection between the expenditure and the eligible R&D activities;  that the expenditure is on the list of eligible expenditure, and not on the list of ineligible expenditure;  evidence of reasonable apportionment methods where the expenditure is incurred on R&D and non-R&D activities. For example, a time recording system or weekly project report to show the extent to which staff costs relate to eligible R&D activities;  where R&D expenditure is incurred in a commercial production environment (see the section on Eligible expenditure (page 30) for more information), evidence that the expenditure is additional expenditure. That is, the expenditure would not have been incurred in the absence of the R&D activity);  the proportion of expenditure incurred on R&D activities conducted outside New Zealand; and  the amount of expenditure incurred on internal software development. Approved research providers An approved research provider will need to keep records to show that they meet the requirements of proposed new section 15ZB(4):  are capable of performing R&D activities on behalf of others and are available to do so;  have, in New Zealand, the necessary facilities to perform those activities; and  perform, or will perform, those R&D activities on behalf of others for market value consideration. In addition, an approved research provider will need to keep records of the R&D activities they perform for others and the associated expenditure, to the same detail as described above. 78 R&D SUPPLEMENTARY RETURNS Clauses 27–29 Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that a person who wishes to claim an R&D tax credit must file an R&D supplementary return within 30 days of filing their tax return for the relevant income year. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that:  a person claiming an R&D tax credit must file an R&D supplementary return in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner within 30 days of filing their income tax return for the relevant income year;  the Commissioner must prescribe one or more electronic formats in which a person’s R&D supplementary return must be filed; and  the Commissioner may also set specifications for software for use in prepopulating the R&D supplementary return. Background The rationale behind requiring a person to file an R&D supplementary return is to provide information to substantiate their claim for an R&D tax credit. It is important for the fiscal sustainability of the scheme that the credit is only provided for legitimate R&D. Data will also be used for statistical and analytical purposes, for instance evaluating the R&D tax credit regime policies’ effectiveness. In the future software will be able to be used to extract relevant information and assist in completing a person’s supplementary return. This is why it is proposed that the Commissioner has the ability to set specifications for such software. Detailed analysis R&D supplementary return (clause 27) Clause 27 proposes that a person must file an R&D supplementary return in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner by the date they are required to file their tax return for the year. 79 The tax credit will be a claimed through the person’s tax return, with the supplementary return attached as evidence of the claim. Electronic formats (clause 28) Clause 28 requires the Commissioner to prescribe one or more electronic formats in which the return must be filed. Prescribing the electronic format includes the way the information must be delivered, as well as the content. Clause 28 also allows the Commissioner to set specifications for software for use in prepopulating R&D supplementary returns. Content of supplementary return In the first year of the tax credit, taxpayers will be asked for a description of their R&D activity and expenditure incurred. The required information will include:  Activities: - What systematic approach was used to conduct the activity? - What new knowledge, process, service or good did the eligible R&D aim to produce? - What scientific or technological uncertainty did the activity seek to resolve? - Why could the scientific or technological uncertainty not be resolved using publicly available knowledge or knowledge deducible by a competent professional working in the relevant scientific or technological field? - For supporting activities, why were they integral to the core activity?  Expenditure – broken down indicatively into categories such as: - Employee remuneration; - Depreciation; - Consumables; - Overheads; - Net cost of items used in, or subject to, a process or transformation; - Expenditure on internal software development; and - Expenditure incurred on R&D activities conducted outside New Zealand. Taxpayers who are subject to the general in-year approval process (see the section on Approval: general approval process (year two) (page 95) for more information) will mainly provide expenditure information with their tax return, as information on their activities will have been provided during the year. However, they will be required to provide a declaration that their activities haven’t materially changed from how they 80 were described in their in-year approval application, and allocate their claimed expenditure to the relevant approved activity. The onus is on the person claiming the credit to provide the required detail. This means that where the person has engaged a contractor to perform the R&D activities, the person will need to ensure that the contractor provides them with enough information regarding the activities undertaken and the associated expenditure. 81 Integrity measures 82 83 AMENDMENTS TO SECRECY PROVISIONS Clause 31 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes amendments to existing secrecy provisions to ensure Inland Revenue is able to communicate information to other state sector entities for evaluating, administering, reporting statistics on, and forming the policy for the R&D tax credit regime. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features The proposed amendments to section 81(4)(w) and (x) will enable Inland Revenue to share information with other state sector entities. These provisions, as currently enacted, amend Inland Revenue’s secrecy requirements for the R&D tax loss cash-out regime. The proposed amendment to section 81(4)(w) empowers Inland Revenue to share any information reasonably necessary for a representative of the Treasury, Callaghan Innovation, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), or a state sector entity charged with any functions relating to R&D advice or incentives to undertake the following: evaluate the R&D tax credit regime in accordance with proposed new section LY 10; administer the R&D tax credit and R&D tax loss cash-out regimes; report statistics on the R&D tax credit and R&D tax loss cash-out regimes; and form policy for the R&D tax credit and R&D tax loss cash-out regimes. The proposed amendments to section 81(4)(x) allow Inland Revenue to share any information reasonably necessary for a representative of MBIE or Callaghan Innovation to perform their work relating to offering R&D advice and incentives. Background The R&D tax credit regime is an MBIE-led cross-agency initiative aimed at encouraging greater levels of business R&D. New section LY 10 proposes that the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation evaluate the tax credit and report to Parliament every five years. Inland Revenue 84 needs to be able to communicate to MBIE the information required for the Minister to prepare the report. It is expected that Inland Revenue, with the assistance of Callaghan Innovation (or another state sector entity), will be primarily responsible for administering the R&D tax credit and R&D tax loss cash-out regimes from the 2019–20 income year. Inland Revenue intends to share statistical information on the R&D tax credit and R&D tax loss cash-out regimes with Statistics New Zealand, to gain insights about business R&D in New Zealand. Claim information will be integrated into the Statistics New Zealand Longitudinal Business Database and the National Research Information System. Information held by Statistics New Zealand will be anonymised. Policy formation of the R&D tax credit regime to date has primarily involved Inland Revenue, MBIE, Callaghan Innovation and the Treasury. Any future policy development of the R&D tax credit or R&D tax loss cash-out regimes will continue to be undertaken across multiple state sector agencies. Therefore, Inland Revenue needs to have the ability to share information with other agencies for this purpose. 85 PUBLICATION OF CLAIM DETAILS Clause 30 (proposed new section 68CE) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that the Commissioner be required to publish the name of each person, and their eligible R&D expenditure amount in dollar bands, two years after the end of the tax year to which an R&D tax credit claim relates. Application date From the 2019–20 income years. Key features Proposed new section 68CE requires the Commissioner to publish the names of people who have received R&D tax credits, and the amount of eligible R&D expenditure claimed, in appropriate dollar bands. The Commissioner must not publish a person’s name and band until at least two years have passed since the end of the tax year to which the person’s R&D tax credit relates. Background Publishing the names of R&D tax credits recipients and the bands within which their eligible R&D expenditure claims fall provides transparency about how the R&D tax credit regime is operating. Similar information is currently published by Callaghan Innovation for Growth Grants. The Commissioner will delay publishing claim information until two years have passed to avoid publishing commercially sensitive information. Example 24: Claim details publication (illustrative only – actual publication format may vary) In the 2019–20 tax year:  Kawhia Ltd claims $79,00 of eligible R&D expenditure;  Marsden Ltd claims $695,000 of eligible R&D expenditure; and  Northland Ltd claims $50,000,000 of eligible R&D expenditure. After 1 April 2022, the Commissioner publishes the following details in an online publication: Tax year Claimant Expenditure band 2019–20 Kawhia Ltd Less than $100,000 2019–20 Marsden Ltd $500,000 to $1,000,000 2019–20 Northland Ltd $50,00,000 to $120,000,000 86 EVALUATION Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 10) and 31 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that an objective and independent evaluation will be carried out on the R&D tax credit regime every five years. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 10 of the Income Tax 2007 requires the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation to report to Parliament on the R&D tax credit regime every five years. The first report will be due as soon as practicable after the end of the 2023/24 tax year. The Minister’s report must objectively and independently evaluate the R&D tax credit regime on:  delivery of the policy intent of the regime;  to what extent the regime is stimulating expenditure on R&D activities;  compliance costs of the regime for taxpayers;  administration costs of the regime for government; and  the extent to which claimants are complying with the legal requirements of the regime. The proposed amendment to section 81(w) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides Inland Revenue with the ability to communicate the information necessary for an evaluation of the R&D tax credit regime to take place in accordance with proposed new section LY 10. Background Other jurisdictions’ experience with R&D tax credit regimes indicates that regular, independent evaluations are important to ensure an R&D tax credit regime continues to function as intended. Regular evaluations will ensure any deficiencies with the regime are identified and addressed through legislative or operational change. 87 FLEXIBILITY: ORDERS IN COUNCIL Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 9) and 22 (proposed new schedules 21 and 21B) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that the Governor-General have the ability to make changes to schedules 21 and 21B on the joint recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section LY 9 empowers the Governor-General to amend proposed new schedules 21 (excluded activities) and 21B (eligible and ineligible expenditure). Background The flexibility offered by the ability to amend schedules 21 and 21B by Order in Council is necessary for three key reasons:  Given the constant and sometimes unpredictable advances of science and technology, it is impossible to fully anticipate all possible R&D activities and determine whether these activities should be incentivised by the R&D tax credit or some other support mechanism. Therefore, having the ability to amend the lists of excluded activities is necessary so that they do not remain static while science and technology continues to progress.  It enables the Government to make changes to the lists where the Government’s policy intent has changed.  The Government needs to be able to add or remove activities and expenditure from the lists to close off problem areas that could impact on the fiscal sustainability of the R&D tax credit regime. 88 BINDING RULINGS Clause 24 Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that taxpayers will not be able to obtain binding rulings as to whether they are eligible for an R&D tax credit. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features The definition of proscribed question has been amended to include a question that relates to R&D tax credits under subpart LY of the Income Tax Act 2007. This prevents taxpayers from obtaining binding rulings, as the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if it would require the Commissioner to determine a proscribed question (section 91E(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Background It is proposed that binding rulings are not available in the first year of the R&D tax credit regime as Inland Revenue will not have sufficient resources to consider them. From the 2020–21 income year, most claimants will be required to get in-year approval of their activity to qualify for R&D tax credits (see the section on Approval: general approval process (year two) (page 95) for more information). 89 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULE Clauses 7 (proposed new section GB 56) and 10 (proposed new section LY 1(4)) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed new section GB 56 introduces an anti-avoidance rule for arrangements involving R&D tax credits. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed new section GB 56, which introduces an anti-avoidance rule in the context of R&D tax credits, applies where:  an arrangement has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the R&D tax credit legislation in subpart LY; and/or  eligible R&D expenditure for relevant goods and services is more than the market value. Under the rule the Commissioner may reduce the person’s entitlement to the R&D tax credit to the amount the Commissioner considers would have arisen if the arrangement or inflated transaction had not occurred. The rule applies regardless of whether the relevant person is a party to the arrangement or inflated transaction. Background The proposed anti-avoidance rule has been drafted broadly to catch expenditure misallocation and contrived R&D activities, even where the person that benefits from the arrangement is not a party to it. The reconstruction provision refers to reducing the person’s entitlement. This means that where there is an offending arrangement, the Commissioner may still give a credit for any legitimate expenditure that is part of the arrangement. An anti-avoidance rule is necessary to uphold the integrity of the regime and to ensure government money is not misappropriated. 90 PENALTIES Clauses 36 and 37 Summary of proposed amendment It is proposed that the promoter penalty regime is extended to include people offering schemes involving R&D tax credits. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features Proposed amendments to section 141EC extend the promoter penalties regime to include a person providing services on a contingency fee basis in relation to R&D tax credit claims. This means that promoters of R&D tax credit schemes will be liable for a penalty where the requirements of section 141EB are met. The Bill proposes amendments to the definition of promoter, so that a promoter includes a person party to, or significantly involved in, formulating software from which an arrangement is offered. Background The Bill extends the promoter penalty regime to include promoters of R&D tax credit schemes to disincentivise the promotion of such schemes. 91 DEADLINES FOR FILING AND AMENDING ASSESSMENTS Clauses 10 (proposed new section LY 3(2)(a)) and 32–34 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes to limit taxpayers’ ability to retrospectively claim an R&D tax credit. Application date From the 2019–20 income year. Key features It is proposed that:  a taxpayer must file their income tax return within one year after the due date for filing if they wish to claim an R&D tax credit;  the Commissioner may not increase the amount of a person’s R&D tax credit after two years from the due date of the person’s tax income tax return; and  an R&D tax credit claim, once filed, can only be amended once. A request to amend a claim must be made within two years of the date on which a person’s income tax return is due for the relevant income year. Background The rationale behind the above amendments is to limit a person’s ability to retrospectively reclassify their expenditure. This includes where R&D activities or expenditure is identified after the end of an income year. If a person receives R&D tax credits for R&D they were unaware of at the time the R&D activities took place, the R&D tax credit regime has not provided any incentive to the person to undertake additional R&D. The proposed time limits are intended to give people enough time to prepare the required information and make any necessary adjustments to their claims, while discouraging the retrospective reclassification of expenditure. Detailed analysis Filing deadline Proposed new section LY 3(2)(a) prevents a taxpayer from claiming an R&D tax credit if they have not filed their tax return for the relevant year within one year after the due date for filing. 92 For example, a person with an extension of time arrangement for the year ended 31 March 2019 has to file their income tax return for that year by 31 March 2020. The effect of section LY 3(2)(a) is that if the person has not filed by 31 March 2021 (which is one year after the person’s due date for filing), the person cannot make an R&D tax credit claim. Time bar The Bill proposes amendments to the time bar in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, so that the Commissioner cannot increase the amount of a person’s R&D tax credit if two years have passed from the due date of the person’s tax return for the relevant tax year. Notice of proposed adjustments (NOPA) and section 113 adjustments A person is only able to adjust their R&D tax credit claim upwards once, and must do so within two years of the due date of their income tax return for the relevant income year. This restriction applies whether a person issues a NOPA or requests an amendment under section 113. 93 In-year approval 94 95 APPROVAL: GENERAL APPROVAL PROCESS (YEAR TWO) Clauses 38, 39, 43 and 44 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that persons intending to apply for R&D tax credits must, in most circumstances, obtain approval of their core activities for each income year. Application date From the 2020–21 income year. Key features From the 2020–21 income year, all persons (including LTCs and partnerships) will be required to obtain approval under proposed new section 68CB or section 68CC. The default rule is in proposed new section 68CB, which requires anyone intending to apply for an R&D tax credit for an income year to obtain approval of their core activities (general approval). General approval can last for up to three income years. Applications for approval must be made by the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year. For a person with a standard balance date with eligible R&D expenditure in the year ended 31 March 2021, the person would need to apply for general approval by 7 May 2021. Without general approval, a person is not able to obtain R&D tax credits for an income year, unless they satisfy the requirements of, and choose to apply, proposed new section 68CC. Under proposed new section 68CC, a person may opt-out of the general approval regime if they satisfy certain requirements, including a requirement that the person (or their partnership or corporate group) has, or reasonably estimates that they will have, more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year. See the section on Approval: significant performer regime (year two) (page 99) for more information. A decision made by the Commissioner under the proposed new sections cannot be challenged, except through judicial review. Background General approval is designed to:  provide certainty;  act as an integrity measure; and  shift the timing, and burden, of compliance and administrative costs so that it is easier on both government and people making R&D tax credit claims. 96 Certainty General approval is intended to provide people making R&D tax credit claims with greater certainty, because they will be able to obtain approval of their core activities while they are undertaking them. Operational constraints mean that general approval will only be available from the 2020–21 income year. Integrity measure Requiring people to obtain general approval acts as an integrity measure, because it ensures they apply for approval of their core activities when (or slightly before or after) they are actually performing their R&D activities. As a result, general approval:  increases the likelihood that R&D tax credits are only paid out to those persons who were aware that they were performing R&D activities in the relevant income year; and  makes it easier to identify that there is scientific or technological uncertainty than would be the case if the examination occurred one or two years after the R&D activity has been completed. Other benefits In other jurisdictions, government approval of core activities and the certainty this provides has enabled people with approval to obtain R&D funding more easily. In these jurisdictions, lenders take government approval into account when providing funding for R&D activities. Detailed analysis General approval not available in year one General approval will only available from the 2020–21 income year onwards (see clause 38. Modification to general eligibility criteria in year two (section LY 3(1)(b)) A proposed amendment to section LY 3, through the insertion of new paragraph (b), ensures that obtaining general approval or opting into the significant performer regime is a prerequisite for any persons seeking to obtain R&D tax credits. Proposed new section 68CB sets out the general approval process. Section 68CC provides an alternate approval process for persons who have $2 million or more of eligible R&D in an income year and choose to opt out of the general approval process. Application deadline Applications for general approval must be made by the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year. 97 Example 25: Application deadline for standard balance date taxpayer Taylor Ltd has a 31 March balance date. It wants to obtain general approval for the year ended 31 March 2021. Taylor Ltd will need to ensure it applies for general approval by 7 May 2021. Example 26: Application deadline for non-standard balance date taxpayer Pym Ltd has a 31 December balance date. It wants to obtain general approval for the year ended 31 December 2020. Pym Ltd will need to ensure it applies for general approval by 7 February 2021. Application requirements Applications for general approval must set out the activities a person wants approved as core activities, the income years the person wants the general approval to apply for, and any other information required by the Commissioner. Once general approval is granted, the Commissioner must notify the person which activities are approved as core activities, the income years for which the general approval applies, and any conditions of the general approval. The Commissioner’s decision to approve or reject a general approval application cannot be challenged. Impact on core and supporting activities General approval can only be obtained for core activities. Expenditure on supporting activities is only eligible to the extent the supporting activities relate to approved core activities. General approval is binding if certain requirements are met General approval is valid and binding on the Commissioner if:  a person’s application is accurate;  the person satisfies any conditions of the general approval that have been set by the Commissioner; and  there is no change to subpart LY (and any associated provisions) that materially alters the basis on which the general approval was provided. If the Commissioner has provided general approval for more than one income year under section 68 CB(3), then the person must provide the Commissioner with confirmation that they have continued to satisfy the conditions of their general approval. 98 Varying an existing general approval A person can apply to vary an existing general approval if their circumstances change. An application to do this must be submitted by the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year (which is the same application deadline for new general approval applications). Opting out of the general approval regime A person can opt out of the general approval regime if they satisfy the requirements of proposed new section 68CC(1), which says that section 68CC applies if a person:  chooses to opt out of the general approval regime; and  has more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year, or reasonably estimates that they will have more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year. A person can also satisfy the $2 million threshold by grouping their expenditure with other members of their corporate group. A person in partnership with others is not assessed individually. The person satisfies the $2 million threshold if their partnership has more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure in an income year. 99 APPROVAL: SIGNIFICANT PERFORMER REGIME (YEAR TWO) Clauses 38, 39, 42, 43 and 44 Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes that persons with more than $2 million of eligible expenditure in an income year have the ability to opt out of the general approval process and into the significant performer regime. Application date From the 2020–21 income year. Key features From the 2020–21 income year, all persons will be required to obtain approval under either proposed new section 68CB or section 68CC. The default rule is general approval, which is in proposed new section 68CB. See the section on Approval: general approval process (year two) (page 95) for more information. An alternative to the general approval process, the significant performer regime, is available to persons who have (or reasonably estimate that they will have) more than $2 million of eligible expenditure in an income year. A person must notify the Commissioner if they wish to opt out of the general approval process and into the significant performer regime. A decision made by the Commissioner under the proposed new sections cannot be challenged, except through judicial review. Significant performer regime requirements People who opt into the significant performer regime are not able to obtain general approval of their core activities. Instead, they need to notify the Commissioner of their intention to opt into the significant performer regime, and provide an estimate of the amount of eligible expenditure they expect to incur for the income year. All people in the significant performer regime must provide R&D certificates alongside their R&D supplementary returns. Optional criteria approval People in the significant performer regime can apply for approval from the Commissioner of their criteria and methodologies for determining the eligibility of their R&D activities and expenditure (“criteria approval”). Criteria approval is optional, and can be granted for up to three income years. The Commissioner can revoke a criteria approval from the beginning of an income year if she considers that a person has classified their activities or expenditure in a 100 way that defeats the intent and purpose of the R&D tax credit regime. The Commissioner’s decision to grant, decline, or revoke a criteria approval cannot be challenged. Background Significant performers are exempt from the general approval process, if they wish to be, because:  the size of their R&D spend indicates they are mature R&D performers who are likely to have robust systems in place; and  they are less likely to desire the certainty provided by in-year approval, as the maturity makes them more likely to know whether their activities are eligible core or supporting activities. Significant R&D performers must notify the Commissioner by the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year if they want to opt-out of the general approval regime. This deadline is the same for general approval applications, for ease of compliance and administration. Requiring significant R&D performers to obtain R&D certificates will provide the Commissioner with the assurance that these claimants have the processes expected of mature R&D performers. Detailed analysis Modification to general eligibility criteria in year two (section LY 3(1)(b)) A proposed amendment to section LY 3, through the insertion of new paragraph (b), ensures that obtaining general approval or opting into the significant performer regime is a prerequisite for any persons seeking to obtain R&D tax credits. More than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure For a person to be eligible for the significant performer regime, they must have (or reasonably expect that they will have) more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the relevant income year. The expenditure of partners in partnership, as well as companies in the same group of companies, can be grouped when determining this. 101 Example 27: Partners in partnership Mike and Jay are in partnership together. In the 2020–21 income year, both partners reasonably expect to incur less than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure individually, but as a whole the partnership will satisfy the $2 million threshold. Estimate of eligible R&D expenditure for the year ended 31 March 2021 Partner Expenditure Mike $1.5m Jay $1.2m Total $2.7m The partnership is able to opt in to the significant performer regime because it reasonably expects to incur $2.7 million of eligible R&D expenditure in the 2020–21 income year. Example 28: Members of the same corporate group Papaya Ltd reasonably estimates that it will have $1.5 million of eligible R&D expenditure for the 2020–21 income year. It is wholly owned by Tropical Fruit Ltd, which also owns Mango Ltd. Mango Ltd reasonably estimates that it will have $800,000 of eligible R&D expenditure for the 2020– 21 income year. Papaya Ltd and Mango Ltd are able to group their expenditure to determine their eligibility for the significant performer regime. Since their combined expenditure estimate is $2.3 million, they satisfy the $2 million threshold. Notification deadline People who wish to opt in to the significant performer regime must notify the Commissioner by the seventh day of the second month after the end of the relevant income year. They must also notify the Commissioner of their expenditure estimate by this date. Example 29: Notification deadline for standard balance date taxpayer Rainbow Ltd has a 31 March balance date. It has $2.5m of eligible R&D expenditure for the year ended 31 March 2021. If Rainbow Ltd wants to opt in to the significant performer regime, it will need to notify the Commissioner and provide an expenditure estimate by 7 May 2021. 102 Example 30: Application deadline for non-standard balance date taxpayer Pot of Gold Ltd has a 31 December balance date, which is an early balance date. It reasonably expects to incur $3 million in the year ended 31 December 2020, and wants to opt into the significant performer regime. Pot of Gold Ltd notifies the Commissioner of its intention to opt into the significant performer regime on 1 February 2021. It provides the Commissioner with a summary of the expenditure it estimates it has incurred in the year ended 31 December 2020. Pot of Gold Ltd has complied with the requirement that notification must be provided to the Commissioner by the seventh day of the second month following the end of the relevant income year. R&D certificates If a person opts into the significant performer regime, they are required to supply the Commissioner with an R&D certificate alongside their R&D supplementary return (see the section on R&D supplementary returns (page 78) for more information). The information R&D certificates must contain is not prescribed by legislation, but it is expected that R&D certificates will confirm that:  an R&D certifier (typically a law or accounting firm) has reviewed a sample of a person’s eligible R&D expenditure;  the expenditure sample reviewed by the R&D certifier was calculated in accordance with the R&D tax credit rules; and  the person actually incurred, or was reasonable in estimating that they would incur, more than $2 million of eligible R&D expenditure in the relevant income year. R&D certifiers Proposed new section 15ZC sets out the requirements for R&D certificates and R&D certifiers (referred to as “accepted research and development certifiers” in the Bill). A person is an R&D certifier if they:  have requested approval from the Commissioner in the prescribed form;  have not had their R&D certifier approval revoked in the last two years;  have made a statutory declaration that they are competent in applying appropriate accounting and legal standards in relation to R&D tax credits;  have declared any other matters the Commissioner requires them to declare for assuring the Commissioner that they have the legal, accounting, and scientific expertise to complete R&D certificates; and  the Commissioner approves their application. 103 Once the Commissioner approves a person’s application to be an R&D certifier, the Commissioner must notify the person and publish the approval in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. The Commissioner is able to revoke approval of an R&D certifier at her discretion. If approval is revoked, this must be published in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. If an R&D certifier provides an R&D certificate to a person in relation to an income year, and the person subsequently receives a shortfall penalty in relation to R&D tax credits for the income year, the Commissioner must revoke the R&D certifier’s approval. The Commissioner will not revoke an approval, however, where a person has wilfully misled the R&D certifier. Once approval is revoked, the R&D certifier may not be reinstated as an R&D certifier for two years. The Commissioner’s decision to approve, decline to approve, or revoke the approval of an R&D certifier cannot be challenged. Optional criteria approval People who opt into the significant performer regime are able to apply for optional criteria approval. Application requirements Applications for criteria approval must detail:  the criteria and methodologies the person wants the Commissioner to approve;  the income years the criteria approval will apply for; and  any other information required by the Commissioner. Commissioner’s approval The Commissioner is able to approve appropriate criteria methodologies that the person can use to determine whether their R&D activities and expenditure are eligible. Once criteria approval is granted, the Commissioner must notify the person what criteria and methodologies the Commissioner approves of, the period for which the criteria approval applies, and any conditions of the criteria approval. Approval is binding on the Commissioner if certain requirements met Criteria approval is valid and binding on the Commissioner if:  a person’s application is accurate;  the person satisfies any conditions of the criteria approval that have been imposed by the Commissioner;  there is no change to subpart LY (and any associated provisions) that materially alters the basis on which the criteria approval was provided; and 104  the person satisfies the other requirements of the significant performer regime (that is, the person satisfies the $2 million threshold and supplies an R&D certificate alongside their R&D supplementary return). Commissioner can revoke criteria approval The Commissioner can revoke a criteria approval from the beginning of an income year if she considers that a person has classified their activities or expenditure in a way that defeats the intent and purpose of the R&D tax credit regime. The Commissioner’s decision to approve, decline to approve, or revoke a criteria approval cannot be challenged. 105 Appendices 106 107 APPENDIX 1: ADMINISTRATION The Bill contains requirements about a person’s compliance obligations so that they can receive the tax credit, such as:  record keeping (see the section on Record keeping, page 75);  electronic filing and deadlines for filing (see the section on R&D supplementary returns, page 78); and  in-year activity approval (see the section on Approval: general approval process (year two), page 95). This appendix covers how the R&D tax credit will be administered. The tax credit will be administered by Inland Revenue with support from Callaghan Innovation. Callaghan Innovation will bring technical research and scientific knowledge to support the on-going administration of the tax credit. Businesses will not be able to receive the tax credit in the same year as a Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant. Businesses who currently receive a Growth Grant will be supported through their transition by Callaghan Innovation. There will be a dedicated R&D tax incentive delivery team to manage the approval processes and general support to businesses considering and applying for a R&D tax credit. Businesses will apply for the tax credit through a calculation on the corresponding income tax return and by submitting an electronic supplementary return which details the associated R&D activity and expenditure. This will also include any relevant eligibility tests and calculations about the refundability of the tax credit for businesses in loss. Businesses will be able to apply for both the tax credit and the existing R&D tax loss cash-out (as provided for by subpart MX) in the same financial year. Businesses will need to submit full application information to satisfy the eligibility criteria for both of these, however there will be support available to assist them through the process. The first year of the tax credit will be administered as a complete end-of-year process at the same time as the filing and processing of a business’s income tax return. From year two of the tax credit businesses will be required to seek in-year activity approval, and submit end-of-year expenditure information. From year two of the tax credit, for in-year approval there will be two regimes available:  general approval process – any eligible R&D performing business; and  significant R&D performer – businesses who expect to spend in excess of $2 million on eligible R&D expenditure. 108 Organisations will be able to apply to Inland Revenue to become approved research providers for the tax credit. From year two, organisations will be able to apply to become approved R&D certifiers for the significant R&D performer approval. Once the Bill is enacted Inland Revenue will publish more detailed information about the administration of the R&D tax credit, such as detailed record keeping guidance, process for becoming an approved research provider, the tax credit service model, electronic tax credit enrolment process, approval processes, and the electronic application process. 109 APPENDIX 2: FLOW CHARTS Flow chart 1: Outline of the R&D incentive policy Ineligible for the R&D tax credit R&D tax credit = 0.15 x total eligible R&D expenditure Has the person filed their tax return and R&D supplementary return by the deadline?

This includes goods and services imported for consumption in New Zealand. The New Zealand Customs Service is currently responsible for collecting GST on imported goods at the border. However because of the administrative cost, GST is not currently collected on imported goods attracting less than $60 in GST or other levies. 1.2 The advent of the internet and the growth of online shopping has in recent times seen a rapid increase in sales of imported low-value goods. This has consequences for the tax base if consumers are shifting their buying from domestic to offshore retailers. It also places domestic retailers at an unfair disadvantage. This is a problem faced by tax authorities around the world. 1.3 This public consultation document seeks submissions on the design of a system that would require offshore suppliers to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers. Offshore suppliers would therefore be required to register for GST with Inland Revenue just as New Zealand domestic retailers are. The offshore supplier registration system would apply to goods valued at or below $400 1 and is intended to address the non-collection of GST on imported goods below the current de minimis. 1.4 Implementing an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods is consistent with recent changes New Zealand has made to deal with the non-collection of GST on cross-border services and intangibles. The cross-border rules, which applied from 1 October 2016, require suppliers of cross-border services and intangibles (including e-books, digital downloads and software) to register and return GST when they supply services and intangibles to New Zealand-resident consumers. 1.5 The system outlined in this consultation document is also broadly in line with recent international developments. In Australia a similar approach will apply to all imported goods valued at or below AU$1,000 supplied to Australian consumers from 1 July 2018. The European Commission indicated in December 2016 that European Union (EU) Member States would use a variant of an offshore supplier registration system to collect value-added tax (VAT) on low-value imported goods from outside the EU by 2021. The EU also currently uses an offshore supplier registration model to collect VAT on intra-EU cross-border supplies of goods. 1 All monetary values in this discussion document are denominated in New Zealand dollars unless otherwise stated. 2 Background 1.6 New Zealand’s GST system is a broad-based consumption tax, based on the destination principle. This means that all goods and services should be subject to GST when they are consumed in New Zealand. Consistent with this principle, GST should ideally be collected on all imported goods, regardless of value. 1.7 Under the current rules, the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) collects revenue (GST, tariff duty and cost recovery charges) on imported goods when $60 or more of total duty (including GST) applies. This threshold is known as the de minimis and generally equates to a parcel valued at approximately $400. However, the value of a parcel on which revenue is collected could be as low as $226 depending on whether tariffs are collected. 1.8 The growth of online shopping means the volume of imported low-value goods on which GST is not collected is becoming significant. This indicates that the current settings are not sustainable. In particular, concerns have been raised about the impact that the uneven GST treatment may have on tax revenues and on the competitiveness of domestic suppliers. Options for collecting GST on low-value imported goods 1.9 There are a number of options for collecting GST on low-value imported goods, based on different points along the supply chain. These are:  At the point of sale: offshore suppliers would be required to register for, collect and return GST (“offshore supplier registration”).  Between the point of sale and delivery: courier companies and New Zealand Post would collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges (“extended status quo”).  After delivery of the goods: recipients would pay GST directly to the government after the goods have been delivered (“pay after delivery”). 1.10 In January 2018, the Government asked the Tax Working Group (the Group) to consider options for collecting GST on low-value goods imported into New Zealand. The Group was established to examine improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of New Zealand’s tax system; accordingly, the Government has used the Group’s expertise to consider the merits of potential reforms to the mechanism for collecting GST on low-value imported goods. 1.11 The Group considered all of the options listed above and has recommended the Government implement an offshore supplier registration model for collecting GST on low-value imported goods. The Group considered options to collect GST on imported goods between the point of sale and delivery and after delivery, but recognised that practical concerns mean these two options may not be feasible in the short term. 3 1.12 The Group’s conclusions are consistent with the findings of the Australian Productivity Commission, who also considered options other than offshore supplier registration to be less feasible at the present time. New rules for collecting GST on low-value imported goods 1.13 If enacted, the new rules would require offshore suppliers to register and collect GST on all goods (except alcohol and tobacco products) supplied to New Zealand consumers valued at $400 or less. 2 Offshore suppliers would only be required to register if their total supplies of goods and services to New Zealand consumers exceed $60,000 a year. 3 Offshore marketplaces and re-deliverers would be required to register and return GST if supplies made through them meet the registration threshold. Tariffs and cost recovery charges 4 would not be collected on goods valued at or below $400. The existing border processes to collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on imports above $400 will remain unchanged. Summary of the proposals Scope of the rules  Offshore suppliers would be required to register, collect and return GST on supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers if the value of the goods is $400 or less. Tariffs and cost recovery charges would no longer be collected on goods valued at or below this value.  Goods supplied to GST-registered businesses would be excluded unless the offshore supplier decided to zero-rate the supply (this would allow offshore suppliers to claim costs associated with business-to-business supplies).  Offshore suppliers would be required to charge GST unless the recipient identified themselves as a GST-registered business or provided their GST registration number or New Zealand Business Number.  A reverse charge (that is, when the recipient of the goods accounts for the GST) would apply to GST-registered recipients that use goods for non-taxable purposes (such as private purposes). 2 Unless otherwise stated, references to goods valued at or below $400 are exclusive of GST. 3 This is in line with the fact that New Zealand suppliers and offshore suppliers of cross-border services are already required to register for and charge GST if they have over $60,000 of taxable supplies. 4 The existing cost recovery charge of $49.24 charged by Customs at the border comprises two separate departmental levies: an Import Entry Transaction Fee of $29.26 and a Biosecurity System Entry Levy of $19.98. 4 Registration requirements and return filing  Offshore suppliers would be required to register if their total supplies of goods and services to New Zealand exceed $60,000 a year (the registration threshold).  Offshore marketplaces and re-deliverers would be required to register and return GST if they meet the registration threshold.  A simplified “pay only” registration system is proposed to minimise compliance costs for offshore suppliers.  Quarterly GST filing is proposed for offshore suppliers of low-value goods. Enforcement, compliance and penalties  New Zealand has international agreements with a number of jurisdictions (including our major trading partners) that include “Assistance in Collection” provisions. This means that if a non- resident supplier fails to comply with their New Zealand tax obligations, New Zealand can ask the relevant foreign tax authority to use its enforcement powers to help collect the GST on New Zealand's behalf.  The existing penalties and use-of-money interest rules would apply to offshore suppliers as they do to domestic suppliers. In addition, existing penalties would apply to consumers that falsely represent themselves as a business to avoid GST.  For the worst offenders, the rules would provide Inland Revenue with discretion to require a consumer to register and pay the GST that should have been returned.  Further measures to bolster compliance will be explored, for example a possible joint registration system with other countries (such as Australia) or data matching programmes between tax jurisdictions or government agencies. This might include the sharing of information on registrations with Australia. Another possibility is the sharing of additional information with Customs. Maintaining effective border risk-management  Changes to the GST settings for low-value imported goods need to take into account implications for the way that risks to New Zealand are managed at the border.  Importers would still be required to provide information to Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries to support effective risk and biosecurity assessment on low-value imported goods. 5 Application date 1.14 The proposals in this discussion document require legislative changes and would apply from 1 October 2019. How to make a submission 1.15 Feedback is sought on the design of the offshore supplier registration system, including:  how the design of the proposed rules could be improved so they are more effective or have lower compliance costs;  whether there are any aspects of the proposed rules that would give rise to undue compliance costs;  whether there are any practical concerns with the proposed rules that would make them unworkable in practice; and  whether there are any concerns with changing the de minimis from a calculation of duty owing to a fixed threshold based on the total value of the goods imported, and whether the proposed $400 threshold is appropriate. 1.16 Send your submissions to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “GST on low- value imported goods” in the subject line. 1.17 Alternatively, send your submissions to: GST on low-value imported goods C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.18 The closing date for submissions is 29 June 2018. 1.19 It would be helpful, but not essential, for submissions to include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether the authors would like to be contacted by officials to discuss the points raised. 1.20 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason will be determined in accordance with that Act. You should make it clear if you consider any part of your submission should be withheld under the Official Information Act and the grounds you consider justify its withholding. 6 CHAPTER 2 Background New Zealand’s GST system 2.1 New Zealand’s GST is a broad-based consumption tax. It is generally levied at a single standard rate of 15%, 5 and there are very few exemptions. 6 Consumption taxes seek to tax consumer spending on goods and services. New Zealand’s GST system, along with other value-added tax (VAT) and GST systems around the world, is based on the destination principle. This means that goods and services are subject to GST when they are consumed in New Zealand. In principle, GST should therefore be applied to all goods consumed in New Zealand, including imported goods, regardless of value. 2.2 Conversely, goods and services that are exported (and therefore consumed offshore) are generally untaxed. Under the GST rules, exports are zero-rated, meaning GST is charged at a rate of zero percent and businesses can claim the GST back on the cost of their inputs. Allowing exporters to claim back GST on their inputs ensures that GST is not a cost on businesses or offshore consumers. 2.3 New Zealand’s GST system is regarded throughout the world as a model consumption tax. This is because our GST system is very broad-based – it applies to a wide range of goods and services and there are very few exemptions. When GST applies broadly it ensures that consumer decisions to purchase particular goods or services are not influenced or driven by tax considerations. This improves its efficiency and fairness, and provides simplicity. Current system for low-value imported goods 2.4 GST on imported goods is currently collected by Customs at the border. However, GST is not collected if the total duty value (including GST, tariffs and other duties) is less than $60. This is known as the “de minimis”. 2.5 Ideally, GST should be collected on all imported goods, as these goods are likely to be consumed in New Zealand. The rationale behind the de minimis threshold is to facilitate trade and achieve a balance between the cost of collection and the revenue received. In the New Zealand context, the de minimis was set at a level where it was estimated that the costs of collecting the duty begin to exceed the revenue the duty generates. New Zealand is required to have a de minimis to comply with international obligations. 7 5 Certain supplies are levied at a rate of zero percent (see sections 11 and 11A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985). 6 The key exemptions are supplies of residential accommodation and business-to-consumer supplies of financial services. 7 Protocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (June 1999). 7 2.6 Depending on freight costs, the $60 de minimis roughly equates to a parcel worth $400 if GST is the only duty applying. It can equate to a parcel with a much lower value when tariff duty applies or if the freight and insurance costs are high. 8 Tariff duties of five percent or ten percent apply to a range of goods, including some apparel and footwear. Cost recovery charges of $49.24 9 also apply to goods above the de minimis threshold stopped at the border. Example 1: Current system Melissa purchases active wear from a large offshore website. She pays $100 (inclusive of shipping). Apparel attracts a ten percent tariff duty where New Zealand does not have a free trade agreement with the country of the goods’ origin. Since the duty on the clothing is only $26.50 (comprising tariff duty of $10 ($100  10%) and $16.50 of GST ($110  15%), Melissa’s purchase is below the current de minimis threshold. She is not required to pay any duties to Customs on the active wear she purchases from offshore. The total cost of Melissa’s parcel is $100. Melissa later purchases a pair of running shoes from the same offshore website with a value of $300 (inclusive of shipping). Footwear also attracts a ten percent tariff duty. This means the total duty owing on Melissa’s running shoes is $79.50 (the 10% tariff of $30 plus GST of $49.50 ($330  15%)). This is above the current de minimis threshold. Melissa is required to pay GST and tariff duty on the running shoes. Melissa also has to pay the cost recovery charges of $49.24 to Customs. The total cost of Melissa’s parcel is $428.74. 2.7 Historically, the majority of imported goods have been imported by commercial entities in consignments above the de minimis. When GST was introduced in 1986, very few final consumers imported goods below the de minimis. Therefore, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported goods below the de minimis was considered to outweigh the benefits of taxation at that time. 2.8 However, the growth of online shopping and the practice of supplying goods directly to customers have meant that the volume of low-value goods imported by final consumers has significantly increased. Based on a five- year average, volumes are growing at about eighteen percent a year. 10 2.9 Given the nature of the current methods of collecting GST on imported goods, the growing volume of imported goods has meant the cost of collecting GST on these goods, and the GST revenue foregone, have both increased. 8 The de minimis does not apply to shipments of alcohol or tobacco products, as excise taxes are required to be collected on these goods. 9 This comprises two separate departmental levies: Customs’ Import Entry Transaction Fee of $29.26 and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ Biosecurity System Entry Levy of $19.98. 10 Based on Customs and New Zealand Post data. 8 Issues with the current system Competitive neutrality and tax distortions 2.10 In general, the increasing ability to easily purchase goods and services online has benefited New Zealand. It has given consumers greater access to a wider range of goods and services from around the world, and increased competition in the domestic retail market. Increased competition tends to encourage the efficient use of resources, which can result in lower prices, greater innovation, and better quality goods and services for consumers. 2.11 Despite these benefits, when GST does not apply evenly, it may bias consumer and business decisions, which could lead to unfair and inefficient outcomes. The non-collection of GST on imported goods below the de minimis creates a distortion in the tax system whereby the vast majority of goods valued below $400 that are purchased from offshore suppliers are not subject to GST, while all purchases from domestic retailers are subject to GST. 2.12 The current policy settings place domestic suppliers of goods at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore suppliers that are able to transport low-value goods directly to their customers without the imposition of GST. This is having the greatest impact on domestic sellers that provide goods that are similar to goods sold from offshore (or substitutable products). 2.13 There are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers might purchase goods online from offshore businesses, however, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. Foregone revenue 2.14 Furthermore, the growth of the online shopping market means the amount of GST not being collected on low-value goods supplied from offshore, but consumed in New Zealand, is increasing. 2.15 Estimating the total foregone revenue on imported low-value goods relies on a number of assumptions, and estimates of the foregone revenue vary. An estimate by Retail NZ, for example, places the total foregone revenue at $235 million a year. 11 2.16 In the 2015 discussion document, GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods, officials estimated the maximum potential foregone GST revenue for low-value imported goods was around $140 million a year. This estimate was derived from survey and credit card spending information. 2.17 Since then, further work has been undertaken by officials using a mixed dataset that includes Customs’ sample data of goods coming across the border. An estimate was calculated based on an assessment of the value of goods under the current de minimis. This work conservatively estimates that 11 http://www.retail.kiwi/advocacy/efairnessnz 9 the foregone GST revenue for the 2016 calendar year was around $80 million. Assuming a foregone revenue growth rate of ten percent a year, the foregone revenue is projected to grow to $127 million by 2021. 2.18 While it is difficult to estimate the total revenue foregone resulting from the non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods with certainty, it is clear that the numbers are significant and a growing concern for Government. 2.19 Government revenues pay for important public services such as education, healthcare, roads and superannuation. Given that over thirty percent of total tax revenue is collected from GST, an increasing gap in that revenue base becomes a concern for everyone who relies on these services. A shortfall in GST revenue may eventually have to be paid for by tax increases or spending cuts. International developments 2.20 Following the success of a number of countries’ rules (including New Zealand’s) to require offshore suppliers to collect VAT and GST on cross- border services and intangibles, there has been some interest internationally in requiring offshore suppliers to also register and collect VAT or GST on low-value imported goods. 2.21 On 21 June 2017, the Australian Parliament enacted legislation that requires offshore suppliers of goods to register for GST in Australia, and collect and return GST on their supplies of goods to Australian consumers that are valued at or below AU$1,000, if their total supplies to Australia exceed the AU$75,000 registration threshold for GST. 12 The new rules will come into force on 1 July 2018, one year after the implementation of Australia’s new rules applying GST to cross-border services and intangibles. 2.22 The legislation also required an inquiry by the Australian Productivity Commission on the effectiveness of the rules and other possible models for collecting GST on low-value imported goods. The Australian Productivity Commission completed its inquiry on 31 October 2017 and concluded that the legislated model was the most feasible option at the present time. 2.23 The European Commission indicated in December 2016 that EU member countries would implement a variant of an offshore supplier registration system to collect VAT on low-value imported goods from outside the EU from 2021. The proposals would extend their current collection mechanism for digital services and intra-EU cross-border supplies of goods to include supplies of physical goods from outside the EU. 13 12 See the Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Low Value Goods) Act 2017. 13 https://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/business/vat/digital-single-market-modernising-vat-cross-border- ecommerce\_en 10 New Zealand’s current rules for collecting GST on cross-border supplies of services 2.24 Since 1 October 2016, offshore suppliers of cross-border services and intangibles have been required to register, collect, and return GST on supplies they make to New Zealand-resident consumers. When the rules were initially proposed in the 2015 Government discussion document, GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods, it was estimated that the Government was foregoing approximately $40 million a year in revenue through the non-collection of GST on these services. 2.25 To date, over 200 offshore suppliers have registered under the new rules. Further, revenue from the GST returns filed by offshore suppliers since the introduction of the rules totals $162 million. 14 2.26 The success of an offshore supplier registration system to collect GST on cross-border services and intangibles illustrates that such a system is effective and relatively easy to comply with. An offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value goods 2.27 To deal with the issues outlined in this chapter, the Government intends to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods. Chapters 3 to 5 of this discussion document outline the proposed design features of the offshore supplier registration system. The Government is keen to ensure that the design of the rules is workable in practice so that compliance costs are kept to a minimum. The proposed rules, therefore, are broadly in line with New Zealand’s current rules for collecting GST on cross-border services and intangibles, and the recently enacted rules for low-value imported goods in Australia. 2.28 At the same time, it is important to ensure that the changes proposed do not adversely affect New Zealand’s current risk assessment and biosecurity processes at the border. 14 As of 27 April 2018. 11 CHAPTER 3 Offshore supplier registration: scope of the rules  Offshore suppliers would need to register, collect, and return New Zealand GST if: – the total value of goods and services they supply to New Zealand consumers is above the $60,000 registration threshold; – a good supplied by them to New Zealand consumers (excluding alcohol and tobacco products and fine metal) is valued at or below $400; and – the goods are delivered to a New Zealand address.  The current tariffs and cost recovery charges would be removed for goods valued at or below $400. 3.1 An offshore supplier registration system applies a different approach to the one currently in place for taxing low-value imported goods. It is still consistent with the destination principle underpinning New Zealand’s GST system but no de minimis for collecting GST is required. 3.2 Under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, supplies of goods by non- residents are treated as being supplied in New Zealand (and therefore subject to GST) if the goods are in New Zealand at the time of supply. If the good is outside New Zealand at the time of supply it is generally not subject to GST. The GST on these supplies is instead collected at the border unless it is valued at or below the customs de minimis (usually $400). The taxing point under the current approach is therefore at the border. 3.3 Under an offshore supplier registration system, the taxing point for imported goods valued at or below $400 would shift to the point of sale. This means that non-resident suppliers (referred to as offshore suppliers in this paper) would be required to register for GST if their total supplies (sales) of services and low-value goods to New Zealand consumers exceed the $60,000 registration threshold. A supply of a good by an offshore supplier would be treated as supplied in New Zealand if the good is to be delivered to a New Zealand address and the good is valued at or below $400. 3.4 Under this approach the offshore supplier would add GST to the price charged to the New Zealand consumer at the point of sale. This means offshore suppliers of low-value goods would be required to register and return GST in the same way as New Zealand suppliers. It is also consistent with the offshore supplier registration rules that were recently implemented for cross-border services and intangibles. This would ensure that physical goods and competing electronic services (such as physical books and e-books or DVDs and video streaming services) are subject to GST in the same way. 12 3.5 The Government is not proposing that the offshore supplier registration system would apply to goods that exceed $400. Above $400 Customs has existing processes to collect GST on imported goods (along with cost recovery charges and tariffs). Example 2: Goods below the current threshold Current rules Sophie buys a t-shirt for $50 (shipping included) from The Gorms, a popular US-based clothing website. Sophie lives in New Zealand and requests that the t-shirt is delivered to her home address, in Wellington. The supplier is a large business that supplies more than $60,000 of goods to New Zealand a year. Since GST (and tariff duty) on the t-shirt is below the de minimis, Customs will not require Sophie to pay any GST (or tariffs). The total cost of Sophie’s parcel would be $50. Proposed rules Under the proposed rules, The Gorms would be required to charge GST on the t-shirt. GST would be included in the purchase price and charged to Sophie at the point of sale. The tariff duty would not be collected. The total cost of Sophie’s parcel would be $57.50 ($50 t-shirt + $7.50 GST ($50  15%)). 3.6 To enable the proposed changes the Customs de minimis would be changed to $400 based on the value of the goods imported. This would mean that cost recovery charges and tariffs would not be collected on imported goods valued at or below $400 once the offshore supplier registration system is implemented. Example 3: Goods below the current threshold – the same treatment for digital and tangible products Current rules BigBooks is a large offshore website that supplies both e-books and physical books to consumers. BigBooks supplies over $60,000 of both goods and services to New Zealand consumers, and is registered for GST under New Zealand’s cross-border services rules. Neisha downloads two e-books for her e-reader at $15 each. Under the current rules, BigBooks would charge Neisha $4.50 GST on her purchase ($30  15%). The total cost of her purchase is $34.50. Her husband Damendra buys two hard-copy books from the same website also for $15 each. Under the current rules, Damendra’s purchase is below the de minimis. The total cost of his purchase is $30. Proposed rules As BigBooks is already registered for GST, it would have to charge GST on all its supplies (both goods and services) to New Zealand consumers. When Damendra purchased his two books for $30, BigBooks would charge him $4.50 GST at the point of sale. Under the offshore supplier registration system, both Neisha and Damendra would have to pay $34.50 each on the total cost of their respective purchases. 13 Example 4: Goods above the current threshold – where tariffs currently apply (first example) Current rules If Sophie in example 2 had purchased a $250 jacket (shipping included) from The Gorms, under current rules Customs would stop the parcel at the border and require Sophie to pay GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on the jacket. The total cost of Sophie’s parcel would be $365.49 ($250 jacket + $25 tariff ($250  10%) + $41.25 GST ($275  15%) + $49.24 cost recovery charge). Proposed rules Under the proposed rules, and if Sophie requested that the jacket is delivered to an address in Wellington, GST would be charged by The Gorms to Sophie at the point of sale. The new rules mean that tariff duty and Customs cost recovery charges no longer apply to goods valued at or below $400. The total cost of Sophie’s parcel would be $287.50 ($250 jacket + $37.50 GST). Example 5: Goods above the current threshold – where tariffs currently apply (second example) Current rules Consider Melissa in example 1 and her $300 running shoes purchased from a large offshore website. Under the current rules, Customs would stop her parcel at the border for assessment and she would have to pay $128.74 in GST, tariff duty and cost recovery charges, making the total cost of her parcel $428.74. Proposed rules The large offshore supplier would be required to register for GST. When Melissa purchases her $300 running shoes from the website, she would be charged $45 GST by the supplier at the point of sale. No tariffs or cost recovery charges would be payable at the border. The total cost of Melissa’s parcel would be $345. Goods included and excluded 3.7 The definition of “goods” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is very broad. “Goods” is defined as meaning all kinds of personal or real property; but it does not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by means of wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system. 15 3.8 The term “low-value goods”, as used throughout this paper, refers to imported goods that have a value of $400 or less. The proposed rules will not apply to shipments of alcohol or tobacco products. The existing rules, including excise-equivalent duties and other charges that are required to be collected at the border, will continue to apply to these products. 15 See section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 14 3.9 It is proposed that the new rules would cover all other goods except those that are currently exempt or zero-rated. The main exception would be for supplies to New Zealand-registered businesses. This is discussed in more detail below. Exempt and zero-rated goods 3.10 New Zealand has a very broad-based GST system, with very few exemptions. The main exemptions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 relate to certain types of services, such as financial services and residential accommodation. 16 The only exemption that applies to goods that could be physically imported by consumers concerns supplies of “fine metal”. 17 It is unlikely that there would be very many individual consumers who would import fine metal with a value below $400; these supplies are more likely to be business-to-business and would most likely have a value above $400. However, where a consumer imports fine metal supplied by an offshore supplier with a value of $400 or less, it is proposed that these goods should remain exempt from New Zealand GST. 3.11 Having such limited exemptions and a single standard rate of GST (15%) should make it easier for offshore suppliers of goods to comply with the New Zealand GST system, compared with countries that have multiple exemptions or several different rates of VAT/GST. Supplies of multiple low-value goods 3.12 When a consumer purchases multiple goods from a supplier, the supplier of the goods may bundle and ship these goods to consumers in one consignment or as individual consignments. The following rules outline how GST would apply to these multiple supplies. Total value of the consignment is $400 or less 3.13 As a default rule, offshore suppliers would be required to collect and return GST if they supply a low-value good to a New Zealand consumer. This includes supplies of a single low-value good (valued at or below $400) or multiple low-value goods that total $400 or less in one transaction. Total value of the consignment exceeds $400 3.14 The default rule also means that offshore suppliers would be required to collect and return GST on the supply of multiple low-value goods in a single transaction, even if the total transaction exceeds $400 in value. 3.15 As discussed earlier in this chapter, the rules would move the taxing point for goods valued at or below $400 from the border to the point of sale. Current processes would, therefore, continue to apply for goods shipped in consignments exceeding $400. 16 Section 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 contains the current exemptions from GST. 17 “Fine metal” includes gold, silver and platinum with a purity of at least 99.5 percent, 99.9 percent and 99.0 percent, respectively. 15 Example 6: Supply of multiple low-value goods – proposed treatment Chan buys one drill part valued at $100 for his electric drill from an offshore website, Hammers, Drills & Things. Hammers, Drills & Things is registered under the new rules, and charges Chan GST for the drill part. Later that year, Chan buys six different drill parts from the website’s deluxe range valued at $200 each. The total value of the goods is $1,200. Each drill part is considered a low-value good, so Hammers, Drills & Things charges Chan $180 GST on his purchase. The discussion below and further examples explain what happens at the border if Chan’s $1,380 transaction is consigned and sent to him as one parcel. Preventing double-taxation 3.16 There may be situations when a consumer has purchased multiple goods from a supplier – either as part of one single transaction or several individual transactions – and then these goods are subsequently packaged together and consigned as one parcel with a value exceeding $400. Because the value of this consignment is above $400, that parcel would be processed at the border by Customs for revenue. 3.17 To prevent GST being paid twice on the low-value goods in that single consignment, it is proposed that the consumer would need to provide Customs with appropriate evidence that GST had already been paid on the low-value goods portion in that consignment. For example, the consumer 18 would retain a record of delivery duty paid or other evidence that GST was paid at the point of sale. 3.18 When GST had not already been paid by the offshore supplier (for example, because the offshore supplier was not registered for GST or had not charged GST), GST would continue to be collected at the border on all the goods in a consignment valued above $400. Example 7: Supplier below the registration threshold Chan’s wife, Ravin, buys two portable speakers from a boutique offshore supplier for $300 each. The speakers are sent to Ravin in a single consignment. The supplier does not reach the $60,000 registration threshold under the proposed rules, and does not charge any GST to Ravin at the point sale. The total value of her transaction is $600, so it is stopped at the border for revenue assessment. As GST was not charged by the supplier at the point of sale, Customs would charge Ravin GST on the total value of her consignment. 3.19 In other cases, the consignment could involve a mix of goods on which GST had been already been charged by the offshore supplier (goods valued at or below $400) and goods where GST had not yet been charged (goods valued above $400). In these cases, the consumer could provide evidence to 18 Or the consumer’s broker. 16 Customs for GST relief in relation to those goods on which GST had already been charged, but would still be required to pay GST on any other (previously untaxed) goods in the consignment. Example 8: Supply of multiple goods – where one of the goods is valued over $400 Variation 1: Chan buys 11 different drill parts valued at $100 each. Even though the total value of his transaction is $1,100, Hammers, Drills & Things is required to charge GST on the total value of the transaction as each of the 11 individual drill parts are considered to be low-value goods. Variation 2: If Chan buys five drill parts valued at $100 each as well as an electric drill valued at $2,000, Hammers, Drills & Things would only be required to charge GST on the five drill parts. The electric drill is not a low-value good. Multiple consignments Under either variation, if the drill parts and the electric drill are ultimately consigned and sent to Chan in separate parcels, only the electric drill would be stopped at the border for assessment by Customs. GST would have already been paid on the individual drill parts and would not be subject to GST at the border. Single consignment Under either variation, if the drill parts and the electric drill are consigned and sent to Chan as one parcel, the parcel would be stopped at the border for assessment. Chan would need to pay GST to Customs on the electric drill, and provide Customs with proof that GST has already been paid on the drill parts. Australia’s approach to supplies of multiple low-value goods 3.20 Australia’s approach to supplies of multiple low-value goods exceeding $1,000 is similar to this proposal. That is, offshore suppliers should charge GST at the point of sale. However, Australia also applies a “reasonable belief” exception. The exception means that if the supplier reasonably believes that the multiple goods will be grouped together and shipped in one consignment, GST can be charged at the border instead of by the offshore supplier. A supplier’s reasonable belief can be based on common industry or commercial practices. 3.21 The Government is interested in feedback from offshore suppliers about the proposed approach to supplies of multiple low-value goods. In particular, whether Australia’s “reasonable belief” exception should be incorporated into New Zealand’s proposed rule. For example, would the test be appropriate in situations when the supplier knows the goods will be shipped in a single consignment, because the supplier of the goods is also responsible for its shipping, or is informed by the person who organises the shipping that it will be consigned as a single parcel. Returns and refunds 3.22 When a consumer imports goods from offshore on which GST has been charged by the supplier and sends the goods back, the consumer would be 17 able to get the GST refunded by the supplier if the terms and conditions of the supply allow for returns and refunds. 3.23 Offshore suppliers would be able to adjust their output tax in a GST return, subsequent to refunding the customer, to take into account the overpaid GST. Consistent with the general rules for claiming input deductions under section 20 of the GST Act, these adjustments would, subject to existing exceptions, be required to be made within two years of the original supply. Supplies to consumers and GST-registered businesses 3.24 The Government is proposing that only supplies of low-value goods by offshore businesses to New Zealand consumers would be covered by the offshore supplier registration system. Supplies to GST-registered businesses would be excluded unless the supplier chose to zero-rate the supply. Identification of New Zealand consumers 3.25 The test for determining who is a New Zealand consumer under the proposals is not based on residence or tax residence. 19 Under the proposed rules, supplies are made to New Zealand consumers if the parcel is addressed to a New Zealand delivery address. Goods intended to be sent to a New Zealand delivery address are likely to be consumed in New Zealand. Therefore, consistent with the destination principle, these goods should be subject to GST. Supplies to businesses excluded 3.26 Goods supplied to New Zealand GST-registered businesses (referred to as “business-to-business supplies”) would be excluded from the proposed rules. This approach is consistent with the rules that apply to suppliers of cross- border services. 3.27 From a revenue perspective, there would be little value in requiring offshore suppliers to charge GST on low-value goods to New Zealand businesses. This is because in most situations New Zealand businesses, if registered, would be able to claim back any GST they incur. 3.28 Excluding business-to-business supplies has a number of benefits:  It may reduce the number of offshore suppliers that would be required to register (as many suppliers may only supply to GST-registered businesses), and therefore would reduce compliance costs.  Tax invoice requirements could be relaxed for offshore suppliers because no New Zealand consumers charged with GST would be in a 19 Section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains the rules for determining when a natural person is a New Zealand resident for income tax. However, for GST purposes, the effect of section YD 1(4) and (6) is ignored for determining the residence or non-residence of a natural person. See the definition of “resident” in section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, paragraph (c). 18 position to claim back the GST. Relaxed invoice requirements would lower compliance costs for offshore suppliers.  There are fiscal risks associated with applying GST to business-to- business supplies, as less reputable offshore suppliers may purport to charge GST but not return the GST, and GST-registered New Zealand businesses would be able to claim the GST back in the normal manner. 3.29 There are, however, some disadvantages in applying the rules only to business-to-consumer supplies:  Excluding business-to-business supplies means offshore suppliers would be required to determine whether they were supplying to a business or an individual consumer. This could be difficult and may impose compliance costs on suppliers.  Revenue could be foregone if consumers misrepresented themselves as a GST-registered business and were able to avoid the GST. 3.30 Simplified rules for identifying business-to-business supplies are therefore required to minimise compliance costs to offshore suppliers. The proposed requirements for offshore suppliers to identify business-to-business supplies are discussed below. Rules to address the risk of foregone revenue from consumers misrepresenting themselves as GST-registered businesses are detailed in Chapter 5. Situations when a supplier treats a registered business as a consumer and advertently charges that business GST are covered below. Rules for identifying business-to-business supplies 3.31 In many instances, offshore suppliers of low-value goods would be able to assume their goods were being purchased by individual consumers given the nature of the supplies. 3.32 As with the approach to cross-border services, the Government proposes that offshore suppliers would be required to assume a New Zealand consumer is not a GST-registered business unless the customer has communicated to the supplier their GST registration number, New Zealand Business Number or self-certification as a GST-registered business. 3.33 It may not be practical for all suppliers to obtain or retain evidence that a customer is GST-registered. Under our cross-border services rules, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is able to prescribe or agree to an alternative method of determining whether a supply is made to a GST- registered person. The Commissioner takes into account a number of factors, such as the nature and value of the supply, and the terms and conditions of the provision of services. 20 It is proposed that this discretion be extended to suppliers of low-value goods. 20 See section 8B(6) to (8) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 19 Ability to zero-rate business-to-business supplies 3.34 While excluding business-to-business supplies as a default rule is expected to minimise compliance costs for the majority of offshore suppliers of low- value goods, some offshore suppliers may have incurred New Zealand GST in making a business-to-business supply. The Government is therefore proposing to allow offshore suppliers to choose to zero-rate their business-to- business supplies of low-value goods (apply GST at a zero percent rate). This would allow offshore suppliers to deduct any New Zealand GST costs incurred in making the supply the same way as resident suppliers, thus ensuring that GST is not a tax on businesses. Example 9: Supplies only to GST-registered businesses Pie Trays Co (PT Co) is an offshore supplier of large multi-hole pie trays for commercial kitchens. PT Co supplies pie trays to New Zealand businesses, all of whom are GST-registered. As business-to-business supplies are excluded, PT Co would not be required to register for New Zealand GST as it only makes supplies to GST-registered businesses. Given the pie trays supplied by PT Co are only suitable for use in commercial kitchens and supplied to businesses, PT Co can apply to Inland Revenue seeking to treat all their supplies into New Zealand as business-to-business supplies. If the discretion is applied, its customers would not need to advise PT Co that they are a business. If PT Co decided to voluntarily register, the goods it supplies could be zero-rated for GST purposes and PT Co would be able to claim back any New Zealand GST it incurs on its costs in the course of making those supplies. Reverse charge for GST-registered businesses 3.35 GST should not be a tax on businesses. This is achieved by allowing GST- registered businesses to claim back GST charged on goods and services they receive to the extent the goods and services are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. 21 When GST-registered businesses purchase goods and services for non-taxable purposes, such as for private or exempt activities, the business cannot claim back GST as the goods and services received do not relate to the making of taxable supplies. Effectively, the business is treated like a final consumer. 3.36 To account for GST in situations when a GST-registered business purchases goods for non-taxable purposes, a special reverse charge would be included. The reverse charge rule would treat the GST-registered business that purchased the low-value goods as the supplier of those goods, so that the business would be required to return the GST instead of the offshore supplier. 3.37 This rule would be an extension of New Zealand’s existing reverse charge rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, which apply domestically and in the cross-border services context. It would only apply when the GST- 21 See section 20(3C) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – Input tax may be deductible. 20 registered recipient of the goods intends to use the goods other than for making taxable supplies. This would include situations when they use the goods for a private purpose (as opposed to a business purpose) or for making GST-exempt supplies. The current five percent de minimis exemption would also be retained. 3.38 If the reverse charge applies, the GST-registered business would be required to return output tax on the full value of the supply (as the deemed supplier), but only claim an input tax deduction to the extent the good is used for making taxable supplies. The net result would be that output tax on the non- taxable use is paid by the GST-registered business. Example 10: Where the reverse charge applies Thomas is a self-employed architect registered for GST. In his spare time, Thomas is also learning to paint landscapes. He purchases drawing supplies from an offshore supplier for $300. Thomas identifies himself as a registered business and therefore is not charged GST. He uses his drawing supplies fifty percent for his taxable architecture business and fifty percent for his hobby as an artist. Under the reverse charge, Thomas is treated as making a supply to himself of $300 at the 15% GST rate. He must return output tax of $45 ($300  15%). However, Thomas can claim an input deduction for the portion of the value of the drawing supplies (fifty percent) that is attributed to his taxable use. This input deduction is $22.50. His net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of $22.50 ($45 output tax minus $22.50 input tax). If Thomas’s use of his drawing supplies had been ninety-five percent taxable or more, he would not be required to apply the reverse charge. New Zealand businesses being inadvertently charged GST 3.39 There may be instances when an offshore supplier treats a GST-registered business as an individual consumer and inadvertently charges that business GST. 3.40 For these situations, as with cross-border services, it is proposed that the New Zealand business contact the offshore supplier directly to rectify the mistake. The supplier would then have the option of doing one of two things: 1. It could provide the GST-registered business with a refund of the incorrectly charged GST. If a refund is provided, the New Zealand business would not be able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST that was incorrectly charged. To take into account the overpaid GST, the offshore supplier would be able to adjust their output tax in their GST return, subsequent to the refund being made. 21 2. Alternatively, the supplier could choose to provide the GST-registered business with a full tax invoice. 22 This could be a compliance cost saving for offshore suppliers, when the cost of issuing a refund would exceed the cost of issuing a tax invoice. If a full tax invoice is provided, the New Zealand business would be able to claim an input tax deduction under the general rules. Special provisions under our cross-border services rules which turn a supply that should not have been taxed by the supplier (or taxed at zero percent) into a supply that is taxed at the standard GST rate of 15% would be extended to low-value imported goods. This would ensure that if the supplier exercised the full tax invoice option, they would not have to subsequently make an adjustment to their GST return as the correct GST result would have been reached. Tariffs and cost recovery charges 3.41 Under the current system, GST and cost recovery charges for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries are collected at the border by Customs on goods valued above the de minimis threshold. For some goods, tariffs may also apply, depending on the product type and the country of origin where the good was manufactured. When tariff duties also apply, GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges may be collected at the border on goods with a value as low as $226. 3.42 The cost recovery charge of $49.24 collected by Customs at the border comprises two separate departmental levies: Customs’ Import Entry Transaction Fee of $29.26 and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ Biosecurity System Entry Levy of $19.98. 3.43 The Import Entry Transaction Fee is used to fund Customs’ border clearance activities, including screening for prohibited goods such as drugs and other dangerous goods or objectionable material. The Biosecurity System Entry Levy funds the Ministry for Primary Industries’ activities in relation to assessing and managing biosecurity risks at the border. 3.44 The offshore supplier registration system would require offshore suppliers to register for and return GST on goods imported by consumers valued at or below $400. Offshore suppliers will however not be responsible for collecting tariff duties and cost recovery charges under the proposed rules. 3.45 The Government considers that Customs collecting tariffs and cost recovery charges on goods valued at or below $400 would undermine the efficiency of the proposed system. The Government is therefore proposing to remove tariffs and cost recovery charges from all imported goods valued at or below $400. 22 Section 24(5B) allows suppliers of cross-border services to choose to provide a tax invoice where GST is incorrectly charged on a supply to a GST-registered business, provided that the payment for the supply is less than $1,000. 22 3.46 Removing the need to collect tariffs and cost recovery charges at the border will simplify the process, avoid delays for consumers, and reduce barriers to importing low-value goods. 23 CHAPTER 4 Registration requirements and returns filing  All offshore suppliers supplying a total value of goods and services to New Zealand consumers above $60,000 in a 12-month period would be required to register.  Online marketplaces and re-deliverers would be required to register and return GST if they meet the registration threshold.  Business-to-business supplies would not count towards an offshore supplier’s total supplies unless the supplier chose to zero-rate these supplies.  A simplified “pay only” registration system will be available to offshore suppliers.  Quarterly filing is proposed for offshore suppliers of low-value goods. 4.1 This chapter discusses the proposed registration threshold that could be applied to offshore suppliers, and situations when an electronic marketplace or a re-deliverer might be required to register instead of the principal supplier. Registration threshold for offshore suppliers – $60,000 4.2 Currently, domestic businesses and offshore suppliers of cross-border services are required to register for, collect and return GST if their total New Zealand supplies exceed, or are reasonably expected to exceed, $60,000 in a 12-month period. They are also able to voluntarily register if their turnover falls below that amount. 4.3 While the registration threshold might be considered an exception to New Zealand’s broad-based GST policy, as some suppliers would not be required to register and return GST, it is intended to reduce compliance costs for very small businesses. For the same reason, a similar registration threshold is proposed for offshore suppliers of low-value goods. 4.4 For some suppliers, the compliance costs of registering and returning GST may outweigh the revenue collected in supplying low-value goods to New Zealand customers. As far as possible any new rules should be designed in a way that does not pose a barrier to trade with New Zealand as this could reduce market competition and consumer choice. 4.5 Countries that have introduced offshore supplier registration systems for services and intangibles have typically adopted low or nil thresholds. However, similarly to New Zealand, Australia has a registration threshold for 24 offshore supplies of cross-border services and intangibles that is the same as the domestic registration threshold of AU$75,000. This registration threshold will also apply to offshore suppliers of low-value goods to Australian consumers from 1 July 2018. 4.6 The Government considers that applying the existing $60,000 registration threshold, which applies to domestic suppliers and offshore suppliers of cross-border services, is most appropriate. This would ensure that offshore and domestic suppliers making a similar level of supplies in New Zealand would receive comparable treatment. Although, it is acknowledged that with the exclusion of business-to-business supplies, for some offshore suppliers, the registration threshold could in practice be higher than the domestic one. It would also mean the compliance burden associated with the requirement to register and file returns is not imposed on smaller suppliers to the New Zealand market, which could otherwise pose a barrier to trade with New Zealand and could reduce market competition and consumer choice. Example 11: Supplier below the registration threshold Ryan buys $200 worth of mobile phone accessories from a website called Dalen’s Designs, a small boutique store in Utah that sells individualised mobile phone covers. Dalen’s Designs does not make $60,000 worth of supplies to New Zealand a year. Under the new rules it would not be required to register for, collect or return New Zealand GST. Special rules for marketplaces and re-deliverers Marketplaces 4.7 The Government is proposing to extend the electronic marketplace rules that apply to cross-border services to supplies of low-value goods. In some instances, offshore suppliers would not directly supply goods to their customers. Instead they may use an online marketplace, such as a website or internet portal, to market and sell their products. It is proposed that the marketplace would be treated as the supplier and be required to register. 4.8 The marketplace is generally in a better position to register and return GST on supplies compared with the underlying supplier. Typically, the marketplace would be larger and better resourced and may have a closer relationship with the customer. Requiring the marketplace to register may also reduce compliance costs, as a potentially large number of smaller suppliers may not be required to register. It is anticipated that the marketplace and the underlying supplier will have commercial arrangements in place that could take any GST costs into account. 4.9 To ensure these rules can be easily applied in practice, it is important to clearly define the circumstances in which the marketplace would be required to register, and therefore, the underlying supplier would not be required to register. Without this clarity there is a risk that both parties may register or fail to register. 25 4.10 It is proposed that a marketplace would be required to register when customers would normally consider the marketplace to be the supplier, and this is reflected in the contractual arrangements between the parties. This is likely to be when the marketplace:  authorises the charge to the customer;  authorises delivery of the goods to the customer; or  sets any of the terms and conditions of the transaction. 4.11 It would be expected that an offshore supplier simply using a payment service provider to organise the payment from the customer would still be required to register. In this situation, the payment service provider would have a limited role in the supply chain. However, if for example an offshore supplier listed goods on a third-party website, and that website interacted directly with the customer and organised payment and delivery for any purchases, that website would be required to register, charge and return GST instead of the underlying supplier. 4.12 Underlying suppliers would still be required to register for supplies to New Zealand residents not connected with the marketplace. 4.13 The proposal to require marketplaces to register for GST means that supplies of low-value goods made by smaller suppliers to New Zealand consumers through the marketplace would be subject to GST. It is acknowledged that in the absence of marketplace rules, supplies of low-value goods by these smaller suppliers would not be subject to GST because the total value of their supplies to New Zealand consumers would fall below the GST registration threshold. While the purpose of the registration threshold is to reduce compliance costs for suppliers that do not supply many goods and services to New Zealand consumers, the compliance costs for these smaller suppliers fall away when the requirement to register and return GST is shifted to the marketplace. Example 12: Marketplace with supplies over $60,000 a year Anthony’s Accessories is a small store in England that sells mobile phone accessories. These phone accessories are also available to purchase online but only through the large online marketplace, E-Marketz. An extensive range of goods and services are sold to consumers through the E-Marketz marketplace such as, physical books, e-books, CDs, DVDs, and digital music and movie files. The total value of low-value goods and services sold through E-Marketz’ platform to New Zealand consumers is well over $60,000 a year. Consider Ryan in example 11. He now purchases $200 worth of phone accessories from Anthony’s Accessories through the E-Marketz website. Under the proposals, E-Marketz would be treated as the supplier of goods to Ryan. E-Marketz is already registered for GST under New Zealand’s cross-border services rules. E-Marketz would now be required to collect and return GST on its supplies of low-value goods to New Zealand consumers. 26 4.14 Australia has similar GST rules for cross-border services supplied through electronic distribution platforms. These rules include the ability for platforms and underlying suppliers to agree that the underlying supplier is responsible for returning GST on the services supplied through the platform to Australian consumers. From 1 July 2018, these rules will also apply to goods sold through these platforms. 4.15 The Government is seeking feedback on whether, as a default rule, treating the marketplace as the supplier of the goods provided that any of the conditions in paragraph 4.10 are met is workable. Re-deliverers 4.16 Re-deliverers are used by consumers when the supplier or marketplace does not offer shipping to New Zealand. The good is instead shipped to an overseas “hub” or mailbox, which then ships the good to New Zealand. Since the supplier or marketplace in this situation may not know that the final destination of the good is New Zealand, it would be unreasonable to require them to charge GST. 4.17 Re-deliverers will, however, know the final destination of the goods on which they are “redelivering”. They should also know the value of the goods to be redelivered to New Zealand, as the consumer is generally required to provide a value for their parcel as part of the arrangements with the re- deliverer for payment and delivery of the goods to New Zealand. 4.18 For these reasons, it is proposed that re-deliverers, rather than the underlying suppliers, be required to register and return GST, if their supplies to New Zealand are above the registration threshold. Requiring re-deliverers to collect and return GST instead of the underlying supplier or the marketplace recognises that when consumers engage the services of a re-deliverer to “redeliver” their goods to New Zealand, it is the re-deliverer who would be best placed to know the status of the goods and the location to which they being delivered. Australia’s approach to re-deliverers 4.19 Under Australia’s rules for low-value imported goods, an entity is a re- deliverer if that entity arranges with the recipient consumer to:  provide for the use of an overseas mailbox to which the goods are delivered; or  purchases the goods (as an agent of the recipient consumer); and  delivers the goods to Australia. 23 4.20 Consistent with Australia’s rules, it is also proposed that freight forwarders or transporters (such as courier companies) who bring goods to New Zealand for consumers would not fall within the scope of the proposed rules for re- 23 The entity would also be a re-deliverer if it procured, arranged or facilitated in these activities. 27 deliverers, unless the functions they are performing for the consumer are more akin to those of a re-deliverer. 4.21 The Government is interested in feedback from re-deliverers on this measure, in particular, whether the Australian approach should be adopted in New Zealand. The Government would also be keen to understand any practical issues with this approach. Example 13: Re-deliverer above the registration threshold Marie lives in Wellington and is an avid purchaser of designer handbags. She wishes to order a $300 handbag by popular American designer, Babette Nordqvist. Unfortunately, Babette Nordqvist does not offer shipping to New Zealand. When Marie purchases the handbag from Babette Nordqvist, she requests that the bag is delivered to a US-based address provided to her by Ship2Me. Ship2Me is an entity that provides its customers with a US postal address and then arranges with its customers to have their goods redelivered to New Zealand. Marie arranges with Ship2Me to have her handbag delivered to her home address in Wellington. Ship2Me’s supplies exceed the registration threshold. Under the proposed rules, it would be a re- deliverer and would be required to register for GST instead of Babette Nordqvist (the underlying supplier). Simplified registration system 4.22 To ensure compliance costs are kept to a minimum, the Government proposes that a simplified “pay only” registration system be available to offshore suppliers of low-value goods. A pay-only registration system is tailored for offshore suppliers that have no GST to claim and make payments only. The main benefit of a pay-only system is that the system can be very simple. 4.23 Because offshore suppliers that are in a pay only position represent a low risk from a revenue perspective, the registration and filing requirements are significantly simplified. The usual checks and balances focussed on ensuring that input tax deductions or refund claims are correct can be relaxed. 4.24 Inland Revenue has already developed a system for offshore suppliers of cross-border services and it has been well received. The Government proposes to extend this system to offshore suppliers of low-value goods. Offshore suppliers that are already registered for GST under the cross-border services rules would not need to re-register for their supplies of low-value goods under the proposed new rules. 4.25 While it is expected that the majority of offshore suppliers would only need to register under a pay-only system (as they would not normally incur any New Zealand-based GST costs on their supplies of low-value goods to New Zealand consumers), the normal domestic registration system would also need to be available so that offshore suppliers who do wish to claim back any New Zealand GST they have incurred may do so. By international standards, New Zealand’s domestic registration system is considered to be very simple. 28 Filing periods 4.26 Currently, domestic suppliers must file GST returns on a one-monthly, two- monthly or six-monthly basis, depending on turnover level. However, during consultation for the GST rules on cross-border services, offshore suppliers expressed a preference for quarterly GST returns, to better align with their filing obligations in other countries. 4.27 Consequently, under New Zealand’s GST rules, quarterly returns are mandatory for offshore suppliers whose only New Zealand supplies consist of cross-border services. The Government proposes that this rule is extended to offshore suppliers of low-value goods. 29 CHAPTER 5 Enforcement, compliance and penalties  The existing penalties under tax legislation would apply to consumers that falsely represent themselves as a business to avoid GST.  Inland Revenue would be provided with the discretion in certain circumstances to require a consumer to register and pay the GST that should have been returned.  Further measures to bolster compliance will be explored, such as a possible joint-registration system with other countries or data matching programmes between tax jurisdictions or government agencies. 5.1 New Zealand’s tax system is based on the principle of voluntary compliance. That is, because our tax system is largely fair and coherent, the vast majority of people do the right thing and comply with their tax obligations. Our tax rules, by and large, are designed to make it easy for people to comply and difficult for people not to comply. It is expected that most offshore suppliers of low-value goods would comply with the rules outlined in this document for the same reason. 5.2 New Zealand’s recent experience with GST on cross-border services has shown that a strategy of making it as easy as possible for offshore suppliers to comply with the rules is likely to help maximise compliance with an offshore supplier registration system. It has also been the experience in other jurisdictions that have implemented similar rules for cross-border services that offshore suppliers have demonstrated a willingness to comply. This is to a large extent because the tax is passed on to the consumer and any cost is administrative only. 5.3 The Government is therefore keen to ensure that the rules are workable and are as easy and practical for offshore suppliers to comply with as reasonably possible. 5.4 New Zealand has mechanisms for mutual co-operation, information exchange and assistance with many jurisdictions under both bilateral agreements and the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. These agreements cover an extensive network of jurisdictions, including our major trading partners. The agreements mean New Zealand can request that our treaty partners (that is, other foreign tax authorities), collect and provide information, assist in the service of documents, and collect unpaid GST on New Zealand’s behalf. 5.5 In addition to the current compliance approach, the Government will continue to explore different approaches to further bolster compliance as well as maintain and strengthen cross-border neutrality. 30 Measures to bolster compliance Opportunity to explore a joint-registration system with other countries in the future 5.6 It will be important in the future to explore joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions that have similar rules for collecting GST on low-value goods. For example, this could mean a joint Australia/New Zealand registration system. A similar system operates in the European Union and is known as the “one-stop-shop” registration system. Under the one-stop-shop, suppliers are able to register in a single Member State, which is then responsible for distributing the GST returned amongst the other relevant Member States at the appropriate rate. 5.7 The intention of the one-stop-shop was to lower the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers and to enhance compliance with the system as a whole. This is because registering and filing a single return with one Member State is considered to be easier than registering and filing in multiple Member States. 5.8 In the New Zealand context, our most obvious regional partner is Australia. Similar benefits could be achieved through a comparable one-stop-shop in the future. For example, if an offshore supplier supplied services or goods to both Australia and New Zealand, a one-stop-shop registration system would allow the supplier to register and file returns in a single country, instead of both countries. 5.9 It should be noted, however, that such a system would require high levels of cooperation and would take time to develop. An offshore supplier registration system would therefore be embedded in both New Zealand and Australia before consideration would be given to developing a joint registration system. Data matching programmes 5.10 Other compliance measures that could be explored include data matching programmes. This could be done between jurisdictions or with Customs and Inland Revenue. 5.11 As a first step towards a joint-registration system it could be possible, for example, for Australia and New Zealand to share a list of registered suppliers under our respective rules for low-value imported goods. 5.12 Domestically, Customs’ import entry information could be matched with Inland Revenue’s list of GST-registered businesses to determine whether suppliers who are supplying more than $60,000 of goods a year into New Zealand are registered for GST. Officials consider that this can be efficiently supported by the new customs and excise legislation. 31 Penalties for false representations by consumers 5.13 The Government proposes that the existing penalties and use-of-money interest rules that apply to domestic suppliers be extended to apply to offshore suppliers. Further, the existing knowledge offences under tax legislation would apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information for the purpose of avoiding GST – for example, by misrepresenting themselves as a GST-registered business. The maximum fine a court could impose is $25,000 for a first time offender or $50,000 for a repeat offender. 5.14 In addition to existing penalties, it is proposed that in egregious cases, Inland Revenue would also have the discretion to require a person to register and pay the GST that should have been returned. This would apply only in exceptional cases, such as when a person repeatedly provided false or misleading information about themselves in order to avoid GST.

Background The Government has set out its commitment to reforms that ensure the public sector takes a more collaborative, cross-agency approach to supporting New Zealanders and gaining efficiencies. A key part of this commitment includes is reducing the rates of crime. It has been identified that sharing information between IR and the NZ Policethe Parties would be one way of supporting these goals. The tax secrecy rules in the TAA prevent IR from sharing information with other agencies other than when a specified exception applies. One exception to tax secrecy is that Information may be shared when in accordance with an approved information sharing agreement pursuant to Part 9A 7 of the Privacy Act 19932018. This Agreement has been put in place under Part 9A 7 to enable IR to share Information with NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies, for the purpose of detection, prevention, investigation or providing evidence of Serious Crime. IR may share Information with NZ Policeone or more Requesting Agencies either proactively or in response to a request from NZ Policea Requesting Agency. That Information may relate to Persons that may be involved in or otherwise connected to a Serious Crime as well as Persons with whom they have or have had a relationship (for example, family members or Associates). Terms 1. Objectives and purpose of the Agreement Objectives The objectives of this Agreement are to: (a) Prevent and reduce the level of Serious Crime committed; (b) Gain efficiencies through more collaborative, cross-agency work; and (c) Enable sufficient protection of people’s privacy and ensure a proper level of security and transparency. Objectives (a) and (b) can potentially conflict with objective (c), if robust security systems and processes are not established to protect people’s privacy. To ensure that a potential conflict is IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 11 managed appropriately a balance between providing better public services and ensuring that peoples’ information is adequately protected is required. Purpose The purpose of this Agreement is to enable IR to share Information with NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation or providing evidence of a Serious Crime that there are reasonable grounds to suspect has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed. IR may share Information with NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies either in response to a request from NZ Policea Requesting Agency or proactively. The Agreement does not cover information sharing as part of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009. Nothing in this Agreement affects that Act. 2. Exemptions and/or modifications to information privacy principles For the purposes of this Agreement information privacy principles 2 and 11 which are set out in section 6 19 of the Privacy Act 1993 2018 are modified (by the Order in Council) as follows: Principle 2: Source of Personal Information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 2 for IR to collect Personal Information from NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies or NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies to collect Personal Information from IR for the purposes of this Agreement. Principle 11: Limits on disclosure of personal information It is not a breach of information privacy principle 11 for NZ Police the Requesting Agencies to request Personal Information from IR (which itself may entail the disclosure of Personal Information to IR) or for IR to provide Personal Information to NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies for the purposes of this Agreement. 3. The public service or public services the provision of which the Agreement is intended to facilitate The public services that this Agreement is intended to facilitate are maintaining public safety, law enforcement and crime prevention. In particular this Agreement is intended to facilitate the provision of Information for the prevention, detection or investigation of, or as evidence of, Serious Crime. This may result in the prosecution of a Person for a Serious Crime. 4. Type of Information to be shared under the Agreement Test for sharing Information sharing under this Agreement will only occur where the following test is met: NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may request Information from IR and IR may share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency in response to that request, or IR may proactively share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency, where:  NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency (if requesting) or IR (if proactively sharing) has reasonable grounds to suspect that a Serious Crime has been, is being, or will be, committed; and IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 12  NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency (if requesting) or IR (if proactively sharing) has reasonable grounds to suspect that the Information is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence of, a Serious Crime; and  IR determines that the Information is readily available within IR and that it is reasonable, practicable and in the public interest to provide the Information to NZ Policethe Requesting Agency. As noted above, this Information may relate to Persons that may be involved in or otherwise connected to a Serious Crime as well as Persons with whom they have or have had a relationship (for example, family members or Associates). The Information may relate to such offending as, for example, investor fraud, money laundering or drug manufacturing or distribution. This is an indicative list only for the purposes of illustration. For the avoidance of doubt, a Requesting Agency may proactively share information that it holds in relation to Serious Crime with IR in accordance with relevant provisions of legislation that it administers (such as section 36 of the Serious Fraud Office Act 1990) or the information privacy principles contained in section 19 of the Privacy Act 2018. Any agreed operational arrangements in relation to the sharing of such information will be specified in a separate memorandum of understanding between the Requesting Agency and IR. 5. The parties Parties involved and the lead agency As indicated above, this Agreement is between NZ Police, NZ Customs, SFO and IR. IR is the lead agency. 6. Description of information to be shared between the Parties IR will only share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency where the relevant test for sharing in clause 4 above has been met. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may request that IR share information Information falling within the categories in Row 1 of the table below and IR may share such information Information in response to a request. In making such a request of IR, NZ Policea Requesting Agency may itself need to share certain information Information (such as identifying details and grounds for the request) with IR, to enable IR to process the request and/or for IR to assess whether relevant parts of the test are met. The information that a Requesting Agency may share with IR can include: \[Insert\] IR may proactively share information Information described in Row 2 of the table below. This means that IR may proactively share information Information that could otherwise be requested by NZ Policea Requesting Agency under Row 1, and any other information Information discovered by IR in the course of carrying out its usual functions and duties (however discovered) with NZ Policea Requesting Agency when the test is met. The information that IR may share with NZ Policea Requesting Agency can include:  Information about a Person'’s Associates IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 13 Row 1 Information IR may share with NZ Policea Requesting Agency upon request  Tax Information  Financial Transaction Information  Financial Relationship Information  Domestic Relationship information  Information about Assets  Employment Information  Person Records  Social Assistance Information Row 2 Information IR may share with NZ Policea Requesting Agency proactively  Information falling within the categories in Row 1 above  Any other Information discovered by IR in the course of carrying out its usual functions and duties (however discovered) For the avoidance of doubt, IR may share both current and previous information, as held by IR, with NZ Policea Requesting Agency. 7. How the parties Parties may use the Information IR may use Information received from NZ Policea Requesting Agency under this Agreement to process an NZ PoliceRequesting Agency request and/or to assess whether relevant parts of the test in clause 4 above are met. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may use Information received under this Agreement for the purpose of prevention, detection or investigation of, or to use as evidence of, a Serious Crime. This may involve undertaking the following types of activities (note that this is an indicative list only for the purposes of illustration):  Identifying the commission or potential commission of a Serious Crime.  Identifying individuals involved in a Serious Crime (e.g., victims, offenders, witnesses).  Identifying other lines of inquiry for a Serious Crime.  Using the Information as intelligence for a Serious Crime investigation.  Using the Information as evidence in the investigation and prosecution of any Person for a Serious Crime.  Using the Information as part of an investigation into a Serious Crime to identify roles and relationships within criminal networks to then identify the enablers of financial structures.  Identifying potential victims or offenders of Serious Crimes to enable activation of preventative measures. IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 14  Enabling, where the test is met, the sharing of Information for joint NZ PoliceRequesting Agency and IR taskforces. Information used in any of the respects above may also be turned into anonymised data for the purpose of producing strategic intelligence products that detail crime trends. Neither pNo Requesting Agencyarty will use any Information shared under this Agreement for any purpose other than as set out in this Agreement. For example, IR will not use Information received from NZ Police under this Agreement for TAA purposes and NZ Policea Requesting Agency will not use Information received under this Agreement:  As evidence of a non-serious crime that is not a Serious Crime.; or  As general intelligence information.; or  As part of a vetting process. These restrictions do not apply from the point in time (if any) that the Information becomes publicly available as a result of legitimate public disclosure or as a result of court proceedings. IR may use Information obtained under this Agreement as part of a request for Information by a Requesting Agency in accordance with section 17M of the TAA. 8. Adverse actions Section 96Q 152 of the Privacy Act 1993 2018 requires agencies to provide written notice to individuals before any “adverse action” is taken against them on the basis of Personal Information shared under an information sharing agreement, and give those individuals 10 working days to dispute the information received. Section 96R 153 allows agencies to either dispense with the requirements under section 96Q 152 or shorten the 10 working day period. Information (including Personal Information) held by IR will only be shared with NZ Policea Requesting Agency where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a Serious Crime has been committed, is being committed or will be committed and that the Information is relevant to the prevention, detection, investigation or the provision of evidence of a Serious Crime. Much of NZ Police’sa Requesting Agency’s early assessment and investigative work is sensitive. Advance notification by NZ Policea Requesting Agency of an adverse action would ‘tip off’ an alleged serious criminal offender. For these reasons NZ Policethe Requesting Agencies will dispense with the notice requirements under section 96Q 152 for this Agreement. To the extent that IR’s use of Personal Information received from NZ Policea Requesting Agency to locate Information (including Personal Information) held by IR for disclosure to NZ Policea Requesting Agency, or IR’s sharing of Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency, could be considered an adverse action, IR will dispense with the notice requirement under section 96Q 152 for this Agreement. Adverse actions NZ Policea Requesting Agency may take The type of adverse action NZ Policea Requesting Agency may take is dependent on:  the nature of the Serious Crime and the immediacy of action required e.g., a homicide versus a financial crime; and IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 15  the nature and value of Information when considered alongside the facts of a case and material held by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency. The types of adverse action could include (but are not limited to):  investigation;  arrest; and  prosecution. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency may also use its range of statutory powers to support the exercise of these actions. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency’s employees or anyone engaged by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency will comply with all NZ Policeof the Requesting Agency’s policies and guidelines as well as the Solicitor General’s Prosecution Guidelines (Guidelines), before taking any adverse action. The Guidelines assist in determining:  whether criminal proceedings should be commenced;  what charges should be filed; and  whether, if commenced, criminal proceedings should be continued or discontinued. The Guidelines also provide advice for the conduct of criminal prosecutions, and establish standards of conduct and practice expected from those whose duties include conducting prosecutions. If Information shared under this Agreement forms part of the prosecution’s evidence in a criminal case, the Information may be disclosed to an individual in accordance with the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008. Any dispute about the provision of such information will be managed by the courts as part of the subject matter of the prosecution. IR and adverse actions Except to the extent that IR’s locating and sharing of Personal Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency could be considered adverse action, IR will take no adverse actions under this Agreement as a result of receiving Personal Information from NZ Policea Requesting Agency under this Agreement. However, this does not prevent IR from using such information in accordance with section 17M of the TAA. 9. Where you can view this document This document is available to the public online at www.ird.govt.nz and www.police.govt.nz or aton the public website of each Party or in person at: Inland Revenue Asteron Centre Level 5 55 Featherston Street Wellington 6011 10. Overview of the operational details Requests for Information by NZ Policea Requesting Agency will be passed to and managed by a designated team in NZ Policethe Requesting Agency. They will decide whether the parts of the test in clause 4 required to be satisfied by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency are met and whether the request should be sent to IR. Requests for Information will be sent to a particular nominated team at IR. Certain staff members will ascertain whether IR holds the Information sought and decide whether that IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 16 Information may be released to NZ Policethe Requesting Agency, having applied the relevant parts of the test. In the case of proactive release of Information by IR to NZ Policea Requesting Agency, IR personnel will pass the Information to be considered for proactive release to the same nominated IR team so that a decision can be made as to whether the Information can be provided to NZ Policethe Requesting Agency in accordance with the test. Senior personnel within each agency Party will be responsible for the relevant decision-making by their agencythat Party. From NZ Police this will be overseen by the Manager: Intelligence Operations (or their nominated Deputy), based in the National Intelligence Centre, or relevant successor personnel. From IR this will be overseen by the Manager: Investigations (or their nominated Deputy), or relevant successor personnel. From NZ Customs this will be overseen by the Manager: Intelligence (or their nominated Deputy). From SFO this will be overseen by the General Counsel. Subject to the commentary below, IR and NZ Policethe Parties will use the SEEMail environmenta Secure Transmission Method to share Information with one another. SEEMail is designed to facilitate the secure exchange of email and attachments between participating agencies in a manner that protects the information against disclosure to anyone outside of the SEEMail environment. If Information is shared by IR via SEEMail, it will be received by NZ Police a Requesting Agency in a designated secure email inbox. Once received, it (rather than the individuals to whom it relates) will be given a unique identifier (for the purposes of file management) and held by NZ Policethe Requesting Agency in a secure registry on a secure floor. Specific security access is required to access that registry and floorenvironment. IR may also, in addition to using SEEMail, share Information with NZ Policea Requesting Agency by other means, for example, by permitting NZ Policethat Requesting Agency to physically access IR premises to examine and copy and/or remove the Information, e.g., a hard drive, computer file, hard copy files etc. Information will only be distributed within NZ Policea Requesting Agency to Appropriately Authorised Staff, for the purposes set out in this Agreement. Information will be distributed with specific caveats and rules to ensure the Information remains protected. 11. Safeguards to protect privacy and security Test for sharing Information Before any Information is requested or released, the relevant test in clause 4 must be satisfied. As noted above, senior personnel within each agency Party will be responsible for the relevant decision- making by their agencythat Party. In addition, Information will only be accessible by those Appropriately Authorised Staff who need to use it for the purposes of this Agreement and who have signed certificates of confidentiality under the TAA. Secure sharing of Information As noted above, SEEMail a Secure Transmission Method will primarily be used to share Information between IR and NZ Policethe Parties. Both agenciesThe Parties have information technology systems that comply with the applicable government security levels. If SEEMail is used appropriately by participating agenciesthe Parties, users can be highly confident that:  Email marked \[SEEMAIL\] can only be read by the participating agency of the recipient, either IR or NZ Police. IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 17  The email does in fact come from the participating agency asParty claimed.  No one outside the sender’s participating agencysending Party can read the email when it is in transit.  No one outside the sender’s participating agencysending Party can alter the message.  Email marked \[SEEMAIL\] cannot be inadvertently sent to non-participating agenciesParties.  All email traffic between participating agenciesParties is secured.  All email traffic between participating agenciesParties authenticates the sending agencyParty. The Parties are investigating greater use of MFT to transfer Information between them. As part of this, they will explore using and may in the future use MFT to transfer Information under this Agreement rather than SEEMail. Reasonable and practicable steps will be taken by the Parties to maintain security during any physical access, examination, copying and removal of Information. For example, where practicable physical media devices will be encrypted and password protected before removal from IR. Onsite access by NZ Policea Requesting Agency will also be closely supervised by IR to ensure that only Information able to be shared under this Agreement is accessed, examined, copied and removed. Verification of Information/confirmation of identity When NZ Policea Requesting Agency requests Information about one or more identifiable Individuals, IR will compare the details about the Individual(s) provided by the NZ PoliceRequesting Agency with the details IR holds so as to have a high degree of confidence that the correct Information is shared. Where NZ Policea Requesting Agency requests Information about an identifiable Individual's family members, for example, without providing identifying details of who they are, IR may need to rely on its own information. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency will use standard investigative processes to independently verify that Information received from IR is accurate. The process of further investigation or development of the Information will be aimed at verifying the circumstances and accuracy of the Information through corroboration with information from other sources. Disclosure NZ Police and IRA Requesting Agency will not provide Information obtained under this Agreement to other another agencies Requesting Agency or any other third party, except as required by law or the courts. For example if Information shared under this Agreement is used by NZ Policea Requesting Agency as part of a criminal prosecution it may be required to be disclosed under the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008. Nothing in this Agreement limits the requirements of that Act. IR may use Information obtained under this Agreement as part of a request for Information by a Requesting Agency in accordance with section 17M of the TAA. Under section 17M(2) of the TAA, this includes its use in a “permitted disclosure” as defined in that Act. Storage of Information NZ Police and IRA Requesting Agency will receive and store Information received under this Agreement securely and separately from other information that it holds. via SEEMail in a designated secure email inbox. The information in this email inbox will be segregated from other information that IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 18 NZ Police and IR hold. Information received in physical form will be stored according to NZ Police protocols and will similarly be kept segregated from other information that NZ Police hold. Transfer of Information within NZ Policea Requesting Agency The Information will only be distributed to Appropriately Authorised Staff, for the purposes set out in this Agreement. NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency will not make such Information generally available to all NZ Policeof its employees or anyone engaged by NZ Policethat it engages. The Information will be distributed to Appropriately Authorised Staff in a manner which ensures that the Information is kept separate from all other information while it is being transferred and is not at risk of being mixed or overheard (as applicable). The Information will be tagged with specific rules and caveats on how the Information may be used to ensure that the Information is not used inappropriately and remains protected. IR Training The authorised staff of IR will be appropriately trained and/or issued with guidelines to ensure that the test is met before Information is shared under this Agreement. Retention and deletion of Information Relevant information NZ PoliceA Requesting Agency will make an initial decision as to whether Information shared by IR under this Agreement is required for any of the purposes set out in this Agreement, within 90 days of receipt of that Information. If NZ Policea Requesting Agency decides that it no longer requires the Information, it will inform IR of that decision within 14 days of making the decision. Information that is shared and held by NZ Policea Requesting Agency that is required for any of the purposes set out in this Agreement will be retained by NZ Policethat Requesting Agency for as long as required and in accordance with the Public Records Act 2005 and any applicable disposal authorities under that Act. Given that matters concerning Serious Crimes are usually complex, this retention period may extend over a number of years, both for active cases and in situations involving cold cases. Destruction thereafter is subject to the requirements of the Public Records Act 2005 and any applicable disposal authorities under that Act. Information that is not relevant or no longer required Information shared with NZ Policea Requesting Agency by SEEMail that is not required by NZ Policethat Requesting Agency for the purposes set out in this Agreement will be deleted from operational files within 90 days of the non-requirement decision being made (such decision being required within 90 days of receipt of the Information), subject to the requirements of the Public Records Act 2005 and in accordance with any applicable disposal authorities under that Act. (Information in physical form that is not required by NZ Policea Requesting Agency will also be destroyed, or returned to IR at IR’s request, within 90 days of the non-requirement decision, subject to the requirements of the Public Records Act 2005 and in accordance with any applicable disposal authorities under that Act.) IR records of Information requests from NZ Policea Requesting Agency and the responses to those requests, and IR records of the proactive provision of Information to NZ Policea Requesting Agency, will be deleted from operational files within 90 days of receipt of a non-requirement decision from NZ Police, subject to the requirements of the Public Records Act 2005 and in accordance with any applicable disposal authorities under that Act. IR may retain administrative records documenting the fact that requests were received and transfers occurred in accordance with the Public Records Act 2005. IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 19 The NZ Police Requesting Agency deletion/destruction/return obligation applies to Information shared by IR only and not to Information that a Requesting Agency has obtained independently by NZ Police. The IR deletion obligation applies to records of Information requests and responses, and to the records of proactive releases of Information to NZ Policea Requesting Agency, but not to the original collections of Information held by IR. IR Retention If IR does not receive a non-requirement decision following the initial provision of Information to NZ Policea Requesting Agency (as outlined above) IR will retain its records of Information requests and of the provision of Information for a period of 7 years following which the records will be deleted, subject to the requirements of the Public Records Act 2005 and any applicable disposal authorities under that Act. IR may retain administrative records documenting the fact that requests were received and transfers occurred in accordance with the Public Records Act 2005. Codes of conduct All staff at IR must follow the IR’s code of conduct which prohibits the disclosure of any information obtained from their work unless they have authority to do so. IR officers must also comply with the secrecy confidentiality obligations in section 81 18 of the TAA which provides that all such officers must keep confidential all sensitive revenue information secret matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts (except to the extent that an exception in the TAA appliesdisclosure is permitted under the TAA). IR contractors must comply with similar obligations. NZ PoliceRequesting Agency employees and anyone engaged by NZ Policea Requesting Agency must comply with the NZ PoliceRequesting Agency’s Code of Conduct (if any), its policies relating to integrity and confidentiality, and other applicable polices and legislative obligations. The Police Code of Conduct prohibits unauthorised access to, or disclosure of, any matter or information in relation to Police business. NZ PoliceRequesting Agency employees may on occasion find themselves privy to information that, although it is legitimately obtained for NZ PoliceRequesting Agency business purposes, may set up a conflict of interest, or create tension between NZ PoliceRequesting Agency duties and personal obligations. NZ PoliceRequesting Agency employees, and others with authorised access to NZ PoliceRequesting Agency information, must declare such personal or private interest in official matters to management and accept and abide by decisions that they should have no further involvement in the matter, and not receive or seek out any further information about it. Privacy breaches Where Personal Information is found to have been inappropriately accessed or disclosed, IR’s and NZ Police’sthe relevant Parties’ internal investigation processes will be applied. Where an internal investigation confirms the loss of, or unauthorised access to, Personal Information, amounting to a material privacy breach, the Privacy Commissioner will be notified as soon as possible. Audit The Parties will undertake an audit of the operation of this Agreement on an annual basis to check that the safeguards in the Agreement are operating as intended, that they remain sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals and to ascertain whether any issues have arisen in practice that need to be resolved. IR – NZ POLICE, NZ CUSTOMS SERVICE, SFO Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement Page 20 12. Assistance statement IR and NZ PoliceThe relevant Parties will provide any reasonable assistance that is necessary in the circumstances to allow the Privacy Commissioner or an individual who wishes to make a complaint about an interference with privacy to determine the agency Party against which the complaint should be made. 13. Security provisions If either Party has reasonable cause to believe that any breach of any security provisions in or referred to in this Agreement has occurred or may occur, that Party may undertake investigations in relation to that actual or suspected breach as deemed necessary. Both Parties shall ensure that reasonable assistance is provided to the investigating Party in connection with all inspections and investigations. The investigating Party will ensure that the other party is kept informed of any developments. Compliance by IR officers with this obligation is subject to their obligations under the TAA. Either A Party may suspend its participation in this Agreement to allow time for a security breach to be remedied. 14. Dispute resolution Should any dispute or differences relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement arise; the relevant Parties will meet in good faith with a view to resolving the dispute or difference as quickly as possible. If the relevant Parties are unable to resolve any dispute within 60 days, the matter shall be referred to their Commissioner/Director/Comptroller (as applicable) CNZP and the CIR, or their delegated representatives, for resolution. The relevant Parties shall continue to comply with their obligations under this Agreement despite the existence of any dispute. 15.

In the existing agreement, serious crime is defined as an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of four years or more. The information exchanged since the agreement’s implementation has delivered significant benefits in tackling serious crime. 1.3 This discussion document sets out proposals to extend the existing information sharing agreement to include the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service, so Inland Revenue may share information with these agencies where it might be an advantage in dealing with serious crime. Summary of proposals 1.4 The Government proposes allowing Inland Revenue to share information with the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service, under the same framework currently used to share information with the New Zealand Police for targeting serious crime. 1.5 The existing framework and proposed model for sharing information wit h those agencies would allow an agency to request information, or for Inland Revenue to proactively provide information, when: • there are reasonable grounds, for the agency identifying the possible offence, for suspecting that a serious crime has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed; • the agency considers that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the information is relevant to preventing, detecting, investigating, or providing evidence of a serious crime; and • Inland Revenue is satisfied that: - any statutory criteria relating to the release of protected information are met; - the information is readily available within Inland Revenue; - it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information; and - it is in the public interest to communicate it. 1 1.6 These proposals do not alter the existing information sharing agreement with the New Zealand Police. They build on that activity to allow the New Zealand Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office to provide services more efficiently, while maintaining the privacy protections provided by the Privacy Act 1993 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1.7 The proposals are discussed in detail in chapter 2. Details about informat io n sharing and the existing information sharing agreement with the New Zealand Police are set out in chapter 3. 1.8 The Government welcomes feedback on all aspects of these proposals, including whether addit ional controls should be put in place. How to make a submission 1.9 Submissions are invited on the proposals in this discussion document. 1.10 The closing date for submissions is 30 October 2018. 1.11 Submissions can be made: • by completing the submission form at https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tsc- submission; • by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Targeting serious crime: extending information sharing” in the subject line; or • by post to: Targeting serious crime: extending information sharing C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.12 Submissions should include a brief summary of the major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it is acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue, the New Zealand Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office to contact submitters to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.13 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withho lding o f particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission should clearly indicate if they consider any part of their submissio n should be withheld under the Act. 2 CHAPTER 2 The main proposal 2.1 The Government recognises that confidentiality is an important aspect of taxpayers’ trust in the tax system. Therefore, when considering information sharing between Inland Revenue and other agencies, strict processes are involved and the benefits to society must be clear. 2.2 Unlike most government agencies that may be allowed to share information under the Privacy Act 1983’s exceptions, Inland Revenue is limited by a secrecy rule, and is only allowed to share information with other agencies in accordance with an exception specified in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.3 One of the exceptions to Inland Revenue’s general secrecy rule allows disclosure of information under an approved info rmat ion sharing agreement (AISA) made under section 96J of the Privacy Act 1993. An AISA provides a flexible and robust framework for information sharing between agencies, while maintaining the protections provided by the Privacy Act 1993 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2.4 The Government is proposing that the existing AISA between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police, the Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement, 1 is extended to include two additional agencies, the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service. These agencies have an interest in the efficient and effective reduction of serious crime. The extension to the agreement will assist them in identifying, investigating and prosecuting fraud, corruption, and cross-border crime. 2.5 Extending the existing agreement, rather than using other legislative mechanisms to share information, is considered the best option to enable these agencies to work together and provide an all-of-government response to serious crime. The proposed extension to the AISA would enable: • information sharing from Inland Revenue to the Serious Fraud Office; and • information sharing from Inland Revenue to the New Zealand Customs Service. The ‘test for sharing’ framework 2.6 It is proposed that the same framework that Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police use to share information for serious crime should be applied to information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office, and between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. 1 The AISA is available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/agreements/agreement-police/. 3 2.7 The information to be released from an agency must fit certain criteria. The first one is the ‘serious crime’ test, which requires that informat ion must relate to a ‘serious crime’. Serious crime is defined as an offence punishable by imprisonment of four years or more (committed by an individual, or a similarly serious offence committed by a body corporate which would be punishable by imprisonment of four years or more if it had been committed by an individual). 2.8 The second test is the ‘reasonable grounds and relevance’ test, where the agency identifying the possible offence must also consider whether there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a serious crime has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed; and that the information is relevant in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or there is evidence of, the serious crime. In the case of requests for information, when determining whether the information Inland Revenue holds is relevant, it may be necessary for Inland Revenue to seek further details from the requesting agency. In addition, sufficient information will need to have been provided to ensure that a match is made to the correct individual or entity for which information is sought. 2.9 The final test ensures the appropriate use of Inland Revenue’s resources. The test is essentially one of balancing the benefits of releasing information and the costs of preparing that information for release. Information would be provided only when: • any statutory criteria relating to the release of protected information are met; • the information is readily available within Inland Revenue; • it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information; and • it is in the public interest to communicate it. Information flows 2.10 The flow of information in the existing AISA between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police is a one-way flow from Inland Revenue to the New Zealand Police eit her in response to a request or proactively. However, in the course of making a request, a limited amount of information is shared by the New Zealand Police to Inland Revenue to enable Inland Revenue to assess whether the request meets the ‘test for sharing’ criteria. 2.11 The proposed information flows for sharing between Inland Revenue and the Serious Fraud Office, and between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service, would fo llow the same model, where information may be shared by Inland Revenue either in response to a request or proactively, provided the information fits the ‘test for sharing’ criteria outlined previously. 2.12 Figure 1 provides an overview of the proactive and reactive sharing that is in scope for the extended AISA. Information sharing between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police is already in place and will continue unchanged. 4 Information sharing with the New Zealand Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office would be included under the AISA extension. Figure 1: Overview of the current agreement and the proposed extension Inland Revenue NZ Police Serious Fraud Office Inland Revenue proactive sharing Inland Revenue proactive sharing Information provided in response to a request Information provided in response to a request Current agreement Proposed agreement extension Customs Information provided in response to a request Inland Revenue proactive sharing Information to be shared 2.13 The financial focus of Inland Revenue’s activities reflects the types of investigations which Inland Revenue’s information would be useful for. This means it is more likely that Inland Revenue would have information that would assist with investigating financial crime, such as serious fraud or money laundering, rather than information that would assist in cases o f serious physical offences. However, in the course of the department’s activities, Inland Revenue may also come across non-financial crimes, such as smuggling or drug offences. 2.14 Information to be shared should be broadly defined to include information about organisations, entit ies, and individuals that may be involved in, or otherwise connected to, a serious crime or individuals with whom they have a relationship. 2.15 For the purposes of illustrating the type of information to be shared, the information may relate to offending such as investor fraud, money laundering, drug manufacturing or distribution. 2.16 Examples of the information that Inland Revenue may share with the other agencies include: • Information Inland Revenue holds on a specified person This may include their IRD number, entity information, the taxes for which they are registered, income history, tax payment history 5 (including any compliance issues), types of income, expenses, asset and liability information, and actions taken or planned to be taken in relation to the specified person. The information provided may relate to a victim of a serious offence rather than the perpetrator of the offence in order to identify a person who may have had a motive to harm the victim. • Information Inland Revenue holds on other persons or entities that are associated with, or related to, the specified person This may include information necessary to understand beneficial ownership, or the nature of the structures the specified person is involved with. • Information Inland Revenue holds that is aggregated, derived or inferred that is relevant to the specified person (or associated or related persons) This may include judgements about compliance behaviour and judgements on possible approaches by the specified person to compliance with tax and other legal obligations. Information shared would include documents Inland Revenue may have that would support another agency’s enforcement action. Safeguards 2.17 The Government takes the protection of personal information seriously. The proposed AISA would include controls and processes to minimise any risk of a privacy or secrecy breach occurring. 2.18 The sharing of information would only occur for the purpose set out in the AISA, which is for identification, investigation and prosecution of serious crime. 2.19 Memoranda of understanding agreed by the agencies involved would need to be in place before any information sharing could occur, and would provide: • details on how the information exchanges would occur, such as what information can be exchanged and the safeguards to ensure the privacy of the information shared; and • the designated senior personnel of each agency responsible for the information sharing. 2.20 Information would be available only to authorised staff in each agency to ensure that information is treated appropriately under the proposed AISA. Staff who knowingly disclose information outside what is legally permitted would face potential criminal liability for breaching taxpayer secrecy. 2 2.21 In the event of a privacy breach, despite the safeguards, measures will be in place to ensure that any affected individuals are identified as quickly as 2 Staff would be breaching taxpayer secrecy under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. On conviction they could be liable to a fine of up to $15,000 and/or term of imprisonment of up to six months under section 143E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 6 possible. The necessary steps taken to minimise and mitigate any risk to those individuals are that: • designated senior personnel in the relevant agencies would meet immediately to assess the issue and manage the response; • information sharing would be immediately suspended if there was any risk of on-going breaches; and • the Office of the Privacy Commissioner would be notified and involved where appropriate. Example scenarios 2.22 The following examples illustrate scenarios where the ability to share information between Inland Revenue and other agencies would be of value. Example scenario 1: Investigation into PAYE offending An investigation, where there was suspicion of tax offending, provided evidence that suggested a businessman had set up complex business and tax structures, with appropriate cut-offs through a professional trustee company, to orchestrate tax evasion. This tax evasion was addressed as part of Inland Revenue’s enforcement activities. However, the investigation also disclosed probable and significant fraud against a trustee. Because of Inland Revenue’s secrecy rule, Inland Revenue was unable to advise the Serious Fraud Office about the suspected fraudulent activity. This meant the businessman could not be stopped and the suspected fraudulent transactions could not be raised with the Serious Fraud Office. With the proposed AISA extension, Inland Revenue would be able to advise the Serious Fraud Office of the suspected fraud, and the case could be evaluated and investigated to avoid further impact to possible victims and public confidence. Example scenario 2: Income suppression resulting in identifying suspected drug smuggling During a tax audit investigation it becomes obvious that significant funds flowing through a taxpayer’s bank account, on which tax has been paid, are not related to the core business activities. Further investigation reveals the potential for this taxpayer to be involved in smuggling drugs into New Zealand. Under the proposed rules in the AISA, Inland Revenue could inform the New Zealand Customs Service of a suspected offence. Inland Revenue could then provide bank account information and records of statements made by the taxpayer in interviews to assist with an investigation into the suspected offence. 7 Example scenario 3: Investigation into a controlled drug importation across the border In a New Zealand Customs Service investigation of a controlled drug importation, the offender claimed to have a legitimate business. However, Customs was unable to identify any business accounts at all, only a cash account. Since Customs could not prove the origin of the cash deposits, they were unable to confirm the cash came from the proceeds of the controlled drug sales, and the charges available to be laid against the individual were limited. In this scenario, the proposed AISA extension would allow Inland Revenue to provide Customs with data that would have opened a number of new lines of enquiry, as well as enabling a better picture of the proceeds from the controlled drug sales. The offender would likely have received a sentence more suited to the offending. Questions for submitters • What do you think of extending Inland Revenue’s ability to share information about serious crimes with the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service? • Should information sharing for serious offences be extended further to include other government agencies in addit io n to the New Zealand Police, the New Zealand Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office? • Are the proposed safeguards sufficient for the protection of the information shared? What else should be considered? • Are there any other things that should be considered as part of the proposed extension to the current information sharing agreement? 8 CHAPTER 3 Information sharing 3.1 Information sharing agreements between government agencies require the privacy of individuals to be considered and balanced against the need for government agencies to provide efficient, high quality services. 3.2 In the case of organised criminal activity, the benefits to society of sharing the informat ion outweigh the reduction in privacy of certain individuals and the risks to the voluntary compliance model on which our tax system is based. 3.3 For most government agencies, the Privacy Act 1993 regulates information sharing between agencies. Principle 11 of the Privacy Act 1993 limits the disclosure of personal information, but contains exceptions that permit disclosures when necessary “to avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law” and “for the protection of the public revenue”. However, those exceptions do not apply to Inland Revenue. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides a strict rule of taxpayer secrecy, where the secrecy of all matters relating to the various tax Acts administered by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must be maintained. At the same time, the Tax Administration Act 1994 recognises that the duty to maintain secrecy cannot be absolute and so there is a list of targeted exceptions to the general secrecy rule. The AISA framework 3.4 One of the exceptions to the general secrecy rule of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows for information to be shared under an approved informat io n sharing agreement (AISA). An AISA is a legal framework under the Privacy Act 1993 which authorises the sharing of information between or within agencies for the purpose of delivering efficient and effective public services. It provides certainty around the purpose of information sharing, the use of the information shared, and management of privacy risks. When justified, an AISA can authorise modification or exemption to the privacy principles set out in the Privacy Act 1993. 3.5 The development of an AISA includes consultation with the parties involved, including government agencies and persons or organisations representing the interests of individuals whose information will be shared. This process involves continuous oversight from, and consultat ion with, the Privacy Commissioner. An AISA ultimately requires an Order in Council, the associated Ministerial and Cabinet approvals, and regulatory impact analysis. 3.6 The AISA framework allows future amendments to be made when there is a need for including other agencies, new information and new purposes for sharing. However, any changes would still go through the same robust process undertaken for its development, to ensure the Privacy Act 1993 9 safeguards are maintained and consultation is undertaken within government, and with the public. The Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement 3.7 In 2014, the Serious Crimes Information Sharing Agreement between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police was implemented to help reduce the level of serious crime and assist investigations into serious crime in New Zealand. 3.8 Under the information sharing agreement, the New Zealand Police can request a range of information from Inland Revenue when investigating a serious crime. There can be multiple information requests associated with the same case or prosecution. Inland Revenue can also proactively provide information to the New Zealand Police. This includes information about individuals and their tax returns, debt and audit history, and information about individuals who are linked to them. Non-individual information is also included in the current agreement and Inland Revenue provides this information when it is clearly relevant to the serious offence being investigated. 3.9 In the 12 months to 30 June 2017, Inland Revenue received over 200 requests for information from the Police. 3 At the time of reporting these requests had resulted in 34 prosecutions, with 96 cases still under investigation. The estimated cost of the informatio n sharing agreement for Inland Revenue was $19,995 for the year. Previous research and public consultation on sharing information for targeting serious crime 3.10 In 2014, Inland Revenue partnered with an external research firm to conduct interviews and an online survey on sharing information for targeting serious crime. The purpose of the research was to better understand how Inland Revenue’s involvement in information sharing to support the Government’s response to serious crime could affect perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. 3.11 Overall, the research found that Inland Revenue’s participation in information sharing actions to address serious crime was considered to be acceptable if it was “fit-for-purpose”. The concerns raised by the research participants included balancing the: • individual’s right to privacy with the social benefits to society; • nature of the serious crime with the type and breadth of information requested; and • intended and potential use of the information with the risk of error and its misuse. 3 See page 171 of Inland Revenue’s 2017 Annual Report, available at https://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/annual-report/annual-report-2017/ . 10 3.12 The research results also indicated that cross-government information sharing to address serious offending is an all-of-government issue and is not specific to Inland Revenue. Tax secrecy does not appear to be a significant concern when considering Inland Revenue’s involvement in cross- government information sharing to address serious crime. However, the potential impact on citizens’ trust in Inland Revenue and the subsequent impact on the integrity of the tax system would need to be considered. Provided the Government communicates that Inland Revenue will share specific taxpayer information only under specific circumstances, both trust and integrity will be maintained despite selectively relaxing tax secrecy regulations to identify and stop serious crime. 3.13 Submissions on the 2013 discussion document Targeting serious crime 4 indicated more support than opposition to sharing tax information to prevent serious crime. In general, submissions in favour of the proposals noted that information should flow freely across government departments; that serious criminals should not be protected by privacy laws; and that a greater ability to share information across the government would result in more resources being freed up and improve government agencies’ ability to detect people committing serious crimes. 3.14 Table 1 sets out the key concerns raised in submissio ns fro m the previous public consultation, and the officials’ responses to these. Table 1: Key concerns raised in submissions from previous public consultation Topic Area of concern Officials’ response Integrity of the tax system Whether the proposals would have a more than a minor effect on the integrity of the tax system and consequently on revenue collection. Officials noted that although sharing information may negatively impact the integrity of the tax system, not sharing information to assist in combatting serious crime may also have a negative impact as it may be perceived as negligence. Resources Whether the proposals would significantly impact Inland Revenue resources, and whether Inland Revenue staff are sufficiently experienced or resourced to make the required judgments to authorise the release of information. This has been addressed by having a small dedicated team with specialised training to handle such requests. 4 Targeting serious crime: a government discussion document about the sharing of tax information to prevent serious crime, April 2013, available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2013-dd-targeting-serious- crime/overview. 11 Topic Area of concern Officials’ response Security How secure the information would be, and whether information shared about a suspected serious crime would be used for the prosecution of a lesser crime (in place of the original suspected serious crime). Inland Revenue is generally recognised as having good information security, alongside the protections of the strict secrecy requirements imposed on staff and anyone who receives tax information. However, officials noted a privacy breach is clearly one of the risks associated with any information sharing proposal and requires careful management. Agencies must also enter into a memorandum of understanding before any information sharing can take place. This is a formal agreement that details how information will be handled and sets out a process to be followed, should a breach occur, despite the protections in place. If there is considered to be a risk of on-going breaches, information sharing will be immediately suspended. On using information for the appropriate purpose (serious crime), if there are concerns that an agency is not meeting the terms and requirements of the information sharing agreement, the agreement could potentially be suspended or cancelled. Undue inhibition of rights and privileges Whether the proposals unduly infringe taxpayers’ rights against unreasonable search and seizure, and privilege against self- incrimination. Officials noted that the proposed information sharing would not alter the way in which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be exercising her statutory powers, and therefore officials do not consider that there is any undue imposition on an individual’s rights. Impact on Inland Revenue’s existing powers Whether the proposals might result in challenges to the exercise of Inland Revenue’s search and seizure powers in tax cases, due to the possibility of the information being used in other criminal proceedings. Officials noted that the Commissioner would not, in any circumstances, be using her information-gathering powers to look for information on behalf of other agencies. It seems unlikely that the Commissioner would be barred from exercising her statutory powers if a taxpayer was concerned about that information possibly being used in an unrelated prosecution. Transparency and notification Whether the proposals provided sufficient transparency and notification of those affected. Although officials appreciated the concern raised, notification is not appropriate given the purposes of the proposal. Notifying someone that their information has been shared, for example with the Police, would serve to put the person on notice that they were subject to a criminal investigation and render the proposal largely ineffective. Similar exclusions from notification are included in the Privacy Act 1993. 12
Targeting serious crime: extending information sharing Summary and submission form Introduction Government agencies share specified information as part of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the services they provide. An existing information sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Police enables Inland Revenue to provide information, under certain criteria, to the New Zealand Police to detect, prevent and prosecute serious crime. In the existing agreement, serious crime is defined as an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of four years or more. The information exchanged since the agreement’s implementation in 2014 has delivered significant benefits in tackling serious crime. The Government is proposing to extend the existing information sharing agreement to include the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service, so that Inland Revenue can share informat ion with these agencies to help them investigate serious crime. Summary of proposals The Government proposes allowing Inland Revenue to share information with the Serious Fraud Office and the New Zealand Customs Service, under the same framework currently used to share information with the New Zealand Police for targeting serious crime. The existing framework and proposed model for sharing information with those agencies would allow an agency to request information, or for Inland Revenue to proactively provide information, when the agency or Inland Revenue considers there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that: • a serious crime has been committed, is being committed, or will be committed; and • the information is relevant to preventing, detecting, investigating, or providing evidence of a serious crime. In addit ion, Inland Revenue must be satisfied that: • any statutory criteria relating to the release of protected information are met; • the information is readily available within Inland Revenue; • it is reasonable and practicable to communicate the information; and • it is in the public interest to communicate it. September 2018 1 These proposals do not alter the existing information sharing agreement with the New Zealand Police. They build on that activity to allow the New Zealand Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office to provide services more efficiently, while maintaining the privacy protections provided by the Privacy Act 1993 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Government’s discussion document, Targeting serious crime: extending information sharing, is available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2018-dd-tsc- extending/overview. The proposals are discussed in detail in chapter 2 . Details about information sharing and the existing information sharing agreement with the New Zealand Police are set out in chapter 3. How to make a submission The Government welcomes feedback on all aspects of these proposals, including whether additional controls should be put in place.

GST on assets sold by non- profit bodies An officials’ issues paper May 2018 Prepared by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, and the Treasury First published in May 2018 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington, 6140. GST on assets sold by non-profit bodies – an officials’ issues paper. ISBN 978-0-478-27166-9 CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1 How to make a submission 1 CHAPTER 2 Background 3 What is a “taxable activity”? 3 CHAPTER 3 Proposals 6 The problem 6 The main proposal 6 Unexpected GST cost 7 Application date and transitional rules 10 CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1.1 The GST treatment of non-profit bodies (NPBs) is more concessionary than for other taxpayers because NPBs may claim back GST on most of their expenses but in many cases not pay much GST meaning that they often receive GST refunds. This issues paper is not focussed on the ability of NPBs to claim back their GST costs but instead to provide certainty about when GST applies to the sale of the assets of an NPB. Importantly, this issues paper aims to reduce a significant revenue base risk arising from an interpretation of what constitutes the “taxable activity” of an NPB. 1.2 Following the announcement by the Minister of Revenue about the GST treatment of assets sold by non-profit bodies that is to apply from 15 May 2018, this issues paper outlines proposals to: • Treat any goods and services for which an NPB has claimed GST costs (input tax) to be subject to GST as part of its “taxable activity” if later sold by the NPB. • Apply the same treatment if an event equivalent to a sale such as an insurance pay-out or GST deregistration occurs. • For NPBs who may not have expected to have to pay this GST, allow a 12 month period in which GST input tax claimed can be repaid so as to treat the asset in question as never having been part of the NPB’s taxable activity. • Include a savings provision that preserves all tax positions taken before 15 May 2018 by NPBs for the scope of their taxable activities. These proposals are discussed in more detail in chapter 3. How to make a submission 1.3 Officials invite submissions on the suggested changes and points raised in this issues paper. 1.4 Send your submission to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “GST on assets sold by non-profit bodies” in the subject line. 1.5 Alternatively, send your submission to: GST on assets sold by non-profit bodies C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.6 The closing date for submissions is 15 June 2018. 1 1.7 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it is acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact submitters to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.8 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts of submissions, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 2 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 The GST treatment of non-profit bodies (NPBs) differs from that of other ent it ies in two areas: • The supply of donated goods and services by an NPB, for example the sale by a charity shop of donated clothing, is exempt. This means that no GST is paid on the sale of these goods and services, and no input tax deductions are available for GST costs incurred in making those sales. • Except for exempt supplies (such as the sale of donated goods), input tax deductions can be claimed by NPBs for all GST incurred for any activity that is not an exempt activity of an NPB. The receipt and payment of donations is outside the scope of GST rather than specifically exempt. Under current legislat ion, NPBs can therefore claim input tax deductions (often in the form of refunds) for the GST costs involved in fundraising and distributing funds or providing services. As a result, of the 19,000 NPBs registered for GST purposes, 7,000 are registered despite the fact that their annual turnover does not exceed the $60,000 compulsory registration threshold. 2.2 The exemption for donated goods and services by an NPB is clearly legislated for and will not be affected by the proposals in this issues paper. Rather, the issues paper concentrates on the lack of specific guidance in the legislation on the output tax (the GST charged) liabilities of an NPB where goods and services that are not specifically exempt are supplied by an NPB. The question of whether GST is payable in these cases is dependent on whether the goods and services in question are supplied in the course or furtherance of the NPB’s “taxable activity”, that is any regular activity that involves making supplies for consideration. 2.3 The GST treatment of NPBs’ outputs has been uncertain since the introduction of GST, so it has likely been assumed by many that the liabilities would be the same as for any GST-registered person apart from the exemption for donated goods and services. In other words, some may have assumed in line with the general expectation under the GST system, that GST is payable on any supply for which input tax deductions have been claimed. This was because it may have been thought that, once an entity registers, all its activities (other than its expressly exempt activities) form part of the entity’s taxable activity. What is a “taxable activity”? 2.4 What might constitute an NPB’s taxable activity has recently been more closely considered by Inland Revenue. It is suggested that the taxable activity may not include activities undertaken by the NPB that do not have a sufficient connection with the activity of making supplies for a consideration. So when there are two activities, one of which involves making supplies for 3 consideration and the other of which involves making supplies for no consideration, the question is whether the two activities have a sufficient connection with each other to be treated as one taxable activity or as two activities, one taxable and one not. It may also be possible to have situations where there is more than one taxable activity and other activities that are not taxable. 2.5 Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the GST position for an NPB under the earlier alternative interpretation (“old interpretation”) and the “new interpretation’ of “taxable activity”. The green box on the left hand column shows the GST payable by the NPB and the red boxes on the right show the GST that can be claimed back by the NPB. The non-coloured boxes show where GST is either not payable or not able to be claimed back. 2.6 Note that the only difference between figures 1 and 2 is that the GST payable is reduced because some supplies that were previously considered part of an NPB’s taxable activity are now non-taxable supplies. While they are not exempt supplies under the GST Act, they are still excluded from the “taxable activity” definition as they do not have a sufficient connection with an activity from which money (or other consideration) is derived. Importantly, while described differently, the new interpretation does not change the level of input tax deductions that can be claimed by NPBs. Example 1: Asset not part of the taxable activity A charity for the homeless owns two buildings – one a headquarters dedicated to fundraising and one an emergency accommodation facility which charges a fee based on the facility’s costs for its services. The funds raised assist towards researching issues about homelessness and finding local and national solutions. The charity has claimed input tax deductions for capital, maintenance and overhead costs relating to both buildings. Following Inland Revenue’s recent interpretation, it could be argued that the charity would not be required to pay output tax on a sale of the fundraising headquarters because the sale would not have been made in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity of providing emergency accommodation. This situation arises because: • Unlike other GST payers, NPBs are entitled to input tax deductions for all GST incurred unless it relates to making exempt supplies – so deductions can be claimed for fundraising activities. • The fundraising activity does not on balance have a sufficient connection with the activity of providing accommodation to the homeless for a fee. This example is illustrated in figures 1 and 2. 4 Figure 1: GST registered NPBs’ GST position under “old” interpretation GST payable GST claimed back “Taxable activity” supplies Receiving donations Exempt activities, for example: supplying d on ated go o ds and services All “taxable activity” – related expenses All expenses for receiving donations All expenses for exempt activities IRD Figure 2: GST position under “new” interpretation GST payable GST claimed back Taxable activity supplies Receiving donations Exempt activities, for example: supplying d on ated go o ds and services All taxable and non- taxable activity related expenses All expenses for receiving donations All expenses for exempt activities N on-taxable activity supplies IRD 5 CHAPTER 3 Proposals It is proposed to: • Treat any goods and services for which an NPB has claimed GST input to be subject to GST as part of its “taxable activity” if they are later sold by the NPB. • Apply the same treatment if an event equivalent to a sale such as an insurance pay-out or GST deregistration occurs. • For NPBs who may not have expected to have to pay this GST, allow a 12 month period in which the GST input tax claimed can be repaid so as to treat the asset in question as never having been part of the NPB’s taxable activity. • Include a savings provision that preserves all tax positions taken before 15 May 2018 by NPBs for the scope of their taxable activities. The problem 3.1 The current GST treatment of NPBs is concessionary because it can allow almost full input tax deductibility even if very few taxable supplies are made. Therefore, GST-registered NPBs can be advantaged by GST relative to other registered persons. The recent interpretation of “taxable activity” only increases this advantage and, in doing so, causes a significant but unquantifiable fiscal risk. 3.2 The revenue risk could arise from certain key events including from the disposal by GST-registered NPBs of any assets to which GST may have been expected to apply but, because of the new interpretation of “taxable activity” by Inland Revenue, will not apply. The risk could also arise for other events which are treated for GST purposes in the same way as if a disposal of assets had occurred such as insurance pay-outs and GST deregistration which we have called “equivalent events” in this issues paper. Another revenue risk could also arise, depending on the circumstances, from the application of the second-hand goods input tax credit. Finally, there is a revenue risk from the possibility of the suggested interpretation applying retrospectively so as to result in refunds of GST previously paid. The main proposal 3.3 The Government intends to amend the GST Act to reduce the input tax/output tax mismatch caused by the interpretation of taxable activity just outlined. The first proposal, therefore, is to amend the input tax deductibility 6 rule for NPBs, so that, on the sale or equivalent event of goods or services (that is, receipt of an insurance payment or deregistration) they will be subject to GST. The amendment will provide that goods and services that are treated as relating to taxable supplies are also deemed to have been acquired in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The rule will apply to sales by NPBs or equivalent events occurring on or after 15 May 2018 whether the affected goods or services were acquired before, during or after that date. Example 2: Aligning input and output tax A healthcare NPB is devoted to monitoring the health of children under the age of five in the local community. The NPB is partly funded by the local health board which provides the NPB with the necessary medical staff. The NPB obtains the necessary medical equipment and overhead expenses out of its own fund-raising activities. The NPB also leases out child car seats and baby equipment to the public for a fee. The NPB has claimed input tax credits for all the GST it has incurred in acquiring the equipment needed for both the health monitoring service and the hiring activity, and for rent and other overheads relating to both activities. The NPB decides that the hiring activity is detracting from its main activity of providing health checks and therefore decides to sell off the car seats and baby equipment to the highest bidders. It also discovers that there is now better medical equipment available for rent, the cost of which could be met by selling off the existing medical equipment to other health providers. Under the government’s proposal the NPB will be required to pay GST on the proceeds of sale of the car seats, baby equipment and medical equipment. Before the proposal it may have been argued that the sale of the medical equipment was not subject to GST as it was not sufficiently connected with the activity of hiring out car seats and baby equipment for a fee. 3.4 There would be no specific rule for goods and services acquired before 1986. Input tax deductions will not have been claimed for the capital cost o f acquiring the goods and services but, if input tax deductions for expenses attributable to such goods and services had been claimed, the goods and services will be treated as if they had been brought into the GST base and therefore output tax would apply. Other GST-registered ent it ies wit h pre- 1986 assets are generally required to pay output tax on sale of the assets or equivalent event so the proposed approach aligns the GST treatment with the general treatment. Unexpected GST cost 3.5 It is possible that some NPBs will have claimed input tax credits for goods and services for which it was not expected there would be an output tax liability on sale or equivalent event. This would be where they had already taken a view that it was possible to claim input tax deductions but not pay related output tax if the relevant good or service was not sufficient ly connected with supplies made for a consideration. In that case it would seem fair to allow these NPBs to pay back any GST already claimed and remove the relevant goods and services from the GST base so as to put the NPBs in the same position as if that GST had never been claimed. 7 3.6 The idea is that these NPBs could, for a limited time, either notify Inland Revenue or apply to Inland Revenue to pay back any input tax claimed on goods and services affected by the changed interpretation since the date they were registered for GST, rather than pay output tax on the sale of the particular assets or an equivalent event. The main instances in which this is likely to be a better outcome for an NPB is with land or any other asset that appreciates rather than depreciates in value. 3.7 The suggested period for allowing input tax deductions to be paid back in this way is 12 months from the date of enactment of the proposals. This would ensure that NPBs using six-monthly GST filing periods have enough time to consider their positions for the next GST filing period. 3.8 It is recognised that a good proportion of NPBs will have been registered for many years and also held their relevant assets for many years. On the other hand, tax records are generally only required to be held for seven years. This means that the exact level of relevant input tax deductions over the period since registration may not be known or not known without involving substantial compliance costs. Therefore, for any period where it is difficult to determine the level of input tax deduction claims made (either in total or in relation to a specific asset or assets) a reasonable estimate of the claims will be able to be used. Any output tax paid would be deducted from the calculation. 3.9 Further points to consider: • What form of notification or application should be required to be made by an NPB electing to pay past input tax deductions under this proposal? • The level of guidance needed to determine what is a “reasonable estimate” of input tax deductions claimed. • Whether there should be a threshold for the affected goods and services so that applications to repay input tax deductions are only available if the deductions related to goods and services that are in aggregate over a certain market value – for example $50,000. • If and how use-of-money interest (UOMI) should be applied to the amount repaid. 3.10 The Government is concerned about any compliance cost increase for NPBs resulting from the “taxable activity” interpretation and that the issue could affect more NPBs than just those which decided to remove an asset from the GST base that no longer meet the “taxable activity” requirement since all NPBs will have an interest in ensuring the best tax outcome. Therefore, we are particularly interested in submissions on the idea and whether it is outweighed by compliance cost considerations. 3.11 Examples 3 and 4 illustrate how the idea to allow the repayment of input tax deductions from an affected asset and remove it from the GST base would apply in practice. 8 Example 3 A GST-registered charitable trust owns a historic nineteenth century church in the Bay of Plenty region in which religious services have been regularly held. In 2013 the trust built a hall next to the church for the use of parishioners but also for the use of the general public for a small fee (which has never exceeded the $60,000 compulsory registration threshold). Input tax deductions have been claimed by the trust for the GST incurred in acquiring the hall, for the maintenance costs of both buildings and for general overhead costs. Parishioner numbers have been steadily declining while maintenance costs, including earthquake strengthening costs, have risen sharply. The trust therefore decides to wind up and distribute its assets for charitable purposes. The trust had received an “on balance” view from its tax accountant in 2013 that, if the church was sold or the trust deregistered, output tax would not be payable notwithstanding full input tax deductions could be claimed for expenses related to both the hall and the church. However, the government is now proposing to clarify the legislation so that output tax is in fact payable on the sale of the church or an equivalent event such as deregistration from GST. Because it is winding up, the trust will need to deregister for GST, meaning that GST would be payable on the market value of the church and the hall as well as any other goods or services held by the trust at that time. The trust could, however, elect to limit this outcome by returning to Inland Revenue within the proposed twelve-month period its best estimate of all input tax deductions previously claimed for the church. The result would be equivalent to the trust never having included the church as part of its taxable activity. Example 4 A GST-registered university in Wellington provides a free student counselling service close to its campus in a building that was bequeathed in 1990 by a renowned psychologist and former student subject to the terms of a special purpose trust. At that time the property had a rateable value of $345,000. The university has since 1990 claimed a second-hand goods input tax credit of $45,000 for the property which represents the notional GST on the market value of the property when acquired. It has also been claiming input tax deductions for expenses relating to the counselling service including repairs and maintenance of the building, general overheads and payments to bring in the occasional overseas expert. The sum of deductions claimed since 1990 (including the second-hand goods claim) is $245,000. Student demand for the service has been rapidly increasing. As the building is now valued at $1.5m the university is considering selling the building for the long-term sustainability of the service. Under the proposals the university would be required to pay output tax on the sale price of the building if it were to sell it. The GST liability would therefore be $225,000 which would need to be added into the sale price (whether or not zero-rated because the sale is to a GST-registered purchaser). After considering the recent interpretation of what would constitute a taxable activity for an NPB in the absence of the amendment to section 20(3K), the University is of the view that the property and free counselling service is not part of its taxable activity. It considers whether it is worth paying back all the related GST expenses and decides not to do so because the cost of this is greater than the GST cost of the sale of the building. 9 Application date and transitional rules 3.12 Because of the need to provide early certainty to the sector, coupled with the risk of the interpretation suggested in this chapter potentially giving rise to refund requests relating to past positions, it is proposed that the amendments apply to tax positions taken on or after 15 May 2018. 3.13 A savings provision for tax positions taken before 15 May 2018 is also proposed, meaning that NPBs will not be able to change a position for the proposed amendments if such a position has not been taken before that date. This means that if an NPB has taken the tax position before 15 May 2018 that an asset that it has sold before that date (or is the subject of an equivalent event before that date) is not part of its taxable activity, the NPB will not be retrospectively subject to GST on that sale or event. Conversely, if an NPB has taken the position that an asset sold, or equivalent event, before 15 May 2018 is subject to GST, that GST will not be able to be claimed back retrospectively. While it is recognised that there could be some concerns raised in submissions about neutrality of treatment, the approach does ensure that NPBs do not need to revisit the past GST positions taken, thereby reducing the compliance costs of the proposals. 3.14 To better ensure that the suggested application date and transitional rules do not themselves give rise to uncertainty, submissions are welcomed on these aspects of the proposals as well as the substantive legislative proposals. 10

This means that speculators and investors will no longer be able to offset tax losses from their residential properties against their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income), to reduce their income tax liability. Current settings 1.3 Under current New Zealand tax settings, tax is applied on a person’s net income. We do not generally ring-fence income and losses from particular activities or investments. This means that there is generally no restriction on losses from one source reducing income from other sources – though there are some exceptions to this general treatment. 1 1.4 Investment housing is currently taxed under the same rules that generally apply to other investments. This means that rents are income, and interest and other expenses (other than capital improvements) are deductible. Capit al gains on sale of the property are not taxed unless the property is on revenue account. This could be, for example, because you are in a land-related business (for example, a land dealer or developer), bought the land for resale, or sell the property within the bright-line period of either two or five years (depending on when you first had an interest in the land). 2 Most rental property investors hold their property on capital account and are not subject to tax on the capital gain. 1.5 While rental housing is not formally tax favoured, there is an argument that it may be under-taxed given that tax-free capital gains are often realised when rental properties are sold. The fact that rental property investors often make persistent tax losses indicates that expected capital gains are an important motivation for many investors purchasing rental property. While interest and other expenses are fully deductible, in the absence of a comprehensive 1 For example, there are loss ring-fencing rules in relation to the bright-line test, which taxes sales of residential land bought and sold within either two or five years (depending on when you first had an interest in the land), and also in relation to the mixed-use asset rules, which may apply to assets that are used both privately and to earn income. 2 The bright-line period is two years if you first acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after 1 October 2015, but is five years if you first acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after the date the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 is enacted. 1 capital gains tax, not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. There is therefore an argument that, to the extent deductible expenses in the long-term exceed income from rents, those expenses in fact relate to the capital gain, so should not be deductible unless the capital gain is taxed. Aim of the proposed changes 1.6 The introduction of loss ring-fencing rules is aimed at levelling the playing field between property speculators/investors and home buyers. Currently investors (particularly highly-geared investors) have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by the reduced tax on their other income sources, helping them to outbid owner-occupiers for properties. Rules that ring-fence residential property losses, so they cannot be used to reduce tax on other income, is intended to help reduce this advantage and perceived unfairness. 1.7 Officials are interested in feedback on the suggested changes outlined in this paper. How to make a submission 1.8 Officials invite submissions on the suggested changes and points raised in this issues paper. Send your submission to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Ring-fencing rental losses” in the subject line. 1.9 Alternatively, submissions can be sent to: Ring-fencing rental losses C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.10 The closing date for submissions is 11 May 2018. 1.11 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.12 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 2 CHAPTER 2 Summary of the suggested changes 2.1 The proposed loss ring-fencing rules will mean that speculators and investors with residential properties will no longer be able to offset tax losses from those properties against their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income), to reduce their tax liability. The losses can be used in future years, when the properties are making profits, or if the person is taxed on the sale of land. 2.2 A summary of officials’ suggestions for the design of the loss ring-fencing rules is set out below. These design issues are discussed in more detail in the chapters that follow. Property the rules will apply to 2.3 It is proposed that the loss ring-fencing rules will apply to “residential land”. We suggest that the rules use the definition of “residential land” 3 that already exists for the bright-line test which taxes sales of residential land bought and sold within eit her two or five years. 4 2.4 The rules would not apply to: • a person’s main home; • a property that is subject to the mixed-use assets rules (for example, a bach that is sometimes used privately and sometimes rented out); or • land that is on revenue account because it is held in a land-related business 5 (that is, a business of land dealing, development of land, division of land, or building). Portfolio basis 2.5 It is suggested that the loss ring-fencing rules should apply on a portfolio basis. That would mean that investors would be able to offset losses from one rental property against rental income from other properties – calculating their overall pro fit or loss across their portfolio. 3 In section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4 The bright-line period is two years if you first acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after 1 October 2015, but is five years if you first acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after the date the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 is enacted. 5 As per section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3 Using ring-fenced losses 2.6 Under the suggested changes, a person’s ring-fenced resident ial rental or other losses from one year could be offset against their: • residential rental income from future years (from any property); and • taxable inco me on the sale of any residential land. Interposed entities 2.7 Under the suggested changes, there would be special rules to ensure that trust, company, partnership, or look-through company cannot be used to get around the ring-fencing rules. It is proposed that such an entity will be regarded as “residential property land-rich” if over 50 percent of its assets are residential properties within the scope of the ring-fencing rules, and/or shares or interests in other residential property land-rich entities. Where that is the case, it is suggested that any interest a person incurs on money they borrow to acquire an interest in the entity (for example, shares, securities, a partnership interest, or an interest in the trust estate) would be treated as rental property loan interest. The rules could then ensure that the interest deduction is only allocated to the income year in question to the extent it did not exceed the distributions from the entity (deemed rental property income), any other residential rental income, and residential land sale income. Any excess of interest over distributions, rental income, and land sale income would be carried forward and treated as “rental property loan interest” for the next income year. Timing of the introduction of the rules 2.8 It is proposed that the loss ring-fencing rules will apply from the start of the 2019–20 income year. The rules could either apply in full from the outset, or they could be phased in over two or three years. We are interested in feedback on which of those approaches should be taken. 4 CHAPTER 3 Property the rules will apply to 3.1 Under the proposed changes, the loss ring-fencing rules would apply to “residential land”. The rules would use the definition of “residential land” that already exists for the bright-line test. 3.2 The rules would not apply to: • a person’s main home; • a property that is subject to the mixed-use assets rules (for example, a bach that is sometimes used privately and sometimes rented out); or • land that is on revenue account because it is held in a land-related business 6 (that is, a business of land dealing, development of land, division of land, or building). Definition of “residential land” 3.3 There is already a definition of “residential land” in the Inco me Tax Act, which is used for the bright-line test which taxes sales of residential land bought and sold within two years. It is proposed that the loss ring-fencing rules apply to land within that definition – with the exceptions discussed below. Using the definit io n already in the legislat ion would avo id the additional complexity of having different definitions for different rules. 3.4 “Residential land” means: • land that has a dwelling on it; • land for which there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it; and • bare land that may have a dwelling built on it under the relevant operative district plan rules. However, “residential land” does not include: • farmland; and • land used predominantly as business premises. 3.5 “Residential land” is not limited to land in New Zealand – it would extend to overseas land. This means that losses from overseas residential rental investments could not be offset against other income in New Zealand. 3.6 Apart from the exceptions below, the rules would apply to all resident ial land, whether or not it is currently rented out, including bare land. This is 6 As per section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 5 because the proposed rules are aimed at levelling the playing field between residential property speculators/investors and people looking to buy their own home or land to build a home on. Main home 3.7 The proposed loss ring-fencing rules will not apply to a person’s main ho me. This is to ensure that a person who has a boarder in their main home, or who rents out a spare room occasionally, would not have to apply these rules, which are primarily targeted at residential investment properties. The meaning of “main home” would be the same as for the bright-line test, which has a main home exclusion. 3.8 A person can only have one main home at a time. If someone has more than one residence, their “main home” would be the one they have the greatest connection with. That would be determined by looking at factors such as: • the amount of time the person occupies the dwelling; • where their immediate family live; • where their social ties are strongest; • their use of the dwelling; • their employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and • where their personal property is kept. Trusts 3.9 A significant number of family homes in New Zealand are owned by family trusts. The definition of “main home” would therefore ensure that a home owned by a trust can be regarded as a main home. 3.10 Like with the bright-line rules, we suggest that a dwelling owned by a trust only be considered a main home (so not subject to the loss ring-fencing rules) if it is the main home for a beneficiary of the trust, provided that a principal settlor of the trust does not have a different main home. 3.11 This restrict ion would ensure that trust ownership cannot be used to claim multiple properties as main homes, and so not subject to the loss ring-fencing rules. Mixed-use assets 3.12 The existing definition of “residential land” in the Income Tax Act would also include holiday houses that are sometimes used privately and sometimes rented out. However, many such properties would be subject to the mixed- use asset rules, which already provide for the quarantining (or ring-fencing) of losses where there is low income-earning use of the asset. 6 3.13 We suggest that property subject to the mixed-use asset rules should be scoped out of the rental loss ring-fencing rules, because the mixed-use asset quarantine rules will cover most if not all mixed-use asset losses. We are interested in feedback on whether property subject to the mixed-use asset rules should be outside the scope of the loss ring-fencing rules. Revenue account land in dealing, development, subdivision and building businesses 3.14 Land that is held in certain land-related business is on revenue account, so the profits on sale are taxed. This applies to land held in dealing, development, subdivision, and building businesses. 3.15 At balance date, taxpayers in these businesses are likely to have a number of properties on hand, though they may not be currently rented out. 3.16 As discussed in chapter 5, it is proposed that resident ial rental or other losses could be used against taxable land sales to reduce the taxable gain to nil, with any further unused losses remaining ring-fenced to future rental income or taxable inco me on land sales. While taxpayers in the business of land dealing, development of land, division of land, or building may have losses in respect of properties on hand at balance date, those losses being able to be used against income from other sales or rental activity in the year would mean that their businesses would be unlikely to be disadvantaged by the ring- fencing rules. In most cases the income from their sale or rental activity would be expected to exceed their losses. 3.17 However, in any overall loss-making year, we do not consider it necessary to ring-fence losses for land held in these businesses. There is not the same concern about any of the deductible expenses in relation to land in these businesses relating to untaxed gains, as all of the businesses’ land is on revenue account. Therefore, we propose that the ring-fencing rules not apply to land that is on revenue account because it is held in a land-related business. 7 This would enable taxpayers in these businesses to use losses arising in any year against other income – for example within their corporate group (as they are likely to be companies). Property owned by companies and trusts 3.18 There is an argument that the loss ring-fencing rules should apply only to individuals (that is, natural persons), 8 and not to companies or trusts. This argument could be made because company losses are effectively ring-fenced inside the company, as are losses in a trust. 7 As per section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 8 This would include a natural person with an effective interest in a look-through company with residential property losses. 7 3.19 However, such an approach would leave open the possibility of individual speculators or investors operating through a company or trading trust, ho lding their residential properties in that vehicle, and offsetting the losses against their labour income. It would also mean that a family trust holding residential rental property and also some other investments could offset rental property losses against income from the other investments. For example, it would not be fair for a professional operating through a company or trust to not be subject to the ring-fencing rules where another person operating as a sole trader would be. 3.20 It is acknowledged that there may be some compliance costs for some corporates that own some residential property incidentally to their business. However, it is considered that limiting the ring-fencing rules to individuals would significantly undermine the fairness of the rules. For this reason, we suggest that the ring-fencing rules should apply to all taxpayers, not only to individual taxpayers. 8 CHAPTER 4 Portfolio basis 4.1 It is suggested that the loss ring-fencing rules should apply on a portfolio basis. That would mean that investors would be able to offset losses from one rental property against rental income from other properties – calculating their overall profit or loss across their portfolio. 4.2 The alternative – a property by property basis – would mean that each property would need to be looked at separately, with losses on one not able to be offset against income from another. 4.3 A property by property approach would be stricter than a portfolio approach, achieving the highest level of ring-fencing. However, it would add complexit y, as losses would need to be tracked separately for each property. Moreover, a property by property approach may just result in taxpayers with portfolios re-balancing their debt funding to avoid having loss-making properties (or at least minimising the extent to which any particular property is loss-making). That response to the rules applying on a property by property basis would be inefficient, and may mean that this approach may have no real advantage over a portfolio approach – adding considerable complexity and increasing compliance costs for no real gain. 4.4 Also, a property by property approach may be seen as unfair in that if a taxpayer has two properties and breaks even on the portfolio overall, the taxpayer’s tax position would depend on whether they break even on both properties or make a gain on one and a loss on the other. 4.5 We therefore suggest that the ring-fencing rules apply on a portfolio basis, so a person with multiple properties would calculate their overall profit or loss across their who le residential portfo lio. 9 CHAPTER 5 Using ring-fenced losses 5.1 Under the suggested changes, ring-fenced residential rental or other losses from one year would could be offset against: • resident ial rental income from future years (from any property); and • taxable inco me on the sale of any resident ial land. 5.2 Most residential rental investors are not subject to tax on the sale of their investment properties under current tax rules. However, in some circumstances, the sale of a residential rental property may be taxed under one of the land sale rules in the Income Tax Act – or the taxpayer may have taxable inco me on the sale of other residential property (not rented out). This could be the case, for example, because the taxpayer is in a land-related business (for example, a land dealer or developer), bought the land for resale, or sells the property within the bright-line period of either two or five years (depending on when they first had an interest in the land). 9 5.3 Under the suggested changes, where a taxpayer sells a property that is subject to the ring-fencing rules (that is, a residential property) and the sale is taxed, any ring-fenced losses the taxpayer has could be used to reduce the taxable gain on sale to nil. Any remaining unused losses would stay ring-fenced, and could be used against any future resident ial rental income or taxable income on other resident ial land sales. 5.4 There is an argument that in the case of a property with ring-fenced losses that is taxed under one of the land sale rules on disposal, the losses should be able to fully utilised (that is, un-fenced) at that point, and be used to offset any other income of the taxpayer. This would reflect that all of the economic income from the investment has been taxed (the rental stream and the capital gain), and that the investor should not be penalised for making an overall loss on the investment. 5.5 However, if the rules are to apply on a portfolio basis, as suggested, allowing accumulated losses to give rise to a tax loss on a disposal subject to one of the land sale rules would create risks. For example, it would enable a portfolio investor to sell a property that has made a small capital gain within the bright-line period, offset that gain with ring-fenced losses from across their portfolio, and apply any remaining losses from the portfolio against other income. While there are ring-fencing rules in relation to the bright-line test, they only apply to deductions for the cost of the land, not other costs. 9 The bright-line period is two years if you first acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after 1 October 2015, but is five years if you first acquired an estate or interest in the land on or after the date the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 is enacted. 10 5.6 Enabling taxpayers to sell their lowest capital gain makers within the bright- line period and access what might be substantial portfolio-wide accumulated ring-fenced losses would significantly undermine the credibility of the rules. 5.7 For this reason, we propose that where a disposal is caught by one of the land sale rules, ring-fenced losses should be allowed to be used only to the extent they reduce the taxable gain to nil, with any further unused losses remaining ring-fenced. 11 CHAPTER 6 Structuring around the rules 6.1 There are two main structuring opportunities that we have considered creating specific rules to deal with. These concern interest allocation and the interposing of entities. Interest allocation 6.2 We have considered whether specific interest allocation rules are required, as without them investors may be able to structure around the loss ring-fencing rules. For example, this could be done by reorganising funding so that business assets other than rental properties are debt-funded, and rental properties are equity-funded to the greatest extent possible. 6.3 However, interest allocation rules would add substantial complexity and compliance costs. Because money is fungible, it is very difficult to attempt to match borrowings to particular investments (tracing). Stacking rules (for example, allocating debt firstly to ring-fenced investments) may be seen as unfair. And pro rata interest allocation between assets that are subject to the ring-fencing rules and those that are not would require regular valuation of assets. 6.4 If interest on any loan that was secured by a residential property was included in the rules, this would create issues for many people who use their rental properties to secure loans for their businesses. This would impact on small and medium business’ access to capital. In addit io n, many arrangements could be even more difficult to apply interest allocation rules to, as revolving credit facilities are often used to fund both a rental property and a business. 6.5 We do not propose specific interest allocation rules because of the considerable complexit y and compliance costs they would add, which would be particularly onerous on smaller taxpayers. Interposed entities 6.6 Under the suggested changes, there would be special rules to ensure that a trust, company, partnership, or look-through company cannot be used to get around the ring-fencing rules. These ownership structures are referred to here as entities for simplicity. 6.7 Otherwise a simple way to get around the ring-fencing rules would be for a taxpayer to interpose an entity to hold a residential rental property, and borrow money to invest in or acquire an interest in the entity. For example, a taxpayer could borrow money to buy shares in a company, which uses those funds to buy a residential investment property. Because the money is borrowed to buy shares, the individual taxpayer would be able to claim 12 deductions for the interest on the borrowings, and offset those amounts against other income sources. 6.8 However, if the taxpayer had used the borrowed money to purchase the property directly themselves, the interest expense would be attributable to the residential rental investment, not shares, so would be taken into account in determining whether the person’s residential rental activity was profit or loss-making. And if the rental activity was loss-making, losses would be ring-fenced under the proposal rules. 6.9 This simple mechanism is illustrated in figure 1. Lo an $1m Bank Standard loanStructuring a loan through a company Purchase house w it h $1m Buys shares for $1m Lo an $1m Bank Company X Purchase house w it h $1m Figure 1 • Person borrows money $1m from bank. • Person purchases residential rental property for $1m using loaned money. • Interest paid to bank is directly attributable to residential rental property. • Person sets up Company X. • Person borrows money $1m from bank. • Person purchases shares in Company X for $1m. • Company X purchases residential rental property for $1m using capital from shareholder. • Interest person pays to bank is directly attributable to acquiring shares rather than residential rental property, and therefore not ring-fenced unless specifically covered. 6.10 A specific rule to deal with the interposing of entities would ensure that this simple mechanism cannot be used to get around the loss ring-fencing rules, undermining their credibility. 13 6.11 A suggested approach to dealing with interposed entities is to specifically define when such entities would be “residential property land-rich”. It is proposed that this would be the case where over 50 percent of the entity’s assets are residential properties within the scope of the ring-fencing rules, and/or shares or interests in other residential property land-rich entities. The rules could then treat dividends, interest, or distributions from the entity as being “rental property income”, and treat interest on borrowings to acquire an interest in the entity (for example, shares, securities, a partnership interest, or an interest in the trust estate), as “rental property loan interest”. The rules could then ensure that the interest deduction is only allocated to the income year in question to the extent it did not exceed the distributions from the entity (deemed rental property income), any other residential rental income, and residential land sale income (as discussed in chapter 5). Any excess of interest over distributions, rental income, and land sale income would be carried forward and treated as “rental property loan interest” for the next income year. This would mean that losses from rental properties would not reduce the tax on other sources of income. 6.12 This suggested approach is illustrated in figure 2. Figure 2 Owns house w or th $1m and o ther assets worth $50,0 00 Buys shares for $1m Lo an $1m Bank Company X $40,000 dividend (treated as “rental p ro per ty in com e”) $45,000 interest paid (treated as “rental property loan interest”) • More than 50 percent of Company X’s assets are residential property, so Company X is “residential property land-rich”. • Because Company X is “residential property land-rich”: – the $40,000 dividend the person receives is treated as “rental property income”; and – the $45,000 interest on the loan to buy shares in the Company X is treated as “rental property loan interest”. • The $45,000 deduction for “rental property loan interest” is more than the “rental property income” of $40,000, so only $40,000 of the deduction is allocated to this income year. • The remaining $5,000 deduction is carried forward and treated as “rental property loan interest” for the next income year. 14 6.13 We are interested in feedback on this suggested approach to preventing the simple interposition of an entity to get around the ring-fencing rules. 15 CHAPTER 7 Timing of introduction of the rules 7.1 It is proposed that the loss ring-fencing rules will apply from the start of the 2019–20 income year. 7.2 The rules could either apply in full from the outset, or alternatively they could be phased in over two or three years. If the rules are phased in, this would be done by reducing the proportion of losses that could be used to offset other income over a two or three year period, until no losses could be used to offset other income sources. For example, if phased in over two years, 50 percent of residential investment losses could be used to offset other income in 2019–20, and no offsetting would be allowed in 2020–21. 7.3 Tax law changes are not usually phased in. But this possible approach has been suggested to allow affected investors more time to adjust to the new rules, or to rearrange their affairs before the rules apply in full. However, we note that phased introduction of the rules would result in some additional complexit y. 7.4 We are interested in feedback on whether the loss ring-fencing rules should apply in full from the 2019–20 income year – the simpler approach – or be phased in over two or three years. 16

One attachment to the Cabinet paper is not included in this information release as it is publicly available: • Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2018 Information withheld No information was withheld for this information release.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee STUDENT LOAN SCHEME (REPAYMENT THRESHOLD) REGULATIONS 2018 Proposal 1. I propose that the Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2018 (the Regulations). The Regulations increase the income threshold at which New Zealand-based student loan borrowers must begin to repay their student loan, from $19,448 to $19,760, for the tax year beginning 1 April 2019. Policy 2. Section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 allows the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to make regulations setting the annual repayment threshold, or a means by which it may be calculated or ascertained. 3. The annual method for setting the student loan repayment threshold is to use the September quarter annual consumers price index-all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products (CPI-ex tobacco) as the basis for adjustment for the following tax year \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. 4. I propose to increase the annual student loan repayment threshold from $19,448 to $19,760 ($380 per week) for the tax year beginning 1 April 2019. This increase was calculated by applying the September 2018 quarter CPI-ex tobacco value of 1021, as published by Statistics New Zealand, to the unrounded threshold for the 2018-19 tax year and rounding up to the nearest $52 (to create a round weekly dollar threshold). 5. The effect of the adjustment will be that New Zealand-based borrowers will be able to retain an additional $6 per week (over 52 weeks this would be $312) of weekly income before their student loan repayments are deducted by employers. Borrowers not subject to PAYE deductions will have an additional $312 per year before they must begin to make repayments. Financial implications 6. Funding changes associated with increasing the student loan repayment threshold were agreed to by Cabinet for 2017-18 and out-years on 5 December 2016 \[CAB-16- MIN-0655 refers\]. Therefore, increasing the student loan repayment threshold for the 2019-20 tax year has no impact on the operating balance and no changes to appropriations are required. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:10:04 Administrative implications 7. Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year. Inland Revenue generally issues several drafts of payroll specifications to allow users to determine payroll impacts and test their systems in plenty of time before changes take effect. However, finalised specifications are not published until December, so it would be possible to include an increased student loan repayment threshold in the final publication of the payroll specification if Cabinet decisions are made in December. 8. Provision for giving effect to threshold changes is built into Inland Revenue’s work programmes so will be funded within existing baselines. Timing and 28-day rule 9. A waiver of the 28-day rule is not required as the Regulations are not proposed to come into force until 1 April 2019 and will apply for the 2019-20 tax year. Compliance 10. The regulations comply with: 10.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 10.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993; 10.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 10.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 10.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 11. Officials consider that as the adjustment is of a minor and routine nature, it is unnecessary to refer the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2018 to the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 12. The Regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact analysis 13. A regulatory impact assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:10:04 Publicity 14. Inland Revenue will publish information about the new threshold and its impact in the student loan section of its website. The Minister of Education and I will also issue a joint press release nearer to the time the Regulations will come into effect. 15. Inland Revenue will publish an article about this change in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive release 16. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in part, in line with the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 17. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Education on the proposal to increase the repayment threshold for the 2019-20 tax year. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that on 5 December 2016 the Cabinet Legislation Committee agreed to the methodology for calculating the student loan repayment threshold and funding changes for 2017-18 and out-years \[CAB-16-MIN-0655\]. 2. note that an Order in Council is required under section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to set the student loan income repayment threshold. 3. note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2018 will increase the student loan repayment threshold to $19,760 for the 2019-20 tax year. 4. note that increasing the student loan repayment threshold for the 2019-20 tax year has no impact on the operating balance and no changes to appropriations are required. 5. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2018. 6. note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2018 will come into force on 1 April 2019.
