Page 1 20 May 2010 Guide to the tax changes proposed in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill 2010 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Page Personal tax cuts 1 New tax rates for companies and savings 10 GST rate increase 17 Depreciation & capital contributions 24 Working for Families: removing the automatic indexation of the income threshold and excluding investment losses 35 Personal tax cuts Under changes proposed in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill 2010, all personal income tax rates will be reduced from 1 October 2010. To ensure that the effects of the tax cuts flow through the tax system appropriately, other consequential amendments to the tax Acts will be needed. The Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill 2010 therefore proposes to amend fringe benefit tax rates, secondary employment codes, withholding tax rates for casual agricultural employees and election day workers, extra pay rates, ESCT rates, PIE rates, RWT rates, RSCT rates, withholding rates for some Māori authority distributions, ACC attendant care withholding rates, child taxpayer tax credits and transitional circumstances tax credits. Transitional provisional tax rules for individual taxpayers are also proposed. Redundancy payment tax credits are proposed to be removed from 1 October 2010, and fund withdrawal tax also phased out from that date. Key features • Under the changes proposed in the bill, the new tax rates will apply to income earned by individuals from 1 October 2010. • The bottom tax rate will be lowered from 12.5% to 10.5%, the 21% rate to 17.5%, the 33% rate to 30%, and the highest rate lowered from 38% to 33%. Page 2 • Consequential changes to other aspects of the tax legislation – such as PAYE tax and provisional tax, resident withholding tax rates for interest income, portfolio investment entity tax rates, and fringe benefit tax – will be made to coincide with these changes. • The bill does not amend some withholding tax rates (for example, the 19.5% tax rate for Māori authorities, and certain withholding tax rates such as payments to horticultural contractors). These rates will be reviewed as it is not clear what rates are appropriate for these payments. Application date Generally these changes apply from 1 October 2010. Fund withdrawal tax will not apply to withdrawals that relate to contributions made on or after 1 October 2010. Redundancy tax credits will not be available for redundancy payments derived after 1 October 2010. Detailed analysis Composite income tax rates for the 2010–11 income year (clause 71(1)) Income tax is calculated based on a person’s annual income. Because the proposed tax rates will be changing part-way through the 2010–11 income year, the new tax rates that will apply for the whole of the 2010–11 income year are “composite tax rates” that reflect an average of the two income tax rates that are used during the year. The table below shows the income tax rates that will be used during the 2010–11 income year as well as the composite tax rates for the year. The new composite rates will be contained in schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and are shown below: Old tax rates applying to PAYE for the period 1 April 2010 – 30 Sept 2010 New tax rates applying to PAYE for the period 1 Oct 2010 – 31 March 2011 Composite tax rates for 2010–11 income year $0 – $14,000 12.5% 10.5% 11.5% $14,001 – $48,000 21% 17.5% 19.25% $48,001 – $70,000 33% 30% 31.5% $70,001 and over 38% 33% 35.5% Page 3 Income tax rates for the 2011–12 and future income years (clause 71(2)) Proposed schedule 1, part A, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new income tax rates for the 2011–12 and future income years. The new rates will be: Income tax rates for the 2010–11 and future income years Income range Tax rate $0 – $14,000 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 30% $70,001 and over 33% PAYE rates: M and ML tax codes The new income tax rates will apply to PAYE for the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010. For pay periods that span the 1 October date and are for a month or are shorter, PAYE will be deducted at the new rates. If the pay period spanning 1 October is longer than a month, then PAYE should be deducted at the old rate for the part of the pay period before 1 October and at the new rate for the part of the pay period after 1 October. The new rates will be: PAYE rates from 1 October 2010 Income range Tax rate $0 – $14,000 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 30% $70,001 and over 33% Inland Revenue’s PAYE deduction tables will be updated to reflect the new rates, so the M and ML tax codes reflect the new rates. PAYE rates: secondary employment income (clause 36) Proposed schedule 2, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 reduces withholding tax rates on secondary employment income to reflect the new tax rates. This will apply from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010. The new rates will be: PAYE rates from 1 October 2010: secondary employment income Income range Tax code Tax rate $0 – $14,000 SB 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 S 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 SH 30% $70,001 and over ST 33% Page 4 Extra pays (clauses 37) Lump sums earned in the course of employment (“extra pays”) are generally taxed at the employee’s marginal rate. Proposed schedule 2, part B, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will reduce withholding tax rates on extra pays to reflect the new marginal tax rates. These will apply from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010. The new rates will be: Tax rates for extra pays Income range Tax rate $0 – $14,000 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 30% $70,001 and over 33% PAYE rates: casual agricultural employees and election day workers (clause 36) Proposed schedule 2, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 reduces withholding tax rates for casual agricultural employees and election day workers. The rate will drop from 21% to 17.5%, to reflect the second-to-lowest marginal tax rate and will apply from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010. Resident withholding tax rates on interest income for individuals (clause 32) Schedule 1, part D, table 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new resident withholding tax (RWT) rates for individuals who receive interest income. These reflect the proposed new personal tax rates of 33%, 30%, 17.5% and 10.5%. Non-declaration rate Row 1 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 will replace the previous 38% RWT rate that applied if a person had not supplied their interest payer with their tax file number with a 33% rate, to align with the new highest marginal tax rate. Default rates Row 2 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 introduces a new 33% default rate from 1 October 2010 for people who have opened a new account with an interest payer after 31 March 2010 but do not elect a tax rate. Row 5 of schedule 1, part D, table 2 provides for a 17.5% default rate from 1 October 2010 for people who have not opened a new account after 31 March 2010 and have not made a tax rate election. Additionally, table 2 sets out transitional rules so that people who elected rates before 1 October 2010 shift automatically on that date to the relevant new RWT rates. The new rates will apply from 1 October 2010. Page 5 Consequential change to resident withholding tax rates on interest income for companies (clause 33) Schedule 1, part D, table 3, rows 3 and 4 are being amended to reflect changes to personal income tax rates. This will reduce the rate of resident withholding tax from 38% to 33% for interest paid to a company when the recipient of the interest has either elected for the top personal rate to apply or has not supplied their tax file number to the payer. This will apply from 1 October 2010. Portfolio investment entity (PIE) rates (clauses 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30 and 39) Proposed schedule 6, table 1 is being amended to lower the tax rates that apply to investors in portfolio investment entities (PIEs). The new rates will be: PIE tax rates Taxable income Taxable + PIE income PIE tax rate $0 – $14,000 $0 – $48,000 10.5% $0 – $14,000 $48,001 – $70,000 17.5% $14,001 – $48,000 $0 – $70,000 17.5% $48,001 and over Any 28% Any $70,001 and over 28% Section HM 58 ensures that people who invest in PIEs before 1 October 2010 will automatically shift to the new equivalent rate on 1 October 2010, so that they do not need to re-elect their rate with the PIE. These changes will apply from 1 October 2010. Provisional tax (clauses 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30) The bill introduces changes to sections RZ 3 to RZ 5 to amend the formulas used to calculate provisional tax and allow individuals who pay provisional tax based on the earlier year method to reduce their provisional tax payments from 1 October 2010. To calculate provisional tax from 1 October 2010 that is paid on the basis of an earlier year’s residual income tax (RIT), transitional factors will apply. The following table provides adjustments to the transitional factors for individuals on the standard and the GST ratio methods for calculating provisional tax for the 2010–11 or later income years. Page 6 Years 2010–11 2011–12 2012–13 2013–14 Standard method adjustment – 110% payment decreases to: – 105% payment decreases to: 95% 95% 95% 95% 100% GST ratio method adjustment – Two years before preceding year RIT decreases to: – Year before preceding year RIT decreases to: – Preceding year’s RIT decreases to: 80% 85% 90% 80% 85% 90% 85% 90% 90% For the 2010–11 income year the adjustments apply to provisional tax payments made on or after 1 October 2010. Consequently, the formulas referred to in sections RZ 5B and RZ 5C from the 2008 Budget measures are repealed. New FBT rates (clauses 64 to 70 and 72) Proposed changes to sections RD 50 to 53 and schedule 1, part C, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provide for new fringe benefit tax (FBT) rates and thresholds for attributed fringe benefits. These reflect the new personal tax rates. The changes will apply to the 2010–11 income year and subsequent income years. For the 2010–11 income year, composite rates apply to reflect the two sets of rates being used for that year. The new FBT rates and thresholds for attribution purposes will be: FBT rates for the 2010–11 income year Income range Tax rate $0 – $12,390 0.1299 $12,391 – $39,845 0.2384 $39,846 – $54,915 0.4599 $54,916 and over 0.5504 FBT rates for the 2011–12 and subsequent income years Income range Tax rate $0 – $12,530 0.1171 $12,531 – $40,580 0.2121 $40,581 – $55,980 0.4286 $55,981 and over 0.4925 Page 7 Employers will still have the option of paying FBT at a single rate if they prefer. Proposed changes to sections RD 58 to 61 reduce the single rate from 61% to 49.25%. For close companies and small businesses that are able to file FBT returns annually, the applicable rate will also be reduced to 49.25 from the 2011–12 income year – however, for the 2010–11 income year, a composite rate of 55.04% will apply. New employer superannuation contribution tax rates (clause 31) Contributions that an employer makes to an employee’s superannuation scheme are generally taxed at the employee’s marginal tax rate. Proposed schedule 1, part D, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rates. Under the changes proposed in the bill, the 12.5% rate has been dropped to 10.5% and the 21% rate has been dropped to 17.5%. The rate has been reduced from 33% to 30% for people who earn between $57,601 and $84,000. The changes will apply from the first pay period that ends on or after 1 October 2010. The new rates will be: ESCT rates Income range Tax rate $0 – $16,800 0.105 $16,801 – $57,600 0.175 $57,601 – $84,000 0.300 $84,001 and over 0.330 It should be noted that the income ranges at which the ESCT rates apply are higher than the income ranges that apply for personal tax rates. This is to reduce the risk that employer contributions made to employees whose income is close to a threshold are not overtaxed. New retirement superannuation contribution tax rates (clauses 35, 40 and 42) Contributions made by an approved entity to a member’s superannuation scheme are generally taxed at the member’s marginal rate under the retirement superannuation contribution tax (RSCT) rules. Proposed schedule 1, part D, table 5 and schedule 6, table 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for new RSCT rates that reflect the new personal tax rates. A consequential change has also been made to section 28C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which deals with notification of a person’s retirement scheme prescribed rate, to reflect the new top tax rate. The changes will apply from 1 October 2010. Page 8 ACC attendant carers (clauses 38 and 73) Payments to ACC attendant carers are currently subject to a withholding tax rate of 12.5%, which reflects the bottom tax rate. Proposed schedule 4, part I, clause 1 reduces the withholding tax rate to 10.5% from 1 October 2010. A consequential change is also being made to section 33C(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This will ensure that these taxpayers do not need to file a tax return if they used 10.5% or the 12.5% rate in the 2010–11 income year. Payments from Māori authorities to members who have not provided a tax file number (clause 34) The current rate of tax for Māori authority distributions to members who have not provided a tax file number is 38% in schedule 1, part D, table 4. It is proposed that this rate be reduced to 33% to reflect the reduction in the top personal tax rate. The changes will apply from payments made on or after 1 October 2010. Fund withdrawal tax (clause 4) Fund withdrawal tax (FWT) is a 5% tax payable on some superannuation fund withdrawals for members whose income is above $70,000. FWT was introduced to ensure that taxpayers who are on the highest tax rate were not undertaxed under the employer contribution superannuation tax (ESCT) rules, as the top rate for ESCT was 33%. As a consequence of the bill’s proposal to align the top ESCT rate and the top personal tax rate, fund withdrawal tax is being phased out. Section CS 1 will be amended to ensure that FWT will not apply to withdrawals that relate to contributions made on or after 1 October 2010 (which is the proposed date of the changes to personal rates). However, FWT will continue to apply to withdrawals that relate to contributions made before 1 October 2010 (before the top ESCT rate was aligned with the top marginal tax rate). In some cases the trustee of the superannuation fund may not be able to establish whether an employer’s superannuation contribution was made before or after 1 October 2010. In these cases, the income derived by the fund in section CS 1(2) can be reduced by 50% of the employer-sourced superannuation savings contributed during 2010–11 if: • the withdrawal relates to an employer’s superannuation contribution made during 2010–11; and • the trustee of the fund cannot identify whether an employer’s superannuation contribution was made in the last pay period ending on or after 1 October 2010. Section CS 1 will provide that FWT will not apply to any withdrawals from income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015. Page 9 Child taxpayer credit (clause 59) The child taxpayer credit provides children with a tax rebate on income that is not interest or dividends. This allows an eligible child to earn income (less interest and dividends) up to $2,340 a year tax-free. As a result of the reduction in the lowest tax rate from 12.5% to 10.5%, section LC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be consequentially amended so that the current tax-free threshold stays at the same level. The changes will apply to 2010–11 and later income years. Transitional circumstances credit (clause 60) The transitional circumstances credit effectively provides a tax-free threshold of $5,824. It is available for some people who earn under $9,880. As a result of the reduction in the lowest tax rate from 12.5% to 10.5%, section LC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be consequentially amended so that the current tax-free threshold stays at the same level. The changes will apply to 2010–11 and later income years. Redundancy tax credit (clauses 10 and 11) Section ML 2(1) will be amended to remove the redundancy tax credit from 1 October 2010. The redundancy tax credit was originally introduced to ensure that the receipt of a redundancy payment did not cause a person to move up a tax threshold and be taxed at a significantly higher tax rate than they would ordinarily (the top personal tax rate at the time was 39%, which was 6% higher than the next highest personal tax rate at the time. The 39% rate has since been reduced to 38%.). Because the 38% rate will be reduced to 33% from 1 October, and because there will be a smaller gap between the new 33% top personal tax rates and the next lowest rate of 30%, it is proposed this credit be repealed from 1 October. Page 10 New tax rates for companies and savings (Clauses 5 to 9, 12 to 30, 39, 43, 87 to 91, 97 and 98) The Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill proposes changes to the tax rules for business and investments. • The company tax rate is being reduced from 30% to 28%. • The top tax rate for people saving through portfolio investment entities (PIEs) – including KiwiSaver funds – and other managed funds will also be reduced from 30% to 28%. • Other tax rates that apply to KiwiSaver funds and other PIEs are being reduced in line with the changes to personal income tax rates. • The safe harbour in the thin capitalisation rules that apply to foreign-controlled entities is being reduced from 75% to 60%. Together, these reforms are intended to improve the competitiveness of New Zealand’s company tax system and to encourage saving. The changes to the thin capitalisation rules support this objective by ensuring that tax rates apply effectively to foreign-controlled entities. Key features The company tax rate will be reduced from 30% to 28%. This change also applies to unit trusts, which are taxed as companies. The resident withholding tax rules for interest paid to companies will be amended accordingly. The top rate for people saving through PIEs and other managed funds is currently set at 30%. This will be reduced to 28%. The other tax rates that apply to multi-rate PIEs will be reduced in line with changes to personal income tax rates. Tax rates for investors in multi-rate PIEs will shift automatically from the old rates to the new rates when the changes take effect on 1 October 2010. The rates of retirement scheme contributions tax will be reduced in line with the changes to personal income tax rates. The thin capitalisation rules deny interest deductions to the extent that the debt percentage (essentially, the debt-to-asset ratio) of a person’s New Zealand group exceeds a specified “safe harbour” threshold and is also more than 110 percent of the debt percentage of that person’s worldwide group. The safe harbour applying to foreign-controlled entities will be reduced from 75% to 60%. This will reduce the scope for foreign multinational enterprises to reduce the amount of New Zealand tax they pay by loading debt against their New Zealand operations. Page 11 A number of transitional arrangements will accompany the reduction in the company tax rate. These are based on similar arrangements that accompanied the previous reduction in the company tax rate to 30%. The transitional rules will: • allow companies to continue to pay out imputation credits at the current 30/70 credit-to- dividend ratio until 31 March 2013, provided the credits arose when the company tax rate was 30% or 33%; • allow shareholders – other than those eligible for the new 28% tax rate – to use these additional imputation credits to offset their tax; and • allow companies that pay provisional tax using the uplift method or the GST ratio method to have immediate access to the tax cut. Application dates For investments through multi-rate PIEs, including most KiwiSaver funds, the reduced tax rates – including the new 28% top rate – will apply from 1 October 2010. For companies, and for investments through other managed funds, the reduction in the tax rate to 28% will apply for the 2011–12 and subsequent income years. The changes to the thin capitalisation rules will also apply for the 2011–12 and subsequent income years. Detailed analysis Unless otherwise stated, references in the following paragraphs to sections and schedules relate to the Income Tax Act 2007. Tax rates Under the proposed changes, the reduction in the company tax rate and the changes to the tax rates that apply to investments through PIEs and other managed funds will be achieved through amendments to a number of provisions. Clause 2 of schedule 1, part A will be amended to reduce the company tax rate to 28%. Since the definition of “company” in section YA 1 includes unit trusts, this reduction will also apply to unit trusts. The lower company tax rate will automatically affect the maximum imputation and FDP crediting ratio under section OA 18, which will change from 30/70 to 28/72. A consequential amendment will be made to the formula in section LP 2(2) for calculating tax credits for supplementary dividends. Clauses 5 and 6 of schedule 1, part A will be amended to similarly reduce the tax rate for group investment funds deriving category A income, approved unit trusts to which the Income Tax (Exempt Unit Trusts) Order 1990 applies, widely held group investment funds, and widely held superannuation funds. Clause 8 of schedule 1, part A will be amended to reduce the rate for life insurance policyholder income. Page 12 In schedule 1, part D, table 3, rows 1 and 2 will be amended to reduce the rate of resident withholding tax applicable to interest paid to companies where the payer of the interest has been supplied with the tax file number of the company and has either not received a payment rate election or has received a payment rate election choosing the 28% payment rate. Rows 3 and 4 will be amended in line with the changes to personal income tax rates, reducing the rate of resident withholding tax from 38% to 33% for interest paid to a company when the recipient of the interest has either elected for the top personal rate to apply or has not supplied their tax file number to the payer. Changes to the prescribed rates for multi-rate PIEs will be effected through amendments to schedule 6, table 1. Section HM 58, as amended, will operate to adjust automatically notified investor rates for multi-rate PIEs, unless the investor advises the PIE that a different rate should apply. Section HM 60(6) will be amended so that, if an investor does not notify a multi-rate PIE of their notified investor rate, the rate applied will be 28%. Section HM 60(3) will be replaced by a new subsection (3) so that multi-rate PIEs can calculate tax for the 2010–11 income year using current notified investor rates for each day in the year up to and including 30 September, and the new lower rates for remaining days in the income year. The new lower rates that the multi-rate PIE will apply from 1 October will be the rate that was automatically adjusted on 1 October under the revised section HM 58 or another rate notified by the investor on or after 1 October. Consequential amendments to the PIE multi-rate calculation provisions in section HM 47(4)(a)(i) will be made to support this treatment. Section HM 47(4)(ii) will be amended so that, if the PIE is treated as the sole investor, the rate applied will be 28%. Retirement scheme contributions tax will be reduced by amendments to schedule 6, table 2. Note that section CS 1, which deals with fund withdrawal tax on superannuation funds, will be amended as a consequence of the alignment of the top rate of employer superannuation contribution tax with a taxpayer’s marginal rate. This is discussed further in the special report item that deals with the changes to personal income tax rates. Provisional tax rules for companies and other 28% taxpayers excepting PIEs Provisional tax involves payments being made during an income year, in anticipation of an income tax liability for that year. Section RC 5 sets out various methods of calculating provisional tax. The “standard method” of determining provisional tax liability, under section RC 5(2) and (3), looks to a person’s residual income tax for a previous year, uplifting that amount by a specified percentage – normally either 5% or 10%, depending on the circumstances. In view of the reduction in the company tax rate, section RZ 3 will be amended to reduce temporarily the amount of that uplift for persons subject to the new company tax rate of 28%. Page 13 • Where the 5% uplift method applies, section RZ 3(1)(b) and (2)(b)(ii) modifies section RC 5(2) to eliminate any uplift for the 2011–12 income year. • Where the 10% uplift method applies, section RZ 3(1)(b), (3)(b)(ii) and (c)(ii) modifies section RC 5(3) to reduce the amount of the uplift to 5% for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 income years (in this case, the modification applies for two years, because section RC 5(3) looks to a person’s residual income tax for the tax year before the preceding tax year). Corresponding modifications to section RC 10 will be made by section RZ 5. Some provisional taxpayers can choose to calculate their provisional tax payments using the “GST ratio method” under section RC 8. The GST ratio is normally calculated by dividing residual income tax for the preceding year by taxable supplies in that year, although in certain circumstances amounts from earlier years may be used instead. Section RZ 4 will modify section RC 8, reducing the income tax amounts used for the purposes of calculating the GST ratio to reflect the reduction in the company tax rate. For the 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2013–14 income years, section RZ 4(1)(b) and (2)(d) provides that the relevant income tax amount for a new company tax rate person is to be multiplied by 0.95 as set out in the following table: Tax year Previous year Year before previous year 2 years before previous year 2011–12 .95 .95 .95 2012–13 na .95 .95 2013–14 na na .95 Thin capitalisation rules for foreign-controlled entities For a person falling within their ambit, the thin capitalisation rules deny interest deductions to the extent that the debt percentage of that person’s New Zealand group exceeds the higher of two thresholds specified in section FE 5. One threshold is a “safe harbour”, currently set at 75%. The other threshold is determined as being 110% of the debt percentage of the person’s worldwide group (this threshold does not apply to natural persons). The scope of the thin capitalisation rules was recently extended by the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Previously, the rules only applied to New Zealand taxpayers if they were, or were controlled by, a non-resident (section FE 2(1)(a) to (d)). They now also apply to New Zealand residents with an income interest in a CFC or with control of a resident company with such an interest (section FE 2(1)(e) to (g)). Section FE 5 will be amended to reduce the safe harbour for taxpayers that are, or are controlled by, a non-resident from 75% to 60%. This lower safe-harbour is set by section FE 5(1)(a)(i) and (3)(a). The safe harbour for New Zealand residents with CFC interests remains at 75% (section FE 5(1)(b)(i) and (3)(b)). The 110% threshold is also unchanged (section FE 5(1)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii)). Consequential amendments will be made to section FE 6(3)(e) and section FE 12(2). Page 14 Section FE 18(5) sets the default percentage for the worldwide group of an excess debt entity. Currently, the default percentage is 68.1818, an amount that when multiplied by 110% is equivalent to a 75% safe harbour. This section will be amended so that, for taxpayers subject to the reduced safe harbour, the default percentage will become 54.5454: multiplied by 110%. This matches a 60% safe harbour. The special thin capitalisation rules for banks are not affected by these changes. Company tax: transitional arrangements Imputation and FDP crediting ratios An immediate reduction of the crediting ratio allowed under section OA 18, which caps the ratio of imputation or FDP credits to dividends, has the potential to disadvantage shareholders if the dividends to which it applies represent a distribution of income that was taxed at 30%. Therefore, the legislation will allow this maximum ratio to be overridden for dividends paid during a transitional period, beginning on the first day of the company’s 2011–12 income year and ending on 31 March 2013. During that period, companies will be able to attach imputation and FDP credits to dividends up to a maximum ratio of 30/70, provided the underlying income was taxed at 30% or 33%. This will be achieved by updating sections OZ 7 and OZ 8, which were introduced to deal with the previous company tax rate cut. If a company imputes dividends using a 30/70 ratio after the 2010–11 income year to an extent that exceeds the credit balance in its imputation credit account relating to income taxed at 30%, a 10% transitional imputation penalty tax will apply under section 140C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Penalty tax will only arise under section 140C if there is a debit balance relating to 30/70 credits on 31 March 2013. If penalty tax is also payable under section 140B because of an overdrawn balance at 31 March 2013, it will be reduced by any amount payable under section 140C. Benchmark dividends Under the current rules, sections OB 61 and OC 28 provide that the amount of imputation or FDP credits attached to the first dividend paid by a company in a tax year (the “benchmark dividend”) sets the imputation ratio for that year. The imputation ratio of subsequent dividends paid in the year must be the same as for the benchmark dividend, unless the company makes a ratio change declaration. Section OZ 9 will be updated to modify the benchmark dividend ratios in sections OB 61(4) and OC 28(4). This will allow companies to change their crediting ratio from 30/70 to 28/72 without making a ratio change declaration. When the benchmark dividend was paid before the start of the 2011–12 income year and credited using a 30/70 ratio, section OZ 9 will allow subsequent dividends paid during the transitional period to be credited using a 28/72 ratio. In addition, if the benchmark dividend was credited using a 30/70 ratio under section OZ 8, section OZ 9 will allow a 28/72 ratio to be used for subsequent dividends once credits accrued under the 30% tax rate have run out. Page 15 Shareholders’ tax credits If the amount of imputation credits or FDP credits exceeds the maximum ratio allowed under section OA 18, the tax credit available to the shareholder is normally limited to that maximum. Section OZ 10 will be updated to modify sections LE 8 and LE 9 and sections LF 6 and LF 7, allowing shareholders to benefit from additional credits during the transitional period, when these have been attached to dividends in accordance with section OZ 8. However, if the shareholder is a person, including a multi-rate PIE, eligible for the new 28% rate, section OZ 11 will limit the credit available against their tax liability based on a 28/72 ratio, even if the actual crediting ratio of the dividend was higher than this by virtue of section OZ 8. Since a new company tax rate person will only be subject to 28% tax on the dividend, it would be inappropriate to allow them to benefit from additional credits, which could be used to offset tax on other income. Tax credits for non-residents. The formula in section LP 2(2) for calculating tax credits for supplementary dividends will be amended, reflecting the new 28/72 crediting ratio. Section OZ 12 will be updated to maintain the existing formula for dividends imputed using a 30/70 ratio under the transitional rules. Available subscribed capital The concept of “available subscribed capital” is relevant when a company cancels its shares and pays consideration to compensate a shareholder for that cancellation. For the purposes of determining available subscribed capital, the extent to which a dividend is fully credited may be relevant. The extent to which a dividend is treated as credited is determined using the formula in section CD 43(26). Section OZ 13 will be updated to provide that a ratio of 28/72 should be used for the purposes of this formula even if a dividend has an imputation ratio up to 30/70 during the transitional period. Dividends from qualifying companies A dividend paid by a qualifying company is only taxable in the hands of the shareholder to the extent it is imputed: these dividends are therefore required to be imputed to the maximum extent possible under the imputation rules given the company’s available credits. The formula for calculating the amount of a fully imputed distribution is set out in section HA 15(2). Section OZ 14 will be updated to modify this formula, to treat the tax rate as 30%, rather than 28%, for dividends paid during the transitional period to which section OZ 8 applies. Statutory producer boards and cooperative companies For a statutory producer board, the allocation of credits to cash distributions must be done according to the formula in section OB 73(4), while section OB 75(2) allocates credits to notional distributions. For cooperative companies, the equivalent provisions are sections OB 78(3) and OB 80(2). Section OZ 15 will be updated to allow these entities to use a 30/70 crediting ratio during the transitional period. Page 16 Branch equivalent tax accounts and conduit tax relief accounts Sections OZ 16 and OZ 17 will be updated so that entries in the branch equivalent tax accounts or conduit tax relief accounts of companies or consolidated groups that relate to 2010–11 or earlier income years are adjusted in line with the proposed reduction in the company tax rate. This is because credit balances in these accounts will be used to offset tax liabilities calculated under the proposed new company tax rate. Page 17 GST rate increase This section of the Budget 2010 Special Tax Report provides early information on the proposed increase in the rate of goods and services tax (GST) covered in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill. The rate of goods and services tax (GST) is being increased to 15% from 1 October 2010, as part of a switch in the tax mix from income tax to consumption tax. The GST rate was last increased in 1989. New Zealand relies heavily on income taxes in order to fund expenditure. Income taxes may, however, be harmful for efficiency and growth. Taxes on consumption, such as GST, tend to be less harmful to growth as, unlike income taxes, they do not apply to savings and, therefore, do not discourage this activity. A switch from income tax towards GST can, therefore, boost incentives to save and encourage economic growth. The merits of changing the tax mix were discussed in the report of Victoria University of Wellington’s Tax Working Group A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future released in January this year. Background How will it be calculated? Under the proposed rate change, businesses and organisations registered for GST will be required to account for GST at the new rate of 15% from 1 October 2010. The rate of increase will also apply to goods imported on or after 1 October 2010. The new tax fraction (the tax rate divided by the sum of 100 plus the tax rate) will be 3/23. This fraction can be applied to the price of goods or services to see how much GST is included in the price. For example, if the cost of a fridge is $2,000 inclusive of GST, the GST included in the price will be $260.87: 1 ($2,000 x 3) 23 Altering systems and prices Businesses will need to alter their systems to incorporate the new rate. They may also alter the prices they charge for the goods and services they supply to cover the increased GST liability. This may not only impact on businesses’ current stocks or transactions but also on their forward orders or deferred supplies. 1 The tax fraction under a 12.5% GST is 1/9, calculated as 12.5/112.5. Under that scenario the GST is $2000/9 = $222.22. Page 18 There are already rules within the GST Act to deal with transitional issues arising from a rate change. These rules provide for prices in existing contracts to be increased by the amount of GST in certain circumstances, and fees and other charges set by Act or regulation are automatically increased by the amount of the GST rate increase. The current legislation ensures that government grants and subsidies are not automatically increased when there is a change in the GST rate. Instead the relevant administering public authorities will be considering the implications for grant recipients on a case-by-case basis over the coming months. Filing returns As happened in 1989 when GST was last increased, there will be an effect on businesses’ return filing. In particular, registered persons will continue to file GST returns at their normal times, but if the return period straddles 1 October 2010 the return will need to be split into two parts – the first covering the period up to 30 September and the second covering the remainder of the return period from 1 October. A special return will be provided for this purpose. To simplify the accounting for those who return GST on either a payments or hybrid basis, the new 15% rate will apply to all payments made or received from 1 October. An adjustment based on the registered person’s creditors and debtors as at 30 September 2010 will ensure that supplies provided before 1 October but which have not been paid for by that date will in effect be subject to the old lower rate. A similar adjustment mechanism applied in 1989. If a taxpayer’s GST taxable period spans the GST rate change and the taxpayer is required to make a combined GST and provisional tax payment, the transitional return will provide guidance on how to make the combined payment. Advice will also be provided on how to account for the GST on FBT, entertainment tax and other deemed supplies during the transition. Time of supply rules The GST Act contains rules that determine the point in time when a GST-registered person must recognise a supply of goods and services that give rise to an output tax liability. In most cases this will be when the supplier issues an invoice or receives payment. The rules attempt to approximate when a transaction has been concluded and economic control of the goods and services has passed from the supplier to the recipient. 2 2 Although the time-of-supply rules determine when GST-registered persons are required to recognise a liability for GST, the accounting basis adopted by the registered person can alter the taxable period in which that liability must be disclosed to Inland Revenue. Page 19 In general, the normal time of supply rules will apply over the transition period. For example, goods purchased through layby accounts will attract the higher 15% rate if the final payment is made on or after 1 October 2010. Reliance on the normal time of supply rules may allow businesses to bring forward invoicing so they can take advantage of the old lower GST rate. In excessive cases the general anti- avoidance provision in the GST Act may be applicable if it is clearly evident that businesses are restructuring their business practices to bring forward a material number of transactions. Communication Inland Revenue will be providing explanatory material to taxpayers on the changed requirements and transition arrangements. This includes advising taxpayers who use accounting software to manage their GST obligations about the need to contact their provider for upgrades to support a rate change. Inland Revenue will also be speaking to groups around the country about the tax package. Legislative changes Some minor legislative changes are being made to the transitional provisions to remove interpretative ambiguity, to cover deemed supplies and to simplify the Act’s return filing and record-keeping requirements for returns that straddle the rate-change date. Changes to the penalties rules are also proposed, to provide remission of late payment and late filing penalties and use-of-money interest in certain circumstances. These changes are explained below. Key features • The rate of GST is being increased to 15% from 1 October 2010. All other key aspects of the GST rules are unaffected. The goods and services subject to GST are not being altered. • The transitional rules that applied in 1989 will, with some minor modification, apply to this latest rate change. Application date All changes apply from 1 October 2010. Page 20 Detailed analysis The minor legislative changes to the GST transitional provisions are: Rate references (clauses 45–47) The rate specified in the GST Act is being amended so that businesses and organisations registered for GST are required to account for GST at the new rate of 15% from 1 October 2010. This also applies to goods imported on or after 1 October 2010. Accordingly, the rate references in sections 8(1) and 12(1) are being changed from “12.5” to “15”. The rate reference in section 10(6), which sets the GST rate charged on goods and service provided to individuals in long-term commercial accommodation, such as rest homes, is also being changed, from “7.5” to “9”. Contract prices (clause 51) Some commentators have suggested that there is interpretative uncertainty over whether contract prices expressed as “inclusive of GST” can be increased by the amount of the GST rate increase. Given that many contracts will be expressed on a GST-inclusive basis, this issue should be put beyond doubt by amending the relevant section of the GST Act. The policy intent is clearly that contract prices expressed as GST inclusive should be able to be adjusted. The uncertainty arises from the words in section 78(2) of the GST Act “or where the alteration in the law has been taken into account”. Accordingly, these words are being removed. Deemed supplies (clauses 48–50) The GST Act deems supplies to take place in certain situations, such as when there is a fringe benefit, entertainment expenditure and change of use. Since the last GST rate increase in 1989, a number of changes have been made to these time of supply rules, aimed at reducing compliance costs by enabling taxpayers to file less frequently. An unintentional result is that when the GST rate is increased, some transactions that took place before the rate-change date will be subject to the new higher rate, in effect applying the rate change in advance of 1 October 2010. Additional transitional provisions are proposed to ensure that the old rate applies in these cases, to ensure that registered persons are neither disadvantaged nor advantaged by the rate change. This is not an issue for FBT as under the FBT time of supply rule the supply is treated as taking place at the time the fringe benefit is or is deemed to be provided or granted. This means that the GST on fringe benefits provided before 1 October will be charged at 12.5%. Page 21 Entertainment expenditure There is no similar rule for entertainment expenditure. That part of entertainment expenditure that is precluded from being deducted will be subject to the higher rate of GST as the supply is recognised on the date the registered person furnishes their income tax return for the tax year, irrespective of when within the year the entertainment took place. The proposed solution is that for the 2010–11 tax year, the registered person would have the option of using the normal time of supply rule applicable to the deemed supply or treating the entertainment expenditure incurred before 1 October 2010 as being supplied on 30 September 2010. The expenses incurred over the rest of the tax year would be recognised on the date the registered person furnishes their income tax return for the 2010–11 tax year. Change-of-use adjustments Supplies are also deemed to occur when there is a change of use. Goods and services intended originally for business purposes may be used for making non-taxable supplies (that is, for exempt or private purposes). In this case output tax is payable. Conversely, goods and services intended originally for exempt or private purposes may be used in the registered person’s business. In this case there is a deduction from output tax (calculated as the tax fraction applied to the lower of the market value or cost price of the good or service). Some registered persons will be making the respective output tax or deduction from output tax in a period other than the taxable period in which there is a change of use. For example, many registered persons make the tax adjustment after the end of the tax year as part of finalising their annual accounts – the adjustments for 2010 would therefore be made in mid- 2011. In this situation, the higher GST rate may apply even when the change of use took place before 1 October 2010. 3 To ensure the old rate applies in such instances, the legislation will, with regard to a deduction from output tax, require a registered person to identify items that changed to a business use before 1 October 2010 and to apply a rate of 12.5% to them even if the deduction is made on or after 1 October. The legislative change will make it clear that the tax fraction mentioned in section 21F(1) is, in such cases, the tax fraction at the time the goods were acquired or imported by the registered person. Similarly, when output tax is required to be paid as a result of the change of use, the legislation will explicitly provide the registered person with the additional option of identifying items that changed to a private use before 1 October 2010 and applying a rate of 12.5% to them, even if the output tax is attributed on or after 1 October 2010. Return filing (clauses 51 and 53) Some minor legislative changes are being made to simplify the Act’s return filing and record- keeping requirements for returns that straddle the rate change date. 3 This means, for example, that when a deduction in output tax is required, the deduction from output tax would be at the rate of 15% even though output tax would have been originally paid at 12.5% when the good or service was purchased. Page 22 Under the current rules, when there is a rate change the transitional mechanism in section 78B avoids the need for special time-of-supply rules for registered persons returning GST on a payments or hybrid basis. The adjustment also affects persons on an invoice basis who have purchased second-hand goods for their business which meet the “qualifying supplies” definition. All the amounts that they pay or receive are accounted for at the new rate but with an adjustment to recognise the fact that the time of supply for some of the transactions would have been before the rate change date. Basically, the adjustment mechanism takes the difference between a registered person’s debtors and creditors immediately before the rate change and multiplies it by the difference between the old and new tax fractions. If the result is a positive amount (that is, creditors on hand exceed debtors on hand) it is treated as output tax in the return period. If it is negative (that is, debtors exceed creditors), the amount must be set off against GST liabilities in the preceding return period, with any balance being carried forward for use in the current return period, and so on. Any excess cannot be offset against the registered person’s other tax liabilities, or refunded. The adjustments are recorded on a special adjustment form which must be furnished to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The proposed legislative changes are: • The requirement (in section 78B(2)(b)) that the registered person furnish the form on which they do their adjustment calculation to the Commissioner, is being removed. Instead, registered persons will only need to retain the form as part of their records, and include the adjustment with any other GST adjustments relevant to that return period. As a consequence of the removal of section 78B(2)(b), section 78B(4) which cross- referred to section 78B(2)(b), is being amended to include the references that were in section 78B(2)(b)(i) and (ii). • Any excess credits will be able to be offset against the registered person’s other tax liabilities, or even refunded. Application of penalties and use-of-money interest (clauses 55 and 56) The proposed new section 183AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the automatic remission of late payment and late filing penalties and use-of-money interest in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are: • that the lateness in filing or paying is reasonably attributable to the change in the GST rate (for example, the required systems changes to accommodate the new rate have not been able to be made in time); and • the registered person has made reasonable efforts to comply and, therefore, shortfall penalties such as lack of reasonable care, would not be applicable. Page 23 If a shortfall penalty was imposed, then the registered person would not be eligible for the remission of late payment/late filing penalties and use-of-money interest under the proposed new remission provision. The remission would be for a limited time, focussing on the transitional return period(s). Subject to the passing of the Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill, Inland Revenue is intending to issue a statement shortly after Budget day expanding on this point. Further legislative changes to section 139B of the Tax Administration Act ensure that the remitted penalties do not affect the late payment penalty grace period. That grace period allows a taxpayer to make an occasional error without the late payment penalty being imposed. Page 24 Depreciation & capital contributions This section of the Budget 2010 Special Tax Report describes the proposed changes to the depreciation rules that, if enacted, will take effect between 21 May 2010 and the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. The Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill 2010, introduced on 20 May 2010, gives effect to these announcements. The bill changes the depreciation rate of buildings with long estimated useful lives to 0%, and removes depreciation loading on items purchased after 20 May 2010. Additionally, the bill changes the treatment of capital contributions, so that recipients of these payments will have to choose either to treat the contribution as income spread over 10 years, or alternatively, reduce the tax book value of the subsidised assets. Finally, the bill introduces provisions to grandparent the treatment of buildings affected by the release by Inland Revenue of Interpretation Statement 10/02. Background The proposed changes are intended to make New Zealand’s tax rules more neutral and non- distortionary. Allowing depreciation on long-lived buildings and the application of depreciation loading on certain assets provides tax depreciation rates in excess of true economic depreciation rates. When this occurs, the tax rules can make an investment profitable when this would not be so in the absence of taxes. The bill also changes the tax treatment of capital contributions. These contributions are generally not taxed even though businesses may be able to deduct, by way of depreciation, the full cost of any assets that the contributions have been used to pay for. This, in effect, is a tax subsidy. Building depreciation Currently, buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years can be depreciated for tax purposes. However, analysis of New Zealand building price data between 1993 and 2009 shows that, on average, buildings have actually been increasing in value. This suggests that the current depreciation rate of 2% is not appropriate. To address this concern, the bill sets a 0% depreciation rate for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This new rate will apply to all such buildings regardless of when they were purchased. Grandparenting existing treatment of some buildings Inland Revenue’s Public Rulings unit has recently released the interpretation statement Meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions (IS 10/02). Under this statement, some items that were previously treated as structures will come within the meaning of “building”. This means there will be a change to the way these investments are treated for tax depreciation purposes. Page 25 On 30 July 2009, following the release of a draft of this interpretation statement, the Minister of Revenue issued a statement providing that the existing treatment of any affected structure acquired on or before the day of the announcement would be grandparented. To facilitate this grandparenting, the bill specifies that a “building” does not include these affected structures. Depreciation loading Under the current rules, depreciation loading increases the depreciation rate by 20% for qualifying items. This concession has been available for items purchased during or after the 1995–96 income year. Depreciation loading was introduced as an incentive to encourage New Zealand businesses to invest in new capital equipment. However, this concession is inconsistent with a broad-based, low rate tax system, and the bill therefore seeks its removal from items purchased after 20 May 2010. Capital contributions A capital contribution is a subsidy or similar payment to a person that compensates them for some capital expenditure. A common example is a payment from a farmer to an electricity lines company towards the cost of connecting their farmhouse to the company’s network. Currently, capital contributions are not taxable in the hands of the recipient as they are capital in nature. Additionally, the recipient may be able to deduct, by way of depreciation, the cost of the assets acquired with the capital contribution. In other words, the recipient can claim deductions for expenditure they have not borne the financial cost of. The bill changes the tax treatment of capital contributions so that people who receive capital contributions will, in their tax return in the year the contribution is received, be required to elect either to treat the contribution as income, spread over 10 years, or alternatively reduce the tax value of the assets the contribution has been used to pay for. These new rules apply to capital contributions derived after 20 May 2010. Key features 0% depreciation rate for certain buildings • Under the changes in the bill, the annual depreciation rate for buildings will be set to 0% if they have estimated useful lives of 50 years or more, as determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. • The annual depreciation rate will also be set to 0% for certain buildings that are excluded depreciable property and that are similar to the types of buildings with estimated useful lives of 50 years, as these do not have estimated useful lives. • This new rate will apply regardless of when a building was acquired. Page 26 • Building owners that have previously claimed a depreciation deduction on their buildings will still be required to pay depreciation recovery if they sell a building for more than its tax book value. • To ensure that the policy works as intended, special depreciation rates will no longer be allowed for buildings and the definition of “temporary building” will also be amended. Grandparenting existing treatment of some buildings • Certain buildings that have been treated as structures and were purchased on or before 30 July 2009, will continue to be treated as structures for tax depreciation purposes. • Any improvements to these buildings made after 30 July 2009 will not receive grandparented treatment. No depreciation loading for assets acquired after 20 May 2010 • The bill removes depreciation loading for assets purchased after 20 May 2010. • Depreciation loading will continue to apply to qualifying assets purchased on or before 20 May 2010. • Any improvements to assets that continue to receive loading made after 20 May 2010 will have to be treated as a separate asset and will not qualify for loading. New treatment of capital contributions • The bill requires businesses who receive a capital contribution to choose how to treat the receipt for income tax purposes – either as income or as a reduction in their depreciation base. Different treatments can be elected for each capital contribution; however, once an election is made it may not be changed. • If a business decides to treat a contribution as income, then it would return 1/10th of the contribution as taxable income every year for 10 years. • If a business decides to reduce its depreciation base, it would reduce the tax book value of the relevant assets to the extent that they have been funded through the capital contribution. • This proposed change only affects new capital contribution arrangements. It would not affect contributions derived on or before 20 May 2010. Application date The new rules for building depreciation will generally apply from the beginning of the 2011– 12 income year. For most people this is 1 April 2011, but if you have had a different income year approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, these would apply from that date. For taxpayers with an early balance date, this may be as soon as 2 October 2010. Page 27 Taxpayers will no longer be able to apply for special depreciation rates for buildings from 20 May 2010. The new rules for depreciation loading will apply to all items for which a binding contract for acquisition or construction was entered into after 20 May 2010. The new rules for capital contributions will apply to all contributions derived after 20 May 2010. The rules providing the grandparenting of buildings affected by IS 10/02 will apply retrospectively from 30 July 2009. Detailed analysis The depreciation provisions are largely contained in subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed rules for the new treatment of capital contributions are set out in new sections CG 8 and DB 64 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Unless otherwise stated, all section references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. 0% depreciation rate for long-lived buildings Annual rate for buildings with long estimated useful lives (clauses 77, 81, 85 and 86) The bill amends sections EE 31 and EZ 13 to provide that buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more will have an annual depreciation rate of 0% for tax purposes. This 0% rate is a statutory rate and overrides the rates set by determination. The changes to section EE 31 apply to buildings acquired during or after the 1995–96 income year, while the changes to section EZ 13 apply to buildings acquired after 1 April 1993 but before the end of the 1994–95 income year. These buildings will still be depreciable property, but with a 0% annual depreciation rate. This means that the other depreciation provisions, such as those providing for depreciation recovery still apply. While the depreciation rate for these buildings will be set to 0%, the depreciation rate for items used in, but not part of, these buildings remains unchanged, and they will be able to continue to be depreciated separately from the building itself. For residential rental properties, the interpretation statement Residential rental properties – depreciation of depreciable assets (IS 10/01) sets out how to determine whether an item is part of a building or separately depreciable. For non-residential properties, the Government has indicated it will be reviewing which items can be depreciated separately from a building. If necessary, the tax rules will be amended before 1 April 2011 to clarify the law. Page 28 Repairs and maintenance The proposed changes will not affect the deductibility of repairs and maintenance. While this can be a complicated matter, with the correct treatment often being a question of both fact and degree, some general guidance is set out below. There is a two-stage approach to determine whether certain expenditure is deductible: 1. Identify the relevant asset – that is, is the item being repaired/replaced part of a larger asset (such as the roof of a house), or is it a single asset (for example, a television). 2. Ascertain the nature, extent and cost of the work undertaken. This will involve determining whether the work remedied wear and tear (generally deductible), or whether the asset has been improved or otherwise substantially changed (generally non- deductible). In relation to step 2, some relevant factors are: • If the expenditure does no more than restore an asset to its condition on purchase, it is likely to be deductible. This can hold even if the work is carried out over several years. • This applies even if what is being replaced or repaired is improved – for example, because of new technology or better design, provided the work does not alter a substantial part of the asset. • Expenditure on the renewal, replacement or reconstruction of a substantial portion of the asset goes beyond repair, and is generally not deductible repairs and maintenance. • Work that results in a significant increase in an asset’s value, or is unusually expensive, is more likely to be considered capital in nature. As discussed above, a building can have many different parts. Repairing or replacing something that forms part of a building, provided it does not substantially improve or alter value or function of the building, is likely to be deductible. If, on the other hand, a substantial amount of work is involved, or the building is improved in some way, it is likely that this will be non-deductible capital expenditure. For example, the replacement of a toilet that has fallen into disrepair in a residential house (which is part of the building as per IS 10/01) is likely to be deductible as repairs and maintenance. On the other hand, if the entire bathroom were to be re-designed and completely re-fitted, this is more likely to be a non-deductible capital improvement. Definition of “building” The bill only affects the depreciation rate of buildings – there is no proposed change to the depreciation rates for structures. What a “building” is, for the purposes of the depreciation provisions, therefore becomes important. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view on this is set out in the recently released interpretation statement Meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions (IS 10/02). Page 29 In essence, a building is a structure that has walls and a roof, is of considerable size, is meant to last a considerable period of time and is generally fixed to the land where it stands. For example, a house has the above features and so would be considered a building; however, a dam does not (it lacks walls and a roof), so would not be considered a building. For more guidance on this issue, the interpretation statement IS 10/02 is available on Inland Revenue’s website, www.ird.govt.nz. Interpretation of estimated useful life An item’s estimated useful life is the estimated useful life for that type of item, as set out in a determination issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Additionally, when interpreting an item’s estimated useful life, the “whole of life” approach should be taken. For example, if a person purchases a second-hand item with an estimated useful life of 50 years, its estimated useful life will still be 50 years, regardless of how old the item actually is. No special rate for buildings (clause 78) The bill amends section EE 35(2) so that special depreciation rates would not be able to be set for buildings, regardless of their estimated useful lives. Special depreciation rates are granted in situations where a specific item’s economic depreciation rate is either faster or slower than the rate set by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This change would have effect from 20 May 2010. The bill removes this ability to apply for special rates for buildings as allowing these would be inconsistent with the general view that buildings, do not on average, decline in value. However, provisional depreciation rates will still be able to be set for classes of buildings. If the Commissioner of Inland Revenue issues a provisional rate for a class of building stating that it has an estimated useful life of less than 50 years, owners of affected buildings will be able to claim depreciation deductions. Provisional depreciation rates are granted when there is no applicable rate for the type of item you own, excluding the default class. To have a provisional rate granted, you must satisfy the Commissioner that the building you own does not come within an existing asset category. Applications for provisional rates can be made using the form IR 260A, available from Inland Revenue’s website at www.ird.govt.nz . Special excluded depreciable property (clauses 82, 83, 96 and 99) Section EE 67 will be amended to provide a definition for “special excluded depreciable property”. Special excluded depreciable property will be all buildings not listed in the proposed new schedule 39. In practice, special excluded depreciable property will be buildings that were excluded depreciable property, and are similar to the current categories of building that have estimated useful lives of 50 years or more. Page 30 The asset classes listed in this schedule are from the depreciation rates issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before 1 April 1993. In some cases, the names of these classes differ from those currently used in the depreciation determinations. This definition of “special excluded depreciable property” is necessary because items of excluded depreciable property do not have estimated useful lives. It is therefore not possible to refer to these buildings using estimated useful lives. 0% annual depreciation rate for special excluded depreciable property (clause 81) Section EE 61 is being amended with new subsection 7B, which will provide that the annual depreciation rate for items of special excluded depreciable property that are excluded depreciable property is 0%. This statutory rate will override any depreciation rate issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Buildings that are excluded depreciable property but not special excluded depreciable property would continue to be depreciated using the appropriate depreciation rates. Change to the meaning of “temporary building” (clause 96) Paragraph (a) in the definition of “temporary building” in section YA 1 will be repealed. This paragraph provides that a “temporary building” includes buildings issued under a permit by a local or public authority that stipulates that the building be removed or demolished at their request. This will ensure the proposed changes work as intended, as otherwise building owners could claim that their building was a temporary building using this section of the definition. Example 1: Building depreciation – proposed treatment Jack owns two buildings that he is currently allowed to claim depreciation deductions for. One building is a residential rental house and the other is a glasshouse. For the 2010–11 income year, the applicable depreciation rates are 2% straight-line for the rental house and 5% straight-line for the glasshouse. This means Jack can claim depreciation deductions of 2% and 5% of the respective building’s cost. Depreciation determination DEP1 provides that the rental house currently has a useful life of 50 years and that the glasshouse has a useful life of 20 years. Therefore, for the 2011–12 income year, the applicable depreciation rates are 0% for the rental house and 5% straight-line for the glasshouse. This means Jack cannot claim depreciation deductions for his rental house, but can continue to claim them for the glasshouse at a rate of 5%. Page 31 Grandparenting existing treatment of some buildings Certain structures purchased on or before 30 July 2009 not buildings (clause 96) Amendments to section YA 1 will add a definition for buildings, which specifies that, in the depreciation provisions, “building” does not include a grandparented structure. This definition of “building” excludes “grandparented structures” from the common law meaning of “building”. This proposed definition is not intended to detract from the Commissioner’s interpretation statement IS 10/02 Meaning of Building. Instead, the definition is intended to grandparent investments, made before 30 July 2009, in certain types of structures from the depreciation rules applying to buildings. This means these buildings will continue to be treated as structures for the purposes of the depreciation provisions (notwithstanding that they are buildings under the Commissioner’s interpretation statement IS 10/02). For example, their relevant depreciation rates will still be set using the double-declining balance method, and losses incurred on disposal will remain tax deductible. The proposed definition of “grandparented structure” is an item on the following list, provided its owner acquired it, or entered into a binding contract for its acquisition or construction, on or before 30 July 2009: (a) barns, including barns (drying) (b) carparks (buildings) (c) chemical works (d) fertiliser works (e) powder drying buildings (f) site huts. More detail on the types of items covered by the definition of “grandparented structure” can be found in IS 10/02, available on Inland Revenue’s website. For example, carparks (buildings) does not include a commercial building that contains carparks. Some carparking buildings continue to depreciate The proposed grandparenting of carparking buildings, described above, will mean that carparking buildings purchased on or before 30 July 2009 will not be subject to a 0% annual depreciation rate. Improvements to grandparented structures building (clause 79) Changes to section EE 37 provide that if a person owns a grandparented structure, and they make the improvements, or enter into a binding contract to make them, after 30 July 2009, then the improvement must be treated as a separate item. This effect of this proposed amendment is that any new improvements to grandparented structures will be treated as buildings. This will mean, for example, losses on disposal on the improvements will not be available. In the case of carparking buildings, this will mean the annual depreciation rate of any improvements will be 0%. Page 32 Removal of depreciation loading No depreciation loading for items purchased after 20 May 2010 (clauses 77 and 81) The bill amends EE 31 with new subsection (3). This subsection will apply when a binding contract for an asset’s acquisition or construction is entered into after 20 May 2010, and provide that an asset’s annual depreciation rate is just its applicable economic, special or provisional rate, unless the item is a long-lived building or international aircraft. This contrasts with existing subsection (2), which applies to assets for which a binding contract for acquisition existed on or before 20 May 2010. Under this section, many assets have an annual rate of their applicable economic, special or provisional depreciation rates multiplied by 1.2. This acceleration of depreciation rates is often referred to as depreciation loading. Treatment of improvements (clause 79) Amendments to section EE 37 apply if a person owns an asset that will continue to receive loading after 20 May 2010. It provides that if they make improvements to it, or enter into a binding contract to make improvements to it, then they must treat the improvements as separate items. Therefore, the annual depreciation rate for these improvements would be set by the proposed subsection EE 31(3) (Rate for item acquired after 20 May 2010). The effect of this is that any improvements made to existing assets will not be eligible for depreciation loading. Such improvements will depreciate for tax purposes at the appropriate rate as set by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Example 2: Depreciation loading – proposed treatment On 1 April 2010, A Co Ltd. purchased $10,000 worth of laptop computers. Laptop computers have a 40% straight-line depreciation rate, but as they are eligible for loading, A Co Ltd. is able to claim depreciation deductions of 48% of their value, or $4,800 each year. On 1 April 2011, A Co Ltd. purchased another order of $10,000 worth of laptop computers. However, as they have been purchased after 20 May 2010, A Co Ltd. is only able to claim depreciation deductions of 40% of their value, or $4,000 each year. This means, for the 2011–12 income year, A Co Ltd. can deduct $4,800 for depreciation of the earlier laptops and $4,000 for the later laptops. New treatment of capital contributions Capital contributions either income or non-deductible (clauses 75, 76 and 96) New sections CG 8 and DB 64 set out a new tax treatment for capital contributions. Page 33 The bill amends the definition of “capital contribution” in section YA 1. Outside of section HG 11, a capital contribution would mean an amount that: (i) is paid to a person (the payer) to a person (the recipient) under an agreement between them that is not a contract of insurance; (ii) is paid by the payer other than in their capacity of settler, partner or shareholder of the recipient; (iii) is not income of the recipient, ignoring section CG 8; (iv) is paid, under the express terms and conditions of the agreement, as a contribution for depreciable property owned or to be acquired by the recipient. Part (i) of this definition ensures that insurance pay-outs to cover the replacement of damaged assets do not fall within this definition, as they are not capital contributions. Part (ii) ensures that payments by settlers, partners or shareholders who are introducing capital into their own businesses in their capacity as owners are not included. The proposed new section CG 8 provides that a capital contribution that a person receives is treated as income in the income year it is received and the nine following income years. The formula for calculating the amount that is income in each income year is set out in section CG 8(2). This is simply the amount of the contribution divided by 10. Section CG 8 provides the default treatment. However, if a person elects, they could instead use the treatment in section DB 64. This election is provided because it was recognised that some businesses would have difficultly implementing section DB 64. Section DB 64, applies when a person derives a capital contribution and would be allowed an amount of depreciation loss for the acquired assets. Subsection (2) provides that the amount of the capital contribution would be excluded from the item’s adjusted tax value, base value, cost, or value, as applicable, for the purposes of part EE (Depreciation). Essentially, this means the recipient would not be able to claim depreciation deductions to the extent that any acquired assets have been paid for by capital contributions. Any election must be made in the recipient’s tax return for the income year in which the relevant capital contribution is derived. Each new capital contribution would require a new election, and the recipient can elect to treat different contributions differently. Once an election has been made in respect of a contribution, it would be unchangeable. Effect on disposal (clause 80) The bill amends section EE 48 so that, if a person has elected to apply proposed section DB 64, then the amount of the capital contribution is added to the calculation of subsection (1)(b) for the purposes of calculating depreciation recovery income. Page 34 Example 3: Capital contributions Under the old rules Ben’s Electricity Company is an electricity lines company. On 1 June 2009, a farmer requested that his farmhouse be connected to Ben’s Electricity network. As the work, costing $10,000, would otherwise be uneconomic, Ben’s Electricity required a $6,000 capital contribution from the farmer. Ben’s Electricity Company can claim depreciation deductions on the full $10,000 cost of the connection to the farmhouse. Also, Ben’s Electricity Company successfully argues that the capital contribution payment is a capital receipt and, therefore, is not taxable. Under the proposed new rules On 1 June 2010, a different farmer requested for his farmhouse to be connected to Ben’s Electricity network. The work, again costing $10,000, would have otherwise been uneconomic, so Ben’s Electricity again required a $6,000 capital contribution from the farmer. Election to treat as income If Ben’s Electricity Company elects to treat the capital contribution as income, it will return 1/10th of the $6,000 capital contribution as taxable income for the next 10 years. In other words, it will return $600 extra income in its 2010–11 income year, and continue to do this until its 2019–20 income year. Election to reduce depreciation base If Ben’s Electricity Company elects to reduce its depreciation base, it will be unable to claim depreciation on the cabling and other assets that make up the new connection to the extent that they were funded by the capital contribution. In other words, it can only claim depreciation deductions on the $4,000 cost for which it bore the financial burden. Page 35 Working for Families: removing the automatic indexation of the income threshold and excluding investment losses As a part of the Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill 2010, the indexation of the income threshold for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits will be removed. This means that the income threshold at which WFF begins to abate will be set at the current threshold of $36,827 and this threshold will no longer be automatically indexed to inflation. However, the amounts of Family Tax Credit will continue to be automatically indexed to inflation. The removal of automatic indexation of the income threshold is intended to more effectively target WFF tax credits to those on lower incomes. This threshold can be increased by Order in Council if the Government wishes. In addition, as a first step to improve the integrity of social assistance, the Taxation (Budget Measures) Bill 2010 will exclude investment losses, such as losses from rental properties, from the calculation of income for WFF tax credit purposes. This measure is intended to prevent higher income people gaining access to assistance they would not normally be entitled to. This special report item outlines the amendments that affect the calculation of WFF tax credit entitlements. Background Removal of automatic indexation of the income threshold for WFF tax credits At present, the amount of the Family Tax Credit (the main WFF tax credit) and the income threshold are both automatically indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The adjustment occurs once the cumulative increase in the CPI reaches 5% from the last adjustment (which was in October 2008). Although the Treasury forecasts at Budget Economic Fiscal Update (BEFU) 2010 indicated that the next adjustment will take place in time for increases to be paid from 1 April 2012, there is also a possibility that the 5% CPI accumulation may trigger an increase in payments from 1 April 2011. While indexation of the Family Tax Credit maintains the real level of the tax credit for those on incomes below the current $36,827 threshold, it results in a double benefit for those on incomes above the threshold. For this group, indexation of the amount of the Family Tax Credit serves to increase the amount they receive, while indexation of the income threshold increases the amount a family can earn before it begins to abate. It extends eligibility to Family Tax Credit to people on even higher incomes. In contrast, removing the indexation of the abatement threshold will not impact on families with nominal incomes below the current $36,827 threshold. Over time, the effect of inflation would mean that WFF tax credits would increasingly be targeted to lower income families. Page 36 Exclusion of investment losses from the calculation of WFF tax credits The Victoria University Tax Working Group report of January raised concerns about the integrity of the social assistance programmes, in particular, arrangements that have the effect of increasing social assistance entitlements such as WFF tax credits. As a first step to address the integrity concerns in this area, the Government proposes to exclude investment losses for the purposes of determining entitlements to WFF tax credits. Investment losses include losses from rental properties and trading in shares on revenue account. Currently, such investment losses can be used to reduce a person’s income and therefore increase their WFF tax credit entitlements. Furthermore, excluding investment losses will make the treatment of losses for calculating WFF tax credit entitlements more consistent. Currently, other losses such as business losses and carried-forward losses are not taken into account for calculating WFF tax credit entitlements. The Government will undertake a wider review of the rules determining entitlements for social assistance, especially arrangements that have the effect of increasing entitlements beyond what people’s true economic circumstances justify. An example is income from trusts. This review will cover WFF tax credits, student allowances and community services cards. An officials’ issues paper will be released later this year seeking public feedback on proposed legislative solutions that will make arrangements that undermine the intent of social assistance ineffective. The goal is for legislation to be enacted later this year, with application on 1 April 2011. Key features Removal of automatic indexation of the income threshold for WFF tax credits (section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007) The income threshold at which WFF tax credits begin to abate will be set at the current threshold of $36,827. Section MF 7(1) will be amended so that this threshold will no longer be automatically indexed to inflation. However, the current WFF income threshold could be replaced by Order in Council if the Government wishes. The amounts of Family Tax Credit will continue to be automatically indexed to inflation. Exclusion of investment losses from the calculation of WFF tax credits (section MB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007) Section MB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to exclude investment losses from the calculation of family scheme income for WFF tax credit purposes. This means that if a person has an investment in an income year, such as a rental property, and that investment produces a net loss, the income and deductions from that investment will be ignored for calculating income for WFF tax credit purposes. Page 37 Application dates The amendment to remove the automatic indexation of the income threshold for WFF tax credits will take effect on 20 May 2010. The amendment to exclude investment losses for the purpose of calculating WFF tax credit entitlements will take effect on 1 April 2011.
\- 1 - 23 December 2010 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Changes to the GST rules This special report provides early information about the main changes to the GST rules relating to land transactions that were included in the recently enacted Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. The report precedes full coverage of the new legislation that will appear in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published early next year. Zero-rating land transactions Background In November 2009, the Government released the discussion document, GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets, which proposed a number of changes to the GST Act that would address certain GST base risks and improve the operation of the GST system more generally. The main risk to the tax base identified in the discussion document was “phoenix” fraud schemes, typically between associated entities, that involve Inland Revenue refunding GST to one party with no corresponding payment being made by the vendor because the vendor deliberately winds up their business before making payment. The discussion document recommended a domestic reverse charge. However, most submitters expressed a preference for zero-rating as it would give rise to fewer compliance costs. That is the option that has now been adopted since, under this mechanism, the accounting obligations of the parties would in most situations remain virtually unchanged from the previous legislation. Key features GST-registered vendors will be required to charge GST at the rate of 0% on any supply to a registered person involving land, or in which land is a component, if at the time of settlement: • the recipient intends to use the goods for making taxable supplies; and • the supply is not a supply of land intended to be used as the principal place of residence of the recipient or a relative of the recipient. Other features of the new rules include: • a definition of “land” which largely follows the definition used for income tax purposes but which excludes most commercial leases; - 2 - • an obligation for the purchaser to advise of their registration status and intentions in respect of the land; and • special rules to deal with situations when a supply is either incorrectly zero-rated or incorrectly standard-rated. Application date The new rules will apply to goods supplied on or after 1 April 2011. For transactions entered into before 1 April 2011 but for which the time of supply is on or after that date, the supplier has the option of treating the transaction as being governed by either the current GST rules or the new rules (section 11(1)(8C)). Detailed analysis Determining zero-rating New section 11(1)(mb) provides that a GST-registered person must zero-rate a supply if the supply wholly or partly consists of land, and: • is made to another registered person; and • the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and • the supply is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c) (that is, their relative). To be a zero-rated supply, the above conditions for zero-rating must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction (new section 11(8B)). If any of these conditions are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply should be taxed at 15%. If land is supplied as part of a larger supply, the whole supply is zero-rated. For example, if land is supplied as part of a business being sold as a going concern, under the new rules the supply of the going concern is zero-rated in its entirety. To ensure that the zero-rating rules apply to services supplied as part of a transaction that includes land, new section 5(24) treats these services as a supply of goods. The requirement that the recipient must intend to use the goods for making taxable supplies may be satisfied even if the recipient does not intend to use the goods wholly for making taxable supplies. Thus, the supply may be zero-rated in its entirety even if the recipient intends to use the goods partly for making non-taxable supplies. It should be noted, however, that in these circumstances the purchaser will be liable to account for the output tax on the non-taxable use of the goods under new section 20(3I) (see the section of this special report on the new apportionment rules for more details). - 3 - The zero-rating rules do not apply to supplies of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a relative of the recipient (section 11(1)(mb)(ii). If a “principal place of residence” is included in a larger supply of real property, amended section 5(15) requires the supplier to treat the supply of the residence as a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. These provisions clarify that a supply of the principal place of residence is not subject to the zero-rating rules. This should prevent registered persons, such as sole traders, from using their GST-registered status to zero-rate the purchase of their family home. Meaning of “land” A supply will only be zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb) if it is a supply of land. A new definition of “land” in section 2(1) of the GST Act includes an estate or interest in land, a right that gives rise to an interest in land and an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land. “Land” includes the ground within the territory of New Zealand, whether below or above the water, and things of a permanent nature situated on the ground, such as buildings or any other structures that become a fixture and thus part of the land. “Land” does not simply mean the physical ground, but the nature of the right involved in the ownership of land. In common law, all land is held by the Crown and rights in respect of land held by subjects are derived directly or indirectly from the Crown. The bundle of rights held by subjects in respect of land is described as “an estate in land”. The largest estate possible is an estate in fee simple but any number of smaller estates may exist at the same time as an estate in fee simple, and each of those estates may be sold or otherwise dealt with. Estates may be freehold or less than freehold, for example leasehold. For the purposes of the new rules, leases are excluded from the definition provided that they are leases of dwellings or they are commercial leases for which: • the supply is made periodically; and • 25% or less of the total consideration specified in the agreement, in addition to any regular payments is paid or payable under the agreement in advance of or contemporaneously with the supply being made. The exclusion will ensure that commercial leases that do not require high one-off payments and which are unlikely to be used for phoenix fraud purposes are not caught by the new rules. The definition also expressly excludes mortgages. Although a person who has an estate will often have a right of immediate possession of the land, it is not a necessary component of having an estate in land. For example, an estate may exist if it gives a person a right of possession at some future time or is contingent on an event that may or may not take place. An “interest” in land includes both legal and equitable estates. By including equitable estates in land, the definition includes interests in land that are recognised and enforceable under the rules of equity – for example, equitable easements or restrictions on the use of land. - 4 - One of the rights that may be granted by a person with a legal interest in land is a “profit a prendre” – that is, a right to enter another person’s land and take some profit from the soil. Common examples of profit a prendre are the right to mine for minerals or a right to harvest timber. “Land” also includes a right or an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land. Lastly, the new definition includes a share in the share capital of a flat-owning or office- owning company, as defined in section 121A of the Land Transfer Act 1952. This aims to prevent such structures being used for fraudulent purposes. Disclosure requirements A supply that wholly or partly consists of land is a zero-rated supply if, at the date of settlement, the recipient is a registered person, acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies, and the supply is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient or their relative. New section 78F seeks to assist the supplier in identifying this information in order to apply the correct GST treatment. Thus, if a supply wholly or partly consists of land, section 78F(2) requires the purchaser to provide, at or before settlement, a written statement to the supplier whether at the date of settlement: • they are, or expect to be, a registered person; and • they are acquiring the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and • they do not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for them or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c) (their relative). This information must be provided to the supplier in writing. It is expected that the requirements of this section will be incorporated into standard sale and purchase agreements. In that case, the written statement could simply be by way of ticking (or not) the relevant criteria. Since the tests in section 11(1)(mb) must be satisfied on settlement for the zero-rating rules to apply, the information provided by the purchaser may be provided on a prospective basis – that is, on the basis of the best prediction of the recipient’s circumstances at the time of settlement. For example, if a purchaser is not registered for GST but intends to register before settlement, they may indicate on their statement that they expect to be registered for GST. Furthermore, if the purchaser who contracts with the supplier does not intend to receive the land themselves but nominates or intends to nominate a third party to receive the supply, the purchaser may make representations on behalf of the nominated person (section 78F(5)). If a supply of land is made by a lender to whom section 5(2) applies, the purchaser must provide the information required by section 78F to the lender rather than the borrower – for example, the mortgagee under a mortgagee sale. - 5 - Supplier’s obligations Having received a written statement from a purchaser, the supplier may rely on the statement to either standard-rate or zero-rate the supply (section 78F(3)). If the statement indicates that the conditions in section 11(1)(mb) are or will be met, the supplier may zero-rate the supply. If the statement indicates otherwise the supplier may standard-rate the supply.. In some circumstances, the vendor may believe that the information provided by the purchaser is not accurate. In these situations, the legislation provides flexibility for the vendor to adopt the GST treatment that they consider to be correct. For example, if, in contrast to the purchaser’s claims the vendor is aware that the purchaser will use the property in question as their principal place of residence, they may but are not obliged to choose to standard-rate the supply. In a commercial transaction it is reasonable to assume that the vendor is unlikely to unilaterally adopt a GST treatment different from the one indicated by the purchaser’s representation without first consulting the purchaser. Once a written statement is provided, the supplier is not required to make any further enquiries regarding the purchaser’s circumstances. If the purchaser either refuses or for any other reason has not provided a written statement regarding their GST registration status and intentions in respect of land, the supplier should standard-rate the transaction. Record-keeping requirements If a supply is zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb), new section 75(3B) requires the supplier to maintain sufficient records to enable the following particulars in relation to the supply to be ascertained: • the name and address of the recipient; and • the registration number of the recipient; and • a description of the land; and • the consideration for the supply. Consequences of incorrect GST treatment In some situations, the GST treatment of the transaction elected by the supplier may be found to be incorrect. The consequences of this will depend on whether the mistake is discovered before or after settlement. Correction of GST treatment before settlement For a supply to be zero-rated, the conditions for zero-rating in section 11(1)(mb) must be satisfied at the time of settlement. Since the time of supply may occur before a transaction is settled, the supplier will need to determine whether the supply should be standard-rated or zero-rated at that earlier time. As discussed earlier, this determination will usually be made on the basis of the written statement provided by the purchaser. - 6 - Before settlement the parties may become aware that the GST treatment applied to the transaction thus far is not correct. For example, on signing the sale and purchase agreement the purchaser may have informed the supplier that they will be registered at the time of settlement. The supplier zero rates the transaction as a result. Before settlement, the purchaser may decide to nominate a third person to settle the transaction. The nominated person indicates that they will not be registered at the time of settlement. Conversely, the parties may become aware of circumstances that indicate that a transaction should be zero-rated rather than standard-rated. In both cases, since the crystallisation of the correct GST treatment in respect of the supply occurs at the time of settlement, the new zero-rating rules do not impose any obligations on the parties to change the initial GST treatment of the supply before settlement. Nevertheless, the parties may voluntarily agree to correct the GST treatment to avoid the consequence of being incorrect, as outlined below. If GST has already been accounted for to Inland Revenue by the supplier, the correction may be done under section 25 of the GST Act, which allows the supplier to issue a credit note to adjust the tax payable by the supplier. Thus, if a supply was standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated, the supplier will be able to deduct the GST already paid to Inland Revenue and the purchaser will be required to account for the amount of any deduction incorrectly claimed in respect of the supply. Alternatively, if a supply was zero-rated when it should have been standard-rated, the supplier would be required to account for the GST. Generally the purchaser will not be able to claim a deduction in respect of the supply since if they are registered for GST and intend to use the goods in making taxable supplies (requirements for obtaining a deduction), standard-rating is unlikely to be the correct treatment. Section 25 has been amended by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act to explicitly allow suppliers to issue debit and credit notes in the context of the zero-rating rules. Example 1 Max, a registered vendor, agrees to sell land to Geoff for $500,000 plus GST, if any. Geoff informs Max that he does not expect to be registered for GST at the time of settlement and does not have any intention to use the land for taxable purposes. Before settlement, Max issues a tax invoice on the basis that the GST of $75,000 is chargeable in respect of the supply. The tax invoice triggers the time of supply and Max accounts for the amount of GST to Inland Revenue. Following the time of supply but before settlement, Geoff tells Max that he has decided to nominate Paul to settle the transaction. Paul informs Max that he will be registered for GST at the time of settlement, will use the land for making taxable supplies and will not use it as his or his relative’s principal place of residence. The parties want to ensure that the correct GST is achieved before settlement. Therefore, Max issues a credit note under section 25 and deducts the amount of GST already paid to Inland Revenue ($75,000). - 7 - Example 2 Robert, a GST-registered property developer, agrees to sell land to Graeme, who is not registered for GST, for $1 million plus GST, if any. In the sale and purchase agreement Graeme specified that on settlement he will be registered for GST, will acquire the property with the intention of using it for making taxable supplies and will not use it as his or his relative’s principal place of residence. As a result, the parties treat the supply as zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb). Before the date of settlement, Robert issues a tax invoice, thereby triggering the time of supply. Since Robert treats the transaction as zero-rated, he does not account for any GST to Inland Revenue. Following the time of supply but before settlement, Graeme informs Robert that his circumstances have changed and that he will not be registered for GST at the date of settlement. As a result, the correct GST treatment of the transaction would be to standard-rate the supply. The parties want to ensure that the correct amount of GST is accounted for before settlement. Robert issues a debit note under section 25 and accounts to Inland Revenue for the GST amount of $150,000. Since Graeme is not registered for GST, he is not able to claim any input tax deduction. Correction of GST treatment after settlement In some situations the correct GST treatment may be unknown until after the transaction has been settled. The consequences of incorrectly standard-rating or incorrectly zero-rating the supply are set out below. Supply incorrectly standard-rated When a supply that should have been zero-rated is incorrectly standard-rated and the GST has been accounted for to Inland Revenue, the supplier will be required to use the credit note mechanism in section 25 to deduct the GST paid in respect of the supply. The purchaser would then be required to account for output tax in relation to any amount of input tax that they have incorrectly claimed in respect of the supply. Example 3 Sarah, a registered vendor, agrees to sell land to Brent for $200,000 plus GST, if any. Brent informs Sarah that he does not expect to be registered for GST at the time of settlement and does not have any intention to use the land for taxable purposes. Before settlement, Sarah issues a tax invoice on the basis that GST of $30,000 is chargeable in respect of the supply. The tax invoice triggers the time of supply and Sarah accounts for the amount of GST to Inland Revenue. Before settlement, owing to changes in Brent’s circumstances, he registers for GST. He also intends to use the land for making taxable supplies and does not intend to use it as his principal place of residence. - 8 - The parties settle the transaction. Since at the time of settlement all conditions in section 11(1)(mb) for zero-rating were satisfied, the supply should have been zero-rated rather than standard-rated. Following settlement, Sarah issues a credit note under section 25 and deducts the amount of GST already paid to Inland Revenue ($30,000). Since Brent has not claimed an input tax deduction, he is not required to account for output tax in relation to the credit note adjustment. Supply incorrectly zero-rated When at any time after a transaction is settled it is found that the supply should have been standard-rated rather than zero-rated, new section 5(23) will treat the purchaser, at the date of settlement, as making a supply of the goods in question at the standard rate. The value of the supply under section 5(23) will be equal to the amount of the consideration for the original supply. Since the supply is treated as being made at the date of settlement of the underlying supply, the purchaser may be subject to use-of-money interest with any applicable penalties calculated from that date. If the purchaser who is required to account for tax under section 5(23) is not registered for GST, they will be treated as registered from the date of the supply under section 5(23) and must apply to be GST-registered (new section 51B(4)). If the purchaser fails to apply for registration, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able to force their registration. New section 20(4B) denies a deduction to the person who is treated under section 5(23) as a supplier of goods. However, the person may be able to claim a deduction for the supply at a later date if they register for GST and use the relevant goods for making taxable supplies. Once GST is accounted for, the purchaser may request that the Commissioner cancel their registration (new section 51B(5)). Under section 5(3) a person cancelling their registration must ordinarily account for the output tax on any goods and services forming part of the assets of a taxable activity carried on by the person. This rule could result in unfair and unintended consequences if it applied to deregistration of a person who was required to register under section 51B(4). Therefore, new section 51B(6) renders section 5(3) inapplicable if: • the person seeks cancellation of their registration by the end of the taxable period in which they have accounted for the output tax under section 5(23); or • the Commissioner agrees that section 5(3) should not apply. Example 4 Isla agrees to acquire land for $1 million plus GST, if any. In a written statement provided to the supplier, Isla indicates that she is registered for GST, intends to use the land for making taxable supplies and will not use it as her or her relatives’ principal place of residence. On the basis of these representations, the supplier zero-rates the transaction. The transaction is settled on 1 July 2011. At the time the settlement Isla is not registered for GST. - 9 - Following settlement, Isla is treated as making a supply of the land on 1 July 2011 and has to account for the GST at the standard rate. Since Isla is not registered for GST, she must apply to be registered. Once registered, Isla must account for the GST under section 5(23) on the value equal to the consideration for the original supply: $1m x 15% = $150,000 Isla will not be able to claim an input tax deduction on the payment made under section 5(23) as this is denied under section 20(4B). In the same taxable period in which she accounts for the output tax under section 5(23), Isla asks the Commissioner to cancel her registration. The Commissioner confirms the deregistration. By application of section 51B(6)(a), Isla is relieved from the requirement to pay any additional tax under section 5(3) on deregistration. Transactions involving associated persons An amendment has been made to section 3A (meaning of “input tax”) to limit input tax deductions for second-hand goods in relation to land acquired as part of an arrangement involving more than two associated parties and more than one supply (new subsection (3B)). If the section applies, the amount of input tax for the supply is limited to the amount accounted for as output tax for all supplies that are part of the arrangement. This section is necessary to ensure that the zero-rating rules are not circumvented by arrangements involving second-hand goods deductions. - 10 - New apportionment rules For GST purposes, the amount of an input tax deduction that can be claimed by a GST- registered purchaser for acquired goods and services should relate to the taxable use of the goods and services. This is achieved by allowing GST-registered persons to claim a full input tax deduction for GST paid on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. If the goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are used partly or entirely for another purpose – for example, for private and exempt purposes (non-taxable purposes), the GST Act treats the non-taxable use of goods and services as a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly. Conversely, goods and services acquired principally for a non-taxable purpose (for which the GST-registered person is not entitled to an input tax deduction) could be partly or entirely used to make taxable supplies. In these circumstances, the GST Act allows a deduction to reflect that taxable use. This approach of taxing the “self supply” of goods and services ignores the original input tax deduction claimed by the GST-registered person as the change-in-use adjustments do not relate to the amount of the deduction claimed on acquisition. This is because the use of goods and services for a non-principal purpose is deemed to be a supply which is separate from the purchase transaction. Another aspect of the GST rules is that there is no statutory limit on the maximum number of adjustments that have to be made, so the number of adjustments required can be excessive relative to the amounts involved. In addition, since change-in-use adjustments do not relate to the amount of the initial input tax deduction, the value of adjustments that a person is required to make can potentially amount to more than the original GST paid on the purchase. Conversely the value of the deduction received by means of change-in-use adjustments can sometimes exceed the amount of GST originally paid. Because of the detachment between the initial input tax claimed on acquisition and the subsequent change-in-use adjustments, the rules for imposing GST on mixed use assets have not been sufficiently clear for many taxpayers. Other issues concerning the current approach were raised by the Court of Appeal decision in Lundy (2005) 22 NZTC 19 at 637, which involved land being used concurrently for taxable (advertised for sale) and non-taxable (generating rental income) purposes. Proposals to reform the change-in-use adjustments rules were initially outlined in an officials’ issues paper, Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions, released in June 2008. In the 2009 discussion document, GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets, the Government proposed to replace the change-in-use adjustment approach with one that would apportion input tax deductions in line with the actual use of the goods and services. The new apportionment rules contained in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 have therefore been the subject of extensive consultation and incorporate various amendments that arose during the policy development process. - 11 - Overall, the new rules are intended to reduce compliance costs for businesses by being simpler and requiring fewer adjustments. Key features The new rules replace the current adjustment approach with an approach that apportions input tax deductions in line with the actual use of the goods and services. In summary, the rules operate as follows: • On acquisition, unless an exclusion applies, the portion of a deduction that a registered person can claim must correspond with the portion of the asset’s use that is intended for taxable purposes. • In subsequent years, a person may be required to adjust the deduction claimed if the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. A number of exemptions are introduced to relieve a person from the requirement to make an adjustment if the amount of tax involved in the adjustment is low. • The maximum number of adjustments that a person may be required to make varies according to the asset’s value or estimated useful life of the asset. • Special “wash-up” rules apply when goods and services that have been subject to the apportionment rules are sold or the person deregisters. • Special rules also apply to assets used concurrently for taxable and non-taxable purposes. Application dates The new rules will apply to goods and services acquired after 1 April 2011. For goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011, registered persons will be required to continue making change-in-use adjustments under the current rules. The obligation to make adjustments will, however, be limited by new section 21G for all supplies other than those that wholly or partly consist of land: • For goods or services whose market value or book value on 1 April 2011 is $5,000 or less, no adjustment under the old rules may be made after 1 April 2011. • For goods or services whose market value or book value on 1 April 2011 is more than $5,000 but not more than $10,000, no adjustment under the old rules may be made after 1 April 2013. • For goods or services whose market value or book value on 1 April 2011 is more than $10,000, no adjustment under the old rules may be made after 1 April 2016. Once the time limit for an asset is reached, the person must stop making any adjustments for change–in-use in respect of that asset. - 12 - Detailed analysis Apportionment of input tax on acquisition Acquisition of standard-rated goods and services Under new section 20(3C), a purchaser will be able to deduct input tax on the acquisition of goods and services to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate on acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, and choose a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result (new section 20(3F)). The estimate could be made on the basis of any records that are available, previous experience, business plans or other suitable methods. The method of working out the extent of intended taxable use will largely depend on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, if the asset is a car which is intended to replace an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of stipulating the intended use of the purchased car provided patterns of use were largely unchanged. The estimated intended taxable use of the goods or services will determine the proportion of the input tax that can be deducted (new section 20(3G)). New section 20(3D) is a de minimis provision to relieve recipients from the obligation to apportion input tax on the acquisition of goods or services in certain circumstances. In a similar way to the current rules, recipients will not be required to apportion input tax if they make both taxable and exempt supplies and have reasonable grounds to believe that the total value of their exempt supplies in the first adjustment period 1 will be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies. Example 1 John acquires a car for $23,000 (including GST of $3,000) to replace his existing car. The car will be used both in John’s business as a sole trader and for private purposes. The logbook kept by John for his old car shows that in the previous year he used the car 70% of the time for business purposes. Since John does not expect this ratio to substantially change in the future, he estimates that he will use the new car 70% for taxable purposes. Consequently, on acquisition John claims 70% of the available input tax using the formula in section 20(3G): $3,000 x 70% = $2,100 1 “First adjustment period” is defined in section 21F(2)(a) as a period that starts on the date of acquisition and ends on the date as the person chooses that either corresponds to the person’s first balance date that falls after the date of acquisition or to the person’s first balance date that falls at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. See more on “adjustment periods” later in this report. - 13 - Example 2 Safe Life Ltd (SL) is an insurance company that provides mostly life insurance policies (exempt supplies), but also provides a range of other insurance covers (taxable supplies). SL purchases 100 computers for a total consideration of $240,000 (including GST of $31,304). On acquisition, SL may only claim the portion of the input tax that corresponds with the intended taxable use of the computers. SL estimates that in the 12 months prior to the purchase, 70% of all its supplies were exempt supplies of life insurance policies and 30% of its supplies were taxable supplies of other insurance covers. As a result, SL determines that the computers will be used 30% of the time for the purpose of making taxable supplies and claims 30% of the input tax paid in respect of the computers: $31,304 x 30% = $9.391 Example 3 A corner dairy spends $6,000 (exclusive of GST) on renovations. The major part of the dairy’s business involves making taxable supplies. However, the dairy also runs a debtors’ account and charges interest on any late payments (exempt supplies). Since the total value of the interest charged (exempt supplies) in the first adjustment period is expected to be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies made by the dairy, the dairy is not required to apportion the input tax in relation to the renovations. Acquisition of zero-rated goods and services The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 introduces new rules that require suppliers of land, or supplies that include land, to charge GST on the supply at the rate of zero percent in certain circumstances. New section 20(3I) provides special rules that will allow recipients of zero-rated supplies to determine the GST component of a zero-rated acquisition and account for any non-taxable use of the goods. In the absence of the special rule, any non-taxable use of the land would remain unaccounted for. Thus, on the acquisition of a zero-rated asset, the purchaser will be required to perform the following steps: Identify the nominal amount of tax First, the purchaser must identify the nominal amount of tax (the “nominal GST component”) that would be chargeable on the value of the supply if the zero-rating rules did not apply and the supply was subject to the standard rate of GST. - 14 - Determine the intended use of the supply The purchaser must then determine as a percentage the extent to which they intend to use the goods for making taxable supplies. Account for output tax, if any If the person estimates that they will not use the asset solely for making taxable supplies, the person must account as output tax for the proportion of the nominal GST component that is attributable to the non-taxable use of the goods. Example 4 Safe Life Ltd (SL) from Example 2 acquires new headquarters for $30 million. There was no GST included in the supply as it is subject to the new zero-rating rules. On acquisition, SL has to apply the rules in section 20(3I) as follows: 1. Identify the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply if the supply was subject to the standard rate of GST (the nominal GST component): (30m x 15% = $4,500,000) 2. Determine the extent to which they intend to use the headquarters for making taxable supplies. (SL estimates that 30% of its activity involves making taxable supplies.) 3. Account for the proportion of the nominal GST component that is attributable to the non- taxable use of the goods as an output tax: $4,500,000 x 70% = $3,150,000 SL has to account for output tax of $3,150.00 in respect of the acquisition of the new headquarters. Example 5 Eric purchases a building for $3 million. The supply to Eric is zero-rated. Eric intends to rent the ground floor of the building to commercial tenants, and the upper floors of the building to residential tenants. On acquisition, Eric has to apply the rules in section 20(3I): 1. Identify the amount of tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply if the supply was subject to the standard rate of GST (the nominal GST component): $3m x 15% = $450,000 - 15 - 2. Determine the extent to which he intends to use the building for making taxable supplies. Eric determines that he intends to use the building 60% in making taxable supplies (rent to commercial tenants) and 40% in making exempt supplies (rent to residential tenants). 3. Account for the proportion of the nominal GST component that is attributable to the non- taxable use of the goods as output tax: $450,000 x 40% = $180,000 Eric has to account for output tax of $180,000 on acquisition of the building. Subsequent adjustments for change-in-use The new rules seek to achieve as much “first instance” accuracy as possible by requiring taxpayers to make fair and reasonable estimates on the intended taxable and non-taxable uses of acquired goods and services. In an “adjustment period” following the initial input tax deduction claim, taxpayers may, however, be required to make further adjustments if the actual taxable use of an asset is different from its intended taxable use. “Adjustment period” An “adjustment period” (described in new section 21F(2)) is a period at the end of which a person is required to estimate whether an adjustment for a subsequent change-in-use is required. The first adjustment period is a period that starts on the date of acquisition and ends on the date as the person chooses that either corresponds to the person’s first balance date that falls after the date of acquisition or to the person’s first balance date that falls at least 12 months after the date of acquisition. All subsequent adjustment periods will be annual periods that start on the day after the end of the earlier adjustment period and end on the last day of the equivalent taxable period in which the first adjustment period ended. Example 6 Mary purchases a car on 1 February 2012. Mary’s balance date falls on 31 March. The first adjustment period in respect of the car is, at Mary’s option, either: 1. the period from 1 February 2012 to 31 March 2012; or 2. the period from 1 February 2012 to 31 March 2013. If Mary has chosen option 1 as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. If Mary has chosen option 2 as her first adjustment period, the second adjustment period will run from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014. - 16 - Number of adjustment periods There will be a maximum number of adjustment periods for which adjustments will be required to be made. The default method for identifying the maximum number of adjustment periods is in new section 21F(3)(a) and requires the taxpayer to apply the following GST- exclusive bands of goods and services: • $5,001 to $10,000 – two adjustments. • $10,001 to $500,000 – five adjustments. • $500,001 or more – ten adjustments. Alternatively, taxpayers will be able to select the maximum number of adjustments by reference to the estimated useful life of the asset as specified in the Tax Depreciation Rates Determinations set by the Commissioner under section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (new section 21F(3)(b)). There will be no limit to adjustment periods in relation to land (new section 21F(4)). Exclusions from the obligation to make adjustments in an adjustment period No subsequent change-in-use adjustment will be required for goods and services acquired for the GST-exclusive value of $5,000 or less (new section 21(2)(b)). Example 7 Sherry, a graphic designer, purchases a computer for $3,999 (including GST of $522) to use both for business and private purposes. She estimates that she will use the computer 80% for taxable purposes and claims a deduction of $418 (80% of $522). Since the GST-exclusive value of the computer is less than $5,000, Sherry will not be required to make any adjustments for change-in-use in any of the subsequent adjustment periods. For assets with a value of more than $5,000, no adjustment will be required in the relevant adjustment period if the recipient makes both taxable and exempt supplies and the total value of their exempt supplies in the adjustment period to which the adjustment relate is no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies for that adjustment period (new sections 21(2)(a) and 20(3)(d)). Identifying whether there is substantial change in the use of the goods and services If the above exclusions do not apply, new sections 21A and 21B provide that, at the end of an adjustment period, a person must compare the percentage actual use of goods or services with: • the percentage intended use of the goods or services (if no previous adjustment has been made); or • the previous actual use (if the goods or services have been subject to a previous adjustment). - 17 - The “percentage actual use” is defined in section 21F(1)(a) as the extent to which the goods or services are actually used by the person for making taxable supplies. It is calculated from the date of acquisition to the end of the relevant adjustment period. The estimate must be expressed as a percentage. The “percentage intended use” is defined in section 21F(1)(b) as the extent to which the goods or services are intended to be used by the person for making taxable supplies, estimated at the time of acquisition. The estimate must be expressed as a percentage. The “previous actual use” is defined in section 21B(b)(i) as the percentage actual use in an earlier period that is the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. If the percentage intended use or previous actual use of goods or services is equal to the percentage actual use, the person will not be required to make an adjustment in the relevant adjustment period. If the percentage actual use of goods or services differs from the percentage intended use or previous actual use, the person will be required to make an adjustment in an adjustment period only if the difference between the amounts is 10 percentage points or more or the monetary value of the adjustment is more than $1,000 (new section 21(2)(c)). Calculating adjustments If none of the exclusions mentioned above apply, the person will need to account for a change-in-use. New section 21C sets out how to calculate the amount of a change-in-use adjustment for the adjustment period. This will be done by applying the formula: Full input tax deduction x percentage difference The “full input tax deduction” is the total amount of input tax on the supply. In situations where goods were acquired subject to the zero-rating rules, “full input tax deduction” will include any nominal GST component as calculated under section 20(3I). The “percentage difference” is defined in section 21F(1)(c) as the difference between the percentage actual use and either the percentage intended use or the previous actual use if the person has already made an adjustment in respect of the asset in an earlier adjustment period. Example 8: Identifying percentage actual use and percentage intended/previous actual use Peter acquires a luxury boat for $800,000 plus GST. On acquisition, Peter estimated that the boat would be used 100% for chartering – a taxable purpose – and claimed the full input tax deduction. However, in later periods Peter uses the boat partly for private purposes. Based on the value of the boat, Peter determines that there will be five adjustment periods. In those adjustment periods, Peter uses the boat as follows: - in the first adjustment period – 100% for taxable purposes; - in the second adjustment period – 80% for taxable purposes; - 18 - - in the third adjustment period – 83% for taxable purposes; - in the fourth adjustment period – 50% for taxable purposes; and - in the fifth adjustment period – 90% for taxable purposes. The first adjustment period is a period of six months. All subsequent adjustment periods are periods of 12 months. None of the exclusions apply to this situation. The question is: what are the use percentages that Peter has to compare at the end of each adjustment period? First adjustment period Percentage intended use – 100% Percentage actual use – 100% Second adjustment period Previous actual use – 100% Percentage actual use – 86.6% (100% x 6/18) + (80% x 12/18) = 33.3 + 53.33 = 86.6% In the above calculations, figures “6” and “12” represent, respectively, the length of the first and second adjustment periods expressed in months. The figure “18” represents the total number of months since the acquisition of the boat. Third adjustment period Previous actual use – 86.6% Percentage actual use – 85.2% (100% x 6/30) + (80% x 12/30) + (83% x 12/30) = 20% + 32% + 33.2% = 85.2% Fourth adjustment period Previous actual use – 86.6% Percentage actual use – 75.2% (100% x 6/42) + (80% x 12/42) + (83% x 12/42) + (50% x 12/42) = 14.3% + 22.9 + 23.7% + 14.3% = 75.2% Fifth adjustment period Previous actual use – 75.2% Percentage actual use – 78.4% - 19 - (100% x 6/54) + (80% x 12/54) + (83% x 12/54) + (50% x 12/54) + (90% x 12/54) = 11.1% + 17.8% + 18.4% + 11.1% + 20% = 78.4% It should be noted that Peter will be required to account for adjustments to Inland Revenue in the second, third, fourth and fifth adjustment periods as in each of those periods either the percentage difference is more than 10 percentage points or the monetary value of the adjustments is more than $1,000. Hence, Peter may not rely on the exclusion in section 21(2)(c). Special rule for concurrent use of land Under the new apportionment approach, the portion of a deduction that a person should be entitled to must correspond with the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one point in time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used by a person for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking the person’s children to school – but usually not both at the same time. In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same point in time – for example, a property developer may supply a house as a dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. Thus, for the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income). Section 21D provides a formula that will assist taxpayers in apportioning between concurrent uses of land. It also allows taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for an alternative approach should the formula not be workable in their circumstances. Section 21D(3) requires a registered person to calculate the extent to which the land is used for making taxable supplies by using the formula: Consideration for taxable supply ––––––––––––––––––––––––––– x 100% Total consideration for supply The “consideration for taxable supply” is defined in section 21D(4)(a) as either the amount derived on a disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The “total consideration for supply” is defined in section 21D(4)(6) as the sum of the amount of the “consideration for the taxable supply” described above and: • the amount of all rental income derived from the supply of a dwelling since the land was acquired; and • if no rental income is paid or payable in relation to the non-taxable use of land, the market value of rental income that would have been derived from the time of acquisition of the land if rental had been charged. - 20 - New section 21D(5) specifies that the market value must be used in determining “consideration for the taxable supply” and/or “total consideration for supply” if amounts derived under those definitions are by associated persons or are not arm’s-length amounts. New section 21D(5B) provides that if the market value of the land or rental income is not readily identifiable, the person may use another method to provide a fair and reasonable estimate of the market value. Example 9 Sandy, a property developer, constructed two similar residential houses, House A and House B, next to each other. The construction cost of each house is $230,000 (including GST of $30,000). Sandy intends to sell both properties on completion (a taxable use) and therefore claims a full deduction on the GST incurred on construction. Sandy is unable to sell the property immediately on completion. Therefore, while still advertising the houses for sale, she: • rents out House A and receives rental income of $26,000 in the first adjustment period; and • moves into House B and lives there rent-free. At the end of the first adjustment period, Sandy sells House B for $360,000. Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period – House A Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable (advertising for sale) and exempt (supplying a residential dwelling) purposes, she uses the formula in section 21D(3) to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The “consideration for taxable supply” is either the amount derived on a disposal of the land or, if the land has not been disposed of, the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. Sandy has not disposed of House A, but ascertains that the market value of the house is approximately the same as for House B – $360,000. The “total consideration for supply” is the amount of the “consideration for the taxable supply” ($360,000) and the amount of all rental income ($26,000) derived from the supply of the dwelling since the land was acquired – $386,000. Therefore, Sandy’s taxable use of the house is: $360,000 –––––––––– x 100 = 93% $386,000 Sandy has therefore deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to Inland Revenue: $30,000 x 7% = $2,100 - 21 - Adjustment at the end of the first adjustment period – House B Since Sandy used the house concurrently for taxable (advertising for sale) and private (residential) purposes, she has to use the formula in section 21D(3) to identify the actual taxable use of the property in the first adjustment period. The “consideration for taxable supply” is the amount derived on a disposal of the house – $360,000. Since Sandy did not rent out House B, but still used it for non-taxable purposes, the “total consideration for supply” is the amount of the “consideration for the taxable supply” ($360,000) and the market value of the rental income that she would have derived if she had rented out the property. Sandy estimates that she would have received $26,000 of rental income. Therefore, Sandy’s taxable use of the house is: $360,000 –––––––––– x 100 = 93% $386,000 Sandy has therefore deducted 7% more input tax than she should have and has to account this amount Inland Revenue: $30,000 x 7% = $2,100 In both cases it should be noted that Sandy may be able to recover some or all of the unclaimed input tax if she later disposes of the houses in the course of her taxable activity (see section below “adjustment on disposal”). An additional formula (section 21D(6)) estimates the extent of taxable use of the land if the land has, at any time, been used solely for making non-taxable supplies. The formula is: Months ––––––––––– x result as calculated under the formula in section 21D(3) Total months “Months” is defined in section 21D(7) (a) as the number of months since acquisition in which all or part of the land is used to some extent for making taxable supplies. “Total months” is defined in section 21D(7)(b)as the total number of months since acquisition. By taking into account the solely non-taxable use of the land, the formula will reduce the extent of the taxable use of the land calculated under the formula in section 21D(3). - 22 - Example 10 The facts are the same as in Example 9. Assume that the length of the first adjustment period was 12 months. In the second adjustment period, Sandy continues both letting out and advertising for sale House A. However, six months after the start of the second adjustment period, Sandy stops advertising House A for sale as she decides to permanently rent it out. In the second adjustment period, she receives rental income of $30,000. The market value of House A at the time of the adjustment is still $360,000. At the end of the second adjustment period, Sandy uses the formula in section 21D to identify the taxable use of the house. For the purposes of the second adjustment period, the “total consideration for supply” is the sum of the market value of the house and all rental income received since the land was acquired: $360,000 ––––––––––––– x 100 = 86.5% $416,000 However, because the house has been used for six months solely for making non-taxable supplies, she has to apply the formula in section 21D(6): 18 –––– x 86.5% = 64.8% 24 Sandy’s percentage actual use of House A in the second adjustment period is 64.8%. The percentage actual use must be compared with the “previous actual use”, that is with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For Sandy, the previous actual use will be 93%. Sandy has therefore deducted 28.2% more input tax than she should have and has to account for this to Inland Revenue: $30,000 x 28.2% = $8,460 Adjustment on disposal When a registered person disposes of, or is treated as disposing of, goods or services in the course of a taxable activity and has not claimed a full input tax deduction, new section 21E allows them to claim an additional amount of input tax. The amount of deduction available on disposal of goods or services will be calculated under the formula: tax fraction × consideration × (1 – actual deduction/full input tax deduction) - 23 - For the purposes of the formula section 21E(3) provides that; • “Tax fraction” has the meaning given in section 2(1). For the purposes of the 15% GST rate, the tax fraction is 3/23. • “Consideration” is the amount of consideration received, or treated as received, for the supply. • “Actual deduction” is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the date of disposal. The amount calculated under the formula, when added to any deduction already claimed, must not be more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply (or the nominal GST component, if the supply was zero-rated). Example 11: Appreciating asset Same facts as in Example 10. The total input tax on the construction costs that relate to House A is $30,000. Sandy claimed 64.8% of the total input tax – $19,440. At the beginning of the third adjustment period, Sandy sold the house to Nigel for $320,000 inclusive of GST. Since Sandy has not claimed the full input tax in respect of the construction cost incurred in respect of the property, she may use section 21E to make a final adjustment of the input tax: 3/23 x $320,000 x (1 - $19,440/$30,000) = $14,692 The resulting amount of $14,692, when added to the deduction already claimed ($19,440), is more than the total amount of the input tax on the supply ($30,000). Therefore, the amount of the adjustment that may be claimed by Sandy will be limited to $10,560. Example 12: Depreciating asset Charles acquired a car for $46,000 (inclusive of GST of $6,000) and claimed 70% of the input tax ($4,200). Having used the car for the intended purpose for three years, Charles sells it for $30,000 inclusive of GST. Since Charles has not claimed the full input tax in respect of the car and the car was sold in the course of the taxable activity, he may use section 21E to make a final adjustment of the input tax: 3/23 x $30,000 x (1 - $4,200/$6,000) = $1,174 The amount of the adjustment to be claimed in respect of the taxable disposal of the vehicle is $1,174. - 24 - Example 13: Master example John, the sole trader in Example 1, acquired a vehicle for $20,000 plus $3,000 GST. On acquisition, John claimed 70% of the input tax – $2,100. Since the GST-exclusive value of the car falls between $10,001 to $500,000, he has to monitor the use of the car for five adjustment periods. In the first adjustment period (a period of 12 months), the entries in the logbook kept by John indicate that he used the car 55% in his business (taxable use). In the second adjustment period (also a period of 12 months), John used the car 65% in his business. In the third adjustment period (a period of 12 months), John withdrew the car from the use in the business and used it solely for private purposes. In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car for $10,000 inclusive of GST. First adjustment period At the end of the first adjustment period, John has to determine whether he may rely on the exclusions in either section 21(2)(a) (minimal exempt supplies) or section 21(2)(b) (the value of the supply) to avoid any change in use adjustments. John determines that the exclusion does not apply. John therefore has to determine whether the use of the car in the first adjustment period corresponds with the intended taxable use of the car as estimated on acquisition. To do this he must compare the percentage actual use of the car with the percentage intended use of the car. The logbook kept by John in respect of the car indicated that the taxable use of the car accounted for 55% of its total use. On acquisition, John predicted that he would use the car 70% for taxable purposes. Since the difference between the intended taxable use and the actual taxable use is more that 10%, John may not rely on the exclusion in section 21(2)(c) and has to make an adjustment for change-in-use. Using the formula in section 21C, John calculates the amount of the deduction that he has to return to Inland Revenue as output tax: $3,000 x 15% = $450 Second adjustment period For the purposes of the adjustment in the second adjustment period, the percentage actual use must be calculated from the date of acquisition to the end of the relevant adjustment period. John used the car for taxable purposes 55% in the first adjustment period of 12 months and 65% in the second adjustment period of 12 months. Overall, over two years, John used the car 60% for taxable purposes: (55% x 12/24) + (65% x 12/24) = 60% - 25 - The percentage actual use must be compared with the “previous actual use”, that is with the percentage actual use as determined in the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. For John, the previous actual use will be 55%, as this was the actual use of the car at the end of the first adjustment period. Since the difference between the percentage actual use (60%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is less than 10 percentage points, John will not be required to account for the amount of the adjustment if the monetary value of the adjustment is less than $1,000. John calculates that the value of the adjustment is less that $1,000 using the formula in section 21C: $3,000 x 5% = $150 Third adjustment period John calculates the percentage actual use of the car after three adjustment periods: (55% x 12/36) + (65% x 12/36) + (0% x 12/36) = 18.3% + 21.7% + 0 = 40% The percentage actual use is 40%. This percentage has to be compared with the previous actual use. Since John did not make an adjustment in the previous (second) adjustment period, the “previous actual use” will be the percentage actual use in a period that is the most recent period in which an adjustment has been made. John made an adjustment in the first adjustment period where his percentage actual use was 55%. This percentage will therefore become John’s previous actual use for the purposes of the adjustment in the third adjustment period. Since the difference between the percentage actual use (40%) and the previous actual use (55%) of the car is more than 10 percentage points, John has to account to Inland Revenue for the over-claimed amount of the deduction. The amount of the output tax to be accounted for is: $3,000 x 15% = $450 Fourth adjustment period In the fourth adjustment period, John sold the car in the course of his taxable activity for $10,000. As John has not claimed the full deduction in respect of the car, he may claim an additional amount of the adjustment on disposal under section 21E calculated as follows: 3/23 x $10,000 x (1 - $1,200/$3,000) = $783 John may claim a deduction of $783 in respect of the taxable disposal of the car. - 26 - Entitlement to input tax deduction for goods and services acquired before registration New rules have also been introduced that may allow a registered person to claim input tax deductions for goods and services purchased by them before registration. These will apply in the following circumstances: • before becoming a registered person, the person acquired goods or services that were chargeable with GST at the standard rate; and • at the time of the registration or at a later time, the person used the goods or services for making taxable supplies; and • the original cost of the goods or services, excluding GST, was $5,000 or less. If these conditions are met, a registered person will be able to claim a deduction for the goods and services purchased by them before registration if they hold a tax invoice in relation to the supply as required by section 20(2) or have adequate records that enable the identification of the particulars of an invoice as required by section 24(3). To claim a deduction, the registered person must make an adjustment for change-in-use under sections 21 and 21A. The ordinary rules for apportionment of input tax would, however, be modified to treat the first adjustment period as the period that starts on the date of the acquisition of the goods or services and ends on the first balance date that falls after the person becomes registered for GST and uses the goods or services for making taxable supplies. Following the determination of the length of the first adjustment period, the person must identify the percentage actual use of the goods or services in that period, using a method that provides a fair and reasonable result. This percentage actual use would then be compared with the percentage intended use (which will be 0% as the person will not have claimed any deduction on the acquisition). The resulting “percentage difference” will be used to claim an adjusted amount of the deduction under section 21C. This rule allows goods and services acquired by a person before their registration to enter the proposed apportionment regime. As a consequence, the asset will become subject to the same apportionment rules as any other asset purchased by the registered person. Example 14 On 1 January 2012, Craig, an unregistered person, acquires a car for $23,000 (including GST of $3,000). For the next two years Craig uses the car solely for private purposes. On 1 January 2014, Craig registers for GST and starts using the car solely for business purposes. Craig’s next balance date is 31 March 2014. Craig has retained the tax invoice received on the purchase of the car. Since the value of the car on the acquisition was more that $5,000, Craig may claim a deduction for the car under section 21AB. - 27 - Craig’s first adjustment period in respect of the car will be treated as the period that starts on the date of the acquisition of the goods or services and ends on the first balance date that falls after the person becomes registered for GST and uses the goods or services for making taxable supplies – that is, from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2014. During that period (a total of 27 months), Craig used the car 0% for taxable purposes for 24 months (1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013) and 100% for taxable purposes for three months (1 January 2014 to 31 March 2014). Therefore, his total taxable use in the first adjustment period will be: (0% x 24/27) + (100% x 3/27) = 11% At the end of the first adjustment period, Craig can claim $330 (11% of the initial input tax of $3,000). Subsequent adjustment periods The maximum number of adjustments that have to be made for goods and services of value between $10,000 and $500,000 is five. Therefore, if Craig continues owning the car he may be required to make four additional adjustments. If he sells the car in the course of his taxable activity, he may be entitled to an additional deduction under the wash-up mechanism in section 21E. Application to acquisitions from associated persons New section 3A(3C) amends the application of section 21AB for goods or services acquired from an associated person. In these situations, the amount of input tax on goods or services that may be claimed by the person must not be more than the amount accounted for as output tax by the associated supplier of the goods or services. - 28 - Transactions involving nominations Nominee transactions ordinarily involve a purchaser nominating another person (a nominee) to receive goods and services and/or settle the transaction. New rules introduced by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 are intended to provide greater certainty for transactions involving nominees by adopting an “economic substance” approach. The rules are not intended to apply to transactions that involve other structures, such as assignments, novations, or agency arrangements. Key features New section 60B clarifies the GST treatment of transactions involving nominations – when a contractual purchaser nominates another person (a nominee) to receive the goods or services from the contractual vendor. In these circumstances, the GST treatment will depend on which party provides payment for the supply of goods or services. In respect of transactions involving land, however, the supply will always be treated as being made by the supplier to the nominee. Application dates The new rules will apply to supplies made on or after 1 April 2011. Detailed analysis Effect of nomination on a supply New section 60B applies when a person (person A) enters into a contract to supply goods and services to another person (person B) and person B directs person A to provide the goods and services to a nominated person (person C) who is not party to the contract. The section does not apply to situations involving supplies made to or by agents, as these situations are governed by section 60 of the GST Act. Also, the new rule does not apply to assignments or novations. The GST treatment of a supply will depend on the exact circumstances of the transaction. Contractual purchaser and nominated person have the same registration status If a contractual purchaser (person B) and the nominated person (person C) are both registered or both not registered for GST, the treatment of the supply will depend on which party provides consideration for the supply: • If person B pays the full consideration for the supply, the supply is treated as a supply from the supplier (person A) to person B and the existence of person C is ignored (section 60B(2)). - 29 - • If person C pays the full consideration for the supply, the supply is treated as a supply from person A to person C and the existence of person B is ignored (section 60B(3)). • If person B and person C each pay part of the consideration for the supply, the supply is treated as a supply from person A to person B. However, person B and person C may agree in writing that the supply is to be treated as a supply made to person C. No such agreement can be made if person B has claimed an input tax deduction in relation to the supply (section 60B(4)). Contractual purchaser and nominated person have different registration status If the registration status of a contractual purchaser differs from the registration status of the nominated person (that is, one party is registered for GST and another party is not registered for GST), the supply is always treated as a supply from the supplier to the nominated person. Nominee transactions that involve land If a supply wholly or partly consists of land, the supply is always treated as made by the supplier to the nominated person. This is intended to provide consistency with fact that the zero-rating rules apply at the time of settlement. Record-keeping requirements The nomination rules in section 60B affect the tax invoice requirements. In normal circumstances, a taxpayer must have a tax invoice to claim an input tax deduction. In transactions involving nominations, a nominee may not have the requisite tax invoice as it may have been issued to the purchaser. In these circumstances, new section 24(7B) requires a nominee to maintain records that would allow the name and address of the supplier, the date of payment for the supply, a description of the goods and services supplied, and the consideration for the supply to be ascertained. New section 20(2)(e) further specifies that a nominee may use the records kept in accordance with section 24(7B) as documentation to claim a deduction of input tax. - 30 - Supplies of accommodation Accommodation provided by GST-registered persons is generally taxable unless it is expressly treated as an exempt supply. The GST Act exempts the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”, but not accommodation that is in a “commercial dwelling”. The main reason for exempting the supply of accommodation in a dwelling from GST, as described in the 1985 White Paper on Goods and Services Tax, was to ensure that those in rental accommodation were not disadvantaged compared with owner-occupiers. For this reason, the definition was intended to apply to situations when there was a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. This goal was arguably not being achieved because of the potentially wide interpretation of the definition of “dwelling”. In addition, the boundary between the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” could have resulted in different suppliers of essentially the same type of accommodation having their supplies treated differently for GST purposes, depending on whether particular aspects of the definitions were satisfied. The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 amends the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” to provide a clearer boundary between the definitions. Key features The amendments narrow the definition of “dwelling” and update the list of accommodation that is treated as being in a “commercial dwelling”. For accommodation to be in a “dwelling” the relevant premises must be occupied by the recipient as their principal place of residence or it must be reasonably foreseeable that this will be the case. The recipient must also be entitled to quiet enjoyment of the property. Accommodation supplied to boarders will also be treated as a supply of accommodation in “dwelling”. The current definition of “commercial dwelling” is amended by expanding the list of types of accommodation that are to be treated as such to include homestays, farmstays, bed and breakfast accommodation and certain serviced apartments. Application dates The new definitions will apply for supplies of accommodation made on or after 1 April 2011. Detailed analysis Definition of “dwelling” The definition of “dwelling” in section 2(1) of the GST Act has been amended to include premises that the person occupies, or that it can reasonably be foreseen that the person will occupy, as their principal place of residence (paragraph (a)(i)), and of which the person has “quiet enjoyment” (paragraph (a)(ii)). - 31 - The term “premises” is defined by reference to section 2 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, and therefore includes: • any part of any premises; and • any land and appurtenances, other than facilities; and • any mobile home, caravan, or other means of shelter placed or erected upon any land and intended for occupation on that land. A definition of a “principal place of residence” is included in the GST Act and means a place that a person occupies as their main residence for the period to which the agreement for the supply of accommodation relates. For example, if accommodation is supplied for six months, to be considered as being in a “dwelling”, the accommodation must be the recipient’s principal place of residence, or be reasonably foreseen as being so, for that period. For a supply to be a supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”, the person must also have “quiet enjoyment” of the premises as the term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. This means that the person must be entitled to enjoyment of the premises without interruption by the landlord or any person claiming by, through, or under the landlord or having superior title to that of the landlord. Moreover, the landlord must not cause or permit any interference with the reasonable peace, comfort, or privacy of the tenant in their use of the premises. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “dwelling” extends the definition to include accommodation provided to a person who is occupying the same premises, or part of the same premises, as the supplier of the accommodation and who occupies the premises as their principal place of residence. The intention of this paragraph is to include supplies of accommodation to boarders who reside in the same premises as their landlords and who may not meet the “quiet enjoyment” test. Finally, a supply will not be a supply of accommodation in a “dwelling” if it is a supply of accommodation in a “commercial dwelling”. Definition of “commercial dwelling” The definition of “commercial dwelling” in the GST Act provides a list of types of accommodation covered. The amended list adds supplies of the following types of accommodation: • homestays; • farmstays; • bed and breakfast establishments; and • a serviced apartment managed or operated by a third party for which services, in addition to the supply of accommodation, are provided and in relation to which a resident does not have quiet enjoyment. - 32 - The last inclusion ensures that all managed serviced apartments are treated in the same manner, irrespective of the structure adopted to provide the accommodation. This position was previously uncertain.
\- 1 - 23 December 2010 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Changes to qualifying company rules This special report provides early information on changes to the rules for qualifying companies, which were part of recently enacted legislation in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. This special report precedes coverage of the new legislation that will appear in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published early next year. The relevant changes introduced in the Act: • provide transparent income tax treatment for electing closely held companies, which will be known as look-through companies (LTCs); • allow existing qualifying companies (QCs) and loss-attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) to continue to use the current QC rules without the ability to attribute losses, pending a review of the dividend rules for closely held companies; and • allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new LTC rules or change to another business vehicle such as a partnership, without a tax cost during the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2013. This report is intended to provide timely assistance to those with existing QCs and LAQCs to help them understand the changes to the tax rules. Any decision on future business structures will need to take into account a wide variety of factors, both tax and non-tax related – for example, the protection of limited liability. Existing QC and LAQC owners will need to consider their own circumstances when making their decisions, and may want to seek assistance from their professional advisor if necessary. A separate special report contains guidance on the new LTC rules. Further guidance on the changes to the qualifying company rules will be available over the coming months on Inland Revenue’s website and in a Tax Information Bulletin. - 2 - Background As part of Budget 2010 the Government announced reforms to the tax rules for qualifying companies. Feedback on the proposals was sought in the officials’ issues paper, Qualifying companies: implementation of flow-through tax treatment published the day after the Budget announcement. Based on this feedback, it was decided to introduce new rules from 1 April 2011, providing an elective look-through income tax treatment for closely held companies. These are covered in a separate special report. In addition, in response to feedback from small businesses, the Government decided to allow existing QCs and LAQCs to continue to use the current qualifying company rules, but without the ability to attribute losses, while a review of the tax rules for dividends from closely held companies is carried out. Because of the changes to the qualifying company rules, a special set of transitional rules were developed, to allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new LTC rules or change to another business vehicle such as a partnership or sole trader, without a tax cost. An early draft of this legislation was made available for public comment on 15 October 2010, accompanied by an explanatory note. The final legislation, which was enacted on 20 December 2010, is different from the earlier draft, reflecting feedback received during consultation. Some of these changes are fairly substantial while others are more technical in nature. The earlier draft of the legislation and the explanatory note have therefore been superseded by the enacted rules and should not be relied upon. Key features Qualifying company rules The changes effectively “grandparent” the QC rules for existing QCs and LAQCs only. The revised QC rules will continue to apply to existing QCs and LAQCs unless they choose to revoke their QC election, and/or use one of the transition options (see below). The main effect of the changes is to: • remove the ability of an LAQC to attribute losses. This means that existing LAQCs will effectively be taxed in the same way as ordinary QCs; and • prevent companies that are not already QCs from entering the QC rules for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011. The changes apply to QCs and LAQCs for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011. - 3 - Transitional rules for existing QCs and LAQCs Special transitional rules allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new LTC rules or change to another business vehicle, without a tax cost. If an existing QC or LAQC chooses not to transition they will remain in the QC rules, but cannot attribute losses to shareholders. The transitional rules provide that: • Transition can take place in either one of the first two income years starting on or after 1 April 2011; the year chosen for transition is called the “transitional year”. • QCs and LAQCs have six months from the start of their transitional year to advise Inland Revenue of their transition. • If transitioning to a new business structure, the partnership or sole tradership must consist of the same person(s) who owned the QC or LAQC. The transition into the new business form must be completed by the end of the transitional year. • The appropriate tax treatment (LTC, partnership or sole trader) will apply from the start of the transitional year. • All of the QCs assets, liabilities, tax balances and other obligations will automatically transfer to the new LTC, partnership or sole trader with no tax cost. • Any carried forward loss balances of a QC or an LAQC can be used in future but are effectively ring-fenced for owners of the LTC, or partners in the partnership, to use against future income from that LTC or that partnership. Application dates The application date for the qualifying company reforms is the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. For companies with an early balance date – for example, an LAQC with a balance date of 31 January, they will have loss attribution for their income year ended 31 January 2012 but will no longer be able to attribute losses for their income year starting on 1 February 2012. To use the grandparented QC regime, QCs and LAQCs must have used the QC regime for their income year immediately before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. If transitioning in the second of the possible transitional years, they must also have met the QC criteria for the whole of the first possible transitional year. - 4 - Detailed analysis Grandparented qualifying company rules Sections HA 1, HA 3, HA 5, HA 7B, HA 10, HA 11(4), HA 20, HA 24 to HA 27, HA 30(3), HA 38 to HA 39 and YA 1 Existing QCs and LAQCs may continue to use the qualifying company rules in subpart HA, without the ability to attribute losses. This will be the default option for all existing QCs and LAQCs for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011. The definition of an LAQC and the various provisions in subpart HA which provided for an LAQC to attribute losses to its shareholders have been repealed. The grandparenting rules apply only to companies that are QCs or LAQCs in the income year immediately before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011; this is called the “grandparenting income year”. Existing QCs and LAQCs include companies already registered with Inland Revenue as QCs or LAQCs, and companies such as newly incorporated companies, for whom the grandparenting income year is the first year for which they are required to submit a return of income, and who send their valid election to Inland Revenue within the timeframe allowed in section HA 30(3). Transitional rules for existing QCs and LAQCs Sections CB 32C, DV 21, DV 23, DV 24, HA 33B, HZ 4B to HZ 4D and YA The transitional rules apply only to companies that are QCs or LAQCs in the income year immediately before the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. If they are transitioning in the second of the possible “transitional” years they must also have met the QC criteria for the whole of the first possible transitional year. Transition can take place in either one of the first two income years starting on or after 1 April 2011. The year chosen for transition is called the “transitional year”. The transitional rules are designed to provide a smooth transition for existing QCs and LAQCs to leave the QC rules and start using the LTC rules if they wish to do so. They also provide an option for existing QCs and LAQCs to transition their business structure into a partnership, limited partnership or sole trader, with no tax cost. This transition will require the setting up of the alternative business structure, and the transfer of assets, liabilities, legal titles and so forth from the QC to the chosen structure. These changes will be completed under the relevant general tax rules; they are not dealt with in the transitional rules, which are concerned solely with tax matters arising from, during or after the transfer. The transitional rules are deliberately outcome focused. The exact process each QC will need to complete in order to transition will vary according to its existing structures and governance. Any interim measures necessary to transition will generally be ignored, as long as the new business structure is in place by the end of the chosen transitional year. - 5 - All of the necessary transfers of assets and liabilities, plus all other legal documentation necessary in the new business structure must be completed by that date. However the tax treatment of the new business structure (that is a partnership or sole tradership) will be applied from the start of the transitional year. This effectively provides a QC or LAQC with up to 12 months to reconstitute its business structure. Transitioning to the LTC rules All the shareholders of the existing QC or LAQC must complete the LTC election within six months of the start of the transitional income year. Making the LTC election revokes the previous QC and LAQC elections with effect for, and from the beginning of that transitional income year. When an existing company becomes an LTC its owners are usually treated as having an amount of taxable income equal to their proportion of the amount of the company’s reserves that would be taxable if the company were to be liquidated and its assets distributed. However, under the transitional provision no income amount will arise, and so no tax will be paid by owners when an existing QC or LAQC transitions to become an LTC. The carried forward loss balance of a QC, and any controlled foreign company (CFC) or foreign investment fund (FIF) losses carried forward by an LAQC, may be used by the owners of the LTC in future years against their share of net income from that LTC. For CFC or FIF losses carried forward, the normal country ring-fencing rules in subpart IQ will apply too. The LTC loss limitation rules do not affect an owner’s claim to these brought-forward losses. For the purposes of the LTC loss limitation rules, there are two options for determining an owner’s basis: • the market value or the accounting book value of the amounts used to determine a owner’s basis for the loss limitation rules. These values should be taken at the last day of the transitional year; and • the historic basis, as if the LTC rules had always applied and the LTC had always existed. If the application of the loss limitation rules calculates an owner’s basis at less than zero, the owner’s basis is treated as zero. Transition to a partnership or limited partnership Existing QCs and LAQCs may transition to become a partnership or a limited partnership during their transitional year under the “QCP transitional process”. This means that during the transitional year, the QC or LAQC must notify Inland Revenue that it intends to become a partnership or limited partnership under the QCP - 6 - transitional process. Notification should be made within six months of the start of the transitional year. This notification will revoke its QC status from the start of that transitional year. The partners of the partnership that emerges following the transition should be the same as the shareholders of the QC. One exception to this is a limited partnership, when a company may be used as the general partner with the shareholders of the QC being the limited partners. Each partner should have the same relative interests in the partnership as in the QC. If several QCs transition into one partnership it is the net position of the partners following transition that should be compared. The carried forward loss balance of a QC, and any CFC or FIF losses carried forward by a LAQC, may be used by the partners of the partnership in future years, against their share of net income from that partnership. In the case of CFC or FIF losses carried forward, the normal country ring-fencing rules in subpart IQ will also apply. The limited partnership loss limitation rules do not affect a limited partner’s claim to these brought-forward losses. For the purposes of the limited partnership loss limitation rules, there are two options for determining the partners’ basis of a limited partnership:  the market value or the accounting book value of the amounts used to determine a member’s basis for the loss limitation rules. The values are taken at the last day of the transitional year; and  the historic basis, as if the limited partnership rules had always applied and the limited partnership had always existed. If the application of the loss limitation rules calculates a partner’s basis as less than zero, the partner’s basis is treated as zero. Example 1: Transition into partnership Mr A and Mr B each own 50% of AB Ltd, an LAQC with net assets of $3,000. Mr X and Mr Y each own 50% of XY Ltd, a QC with net assets of $12,000. They form a new limited partnership which has partnership net assets of $15,000. Each individual is a limited partner and Alphabet Ltd is incorporated to become the general partner. Mr A and Mr B will each hold a 10% partnership share ($1,500 of the partnership’s assets). Mr X and Mr Y will each hold a 40% partnership share ($6,000 of the partnership’s assets). Alphabet Ltd is the general partner, but holds no partnership share. - 7 - Transition to sole trader Existing QCs and LAQCs with only one natural person shareholder may transition to become a sole tradership during their transitional year under the “QCST transitional process”. This means that during the transitional year, the owner of the QC or LAQC must notify the Commissioner that he or she intends to operate as a sole trader, and transition the business under the QCST transitional process. Notification should be made within six months of the start of the transitional year. This notification will also revoke the company’s QC status from the start of that transitional year. The carried forward loss balance of a QC, and any CFC or FIF losses carried forward by an LAQC, may be used by the sole trader in future years. In the case of CFC or FIF losses carried forward, the normal country ring-fencing rules in subpart IQ will apply. Tax outcomes of completing the QCP or QCST transitional process As long as the QCP or QCST transitional process is completed by the end of the chosen transitional year any income and expenses during the transitional year will be treated as arising to the partnership or the sole trader from the start of the transitional year, even if, as a matter of fact, they actually arose during a part of the transitional year when the business was still in a corporate form. If the QCP or QCST transitional process is not completed by the end of the transitional year the company will be taxed as an ordinary company for that year, as its QC status has been revoked. There may also be tax consequences from the parts of the incomplete transition that have already been carried out. Under the QCP and QCST transitional process there is no tax cost arising from the transfer of assets, liabilities and any relevant rights and obligations from the QC to the partnership or sole trader. The historical tax position of the QC instead transfers to the partnership or sole trader; this means any future adjustments to income or deductions relating to the QC period will be dealt with through the partnership or the sole trader. The memorandum account balances and other related tax accounts (such as ASC) for a company that was a QC or LAQC before the transition are extinguished. The company effectively becomes a “shell” company, and may be liquidated or written off the Company Register.
Page 1 10 August 2010 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Further proposed changes to the Goods and Service Act 1985 to help businesses transition to the new GST rate The Government has announced that it intends to include a number of amendments to the Goods and Services Act 1985 by way of a supplementary order paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The Government has also released a draft of the legislative amendments for public comment (available on request from Inland Revenue (04 890 6386) and the Minister of Revenue’s office (04 817 9728). Feedback on that draft is sought by 16 August 2010. This paper provides background and further explanation on the changes. Annual contracts involving successive supplies Many contracts, particularly in the general and health insurance area, are for a period of one year or are at least reviewed annually. In some cases the customer pays the premium in one payment while in other cases the premiums are paid progressively, say by monthly instalment. Most of these arrangements will straddle the GST rate change date of 1 October 2010 so that, in the absence of legislative change, some instalments will be at the new GST rate and some at the old. Businesses may be able to seek additional payment from customers to cover the additional GST, but in many cases the compliance cost to them of doing so is excessive relative to the amounts of GST involved. For example, there will be individual cases when the additional costs of collecting the additional GST exceed the additional GST because the contract has very little time to run. The proposed amendment would allow insurers and others the option of applying the 12.5% rate for the rest of the insured period up to the next annual review date (or less if the contract is for a lesser period) provided certain criteria are satisfied. The key criteria are that all the remaining GST is accounted for in the return period ending before 1 October 2010 and GST- registered recipients only claim back GST at the 12.5% rate. This would be achieved by treating the remaining supplies to have been made on 30 September 2010. In the event that an insurance policy or other contract subject to the transitional rule is cancelled and, therefore the supply is not fully provided, businesses would need to issue credit notes to adjust for the change in consideration and the GST incorrectly paid. A business would elect this option by making a tax return on this basis. Page 2 Example A policy for car insurance covers the period 28 April 2010 to 27 April 2011 and the customer chooses to pay by monthly instalments. The insurer normally pays GST when instalments are due or received but elects to apply the transitional rule and returns the remaining GST at 12.5% in its September GST return. Subrogation payments A subrogation payment is the recovery income received by an insurer for the damages caused by a third party to their insured party. The GST Act deems the time of supply to be the day on which the insurer receives the payment. This means subrogation payments received on or after 1 October 2010 will be subject to the new 15% GST rate, even when the underlying claim to which the payment relates was at 12.5%. The proposed change would allow the rate of GST to remain at 12.5% for subrogation payments received on or after 1 October 2010 provided the underlying claims are agreed and settled before 1 October 2010. Finance leases In agreements to hire that are finance leases, GST is applied to the supply of the good in question (a motor vehicle, for example) but not to the finance component of the transaction as financial services are GST-exempt. In finance leases the interest and principal components are calculated actuarially but to ease compliance GST payments are able to be based on a straight-line approach over the term of the lease. This means that more GST is payable on the earlier lease payments than is actually required. A square-up adjustment is normally only done when the lease terminates, to reflect any difference between the actual and expected residual value of the leased asset. With a rate change occurring during the contract term, the new rate would apply to the remaining payments under the finance lease contract. The subsequent reconciliation that would have to be undertaken on these existing contracts becomes complex and substantial systems changes would be required to accommodate it. Most contracts are with GST- registered businesses who would be able to claim back the GST anyway. The proposed change would allow finance leases entered into before 1 October 2010 for a maximum term of five years to continue to be able to be accounted for at the 12.5% rate, provided GST-registered lessees were advised by the lessors to deduct input tax at the 12.5% rate on payments made after 1 October 2010. This solution would be elective, at the option of the supplier. Aligning legislation and practice There are several instances where further legislative flexibility is needed so that GST practices adopted through systems or other commercial imperatives are not unduly affected by the rate increase. Page 3 The issuing of tax invoices for pre-October supplies The first issue relates to goods or services that are supplied on or before 30 September 2010 but for which the invoice is not issued until early October even though dated before 1 October 2010. Under the GST Act, it is the date when the invoice is issued that is relevant for determining the time of the supply, so these invoices could technically be considered subject to the higher rate even though the goods or services are provided, and the invoice dated, when the rate was 12.5%. Accordingly, for the GST rate transition, the proposal is that suppliers may treat tax invoices issued on or before 11 October 2010 for goods or services provided on or before 30 September 2010 as having been issued on the date of the invoice. This is provided that the invoice is dated on or before 30 September and payment is due no later than 60 days from the invoice date. A cut-off date of 11 October has been chosen to provide two weekends to send out invoices in relation to September supplies. Option of general time of supply or successive supplies rule The second instance arises because some suppliers of what are arguably successive supplies (for example, utilities and phone line rentals) account for GST on the basis of when the invoice is issued rather than when payment is due or received. Technically, the GST rate on a successive supply should be determined by when the payment is due or received rather than when the invoice is issued. Under normal circumstances this makes no difference but with a rate change some suppliers are uncertain about whether a September invoice, for example, would need to be charged at 12.5% or at 15% as this could be dependent on whether the customer paid or was required to pay before 1 October. To address this, it is proposed that for successive supplies, suppliers have the choice of using either the invoice or the “payment due or received” rule provided, as with the previous issue, that the goods or services are provided before 1 October 2010, the invoice for the supply is dated on or before 30 September 2010, the invoice is issued by 11 October 2010 and payment is due not later than 60 days from the invoice date. Replacement invoices The third issue concerns the use of replacement tax invoices. Legally, a supplier cannot issue two tax invoices for the same supply and should be instead issuing credit or debit notes when, for example, goods are returned or additional GST is due as a result of the GST rate increase. Although longer-term this issue needs to be considered in a wider review, in the interim the proposal is that for the GST rate transition period: • As an alternative to issuing a debit note, replacement tax invoices could be issued to replace pre-1 October 2010 invoices for supplies that are being provided successively, to cover the amended GST payable on the remaining services provided from 1 October. • Since in some cases a replacement invoice would alter the time of supply and hence the applicable GST rate, there would be an option of allowing the issue of a new invoice at the previous GST rate of 12.5% if it relates to revising an invoice issued before 1 October 2010, as an alternative to issuing a credit note. Page 4 Layby sales For GST purposes, a layby sale is only recognised as taking place when the goods are delivered, which is normally after the last instalment payment. Goods uplifted after 30 September will, therefore, attract the new 15% GST rate. Although paying all of the lay- by instalments and collecting the layby item before 1 October would preserve the old 12.5% GST rate, this will not always be possible because of the costs involved or the goods simply not being able to be delivered before that date. An amendment is proposed for layby sales contracts that span the GST rate change date and for which a binding contract was in place before Budget night (20 May 2010). The proposal would allow suppliers to elect to apply the old 12.5% GST rate to the extent that any payments in relation to the transaction were received before 1 October 2010. Under this option, the supplier would be required to return these payments in their September 2010 GST return as there would be a deemed supply to the extent of these payments. This would be in effect an apportionment rule, with payments made from 1 October 2010 being at 15%. Private Training Establishments Private Training Establishments (PTEs) are registered with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and are required to use a trust arrangement when students pay their course fees in full. This is to help protect students from the risk that their intended course provider does not deliver the course. As the courses are delivered, the trustee progressively pays out the funds to the PTE. In the absence of any law change, any payments released by the trust to the PTE after 1 October 2010 would be accounted for at the new 15% rate even when students have paid the full course fees before 1 October 2010. This is because the services are considered to be supplied when the payments are released to the relevant PTEs. It would be impractical for the PTEs to seek additional payments from the students. Accordingly, it is proposed to allow registered private training establishments the option of making an up-front adjustment in their 30 September GST returns that would give them a credit to cover the additional GST that would be payable when course fees held in trust as at 30 September 2010 were subsequently released to them. This would apply irrespective of whether the PTE returned GST on an invoice, hybrid or payments basis. The credit would be based on the amount held in trust for the PTE as at 30 September 2010. Application date These changes would apply from Royal assent.
\- 1 - 23 December 2010 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue New look-through company rules This special report provides early information on the new rules for look-through companies, which were part of recently enacted legislation in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. This Act amended the Income Tax Act 2007, with minor or consequential changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. This special report precedes coverage of the new legislation that will appear in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published early next year. The relevant changes introduced in the Act: • provide transparent income tax treatment for electing closely held companies, which will be known as look-through companies (LTCs); • allow existing qualifying companies (QCs) and loss-attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) to continue to use the current QC rules without the ability to attribute losses, pending a review of the dividend rules for closely held companies; and • allow existing QCs and LAQCs to transition into the new LTC rules or change to another business vehicle such as a partnership, without a tax cost during the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2013. This report provides guidance on the new look-through company (LTC) rules. A separate special report contains guidance on the changes to the qualifying company rules, and the various transition options available to existing QC and LAQCs. Further detailed guidance on the look-through company rules will be available over the coming months on Inland Revenue’s website and in a Tax Information Bulletin. Background As part of Budget 2010 the Government announced reforms to the tax rules for qualifying companies. Feedback on the proposals was sought in the officials’ issues paper, Qualifying companies: implementation of flow-through tax treatment published the day after the Budget announcement. - 2 - Following this consultation it was decided to introduce new rules from 1 April 2011, providing look-through income tax treatment for electing closely held companies. Under the look-through rules, the company’s tax treatment is integrated with the tax treatment of the owners, on the basis that entities are agents for their owners. It ensures that shareholders who use a company’s losses also pay tax on any company profit at their marginal tax rate. This removes the tax disincentive faced by the owners of closely held businesses who wish to operate through a company. They can attain the benefits of limited liability afforded by a familiar corporate form, as well as the ability to be taxed at the level of the owner. An early draft of this legislation was made available for public comment on 15 October 2010, accompanied by an explanatory note. The final legislation, which was enacted on 20 December 2010, is different from the earlier draft, reflecting feedback received during consultation. Some of these changes are fairly substantial while others are more technical in nature. The earlier draft legislation and explanatory note have therefore been superseded by the enacted rules and should not be relied upon. Key features Look-through company rules The new LTC rules are available for income years starting on or after 1 April 2011. The rules apply only to companies which are resident in New Zealand. The main features of the new rules are: • An LTC must have five or fewer owners (the ownership interests of relatives are combined). • All owners must elect for the LTC rules to apply initially. LTC elections are to be made prospectively. • Once a company becomes an LTC it will remain so unless one of the owners decides to revoke the LTC election, or the company ceases to be eligible. • Only a natural person, trustee or another LTC may hold shares in an LTC. All the company’s shares must be of the same class and provide the same rights and obligations to each shareholder. • An LTC’s income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are passed on to its owners. These items will generally be allocated to owners in proportion to the number of shares they have in the LTC. Owners are also able to deduct expenditure incurred by the LTC before they became a member, subject to the other deductibility tests in the Act. • Any profit is taxed at the owner’s marginal tax rate. The owner can use any losses against their other income, subject to the loss limitation rule. - 3 - • The loss limitation rule ensures that the losses claimed reflect the level of an owners’ economic loss in the LTC. An anti-avoidance rule also prevents an artificially high basis around the year-end being used to increase any loss flow- through. Owners’ excess losses are carried forward to future income years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. There are certain rules about the use of these losses if the LTC ceases to be an LTC, or if the owner sells their shares. • When owners sell their shares they are treated as disposing of their share of the underlying LTC property. Owners may have to pay any tax associated with the deemed disposal of this property. Exiting owners are generally required to account for tax on disposing of their shares in the LTC only if the amount of the disposal proceeds derived from their LTC interest exceeds the total net tax book value of their share of LTC property by more than $50,000. • Even if this $50,000 threshold is exceeded, exiting owners will not have to account for tax on things such as trading stock in certain circumstances. When exiting owners account for tax on their share, incoming owners must take on a cost basis in the LTCs assets and liabilities that is equal to the deemed disposal under the disposal provisions. • The disposal thresholds do not apply if the company is liquidated, or ceases to use the LTC rules but otherwise continues in business. In these situations, the owner is deemed to have disposed of their shares at market value on the date of exit. • Look-through treatment applies for income tax purposes only. An LTC retains its corporate obligations and benefits, such as limited liability, under general company law. • An LTC is still recognised separately from its shareholders for certain other tax purposes, including GST, PAYE and certain administrative or other withholding tax purposes under the Income Tax Act. Application dates The application date for both the LTC rules and the qualifying company reforms is the income year starting on or after 1 April 2011. For companies with an early balance date – for example, a company with a balance date of 31 December, this means that they can start using the LTC rules from their income year from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012. For companies with a late balance date – for example, a company with a balance date of 31 May, this means they can start using the LTC rules from their income year from 1 June 2011 to 31 May 2012. The LTC election filing rules can be applied from the date of Royal assent. LTC election forms will be available early next year from Inland Revenue. In the interim companies can make an LTC election by writing to Inland Revenue with details of the company and its shareholder, and with signed shareholder elections. The company - 4 - director or agent must confirm these elections are complete. Details of the relevant associations between shareholders should also be provided. Detailed analysis Legislative structure New subpart HB of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains the main LTC rules. It introduces the principle that LTCs are transparent for income tax purposes, and contains the LTC election requirements and rules on the tax treatment following an owner’s disposal of interests in an LTC. Section YA 1 introduces several defined terms, including “LTC”, “owner’s interest”, “look-through interest” and “working owner”. Amendments have been made to income and deduction provisions and, in particular, to sections CB 32B and 32C, CX 63, DV 22 and GB 25B, as well consequential changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Definition of “look-through company” Sections HB 1(1), HB 13(4) and YA 1 A company that elects to use the LTC rules must be a company (that is a body corporate or entity with a legal existence separate from that of its members) that is resident in New Zealand under domestic law and under any relevant double tax agreement. The company residence rules in section YD 2 apply for these purposes; in other words, it is the residence of the company and not its shareholders that is determinative. A company using the LTC rules must have only one class of shares. All the shares must have the same rights to vote concerning company distributions, the company constitution, capital variation and director appointments, and to receive distributions of profits and net assets. This requirement prevents streaming of income or deductions under the LTC rules. The shareholders of a company using the LTC rules must be either natural persons or corporate trustees. An ordinary company cannot hold shares in an LTC. An LTC may be the “parent” of another LTC. The sub-LTC’s income and expenses will ultimately be attributed to the owners of the parent LTC, and these owners are included in the look-through counted owner test. An LTC must have five or fewer “look-through counted owners”. To become an LTC, a company must meet all the eligibility criteria and must continue to meet it for the whole of the income year. If an LTC breaches the eligibility criteria its LTC status is lost from the first day of the income year in which the breach occurs. It cannot then use the LTC rules in the year in which the breach occurs or either of the following two income years. - 5 - A company that has elected to use the LTC rules is thereafter excluded from the definition of “company” in the Income Tax Act. This means that most of the rules that apply to companies, such as the requirement to keep memorandum accounts and the rules governing payments of dividends, do not apply to LTCs. However, for the following provisions there is no look-through treatment and the company rather than the owners is the relevant entity:  PAYE  FBT  RWT  NRWT  ESCT  RSCT  Subpart FO (Amalgamation of companies). The “look-through counted owners” test Section YA 1 An LTC must have five or fewer “look-through counted owners”. This term applies for this count test only, and although related to shareholdings it is not always transposable with the term “owner” or “shareholder”, such as when an LTC is the parent company of another LTC. For many LTCs it will be clear that they meet the count test – for example, if the company has only three individual shareholders it clearly has fewer than five shareholders and so fewer than five “look-through counted owners”. However, for companies that have more than five individual shareholders, or that include trustees, the look-through counted owner test needs to be considered. The look-through counted owner test determines the number of look-through owners the company has for the purposes of the LTC rules by identifying the relationships between individual shareholders. Shareholders related by blood relationships (second degree), marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, or adoption are counted as a single “owner” for the purposes of this test. The relationship between a step-parent and a step-child is a second-degree relationship. Death or dissolution of marriage between the shareholders does not break the two- degree test, provided the company was an LTC and the shareholders were counted as “one” before the event. - 6 - The look-through counted owner test must also be applied if a trustee holds shares in an LTC. Here the test will “look through” to the natural person beneficiaries of the trust (which includes looking through any corporate beneficiaries to its natural person shareholders), if those beneficiaries are allocated income from the LTC as beneficiary income in that income year, or in any of the three preceding income years. The trustees of a trust are counted as one look-through counted owner for an income year if any income the trust was allocated from the LTC in that income year, and in each of the preceding three income years, was retained by the trust and not paid out as beneficiary income. Example 1: Natural person shareholders Zeb m Esther John m Olivia Benjamin Mary m Jones (stepfather of Curtis) Curtis In the example above, if Zebulon, Esther, Benjamin, Mary, Jones and Curtis all held shares in a company they would be counted as a single look-through counted owner because they are related to each other (via Mary) within two degrees. If only Jones, Esther and Curtis held shares they would be counted as two look- through counted owners because although Jones, as his stepfather, is related to Curtis within two degrees, neither of them are related to Esther within two degrees, as she is Curtis’s great grandmother and Jones’s grandmother-in-law. - 7 - If a company (including a qualifying company) is the beneficiary of a trust and has received income from the LTC as beneficiary income in that income year, or in any of the three preceding income years, then the company itself is not regarded as a look- through counted owner. Instead the test counts all natural persons who have a voting interest in relation to that company, whether directly or otherwise. Example 2: Trustee shareholder All the shares in Mountain Design Ltd, an LTC, are held by Walton Trust. Walton Trust is managed by a corporate trustee. It distributes all of the income from Mountain Design Ltd to the following beneficiaries: 20X1, 20X2 and 20X3 Cora and Emily 20X4 Elizabeth, Emily and Mamie (Emily’s sister) 20X5 Rosemary, Erin and Aimee (Cora’s daughter) In 20X1, 20X2 and 20X3 there are two look through counted owners as between them Cora and Emily derived all of the LTC’s income as beneficiary income. In 20X4 there are only three look-through counted owners, Cora, Elizabeth and Emily/Mamie. Because Mamie is Emily’s sister (a two degree blood relative) they are counted as one owner. In 20X5 there are five look-through counted owners, because the test considers who received beneficiary income in the current income year (20X5), and any of the three preceding income years (20X2, 20X3 and 20X4). The look-through counted owners are:  Cora/Aimee (counted as one)  Elizabeth  Mamie/Emily (counted as one)  Rosemary  Erin - 8 - Look-through company elections Sections HB 1 and HB 13 The LTC regime is elective. A company can only use the LTC rules if it continuously meets all the eligibility criteria, and has filed a valid election with Inland Revenue. Making an election All owners must sign an LTC election in order for a company to first become an LTC. A guardian or legal representative must sign for owners aged under 18, or any other owner without legal capacity. The director or other authorised company agent should send the election form to the Inland Revenue, and confirm that all the shareholders have signed it. The LTC election must be received by Inland Revenue before the start of the income year in which the company wishes to be an LTC. Elections relate to the income year of the company electing to become an LTC; therefore the due date for the election depends upon its balance date. Newly incorporated or non-active companies must file the LTC election by the date for filing their first income tax return. If an LTC election is received after the start of the year to which it was intended to apply, or if it is discovered to be invalid because, for example, not all the shareholders signed the election, it may still be accepted as a valid election. The Commissioner’s discretion will be exercised only if exceptional circumstances, such as a severe illness, caused the omission or lateness, and if any omission in the election is rectified in that income year. A company will remain an LTC without any further LTC election. It will cease to be an LTC only if it breaches the eligibility criteria, or the LTC election is revoked. Revoking an election Any owner may revoke the LTC election. It does not matter whether they were one of the initial owners who signed the election or not. The revocation notice must be received by Inland Revenue before the start of the income year to which it applies. A copy should be sent to the director of the LTC, to ensure that all owners are aware of the change in status. If a revocation notice is received after the start of the income year to which it relates, the Commissioner may still accept it, if it was late due to exceptional circumstances. A revocation may be ignored if the owner issuing the revocation notice disposes of all their interests in the LTC, and the person(s) who acquire these interests advise Inland Revenue before the start of the relevant income year that the previous owner’s revocation notice is to be reversed. - 9 - To protect the integrity of the new rules, if an owner revokes the LTC election the company cannot use the LTC rules in the year for which the revocation is made, or in either of the following two income years. Becoming a look-through company Sections CB 32C and HB 3 Any loss balance of a company from income years prior to becoming an LTC is cancelled when it becomes an LTC. If a company becomes an LTC after its first year of trading, its reserves are regarded as held by the owners in proportion to their look-through interest. So when a company first becomes an LTC, each owner will be deemed to have an amount of income arising on the first day of the income year the company becomes an LTC. This is necessary because under the LTC rules these reserves may be distributed or drawn down upon without the owners being subject to tax upon distribution; this treatment is not intended to apply to previously accumulated company reserves. Similar rules apply if a company that is not an LTC amalgamates with an LTC. The amount of each owner’s income is equal to their proportion (based on look- through counted interests) of the amount of the company’s reserves that would be taxable if the company was liquidated and assets distributed to shareholders. The formula to determine the amount of these reserves, which applied to the company immediately before it became an LTC, is: ( a + c – b - c ) - e d Where: a is the amount that would be taxable dividends of the company on distribution following a deemed winding up. b is the assessable income, less allowable deductions, that would be derived by the company on a deemed winding up. This includes items such as depreciation recovered, bad debts and loss on sale of assets. c is balances on the company’s ICA and FDP account immediately before becoming an LTC, plus any unpaid income tax for earlier years, less any income tax refunds due from these earlier years. d is the company tax rate in the income year before the income year in which the company becomes an LTC. e is the exit dividends that, if the company had previously been an LTC and is now re-entering the LTC rules, would be attributed to any retained reserves from the previous LTC period that have not since been distributed. - 10 - Each owner is subject to tax on their proportion of these reserves, which are regarded as an income amount to them. This income amount is deemed to arise to owners in the income year the company becomes an LTC, and each owner pays income tax on the amount at their personal tax rate. Slightly different rules apply to existing QCs or LAQCs who choose to transition to the LTC rules in either the first or second income year that starts on or after 1 April 2011. Please refer to the special report on the qualifying company changes for more details. Ceasing to be a look-through company Sections CD 43 and CX 63 If a company ceases to be an LTC but continues in existence, it will be taxed as an ordinary company. Any retained revenue profits held by the company would have been previously allocated to owners who would have been subject to tax on this income in the year the income was derived. To prevent any double taxation of this income, dividends paid by the company in income years after it ceases to be an LTC will be regarded as paid firstly from this retained revenue profit until an amount of dividends equal to the amount of retained profit has been paid. This applies whether the dividends are paid to the same shareholders as held shares while the company was an LTC or to new shareholders. Dividends regarded as paid from this retained revenue profit are excluded income in the hands of the shareholder recipients. The available subscribed capital formula is adjusted to reflect capital distributions made while the company is an LTC, so taking into account both equity subscriptions and returns on that equity. A look-through company is transparent Sections CB 32B, DV 22, GB 23(2), GB 25B, GB 29, HB 1(4)–(5) and HB 2 With some exceptions, for the purpose of the Income Tax Act, owners are generally treated as carrying on activities and having the status, intention and purpose of the LTC. And the LTC is treated as not carrying on these activities or having such an intention or purpose. The exceptions to look-through include for the purposes of the: PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the RWT and NRWT rules, the ESCT rules, the RSCT rules and subpart FO (which deals with the amalgamation of companies). Generally though, LTCs are transparent for income tax purposes. Owners are treated as holding property in proportion to their effective look-through interest, and as parties to an arrangement, and doing or being entitled to a thing, through their capacity as owner, unless the context requires otherwise. An owner’s effective look-through interest in an LTC is measured by the percentage of decision-making rights carried by their shares in the company in relation to - 11 - dividends or other distributions, the company constitution, variation of the company’s capital and director appointments or elections. Methods for allocation of income and deductions Income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses are passed through to owners. These items are generally allocated in accordance with an owners’ effective look- through interest in the company, and will usually be allocated according to their average yearly interests, as if each item occurred uniformly throughout the year. If the voting interest or market value interest varies during the year, owners may use the weighted average basis to determine their effective look-through interest, as shown in Example 3a. When the company has a market value circumstance in the year, the owner’s effective look-through interest is calculated as the average of their voting interest and the market value interest in the company for the income year. - 12 - Example 3a: Income and deduction allocation – average yearly interests Walnut Ltd is an LTC with a standard balance date. For the first nine months of the year Charles holds 60% of the shares, and his wife Caroline holds 40%. On 31 December Caroline sells all her shares to Laura. Caroline and Laura have been shareholders for nine months (275 days) and three months (90 days) respectively. Walnut Ltd’s income statement for the year shows: $ Trading income 500,000 Allowable expenses (300,000) 200,000 Gross interest 10,000 RWT (28%) (2,800) The income and deductions are regarded as accruing evenly throughout the year, and are allocated to each shareholder based on their yearly average as follows: Charles’s allocation is determined as: $ Trading income 0.6 x 500,000 300,000 Allowable expenses 0.6 x 300,000 (180,000) 120,000 Gross interest 0.6 x 10,000 6,000 RWT (28%) (1,680) Caroline’s allocation is determined as: $ Trading income (275/365) x 0.4 x 500,000 150,000 Allowable expenses (275/365) x 0.4 x 300,000 (90,000) 60,000 Gross interest (275/365) x 0.4 x 10,000 3,000 RWT (28%) (840) Laura’s allocation is determined as follows: $ Trading income (90/365) x 0.4 x 500,000 50,000 Allowable expenses (90/365) x 0.4 x 300,000 (30,000) 20,000 Gross interest (90/365) x 0.4 x 10,000 1,000 RWT (28%) (280) - 13 - Alternatively, if the voting interest or market value interest varies during the year owners can use their actual look-through interest in each period during the income year. This is applied to the income, expenses and other flow-through items from each period, and then added together. This requires accurate accrual accounts to be prepared for each period of ownership within the income year. The Commissioner may require the LTC to use this accounts method if its assessable income in a 12-month period is $3 million or more, and if the Commissioner considers that the accounts method will result in a more equitable and reasonable measure of effective look-through interest in an income year. Excessive effective look-through interests The Commissioner may adjust the effective look-through interests of owners and consequently the income and deduction allocation if he considers that the current application provides excessive income allocations to an owner aged under 20. Example 3b: Income and deduction allocation – accounts method If, in example 3a, Walnut Ltd had drawn up a full accounts and a profit and loss statement for the period before and after Caroline disposed of her shares it would have shown shown: 1 Apr to 31 Dec 1 Jan to 31 Mar Annual $ $ $ Trading income 100,000 400,000 500, 000 Allowable expenses (100,000) (200,000) (300,000) Nil 200,000 200,000 Gross interest 7,500 2,500 10,000 Charles’s allocation for the year is the same as in example 3a. Caroline’s allocation for the 1 Apr to 31 Dec period is determined as: Trading income 0.4 x 100,000 40,000 Allowable expenses 0.4 x 100,000 (40,000) Nil Gross interest 0.4 x 7,500 3,000 RWT (28%) (840) Laura’s allocation for the 1 Jan to 31 Mar period is determined as: Trading income 0.4 x 400,000 160,000 Allowable expenses 0.4 x 200,000 (80,000) 80,000 Gross interest 0.4 x 2,500 1,000 RWT (28%) (280) - 14 - This is an anti-avoidance provision, and aims to prevent income being unduly diverted to owners under the age of 20. It applies when two or more owners of an LTC are relatives, and one of them is under 20 years. In reallocating income and deductions for an income year, the Commissioner will consider the value of the contributions by way of service or capital rendered by the owner aged under 20, together with any other relevant matters. Excessive remuneration to relatives The Commissioner may adjust the allocation of income and deductions from the LTC to its owners if the LTC employs a relative of the owner, and the Commissioner considers that the remuneration paid to the relative for their services is excessive. This is an anti-avoidance provision, to prevent income being unduly diverted to an owner’s relatives. In reallocating income and deductions for an income year, the Commissioner will consider the nature and extent of services rendered by the relative, and any other relevant matters. This provision does not apply if the relative is aged over 20 at the date of entering into a written contact of employment with the LTC, providing they have real control over the income paid to them under the contract. Income from personal services For the purposes of applying the attribution rule for income from personal services, (section GB 27) an LTC is treated as the associated entity, and is not treated as transparent. - 15 - Loss limitation Sections HB 11 and HB 12 New section HB 11 ensures that owners’ deductions are restricted if the amount of the deductions exceeds the adjusted tax book value of their investment in the LTC (the “owner’s basis”). In that event, the deductions an owner can claim are limited to an amount equal to their owner’s basis. This is an anti-avoidance provision; it will generally only apply if a company’s tax losses are not matched by the owner’s contributions. The rule aims to ensure that owners can offset tax losses only to the extent these reflect their economic losses. This reflects the fact that owners of a company enjoy limited liability under the corporate veil. The owner’s basis is calculated for each owner using the following formula: investments – distributions + income – deductions – disallowed amounts Where: investments is the sum of the equity, goods or assets introduced or services provided to the LTC, or any amounts paid by the owner on behalf of the LTC. This includes any loans, including shareholder current account credit balances, made by the owner to the LTC and their share of any LTC debt which they, or their associate, have guaranteed (or provided indemnities for). distributions is anything paid out to the owner by the LTC, including dividends and loans, including shareholder current account debit balances. It does not include any salary or wages received by a working owner. income is the owner’s share of the LTC’s income (including exempt and excluded income) and capital gains from the current and any preceding tax years (in which the company was an LTC). deductions is the owner’s share of the LTC’s deductions and capital losses in the preceding tax years (in which the company was an LTC). disallowed is the amount of investments made by an owner within 60 days of the amount last day of the LTC’s income year if these are distributed or reduced within 60 days after the last day of the income year. This is to prevent the creation of an artificially high basis around the end of the year. To allow for normal operational cash-flow, if the reduction of investments within 60 days of the balance sheet date is less than $10,000, it may be ignored. - 16 - \* The special report published on 23/12/10 showed an incorrect amount in this cell. Correction made on 19/01/11. Example 4: Loss limitation Oleson Ltd, an LTC starts to operate a plant hire business in 20X1. It has three owners, Eleanor, William and Harriet, with shareholdings of 20%, 30% and 50% respectively. Oleson Ltd is given a non-repayable business grant by a local entrepreneurial fund of $50,000. Its owners contribute a further $100,000, each contributing in proportion to their shareholding. Oleson Ltd also has a $100,000 interest-only loan from the bank, which Harriet has personally secured by guarantee against her residential property. Plant $250,000 Shareholder capital $100,000 Entrepreneur grant $50,000 Bank loan $100,000 The plant is depreciable at 20% pa – $50,000. Repair and maintenance costs are $20,000 pa. Interest costs are $10,000 pa (10% interest rate pa). The plant produces hire income of $60,000 pa. Oleson Ltd pays total dividends of $30,000 each year. For the first five years of trading Oleson Ltd’s accounts will show: $ Income 60,000 Repairs (20,000) Interest (10,000) Depreciation (50,000) Net loss (20,000) The owner’s basis (there are no disallowed amounts in this example) determines the amount of their share of the $80,000 deductions that each owner can claim as follows: $ Investment DistributionIncome Prior year deductions Owner’s basis Current year deductions allowed: Restricted deductions c/f 20X1 Eleanor 20,000 6,000 12,000 0 26,000 16,000 0 William 30,000 9,000 18,000 0 39,000 24,000 0 Harriet 150,000 15,000 30,000 0 165,000 40,000 0 20X2 Eleanor 20,000 12,000 24,000 16,000 16,000 16,000 0 William 30,000 18,000 36,000 24,000 24,000 24,000 0 Harriet 150,000 30,000 60,000 40,000 140,000 40,000 0 20X3 Eleanor 20,000 18,000 36,000 32,000 6,000 6,000 10,000 William 30,000 27,000 54,000 48,000 9,000 9,000 15,000 Harriet 150,000 45,000 90,000 80,000 115,000 40,000 0 20X4 Eleanor 20,000 24,000 48,000 38,000 6,000 6,000 20,000 William 30,000 36,000 72,000 57,000 9,000 9,000 30,000 Harriet 150,000 60,000 120,000 120,000 90,000 40,000 0 20X5 Eleanor 20,000 30,000 60,000 44,000 6,000 6,000 30,000 William 30,000 45,000 90,000 66,000 9,000 9,000 45,000\* Harriet 150,000 75,000 150,000 160,000 65,000 40,000 0 - 17 - Any deductions that an owner does not claim in an income year due to the operation of the loss limitation rule are carried forward and may be claimed in future years, subject to the application of the loss limitation rule in those years. If the company ceases to be an LTC but continues in business as an ordinary company, the owner may use any “restricted deductions” against any future dividends he or she receives from the company. If the owner ceases to hold shares in the company and so ceases to have an effective look-through interest in the LTC, the “restricted deductions” cannot be used unless the owner later reacquires shares in the same company. Disposal of look-through interests Sections FB 1(3), FB 10B, FC 1(2), HB 4 to HB 10 Disposal of shares is disposal of underlying LTC property The owners of an LTC are treated as holding LTC property directly, in proportion to their effective look-through interest. When owners sell their shares in the LTC they are treated as disposing of their share of the underlying LTC property, and will bear any tax consequences associated with the disposal. However, sections HB 5 to HB 10 remove the requirement for the owner selling the shares (the “exiting owner”) to account for tax on this disposal of underlying property when the tax adjustment that would otherwise be required is below certain thresholds. When a look-through interest is transferred as part of a settlement of relationship property, and the rules in subpart FB apply, there is no disposal of shares under the LTC rules. Instead, the transferee is treated as having acquired the look-through interests on the date they were acquired by the transferor, and will take on the transferor’s cost basis. This only applies in relation to the disposal provisions. For the purposes of allocating an LTC’s income or deductions in the year of transfer, the weighted average basis or the accounts method discussed above will apply to the transferor and transferee’s periods of actual ownership in the year. Deemed disposal of underlying LTC property If the company ceases to use the LTC rules, but the company otherwise continues, the owner is deemed to have disposed of the underlying property at market value on the date of exit. The company is deemed to have immediately reacquired the property at the same market value. For the purposes of the land provisions in subpart CB, the associated person rule in section CB 15 applies. This means that the “date” on which the company is regarded as acquiring land is the same date on which the “owners” (via the LTC) acquired the land. The owners are effectively regarded collectively as the transferor, and the company as the transferee. - 18 - If an owner ceases to hold interests in the LTC because it permanently ceases to exist as a company – for example, through liquidation or court order, there is a deemed disposal of the shares, at market value. An owner’s interest may also be reduced by cancellation or repurchase of their shares by the LTC. This is a deemed disposal of the shares for their market value, unless it is part of a pro-rata cancellation applied to all owners, and so does not actually alter each owner’s effective look-through interest. In the case of permanent cessation or share repurchase, any actual consideration received by the owner is ignored; the disposal is deemed to occur at market value. The disposal threshold provisions in sections HB 5 to HB 10 do not apply in these deemed disposal circumstances. Disposals thresholds Sections HB 5 to HB 10 remove the requirement for the owner selling the shares (the “exiting owner”) to account for tax on this disposal of underlying property when the tax adjustment that would otherwise be required is below certain thresholds. When these provisions apply, the new owner (the “entering owner”) is treated as acquiring their interests in the LTC’s underlying property for the same cost that the exiting owner had acquired them. The thresholds are: $50,000 threshold Exiting owners are required to account for tax on sale of shares only if the amount of the disposal proceeds exceeds the total net tax book value of the owner’s share of the LTC property (less any liabilities under generally accepted accounting practice) by more than $50,000. When shares in the same LTC have been sold within a 12-month period, all sales are taken into account for the purposes of the threshold. Trading Stock Exiting owners do not have to perform a revenue account adjustment for trading stock if the LTC’s total annual turnover is $3 million or less. Depreciable tangible property Exiting owners do not have to account for depreciation recovery or loss on their share of any depreciable tangible asset if the historical cost of the asset is $200,000 or less. Financial arrangements Exiting owners are not required to perform a base price adjustment for their interest in a financial arrangement if: - the LTC is not in the business of deriving income from financial arrangements; and - the financial arrangement has been entered into as a necessary and incidental purpose of the LTC’s business. - 19 - Exiting owners do not have to account for tax on financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements described in section EW 5(10). Short-term sale and purchase agreements When exiting owners dispose of some or all of their look-through interests in a short term sale and purchase agreement, the consideration received is excluded income. Livestock If the LTC property consists of livestock that includes female breeding livestock that is valued using the national standard cost scheme (section EC 22) or the cost price method (section EC 25), the entering owner may furnish a return of income choosing to apply section EC 26B. The entering owner is treated as if they had originally purchased and held the livestock, not the exiting owner. This is designed to reduce compliance costs for the LTC. Working owners Sections DC 3B, HB 11(6), RD 5(3) and YA 1, and section 14(1) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 A working owner is an owner who is employed by the LTC under a written contract of employment and who personally and actively performs the duties of their employment for the LTC under that contract. This does not apply if the LTC is wholly or mainly engaged in investing money or in holding or dealing in shares, securities, investments, estates or interests in land. An LTC’s payments to a working owner are included in that owner’s salary or wages, and the PAYE rules will apply. When computing their owner’s basis, these wages or salaries are excluded from the distributions element of the formula. An expense deduction is available to all owners of an LTC for wage and salary payments made to working owners. The rules for automatic enrolment of employees into KiwiSaver do not apply to an owner in receipt of salary or wages only because they are a working owner in an LTC. Interests in livestock Section EC 12(4) For the purposes of making a valuation election for specified livestock, a person’s interests in an LTC that owns livestock is treated separately from any other interest that person may have in livestock. Separate elections are needed for each set of livestock, and different valuation methods may be applied to each. Excepted financial arrangements Section EW 5(11B) A look-through interest for an LTC is an excepted financial arrangement. - 20 - Associated persons Section YB 13 The LTC and an owner who is an employee or a director of the LTC are associated. The LTC and an owner who has effective look-through interests of 25% or more are associated. The look-through interests of owners associated under sections YB 2 to YB 11 and YB 14 are aggregated. A slightly modified aggregation rule applies for the purposes of land provisions. Tax administration Sections 42B, 89C(ka), 89D(1), 89DA, 138B and 141B(8) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An LTC must file a return of income, ignoring the look-through requirements. The return must specify the amount of income and deductions allocated to each owner. Only the LTC may propose adjustments to the tax position taken in its return, which the Commissioner may reject by written notice. The LTC may also reject any adjustments proposed by the Commissioner. An owner is entitled to challenge any assessment in relation to their interests in the look-through company by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority only after the disputes process in Part 4A is completed. The Commissioner may issue an assessment to an owner on their tax position in relation to their look-through interests without issuing a notice of proposed adjustment if the LTC and the Commissioner have completed the disputes process for the return of income and that tax position. For the purposes of applying shortfall penalties, and for determining a tax shortfall amount, the amounts returned on the tax return of the LTC are treated as if they were the amounts returned by each owner.

ARTICLE 2 Taxes covered 1 The existing taxes to which this Agreement shall apply are: (a) in New Zealand, the income tax; (hereinafter referred to as "New Zealand tax"); and (b) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, income tax imposed under the national laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; (hereinafter referred to as "Marshall Islands tax"). 2 This Agreement shall also apply to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed after the date of signature of this Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other within a reasonable period of time of any substantial changes to the taxation laws covered by this Agreement. 3 This Agreement shall not apply to taxes imposed by municipalities, local authorities, or possessions of a Contracting State. ARTICLE 3 Definitions 1 For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term "New Zealand" means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (b) the term "the Republic of Marshall Islands" means; any land territory within the territorial limits of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and includes the internal waters and territorial sea of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; (c) the term "competent authority" means in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner and, in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; the Secretary of Finance or an authorised representative of the Secretary of Finance; (d) the term "Contracting State" means New Zealand or the Republic of the Marshall Islands, as the context requires; (e) the term "national", in relation to a Contracting State, means any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; (f) the term "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (g) the term "tax" means New Zealand tax or Marshall Islands tax as the context requires; and (h) the term "transfer pricing adjustment" means an adjustment made by the competent authority of a Contracting State to the profits of an enterprise as a result of applying the domestic law concerning taxes referred to in Article 2 of that State regarding transfer pricing. 2 As regards the application of this Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State, for the purposes of the taxes to which this Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. ARTICLE 4 Resident 1 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means: (a) in the case of New Zealand, a person who is a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax; and (b) in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a person who is a resident of the Marshall Islands for the purposes of Marshall Islands tax; and 2 A person is not a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of this Agreement if the person is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or, in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, is not subject to the most comprehensive taxation provided under the national tax laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 3 Where by reason of the preceding provisions of this Article a person, being an individual, is a resident of both Contracting States, then the person's status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to that individual; if a permanent home is available in both States, or in neither of them, that individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual's personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; (c) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve the question by mutual agreement. 4 Where, by reason of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. ARTICLE 5 Pensions 1 Pensions, (including government pensions) annuities and other remunerations paid to an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State. 2 Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a Contracting State to an individual who is a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. 3 However, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall not apply where the pension, payment, annuities or other remuneration is not subject to tax in the Contracting State of which the individual is a resident. ARTICLE 6 Government Service 1 (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than pensions) paid by the Government of a Contracting State to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government shall be taxable only in that State.

ARTICLE 7 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice, who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is temporarily present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training, receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided such payments arise from sources outside that State. ARTICLE 8 Mutual agreement procedure IN RESPECT OF TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS 1 Where a resident of a Contracting State considers the actions of the other Contracting State results or will result in a transfer pricing adjustment not in accordance with the arm�s length principle, the resident may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the first-mentioned State. The case must be presented within 3 years of the first notification of the adjustment. 2 The competent authorities shall endeavour to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the application of the arm�s length principle by a Contracting State regarding transfer pricing adjustments. They may also communicate with each other directly for the purposes of this Article. ARTICLE 9 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement. Information may be exchanged by the competent authorities for the purposes of this Article in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes concluded by the Contracting States (whether or not this Agreement, in whole or in part,�forms part of the domestic law of either Contracting State). ARTICLE 10 ENTRY INTO FORCE The Contracting States shall notify each other, in writing, through the diplomatic channel of the completion of their constitutional and legal procedures for the entry into force of this Agreement.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF TAXING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN INCOME OF INDIVIDUALS AND TO ESTABLISH A MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE IN RESPECT OF TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS 2 The Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (“the Contracting States”), Recognising that the Contracting States have concluded an Agreement on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes, and Desiring to conclude an Agreement for the allocation of taxing rights with respect to certain income of individuals and to establish a mutual agreement procedure in respect of transfer pricing adjustments, Have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1 PERSONS COVERED This Agreement shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. ARTICLE 2 TAXES COVERED 1 The existing taxes to which this Agreement shall apply are: (a) in New Zealand, the income tax; (hereinafter referred to as "New Zealand tax"); and (b) in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, income tax imposed under the national laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; (hereinafter referred to as "Marshall Islands tax"). 2 This Agreement shall also apply to any identical or substantially similar taxes which are imposed after the date of signature of this Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes.

Media statement

### Dunne unveils new way to give to quake appeal

New Zealanders will be able to donate their accumulated tax credits from donations they have made in the current tax year to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

Last year tax credits claimed for donations were worth about $154 million.

“That is by any measure a substantial amount of money in tax credits, and if some or all of that were gifted to the Appeal, it would be a very significant level of gifting,” Mr Dunne said in an address to the Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand annual conference in Wellington.

From next month, people will fill in their annual tax credit claim form for their donations and will have the option of redirecting their tax credit to the Appeal.

Mr Dunne described it as “a kind of gift aid scheme”.

He said tax credit forms will be posted to people from the end of this month. They will also be available for downloading from the Inland Revenue website (www.ird.govt.nz) along with instructions on how to redirect tax credits to the Appeal.

“The message I have been getting is that many people want to be able to do more.

“This is another way to do that. It is a simple way of giving without actually opening your wallet.”

Mr Dunne added that New Zealanders could also use the payroll giving scheme to give to the Appeal.

Payroll giving is available to all employers who file their Employer Monthly Schedules to Inland Revenue electronically. Further information can also be found on the Inland Revenue website.

Speech

### Address to the Tax Agents’ Institute of NZ Annual Conference  
Holiday Inn, Wellington 12.30pm, Friday 4 March 2011

Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to address you here today.

First, I would like to extend my thoughts and support to the people of Christchurch including TINZ members from the region and their families.

My sincere condolences and sympathies to all who have lost loved ones, friends or colleagues.

As a Cantabrian myself with a large part of my extended family in Christchurch, my heart is very much with all the people of that redoubtable province at this time.

Cantabrians are made of stern stuff, but that has been more than tested in recent months and in particular with last week’s horrendous quake.

As the Prime Minister, John Key, has said, it is not just Canterbury’s test, it is New Zealand’s test, and I have every confidence we will come through this shoulder to shoulder, as one people.

My speech to you today was originally going to focus on the strides we have made in restoring New Zealand’s economy coming out of recession.

However, the truth is that now, as we contemplate the scale of the destruction in Christchurch, we have to accept that this changes everything. 

This is a whole new ball game and we need to respond – and we are responding – quickly, wisely and decisively.

#### Quake response

Like everyone else in the city, Inland Revenue’s Christchurch office has been affected, but early advice suggests that it is structurally sound, although it will be weeks before it reopens. 

On a human note, if you know Christchurch, the Inland Revenue building is across the road from the CTV building that has been a focal point of the tragedy that unfolded on Tuesday of last week, and a number of IRD staff endured the horror, as they were running for their own lives, of watching that building collapse knowing full well that it was occupied by a great number of their fellow Christchurch workers.

There is no over-estimating the trauma that has been suffered and what the people of Christchurch are coming through.

The current focus there is for people to take care of themselves and then to restore services as soon as possible.

In the meantime work normally done in Christchurch has been transferred to other centres.

First and foremost, we are dealing with human beings – our staff and taxpayers both.

People surrounded by human suffering and devastation have much to deal with.

These are extraordinary times and we all need to do what we can to help.

Of course, tax issues will be far from most Christchurch people’s minds at present, but what Inland Revenue can do is to give people one less thing to worry about right now, and that is what we have committed to doing.

Indeed, we have already begun to do so through the various initiatives announced in the last week.

If people cannot meet a tax filing date at this point in time because of lost or destroyed records, then Inland Revenue will be able to waive penalties and interest for those who have been victims of this earthquake.

Inland Revenue has also started running newspaper and radio ads in Canterbury to assure businesses and individuals that they will take a realistic approach in the current circumstances, and apply the discretion that the law allows.

Last year, following the September earthquake, the power to extend the remittance of use of money interest was granted to Inland Revenue. We have already extended that to cover this event.

Can I suggest that when reasonable, any of your clients who have been directly affected by the quake get their tax affairs up to date and then contact Inland Revenue regarding remission of any penalties and interest.

If your clients have debt issues, contact Inland Revenue as soon as is practical so the relevant processes can be put in place.

While we are showing flexibility on tax obligations in these tragic circumstances, we are making sure that payments expected from Inland Revenue, such as Working for Families Tax Credits, are made as usual.

Inland Revenue worked closely with the Ministry of Social Development to develop the employer and job loss cover package that was announced on Monday.

Of relevance is that the earthquake support subsidy payments to employers are free of GST this time.

Approval for this was granted by Order in Council on Monday and Inland Revenue’s website contains details of this.

My officials have been working on a wide range of earthquake-related issues such as donations, depreciation recovered consequences and concerns around hard dates that taxpayers must do things by – filing and notice dates.

I announced on Tuesday that donors to the official Christchurch Earthquake Appeal launched by Prime Minister John Key last Sunday will be able to claim a tax credit or deduction on their donations.

The Appeal will also be treated as a tax-exempt entity.

Many people are being very generous, from large businesses donating big sums through to individuals giving what they can and very generously.

We want to encourage that by ensuring those donations can get a tax credit or tax deduction.

The Appeal has been designed to complement those already established, such as the funds organised by the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.

Essentially, the Government has created the Appeal to work alongside these organisations to make sure the funds are used in the best possible way.

And while I have not previously been known to stand before large gatherings to extol the virtues of gambling, on this occasion I will make an exception.

Half of all sales from this Saturday’s special Lotto draw will go directly to the Appeal. Go out and buy a Lotto ticket this week.

I am sure you will agree that it is for a particularly fine cause.

As I have said, we are working on a wide range of earthquake-related issues. I am sure that further issues will emerge over time and when they do, I promise you that our response will be swift and willing.

Make no mistake.

We have a full sense or urgency around all elements of Government response.

We are fully committed, and will do what we can to assist and expedite Christchurch’s recovery.

#### Budget 2010

It is a year since I last spoke to you and in the interim, much has occurred and changed on the tax landscape.

And the changes we have made have generally been regarded as very positive.

The 2010 Budget, I need not remind anyone, introduced some of the biggest changes to the tax system seen in many years.

It has been a watershed year for the development of our taxation system.

It was a much-needed response to the economic turmoil that New Zealand has faced, along with virtually ever other nation, in the past two or three years, and I am confident it is already paying off by placing our economy on a much sounder footing to face the future.

This is all part of our Government’s overall economic strategy.

With tax rates reduced, people have more disposable income which we want to encourage them to put into savings and investments.

We want people to invest wisely, so in the last Budget we also removed depreciation on most buildings to encourage more prudent investment decisions in a more balanced investment environment, making the old Kiwi favourite of property investment less attractive than it had previously been.

We can now get on with the business of rebuilding and restoring our economy, lifting productivity and encouraging savings and investment.

The year ahead, therefore, looks busy from a tax perspective.

The shift is perhaps best described as a move from ushering in a high level of change and reform, to bedding it in and consolidating it.

The 2011 Budget will be delivered on 19 May.

That will set out the next steps in the plan to lift New Zealand’s economic performance.

Obviously I cannot go into detail about the Budget, but I would like to talk to you about the Government’s priorities.

Our immediate concern, of course, is Christchurch’s recovery.

Recovery plans for Christchurch after the September earthquake have been set back greatly.

The scale of the disaster makes this not a Christchurch disaster, but a national one in every sense.

As such, our slowly recovering economy has taken a hit. There is no other way of dealing with this disaster, unprecedented in its scale and tragedy, than facing reality, and getting on with the task ahead.

On a broader front, I have already said that the next big challenge is to tackle New Zealand’s savings problem.

Our persistent current account deficits and high level of net foreign indebtedness leave us exposed to global and regional economic turbulence.

It is a long-standing problem which successive governments have attempted to address in a variety of ways.

KiwiSaver was, of course, an attempt to address the problem and it has been successful to the extent that it can be, but in and of itself, it is not the complete silver bullet.

In last year’s Budget, we tried to curb New Zealanders appetite for consumption and promote saving by lowering income tax rates and increasing the GST rate, but more still needs to be done.

Because no Government ever has all the answers the Savings Working Group was established to help us get the best answers

#### Savings Working Group

In January, the Savings Working Group issued its report.

It raised concerns about New Zealand's high level of indebtedness and vulnerability to financial shocks.

It examined measures which might reduce vulnerabilities to such shocks and improve the allocation and spread of savings.

The report recommended that the Government consider a large number of possible changes.

These included indexing the tax system for inflation or extending PIE arrangements so that there is a 5 or 10 percentage point reduction for all investors into PIEs below their normal marginal tax rates.

It also suggested extending these low PIE rates to interest and dividends more generally.

The report also set out a number of possible changes to KiwiSaver including auto-enrolment of all employees not currently in KiwiSaver, reducing the starting age to 16 and increasing the default contribution rate.

A major theme of the Savings Working Group report was the need for the Government to improve its own balance sheet faster, which severely limits the scope for any major changes to further lower taxes.

The suggested direction of change is about improving rather than reducing tax collections.

The Prime Minister has stated that Budget 2011 will be a savings and investment Budget.

The measures suggested by the Savings Working Group are among those being considered by the Government in the lead up to the next Budget.

These are major issues.

The Government appreciates the work and co-operation of all involved in making suggestions in this important area.

There is much in the report that makes good sense and I feel we are finally getting some traction with the savings problem.

By playing its part in lifting national savings, the Government will help keep interest rates low and build faster and ongoing economic growth.

In parallel to the redesign of our economy and our tax system is the redesign of how Inland Revenue goes about its work and dealing with tax agents and taxpayers.

#### Business transformation

When I spoke to you last year, I told you about my vision for a first-class tax administration that collects revenue and delivers services with speed, certainty and in a way that allows taxpayers to self-manage their tax affairs with confidence in the technology, systems and people they are dealing with.

I am pleased to report there has been progress on this front.

In June last year, Finance Minister Bill English and I launched an online consultation forum and a discussion document outlining options to improve how employers, businesses and individuals interact with Inland Revenue.

Overall, submitters supported the vision set out in the consultation, particularly the intention to improve interfaces and processes.

However, there was also strong opposition to making use of electronic technology and communications mandatory.

We are committed to moving to an "e" environment over time but we will ensure we do that in a way which builds and maintains the support of the community; working with, rather than dragging along, so to speak.

A tax bill introduced last November included the information sharing framework discussed in the consultation, and aimed at reducing the compliance burden by allowing Inland Revenue to share basic information with other departments so people don’t have to keep supplying the same details over and over.

The select committee is currently hearing submissions on this bill and will report back to the House in June.

Inland Revenue has also been working very closely with interest groups such as the Software Developers’ Working Group, NZICA and personal tax summary intermediaries, to better develop options set out in the consultation.

I expect to receive further advice from officials on these options in due course.

From April next year, Inland Revenue will provide secure access, via third party software, to key account information.

This will allow tax agents to view their clients’ tax data from within their practice management solutions.

Over time, Inland Revenue will expand the information available.

This new service will be a first step towards a full business to business system.

It is just one example of Inland Revenue working with the private sector to reduce compliance costs for business.

Having said all this, although we have taken consistent steps, business transformation is no easy task.

It requires a long term programme consistently applied to make compliance faster, easier and less costly for taxpayers.

#### International tax reform

This year, with a review of the taxation of offshore branches of New Zealand companies, we continue our focus on ensuring that our tax rules are internationally competitive and, where sensible, that our rules on the taxation of offshore investment are in line with international norms.

As with the foundations of a sound tax system and a sound economy, the key planks of our new international tax framework are already in place.

Over the past three years, our international tax rules have been progressively reformed.

In 2007, new rules for the treatment of offshore portfolio investments were introduced.

This standardised the taxation of nearly all such investments, removing distinctions between income and capital gains and eliminating a significant bias towards investment in certain overseas equities.

Then in 2009 the tax treatment of controlling investments in foreign companies was overhauled.

After almost two decades of comprehensive New Zealand taxation of such investments, a tax exemption was introduced for ‘active’ income such as that derived from manufacturing or distribution activities.

This brings New Zealand into line with other OECD countries and lowers barriers to the global expansion of New Zealand-based businesses.

Legislation is currently being considered which continues those reforms.

The Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced in October, proposes extending the active income exemption from controlling investments to non-controlling but significant investments, known as non-portfolio foreign investment funds.

These reforms help New Zealand-based businesses to compete more effectively in foreign markets.

Other Government priorities of the Government are on maintaining the tax system to ensure its integrity.

For the tax system to work efficiently we must also ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax and that all taxpayers are treated consistently.

This is part of what I alluded to earlier – a busy programme of bedding in tax changes and ensuring fairness and consistency across the tax system.

#### Fairness – GST and social assistance

In December, legislation was enacted which squarely addressed fairness concerns.

The new rules prevent GST "phoenix" schemes by requiring GST-registered vendors to charge GST at a zero rate on most transactions involving land if the purchaser is also GST-registered.

Phoenix schemes involve a GST-registered purchaser claiming a GST refund without the corresponding payment having been made because the supplier in the transaction had been deliberately wound up to avoid making the GST payment.

The practice was of particular concern in the property sector, where the GST amount involved can be substantial.

Also introduced were simplified change-in-use rules and greater clarity over when GST applies to residential and commercial accommodation.

On the other side of the equation, we also want to ensure that people receiving social assistance receive their correct entitlement – no more, no less.

A loophole needed to be closed.

It had become apparent that some people with substantial financial means have been able to structure their income in ways that have allowed them to gain clearly unfair advantages over other taxpayers.

The definition therefore of “income” for Working for Families, the Student Allowance and the Community Services Card has been broadened to help prevent structuring income to access these social assistance programmes.

They need to be just that: social assistance programmes for those in need; not pots of gold for the exceedingly cunning, and I think most people agree with that.

My feeling is that the abuse of social assistance programmes by a minority, offends the sense of justice and fair play of the majority.

#### Qualifying companies

In Budget 2010, the Government signalled reforms to the qualifying company (QC) and loss attributing company (LAQC) rules.

The reforms are aimed at addressing a number of problems with the QC rules that, again, undermine the integrity of the tax system.

These problems included arbitrage opportunities, where shareholders could deduct losses at their marginal tax rate and pay tax on profits at the lower company rate.

After a public consultation last year, the Government introduced the look-through company rules that provide transparent tax treatment, similar to partnerships, for income tax purposes.

I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank TINZ for its input during the public consultation.

It was a useful and informative contribution.

Under these rules, a company’s income and losses are both passed on to shareholders, so income will be taxed and losses may be deducted, subject to the loss limitation rule, at a shareholder’s marginal tax rate.

The look-through rules begin on 1 April this year.

However, we are not quite there yet.

I understand there are some issues still to be resolved with the current dividend rules as they apply to smaller companies.

There is a perception that the rules are complex, in particular that shareholders cannot access the company’s capital gains tax-free unless the company winds up.

To a large extent, this issue is addressed in the existing QC rules, although it is also acknowledged by officials, and was commented upon during last year’s public consultation, that some of the eligibility and election features of the existing QC rules do create a compliance burden for small businesses and practitioners such as yourselves.

It does concern me that the dividend rules have been described to me as “ad hoc” and even as “a mish-mash”.

Clearly this not a situation I care to allow to continue in this arena or any other.

In response to the submissions therefore, we announced last October that it was the Government’s intention to review the dividend rules with a view to simplifying them for closely-held companies.

Officials have begun reviewing the dividend rules on the tax treatment of distributions from capital sources, with a focus on closely-held companies.

The review is expected to be concluded next year.

In the interim, the present QC rules are ‘grand-parented’ for existing QCs and LAQCs who do not elect into the flow-through treatment; they may continue to use the QC rules but LAQCs will no longer be able to attribute losses to its shareholders.

For those existing QCs choosing to stop using the QC rules, special transitional provisions enable them to switch to the look-through company rules, or to become a partnership or sole trader with no tax costs.

#### Depreciation

Another change arising out of Budget 2010 was the removal of depreciation for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more.

In addition, the 20 per cent depreciation loading on new plant and equipment was removed for assets purchased after Budget day.

The Government has considered submissions on these matters and the rules introduced in December recognise that there is a case for depreciation on building fit-out.

The new rules confirm that depreciation on the fit-out of commercial and industrial buildings can still be claimed.

The issue of time of purchase of plant and equipment has also been clarified and the depreciation loading on assets can be claimed if the investment decisions were made before 20 May 2010, even if not completed until later.

#### Conclusion

In closing, this then is a broad sketch of what the Government is focusing on.

Naturally, as I indicated at the outset today, some of this will be subject to change as we of necessity give priority to the recovery efforts in Christchurch.

Where Government and the tax system can help, that assistance will be forthcoming. On Monday, the Prime Minister announced details of the initial recovery package.

At the same time we remain committed to restoring New Zealand’s economy.

Government’s priorities are focused firmly on setting the New Zealand economy on its feet again and making it stronger than before.

In this vital work, it is crucial that we have an efficient tax system which supports and enhances, rather than stands in the way and impedes New Zealand business as it sets about growing and thriving.

We have taken huge steps in that direction already. We will continue to do so. Our thinking is clear. We will be resolute in meeting all the challenges that we face as a government, a people and a nation.

Thank you

### Address to the International Fiscal Association Conference

#### Holiday Inn, Wellington  
9am, Friday 11 March 2011

Good morning and thank you for inviting me here today.

When I addressed your conference last year, the Victoria University Tax Working Group had just reported back and their recommendations were being considered by the Government, as part of last year’s Budget process.

Clearly much has happened since then.

Front of mind for all of us, of course, is the devastation in Christchurch, with the huge loss of life, injuries and appalling damage to property, the infrastructure and their local economy, the people of that great city, and ultimately the country as a whole have had to sustain..

The Prime Minister has already released details of the Government’s initial response to the quake, but bluntly the scale of the disaster means more money has to be found to make good Christchurch’s recovery as a leading, dynamic, vibrant, prosperous city, as it was a few short weeks ago.

In a wider sense the earthquake emphasises once again the need for New Zealand to build up its capital in order to be able to recover from such crises.

The Prime Minister has already announced that the central focus of the 2011 Budget will be savings and investment.

Last year’s Budget measures were the most significant tax reform in New Zealand for over twenty years, shifting the weight of taxation from income to consumption.

That Budget contained substantive tax measures to improve the incentives for efficient savings and investment, while maintaining the integrity of the tax system including:

*   Lowering tax rates for individuals and increasing the GST rate

Lower personal tax rates encourage individuals to work, invest and save, increasing wealth and productivity.

The GST rate increase funded a large chunk of the income tax decreases so that they were implemented in a fiscally responsible manner.

*   Company tax rate reduction to 28%

With more capital goods, labour is more productive so this encourages productivity and growth.

It will also ensure that we remain competitive internationally.

*   Changes to the taxation of property

This was a key component of the Budget package.

It will reduce tax biases in favour of property investment while it also helped pay for the tax cuts.

Research indicated that on average, buildings were not in fact depreciating over the period measured and the Tax Working Group had expressed concerns that the residential rental sector was not paying its fair share of tax.

*   Lower PIE tax rates

Budget 2010 also reduced the top PIE tax rate 30% to 28% as well as reducing the lower PIE tax rates to align with the new lower personal tax rates.

This will boost returns to KiwiSaver investments and other long-term savings.

*   Greater integrity and fairness

The Budget measures also significantly improved the integrity and fairness of the tax system by removing the tax advantage that could be gained by sheltering income in trusts.

The top tax rate for individuals is now the same as the trust tax rate.

This year’s Budget will build on all these features.

### Savings Working Group

In January this year, the Savings Working Group issued its report.

While that was not specifically a review of the tax system, it was no surprise that a number of its comments and recommendations focused on tax issues.

It raised concerns about New Zealand's high level of indebtedness and vulnerability to financial shocks.

It examined measures which might reduce vulnerabilities to shocks and which might improve the allocation of savings.

The report recommended that the Government consider a large number of possible changes, including indexing the tax system for inflation or extending PIE arrangements so that there is a 5 or 10 percentage point reduction for all investors into PIEs below their normal marginal tax rates.

It also suggested extending these low PIE rates to interest and dividends more generally.

The report also set out a number of possible changes to KiwiSaver including auto enrolment of all employees who are not currently in KiwiSaver, reducing the starting age to 16 and increasing the default contribution rate.

A major theme of the Savings Working Group report was the need for the Government to improve its own balance sheet faster which severely limits the scope for major tax giveaways in the future

The suggested direction of change is for improving rather than reducing tax collections.

The measures suggested by the Savings Working Group are among those being considered by the Government in the run up to the next Budget with the objective of increasing national savings so as to reduce our over reliance on off-shore capital that should in turn allow for lower interest rates and therefore build faster, ongoing economic growth.

Taxation reform therefore has been and continues to be, central to policy debates in New Zealand.

### The tax reform process

New Zealand, of course, has not been alone in this.

The past couple of years have also been a period of high activity in the taxation area internationally.

Notably we have had the Mirrlees Review in the United Kingdom and the Henry Review in Australia.

Given this strong focus on taxation reform, I want to take this opportunity to reflect on taxation reform and the process of taxation reform in New Zealand.

Most tax professionals would trace the beginnings of modern New Zealand tax reform to the Ross Committee which was established in 1966 and reported back in 1967.

It made about 120 recommendations, but its key recommendations were to:

1.  Reduce reliance on direct income tax and put more weight on indirect consumption taxes.
2.  Remove holes in the tax base that were being exploited, in particular, that fringe benefits of employees be taxed.
3.  Generally reduce income tax rates.

They have a familiar ring, but they were not really implemented until 1984 to 1986 – almost twenty years later.

A most sedate pace by any measure!

Things move more quickly now.

Take the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group.

The group reported in February and most of its recommendations were implemented in the May 2010 Budget.

The Tax Working Group, to my mind, demonstrates how successful the working group model can be.

Academics, practitioners, businesspeople and government officials came together to consider the direction of New Zealand’s tax system.

Their combined efforts not only provided invaluable advice to the Government, but also provided a catalyst for public debate on tax policy issues.

The open debates fostered by the Tax Working Group process went a long way to providing the necessary public acceptance that fundamental change to the tax system was necessary.

The Tax Working Group also provided the broad recipe for change – which was largely followed in Budget 2010.

This is generally achieved by selected businesspeople, private sector advisers and academics working closely together on various policy issues as part of a group.

As a tool of tax reform, using ‘working groups’ in the front-end of the policy-making process in this way was a very successful process and certainly helped the public to understand and appreciate the issues.

For me, a sterling example of this was the work done by the GST Advisory Panel.

In 1989, when GST was last raised, the timetable for making the change was very brisk – indeed a matter of just six weeks or so – with little public discussion or input.

By comparison, the last year’s increase in GST benefited from a more inclusive process and was a remarkably smooth process.

Owing to the Panel’s considerable efforts, transitional measures well targeted to meet specific concerns were implemented.

Other aspects of the Budget also benefited from an inclusive process where possible.

Unlike the 1960s when tax legislation was all introduced and passed on Budget night, key aspects of the Budget such as depreciation of building fit-out, changes to the qualifying companies rules to ensure that investors are taxed at the correct rate, and tightening the rules for social assistance programmes were all subject to a period of brief, but intense consultation.

Given the nature of the Budget package, consultation was necessarily limited.

The concepts however had been canvassed in the Tax Working Group process.

Feedback was also received on details and transitional issues which the Government acted on.

All around, it would be fair to say that the consultation processes improved the results.

This demonstrates how radically the tax reform process in New Zealand has changed since the 1960s and the time of the Ross Committee.

The Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) implemented in the 1990s, and to which the Government remains committed, ensures

We get more input earlier, which in the end this makes for better results.

Indeed, New Zealand is continually cited as a model for how tax reform should be undertaken.

We need to retain and protect this process and I can assure you that you will always have my support in doing so.

From my experience, the keys to success are:

*   Officials and Ministers who actually listen to what the private sector is saying, and
*   A private sector which focuses on the national good rather than just narrow sectoral interests

I acknowledge at this point that the International Fiscal Association has played a crucial part in the interplay between the private sector, officials and Ministers since the 1980s.

Indeed, these conferences are important in building the understanding and consensus that makes tax reform work in New Zealand.

Obviously we do not always agree on every matter but when we disagree, I think we always understand why and I hope we always respect each other’s views.

Returning to the Ross Report, the themes of that are still familiar today.

The basic principles of a good tax system were seen to be:

1.  Economic efficiency
2.  Equity
3.  Certainty, and
4.  Low compliance and administration costs

Those principles remain relevant and the Tax Working Group listed them as:

1.  Efficiency and growth
2.  Equity and fairness
3.  Revenue integrity
4.  Fiscal cost
5.  Compliance and administration costs
6.  Coherence

While slightly expanded, these are fundamentally very similar.

As I have said earlier, the Ross report recommended moving away from taxing income to taxing spending.

In economic terms, this is a move towards taxing capital less and labour more.

The right balance between labour and capital taxation is probably the key tax policy issue that governments face.

It is probably the central issue raised by the Mirrlees Report and the Henry Review, which both favoured lower taxation of capital.

Our response to date has been the switch the emphasis from income tax to GST, which was central to the last Budget.

No doubt, however, it will remain a central issue of tax policy reform.

So too, no doubt will be the issue of taxing capital gains.

A capital gains tax has its adherents.

It was not supported by the Ross review, nor did it get the support of the Valabh, McLeod or the most recent Tax Working Group reviews.

My view is that the Inland Revenue got this right in its publicly available advice leading up to the last Budget.

While a capital gains tax has some theoretical justification, in practical terms, it is not a tax we want, and while there a still some diehards hanging on in woeful desperation for the day that a capital gains tax might be introduced, I say to them that they are going to end up extremely forlorn, and it is time to move on and find a new obsession.

The conclusions of a series of reviews of the New Zealand tax system were not wrong.

There are two differences between the Ross Report and the tax reform issues now that seem significant to me.

First, international tax reform received little mention by the Ross report.

It is now one of the central issues.

Along with taxes and growth and the transformation in the way that Inland Revenue operates, the international tax reform programme is one of the three key aspects of the tax policy work programme.

### International tax reform

This year, with a review of the taxation of offshore branches of New Zealand companies, we continue our focus on ensuring that our tax rules are internationally competitive and, where sensible, that our rules on taxing offshore investment are in line with international norms.

As with the foundations of a sound tax system and a sound economy, the key planks of our new international tax framework are already in place.

Over the past three years, our international tax rules have been progressively reformed.

In 2007, new rules for the treatment of offshore portfolio investments were introduced.

This standardised the taxation of nearly all such investments, eliminating a significant bias towards investment in certain overseas equities that paid no or low dividends.

Then in 2009 the tax treatment of controlling investments in foreign companies was overhauled.

After almost two decades of comprehensive New Zealand taxation of such investments, a tax exemption was introduced for ‘active’ income such as that from manufacturing or distribution activities.

That brought New Zealand into line with other OECD countries and lowered barriers to the global expansion of New Zealand-based businesses.

Legislation is currently being considered which continues those reforms.

The Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Bill, introduced in October, proposes extending the active income exemption from controlling investments to non-controlling but significant investments, known as non-portfolio foreign investment funds.

These reforms are helping New Zealand-based businesses to compete more effectively in foreign markets.

Part of international tax is the work we are doing on the international fund services industry concept.

### International fund services industry

The proposals to remove tax barriers to non-residents investing through PIEs are progressing well.

Officials have been consulting closely with interested parties on proposals to apply the same tax rates to non-residents investing through PIEs that would have applied if they had invested directly.

This is consistent with the general principle underpinning PIEs that investors should – to the extent possible – be taxed as if they held the underlying investments directly.

The trick here is to keep the rules as simple as possible for PIEs to administer, while ensuring that non-residents pay the right amount of tax on their investments.

We think we are close to designing rules that will achieve this.

An essential element of the design is ensuring that the new rules are optional for PIEs.

The Government aims to include these proposals in a bill later this year that would be passed before the November 26 election.

A second striking difference between the Ross Review and the current focus of tax reform is the importance we now give to tax administration.

The minimal focus the Ross Review gave to international tax reflects the closed economy of the 1960s.

The greater focus we now place on administration reflects changes in technology.

A tax system such as ours relies on voluntary compliance and that means that the way the system is administered must suit the taxpayer.

A first-class tax administration collects revenue and delivers services with speed, certainty and in a way that allows taxpayers to self-manage their tax affairs with confidence in the technology, systems and people they are dealing with.

### Business transformation

Starting from April next year, Inland Revenue will be providing secure access, via third party software, to key account information.

This will allow tax agents to view their clients’ tax data from within their practice management solutions.

This new service will be a first step towards a full business-to-business system in future.

Over time, Inland Revenue will expand the information available, moving to greater reliance on electronic delivery of services while ensuring that it does that in a way that builds and maintains community support.

Public consultation last year on options to improve how employers, businesses and individuals interact with Inland Revenue was generally supportive of the intention to improve interfaces and processes, but opposed making electronic communications mandatory.

Meanwhile, a tax bill introduced last November included the information sharing framework discussed in the consultation, aimed at reducing the compliance burden by allowing Inland Revenue to share basic information with other departments so people do not have to keep supplying the same details multiple times to different agencies.

The select committee is currently hearing submissions on this bill and will report back to the House in June.

The information sharing provisions and the proposed changes to secrecy rules have raised some concerns in submissions on the bill.

I want to make it clear that the Government has no intention of undermining the protections on the release of taxpayer’s private or commercial information.

What I am focused on is dealing with the reality that in some instances, the current rules seem too restrictive.

For instance, it does not make sense to me that under current law, Inland Revenue, one part of government, knows of people who are in full-time employment but who are receiving unemployment benefits from another part of government, yet the Department is prohibited from doing anything about that.

It does not seem right that a strict interpretation of the secrecy rules places the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in breach of those rules if he were to apologise publicly for mistakes made by the Department.

I look forward to progress on that bill and expect the concerns raised in submissions will be carefully considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee.

The concerns raised by submitters are important ones, but I do believe that we can come to answers that are both pragmatic and principled.

Having said all this, although we have made some small steps, business transformation is no easy task.

It requires a long term programme, but the end goal is still the same, that is, to make compliance faster, easier and less costly for taxpayers.

We also intend to provide innovative online services, and help Inland Revenue respond more quickly to future changes whilst maintaining the integrity of the tax system.

### Tax policy work programme

An efficient tax system does not stifle enterprise with compliance costs and seeks to minimise the compliance burden on taxpayers and businesses.

As such, the three key drivers of the tax policy work programme are:

*   Taxes and growth
*   International tax reform, and
*   Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme

However, as you know, the tax policy work programme is extensive.

Even while a tax system is undergoing reform, there are many other areas requiring policy attention.

### Earthquake

Nothing demonstrates this point more clearly than the urgent policy response required for the last month’s Christchurch earthquake.

The Government’s response in the tax area has been swift and varied and ranges from emergency measures for supporting businesses and employers by for example, waiving interest and late payment and late filing penalties through to work on initiatives for encouraging private donations as well as investigating options for raising funds at a governmental level.

Inland Revenue is putting processes in place to provide support to businesses where it can help.

It will, for example, help businesses to re-create their records, using the information that the department already holds about them.

Inland Revenue will also be providing broader advisory support to assist business recovery.

More specifically, the department will work with the Ministry of Economic Development and the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce to develop processes for business recovery support.

Inland Revenue intends to provide up to twelve business recovery coordinators to support this work.

There are fifteen staff helping the Ministry of Social Development to process employer and employee subsidy applications in Rotorua.

Inland Revenue staff are also working with their local Welfare Advisory Groups in Ashburton, Greymouth, Auckland, Wellington, Whangarei, Blenheim, Nelson, Palmerston North and Queenstown.

Around 30 staff from Christchurch are currently redeployed in other Government agencies in Christchurch assisting with recovery work.

### Income Sharing

Outside of the earthquake, but of particular interest to me, is the Income Sharing Bill I introduced last year.

The tax credit will effectively refund some of the tax paid by couples caring for children where one partner is on a higher tax rate than the other.

It will mean that different couples on the same level of combined income will effectively pay the same combined amount of personal income tax, regardless of how much each partner earns.

The changes proposed in the bill will also mean some couples have greater choices to work fewer or more flexible hours of paid work in order to care for children, by increasing their combined after-tax income.

The confidence and supply agreement between National and UnitedFuture at the last election included National supporting legislation to the first reading stage to allow couples raising dependent children the option of income sharing for tax purposes.

This bill is currently being considered by the finance and expenditure committee.

If the legislation is enacted, income sharing for eligible households will be available from 1 April next year.

### Child support

I mentioned earlier that the process of reform now includes the opportunity for public feedback and comment.

I will soon release a summary of the feedback received on the Child Support discussion document that was issued late last year and which drew submissions from over 2300 people.

The discussion document outlined a range of options for improving the child support scheme – to make the scheme fairer and to take into account changes in society since the scheme was introduced in 1992.

As expected with an issue that affects so many New Zealanders, there was a huge range of strongly held views, with both the level and tenor of the feedback confirming that the current child support regime is outdated and sometimes unfair.

We intend to make it fairer and more focussed on the well-being of children.

To that end I hope to be in a position to consider and finalise options for change to the child support legislation in the first half of this year for consideration by Cabinet.

### GST cross border work

At the other end of the scale, the government is aware of a number of issues that relate to the imposition of GST on cross-border supplies in a business to business context.

Questions have been raised on whether the existing rules for exporting services to non-resident businesses are appropriate from a New Zealand policy perspective, particularly given the position adopted by our major trading partners that operate GST or VAT systems.

Officials are therefore currently conducting a review of this area and anticipate releasing an issues paper for public consultation in the middle of this year.

### Conclusion

The theme of this speech is continuity and change in New Zealand tax reform since the Ross Report of the 1960s.

Looking back to that period and to the 1989 GST rise, it’s clear that the tax reform process has changed radically and for the better giving taxpayers and tax professionals greater certainty and understanding.

Some issues have much greater focus as the world has become much more integrated and technology has changed.

But the themes of a tax system that is fair and efficient remain constant.

SPEECH

### Address to the Employers and Manufacturers Association annual payroll conference

#### Rendezvous Hotel, Auckland  
9.15am, Thursday 17 March 2011

Good morning and thank you for inviting me to be here with you today.

I was pleased to see that this is now your fourteenth annual payroll conference.

Congratulations on sustaining your conference through the very significant changes to payroll processes that we have witnessed in recent times.

Many of those changes relate to the Inland Revenue Department.

Things such as the advent of Employer Monthly Schedules, ir-file, KiwiSaver, Payroll Giving and last year’s tax rate cuts have all changed the landscape for payroll practitioners over recent years.

Yet through all this, a central function remains – deductions are made and paid to Inland Revenue and salaries and wages are paid to employees.

This happens efficiently and flawlessly for the most part and this, of course, is crucial as our economy depends on that.

Some of how you do that is set to be changed.

For the better, I hasten to add.

I would like to talk to you today about changes the Government is considering which I think should smooth the process greatly for both businesses and individuals.

But our immediate concern of course is Christchurch’s recovery and I would like to first extend my sincere sympathies to all who lost family, friends and colleagues in the disastrous earthquake of February 22.

### Quake response

The response to the earthquake has been swift and remarkably well-considered, with everyone doing their bit within their particular area.

I would like to commend the EMA for the very practical and helpful advice and efforts you are putting in to helping small businesses, in particular, get back on their feet.

People around New Zealand have been incredibly generous, offering all manner of financial and other forms of support.

Of particular relevance to you is that employees can choose to make donations to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal through the Payroll Giving scheme.

Payroll Giving, as you would know, allows people to donate direct from their pay to their chosen charity and receive an immediate tax credit for payroll donations.

The latest figures show that since Payroll Giving’s introduction in January last year, $1.6 million has been donated through the scheme and a total of 650 employers have offered payroll giving to their employees.

I am pleased that a group of large organisations have joined together to form an “early adopters group” to champion payroll giving.

The group is focussed on the question of “how to design and implement a standalone payroll giving scheme”.

At least a couple of you will represent members of the group’s payroll systems.

If you are interested in finding out more about the early adopters group and the role that you can play, I would encourage you to contact the chair of the early adopters group, Diana Crossan, who you no doubt all know better in her role as the Retirement Commissioner.

You can contact her at: [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

You can also learn more about payroll giving by visiting Inland Revenue’s website www.ird.govt.nz

Payroll giving is a simple and easy way for people to support the Christchurch relief and recovery effort.

Inland Revenue, too, is doing its bit by working to ensure smooth processes, appropriate tax relief and the facilitating of the raising of funds for relief and recovery.  
  
To date, my policy officials have been involved in working with the Ministry of Social Development on the Government assistance package that provides the earthquake support subsidy for employers and the earthquake job loss cover for employees.

They also worked to ensure that Inland Revenue’s powers to remit interest are appropriate.

This work resulted in three Orders in Council.

The Department will waive penalties and interest if returns cannot be filed or payments made because of the earthquake.

Now my officials are focusing on a wider range of other matters.

Taxpayers have raised a number of issues and in some areas urgent legislative changes may be necessary.

These issues include:

*   depreciation
*   statutory dates
*   the treatment of donated goods
*   the redundancy tax credit that expires on 1 April this year.
*   the tax treatment of welfare benefits provided by employers (including ex gratia payments).

The government is currently working its way through all these issues, and I am hopeful more definite announcements can be made in the next couple of weeks.

Meanwhile, those people expecting payments from Inland Revenue, such as Working for Families Tax Credits, will continue to receive those as usual.

As I said before, we all do what we can to help, and Inland Revenue is doing what it can to smooth processes.

Smoothing processes is something that the Government and Inland Revenue have developed a particular interest in.

### Making Tax Easier

In fact, in the middle of last year, a discussion paper called Making Tax Easier was issued and an online consultation undertaken, seeking feedback on various proposals to improve the tax system.

A prime focus of _Making Tax Easier_ was the intention to place more reliance on web-based tax administration.

On the whole, submitters supported the vision set out in the consultation, particularly the intention to improve interfaces and processes, but it would be fair to say that they expressed clear reservations about making electronic technology and communications mandatory.

Overall, we are committed to moving to an ‘e’ environment for tax administration over time, but we will ensure we do that in a way which builds and maintains the support of the community.

Good progress has been made on the proposals and I would like to update you on that now.

### Using accounting software for routine tax compliance

A founding principle of the _Making Tax Easier_ discussion document was the will to make tax compliance easier and, whenever possible, cheaper for businesses.

A key innovation proposed in that consultation was the integration of tax functionality into business's accounting software.

This would, for example, enable routine tax compliance tasks like the filing of the Employer Monthly Schedule to be handled automatically by a business's payroll software.

Rather than businesses having to take information from their systems and put it either into a paper form or into a separate Inland Revenue system, the payroll accounting system will be able to send the information directly to Inland Revenue.

Both businesses and software developers responded to these proposals very enthusiastically.

Since then, work has been going on at two levels.

Inland Revenue has also been looking at its own systems, and discussing with the Government the changes it will need to make to support this new way of working.

Inland Revenue has also been working very closely with a group of representatives of the software development industry, to work out how these ideas may work in practice.

I want to acknowledge the efforts and commitment of the software developers group and am pleased to announce that next month, Inland Revenue will be providing secure access, via third party software, to key account information.

This will allow tax agents to view their clients’ tax data from within their software.

Over time, Inland Revenue will expand the information available.

This new service will be a first step towards a full business to business system in future.

It is just one example of Inland Revenue working with the private sector to reduce compliance costs for business.

Because this is an important change which will bring significant benefit to the business sector, it is important that we get it right, and Ministers are watching developments with great interest.

### Improved online services for individuals

One of the other key issues raised in the _Making Tax Easier_ consultation was the difficulty some people face interacting with Inland Revenue.

Think of all the things you can do today from your home computer: you can research travel destinations and hotels, book and pay for a flight, order groceries, buy and sell things on auctions sites like TradeMe and all manner of other transactions.

Until recently, one thing you have not been able to do is arrange your tax affairs.

Much interaction with the tax system still takes place through pieces of paper being sent back and forth.

While this works well for some, it is a failure to take advantage of internet technology.

However this is changing and I have been really encouraged by the progress Inland Revenue has made in this area.

The new Online Services facility was launched in May last year, and further refined in September.

People who sign up for this can carry out almost all of their transactions with Inland Revenue and look at balances, check on due dates and keep their contact details up to date.

This covers not just tax but all the other things people deal with Inland Revenue for, like Child Support, KiwiSaver, and GST.

As employers, this should reduce the number of staff who contact you for information about their transactions with Inland Revenue.

I am especially pleased that inroads are being made into the huge mounds of paper that Inland Revenue has in the past generated in its correspondence.

People can now choose to send and receive email on their tax affairs through a special secure environment.

This is not too dissimilar to a system that some banks operate.

Many of us choose email for all manner of correspondence.

Now you can also use it for managing your tax affairs.

I would encourage any of you who haven't used Inland Revenue's Online Services to try them out – I think you will be impressed with what you find there.

### Cross-agency information sharing

This is another proposal which was raised in the Making Tax Easier consultation.

It is a complex issue.

On the one hand, there is clearly value for individuals in having all of the government agencies that provide services know about something which affects them and where a response from government would help.

An example we always used to give of this was the birth of a child, but the recent tragic events in Christchurch are another example of where the ability to share information about a change in someone's circumstances would help government to provide a swift and comprehensive response.

There are also clearly advantages to government in sharing this kind of information.

Quite simply, doing so enables it to avoid the situation we have now where several different computer systems are maintained to keep the same basic information about someone.

This information is not necessarily complex or sophisticated. It may be as simple as their address.

On the other hand – and this was something that came out of the public consultation – people are concerned about their privacy not being protected and potential misuse of information about them.

These are important concerns and they must be addressed properly at all times.

Legislation to allow greater information sharing by Inland Revenue was introduced in the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill in November last year.

The bill proposes greater sharing of information held by Inland Revenue with other government agencies, but subject to a range of restrictions:

*   the government agency seeking the information must have the ability and authority to collect it in its own right
*   the information must already be information that is collected by Inland Revenue
*   information will only be shared if it is not so sensitive that it would inhibit individuals from providing accurate information in the future
*   it must be either economically inefficient for the agency seeking information to collect it itself, or clear compliance benefits to individuals for the information to be shared rather than collected separately.

The bill is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee and I expect that it will be enacted later this year.

Having said all this, although we have made some small steps, business transformation is no easy task.

And transforming tax administration is even more complex.

While designing new services and communications, the integrity of the tax system must at all costs be protected.

A great deal rides on the confidence that businesses and individual taxpayers have in the security of their tax information.

That confidence underpins a system that people work with and see as fundamentally fair, which is the case here in New Zealand.

And any system that Inland Revenue adopts must be simple, attractive to taxpayers, secure and must not impose undue compliance costs.

It requires a long term programme, but the end goal is the same, that is, to make compliance faster, easier and less costly for taxpayers.

To provide innovative online services and help Inland Revenue respond more quickly to future changes while maintaining the integrity of the tax system.

### Conclusion

In closing, there always seems to be something new happening in the world of payroll.

In recent times, changes have added to your payroll processes.

What I have sketched out today is a broad outline of what Government is focusing on with a view to smoothing processes when dealing with Inland Revenue.

The Government’s priorities are focused firmly on setting the New Zealand economy on its feet again and making it stronger than before.

The changes I have outlined are part of the economic strategy.

An efficient tax system does not stifle enterprise with undue compliance costs and therefore seeks to minimise its compliance burden on taxpayers and businesses.

By Government doing its bit to improve its own efficiency and remove impediments, we help lift productivity in the private sector.

Thank you and I hope you have an enjoyable conference.

Ends.

### Earthquake tax relief measures announced

The Government has put in place several tax relief measures to help Christchurch residents and businesses trying to get back on their feet after last month's earthquake, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"With the end of the tax year rapidly approaching, businesses and employers in Christchurch and around New Zealand need some certainty about the tax issues arising from the Canterbury earthquakes," Mr English said.

"These measures will make it easier for Christchurch businesses to comply with their tax obligations, recognising the disruption caused by the earthquakes," he said.

The measures include:

*   Providing an exemption so businesses do not have to pay tax or gift duty on trading stock they have donated within four months of either the September 4 or February 22 earthquakes.
*   Making certain welfare contributions provided by employers tax free, within eight weeks of either earthquake.
*   Extending the redundancy tax credit, which had been due to end on 31 March, to 30 September this year.
*   Granting the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to extend statutory tax dates on a case or class-of-cases basis.
*   Exempting certain payments made to families who receive Working for Families tax credits as a result of the earthquake from counting as income.

Mr Dunne said that normal tax rules had not been designed for disasters of the scale of the Canterbury earthquakes.

"Therefore the Government has recognised that they simply would not be fair for people in these extraordinary circumstances," Mr Dunne said.

"It is important we provide both income tax and gift duty relief to businesses donating trading stock to help alleviate the impact of the earthquake.

"Without this exemption, businesses would be taxed on a deemed profit based on the market value of any donated goods," he said.

To qualify, trading stock must meet certain criteria outlined on Inland Revenue's policy website at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

Mr Dunne said the move to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to extend statutory tax dates was consistent with the flexible approach the Government and Inland Revenue had already been taking after both Canterbury earthquakes.

"Many businesses are dealing with lost records and disrupted systems and this is being recognised," he said.

Mr English said the definition of income for Working for Families was being broadened from 1 April to include cash gifts, payments of expenses and certain other payments.

"Cabinet has agreed this should not apply to the support given to people adversely affected by the Canterbury earthquakes."

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would have the discretion to exclude such payments from counting as Working for Families income for up to a year.

Mr Dunne said he expected most of the legislation for these decisions to be enacted in early May.

"The Government's objective is to get earthquake-stricken residents and businesses back on their feet and today's decision will help and reflects a need for common sense, flexibility and pragmatism," he said.

Announcements would be made in due course on depreciation recovery and the Government would consider other issues as they arose.

Detailed information on the changes is contained in fact sheets on the Inland Revenue Department's policy website at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

### Dunne: new rules for non-resident PIE investment

New tax rules announced today by Revenue Minister Peter Dunne will remove a barrier to non-residents investing into New Zealand.

The changes are contained in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 released today by Mr Dunne.

He said that the rules for non-resident investors in PIEs will be aligned with those for direct investment to ensure fairness of tax treatment.

Mr Dunne said that the current rules mean that non-residents investing into Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) are taxed at 28% on all the income that they earn from a PIE, whether foreign or New Zealand-sourced.

"This means that these investors are over-taxed in comparison with how they would be taxed if they had invested directly."

He said that this over-taxation had been identified as a barrier to the development of New Zealand's fund management industry, particularly in the case of direct investment into foreign assets by non-residents.

"The International Fund Services Development Group told us that this situation discourages non-residents from investing in New Zealand PIEs. It's a situation we needed to rectify."

Mr Dunne said that the rules are designed to be as simple as possible for PIEs to administer, while still providing that non-residents pay the right amount of tax on their investments.

The new rules introduce two new categories of PIEs. Details of these are on the Inland Revenue policy website taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/

Mr Dunne said he expects the legislation introducing the new rules to be enacted later this year.

### Fact sheet - Non-resident PIE investment

#### Introduction

The rules for non–resident investment in PIEs are being changed to ensure investors are not over-taxed on their PIE income compared with direct investment.

#### Two new PIE categories

In essence, two new categories of PIEs will be introduced that entities can elect into. This gives both PIEs and non-resident investors flexibility to invest into foreign or New Zealand assets, and allows them to choose the tax treatment of their non-resident investors. A further reason for having two new categories for PIEs to elect into is to accommodate the diverse range of systems PIEs have in place for the administration of their investments.

1.  The first new category of PIE which entities could elect into will have both resident and non-resident investors and only foreign-sourced income, subject to a 5 percent minimum threshold for New Zealand-sourced interest income and a 1 percent minimum threshold for New Zealand-sourced income from equities. Non-residents in these PIEs will be taxed at zero percent.
2.  The second category of PIE which entities could elect into will have both resident and non-resident investors, and both foreign-sourced income and New Zealand-sourced income, with variable rates applying, reflecting the rates that would apply if the investment was direct:  
    (i) 0% on foreign-sourced income;  
    (ii) 0% on dividends derived from New Zealand companies that are fully-imputed;  
    (iii) 15% on dividends derived from New Zealand companies that are unimputed where the investor is from a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA);  
    (iv) 30% on dividends derived from New Zealand companies that are unimputed when the investor is from a country with which New Zealand does not have a DTA;  
    (v) 1.44% on New Zealand-sourced financial arrangement income (being the deductible approved issuer levy (AIL) rate); and  
    (vi) 28% on other New Zealand-sourced income.

#### Application date

The application date for the first category is the date the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill receives Royal assent. The application date for the second category is 1 April 2012.

Note: This fact sheet was added to the original news item, dated 5 April 2011, on 6 April 2011 at 5:00pm.

Further earthquake relief measures
==================================

New rules about the tax treatment of depreciation for assets that were destroyed in the earthquake were announced today by the Minister of Revenue. For more information see the [media statement](/news/2011/2011-04-12-further-earthquake-relief-measures#statement)

### Dunne: further Christchurch tax relief on depreciation

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced proposed changes to depreciation rules aimed at giving Christchurch businesses further tax relief, but with two of the measures to be extended to general tax law.

He said Cabinet agreed yesterday to three proposed changes in the rules for the tax treatment of depreciation, specifically around rollover relief, timing of deemed sales of destroyed insured assets, and losses on buildings.

Mr Dunne explained that under normal tax laws, when the insurance proceeds of a destroyed asset exceed the tax book value of the asset the owner is taxed on depreciation recovered. (This is because too much depreciation has been claimed in the past and is often the result when destroyed assets are insured for replacement value).

Rollover relief will be allowed for buildings replaced with buildings within the zone under Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority responsibility.

Similar rules would apply for insurance proceeds on buildings held on "revenue account" so long as the replacement building is in the zone.

Rollover relief would also be allowed for plant and equipment replaced with other plant and equipment, with no restriction on where in New Zealand the replacement asset is located.

Mr Dunne said that a key factor of the changes is the allowing of a five-year period for acquiring replacement assets.

"This is to ensure that businesses can take the time they need to fully consider their position before they replace their assets," he said.

"This special one-off rule acknowledges the sheer size and impact of the Canterbury earthquakes.

"We do not believe that the Government should collect a windfall gain from depreciation recovered where taxpayers use their insurance proceeds to replace assets destroyed by the earthquakes," Mr Dunne said.

In terms of the timing of deemed sales of destroyed insured assets, at present an insured asset is deemed to have been sold when it is destroyed, he said.

Mr Dunne said the timing of a deemed sale can have significant implications for businesses, particularly for assets destroyed in the earthquake where the value of the insurance proceeds may not be confirmed for some time.

"It is therefore proposed that the time of sale be deemed to be the point when the insurance proceeds can be reasonably estimated," he said.

Cabinet has also agreed to extend existing legislation for the write-off of buildings destroyed by an event beyond the owner's control.

"Current legislation allows a write-off when a building is destroyed by an event such as an earthquake, but no deduction is allowed if it is destroyed because of an event, for instance, in a situation where it is demolished to allow a neighbouring building to be properly demolished," Mr Dunne said.

The rollover relief is limited to assets destroyed as a result of the Canterbury earthquake and aftershocks. The other two measures - timing of deemed sales of destroyed insured assets, and losses on buildings - are improvements to general tax law and will be available to all taxpayers.

"We are introducing these measures because the current tax rules on depreciation in this situation would hinder recovery and growth.

"The measures I am announcing today will help allow businesses to get on with the business of recovering, and help businesses to invest in Christchurch's future," Mr Dunne said.

The new depreciation rules are expected to be enacted around July.

Full details of the proposed new rules are available in a fact sheet on the Inland Revenue policy website at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz

19 May 2011 Fact sheet – KiwiSaver changes Why are changes being made? • The Government currently spends over $1 billion a year on KiwiSaver subsidies and tax breaks and is borrowing heavily to pay for this. Borrowing money to put into KiwiSaver accounts doesn't make sense as it does not lift overall net savings and may even result in members saving less of their own money. • Removing the tax-free status of employer contributions will make the scheme fairer – currently 50 per cent of this benefit goes to the top 15 per cent of income earners, due to their higher marginal tax rate. • The changes will help the Government return to surplus sooner. The Savings Working Group said achieving this and reducing Government borrowing was the one of the most important things the Government could do to lift national savings. What is changing? • Budget 2011 makes changes to KiwiSaver that will reduce Government subsidies, and replace them with increased private contributions. This will reduce Government borrowing and lift national savings, while ensuring KiwiSaver remains an attractive option for savers. The specific changes are – the $1,000 Kick-Start remains unchanged: • From 1 April 2012: The tax-free status of employer contributions to KiwiSaver and other complying superannuation funds will end. All employer contributions will be subject to Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) paid at the employee’s marginal tax rate. • For the year ending 30 June 2012 and beyond: The Member Tax Credit rate will be halved from $1 to 50c for every $1 contributed by members, up to $521 a year – half the current maximum. These payments are made annually after the government financial year, so the first payments at these new levels will occur in the second half of 2012. • From 1 April 2013: The minimum employee contribution rate will rise from 2 per cent to 3 per cent. This will apply to existing and new members. This will also be the new default rate, but members will still be able to select a higher contribution rate of 4 per cent or 8 per cent. • From 1 April 2013: The compulsory employer contribution rate will also rise to 3 per cent. Key facts • The savings from reducing the Member Tax Credit and applying ESCT are estimated to be $513 million in 2011/12 rising to $720 million in 2014/15. This amounts to $2.6 billion over the next four years that the Government no longer needs to borrow. • When the changes are fully implemented in 2012/13, the Government will still contribute over $600 million a year in KiwiSaver subsidies. • Officials estimate Budget 2011 KiwiSaver changes will improve the rate of national saving by about 0.2 per cent of GDP a year, with KiwiSaver funds projected to rise from $7.9 billion currently to $25 billion in 2014/15 and almost $60 billion in 10 years. • They also estimate the changes will reduce our net international liabilities – the amount households, businesses and the Government owes to foreign lenders – by about 2 per cent of GDP over the next decade. • Even though the Government is reducing its contribution, KiwiSaver remains a highly attractive and subsidised scheme for savers – in fact: o New members will continue to receive the $1,000 Kick-Start payment. o Most people on the minimum contribution rate will continue to receive more than $1 in combined employer contributions and tax credits for every $1 they put in. o Nearly all members contributing at the minimum rate will end up with more KiwiSaver funds at retirement than would have been the case under the current policy settings. • The Government contributed over $1 billion to KiwiSaver members' accounts in the year to 31 March, 2011, compared to employee contributions of about $1.1 billion and employer contributions of about $700 million. There are currently 1.68 million KiwiSaver members. Where can I find more information? • More information about KiwiSaver is available on Inland Revenue’s KiwiSaver website: www.kiwisaver.govt.nz . • Information for employers about ESCT is available on Inland Revenue’s tax website: www.ird.govt.nz.
KiwiSaver – how changes affect New Zealanders 1. 35-year old couple on average household income. Ben and Megan are both 35 years old. Ben works full time and earns $52,000 a year and Megan works part time earning $25,000 a year. Their combined income is equivalent to the average household wage. They join KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and both contribute the new minimum rate – 3 per cent of their gross wages. Ben contributes $29.92 a week and his employer contributes 3 per cent, or $24.68 a week after tax. He receives the equivalent of $10 a week in government contributions through the annual Member Tax Credit. Megan contributes $14.38 a week and her employer contributes 3 per cent, or $11.87 a week after tax. She receives the equivalent of $7.19 a week from the Member Tax Credit. By age 65 Ben and Megan would have combined savings of about $247,500. This would be enough to provide gross income of about $15,000 a year in retirement over and above the married rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $27,194 a year after tax. 2. 30-year old on average wage Steven is 30 and earns $50,000 – about the average wage. Steven joins KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and contributes the new minimum rate of 3 per cent of his gross wage – $28.77 per week. Steven’s employer contributes 3 per cent, or $23.73 a week after tax. He receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. At age 65 Steven would have about $190,000, which would be enough to provide gross income of around $11,500 a year in retirement over and above the single rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $17,676 a year after tax. 3. 18-year old on the minimum wage Blair is 18 and earns just over $27,000 a year – around the minimum wage. Blair joins KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and contributes the new minimum rate of 3 per cent of his gross wage – $15.60 a week. Blair’s employer contributes 3 per cent, or $12.87 a week after tax. He receives the equivalent of $7.80 a week from the Member Tax Credit. At age 65 Blair would have about $195,000, which would be enough to provide gross income of more than $11,500 a year in retirement over and above the single rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $17,676 a year after tax. 4. 30-year old couple each earning $45,000, contributing 4 per cent and intending to use the first home buyer subsidy Bechi and Dan are both 30 and each earn $45,000 a year. They both join KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and choose to contribute 4 per cent of their gross wage – $34.52 a week each. Their employers contribute 3 per cent, or $21.36 after tax. They each receive the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. After three years, if Bechi and Dan decided to buy their first home, they may be eligible for a first home deposit subsidy of $3,000 each, which increases to a maximum of $5,000 after five years. They could also withdraw their own contributions, their employers' contributions and their fund returns to buy their first home. After five years they would have about $36,000 available for withdrawal, and if their combined income remained under $100,000, they would also be eligible for the $5,000 deposit subsidy, pushing their total first-home deposit to about $46,000. Assuming they withdrew the maximum amount to buy their first home, at age 65 Bechi and Dan would have a combined balance of about $345,000, which would be enough to provide gross income of about $21,000 a year in retirement over and above the married rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $27,194 a year after tax. 5. 45-year old couple with household income of $120,000 Tama and Lisa are both 45. Tama earns $80,000 a year and Lisa earns $40,000 a year. They both join KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and contribute the new minimum rate of 3 per cent of their gross wage. Tama contributes $46.03 a week and his employer contributes 3 per cent, or $32.22 a week after tax. He receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. Lisa contributes $23.01 a week and her employer contributes 3 per cent, or $18.99 a week after tax. She receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. At age 65 Tama and Lisa would have about $200,000, which would be enough to provide gross income of about $12,000 a year in retirement over and above the married rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $27,194 a year after tax. 6. 35-year old earning $80,000 Matt is 35 and earns $80,000 a year. He joins KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and contributes at the new minimum rate of 3 per cent of his gross wage – or $46.03 per week. Matt's employer also contributes 3 per cent, or $32.22 a week after tax. Matt receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. At age 65 Matt would have about $225,000, which would be enough to provide gross income of about $13,500 a year in retirement over and above the single rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $17,676 a year after tax. 7. 40-year old earning $100,000 Lelani is 40 and earns $100,000. She joins KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013 and contributes at the new minimum rate of 3 per cent of her gross wage – $57.53 a week. Lelani's employer contributes 3 per cent, or $38.55 a week after tax. She receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. At age 65 Lelani would have about $212,500, which would be enough to provide gross income of more than $12,500 a year in retirement over and above the single rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $17,676 a year after tax. 8. 50-year old existing member on average wage Emma is 50 and earns $50,000 – about the average wage. She joined KiwiSaver in July 2007 and first contributed 4 per cent of her gross wage. She currently contributes 2 per cent, or $19.18 a week and this is matched by her employer. She also receives the same amount from the Member Tax Credit, which will reduce to the equivalent of $9.59 a week for the year to 30 June 2012 and beyond. From 1 April 2013 Emma's minimum contribution will rise to 3 per cent, or $28.77 a week. Because her contributions rise the amount she receives from the Member Tax Credit will increase to the equivalent of $10 per week. Her employer's contribution will also increase to 3 per cent, or $23.73 a week after tax. At age 65 she would have about $75,000. This would be enough to provide gross income of about $4,500 a year in retirement over and above the single rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $17,676 a year after tax. 9. 30-year old existing member earning $40,000 Nick is 30 and earns $40,000 a year. He joined KiwiSaver in July 2007 and contributes 4 per cent of his gross wage – $30.68 a week. His employer contributes $15.34 a week. He currently receives the equivalent of $20 a week from the Member Tax Credit, which will reduce to the equivalent of $10 a week for the year to 30 June 2012 and beyond. From 1 April 2013, Nick's employer contribution will increase from 2 per cent to 3 per cent, or $18.99 a week after tax. If Nick leaves his contribution rate unchanged, then at age 65 he would have about $215,000. This would be enough to provide gross income of $13,000 a year in retirement over and above the single rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $17,676 a year after tax. 10. 50-year old couple with household income of $100,000 Jeremy and Chloe are both 50. Jeremy earns $75,000 a year, while Chloe works part time and earns $25,000 a year. They both join KiwiSaver on 1 April 2013. As their children have now left home and they have paid off their mortgage, they choose to contribute 8 per cent of their gross wages. Jeremy contributes $115.07 a week. His employer contributes 3 per cent of his gross wage, or $30.21 a week after tax. He receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. Chloe contributes $38.36 a week. Her employer contributes 3 per cent, or $11.87 a week after tax. She receives the equivalent of $10 a week from the Member Tax Credit. At age 65 Jeremy and Chloe would have combined savings of about $217,500. This would be enough to provide gross income of about $13,000 a year over and above the married rate of NZ Superannuation – currently $27,194 a year after tax. If Jeremy and Chloe had contributed only 4 per cent of their gross wage, they would have combined savings of about $140,000, or enough to provide additional gross income of about $8,500 a year in retirement. Assumptions used in KiwiSaver examples • Although the Member Tax Credit is paid annually after the government financial year, the estimated annual amount has been averaged on a weekly basis for the purposes of these examples. • All retirement savings figures are in today's dollars, based on funds earning a real return of 4 per cent a year and real wage growth of 1.5 per cent a year, unless otherwise stated. • The Member Tax Credit and tax rates are not indexed for inflation. • Estimated retirement income is based on life expectancy of 25 years in retirement and an annual real return of 4 per cent a year. Payments are inflation adjusted to preserve real value.

19 May 2011 Fact sheet – Working for Families changes Why are changes being made? • The cost of Working for Families has grown from about $1.5 billion in 2005/06 to $2.8 billion a year now. Without changes it would quickly become unaffordable. These changes make the scheme simpler and more sustainable into the future. • The changes will save $448 million over four years, which can be used for other Government priorities like improving frontline public services or reducing borrowing. • The changes will mean lower income families receive a greater slice of WFF funding over time. What is changing? • The next four times Family Tax Credit (FTC) payments are adjusted for inflation: o The WFF abatement threshold will decrease by $477 on the first adjustment, and thereafter each time by $450. o The WFF abatement rate will increase each time by 1.25 cents in the dollar. • After those four adjustments, WFF will therefore have: o A slightly lower abatement threshold of $35,000, compared to the current $36,827. o A slightly higher abatement rate of 25 cents in the dollar, compared to the current 20 cents in the dollar (this means WFF payments will reduce faster as income increases). • As the law already prescribes, FTC payments will next be adjusted for inflation on 1 April 2012, and thereafter every time CPI inflation cumulatively reaches 5 per cent or more. On current forecasts these further changes are expected to occur on 1 April 2014, 1 April 2016 and 1 April 2018. • In addition, inflation adjustments to FTC payments for children aged 16 and over will be temporarily halted until payment rates for children aged 13 to 15 catch up with them, as they will after successive inflation adjustments (this will reduce the number of different FTC payment categories from five to three). • The Government is making these changes gradually to minimise the impact on affected families. What does this mean for a family’s WFF payments next year? • The table below shows the FTC payment rates that are expected to apply in the 2012/13 tax year (ie, from 1 April 2012), based on current inflation forecasts. These are the maximum payment rates that apply to families below the new abatement threshold of $36,350. Above this threshold, FTC payments will reduce by 21.25 cents for every dollar of family income. Family Tax Credit amounts Current payment rates for the 2011/12 tax year Forecast payment rates for the 2012/13 tax year Eldest Child if under 16 $88.03$92.64 Eldest Child if 16 or over $101.98$101.98 Subsequent child rate if under 13 $61.19$64.38 Subsequent child rate if 13 to 15 $69.78$73.43 Subsequent child rate if 16 or over $91.25$91.25 • It is impossible to say with any certainty what an individual family will receive from one year to the next – this depends on whether there has been any change in their family income; whether they have any more children; whether any of their children have moved into a different payment category; whether any of their children have got a job, gone on a benefit, left home, or turned 18 and are no longer at school or in tertiary education; and when exactly in the year any of these events happen. • For a great many families, these sorts of changes will be far more important than small adjustments to FTC rates or abatement. • Nonetheless, officials have made estimates of how 1 April 2012 changes affect families, assuming that their circumstances next year – including their children's ages - are identical to how they are now. • Based on these estimates, families earning below the new abatement threshold of $36,350 will: o Receive an average of $7 extra WFF tax credits per week. o Receive the full increase in FTC if they have children aged under 16 years. o Receive the same amount of FTC for children aged 16-18 years. • It is estimated about 280,000 families earning less than $70,000 a year will receive an increase in WFF payments, while about 110,000 families – mostly earning over $60,000 a year will receive slightly less. Of this second group about 7,000 families will no longer be eligible for WFF in the 2012/13 year. • The table below outlines the estimated effect of 1 April 2012 changes by income band. Family income Families who receive less WFF on 1 April 2012 Families who receive more WFF on 1 April 2012 Number Average change $ per week Number Average change $ per week Up to $10,000 – – 16,467 7.02 $10,000 to $20,000 – – 87,452 6.93 $20,000 to $30,000 – – 60,177 6.56 $30,000 to $40,000 N/A N/A 37,501 7.31 $40,000 to $50,000 11,307 -2.68 29,928 2.77 $50,000 to $60,000 11,757 -1.87 27,455 2.70 $60,000 to $70,000 23,982 -3.45 10,984 2.62 $70,000 to $80,000 29,681 -4.44 N/A N/A $80,000 to $90,000 20,597 -5.43 N/A N/A $90,000 to $100,000 4,641 -5.14 – – $100,000 to $110,000 N/A N/A – – Above $110,000 N/A N/A – – TOTAL 109,120 278,168 NB: “N/A” represents sample sizes sufficiently small that they are below the margin of error and therefore cannot be reported. • For the reasons outlined on the previous page this is not be an accurate guide for individual families.

Page 1 26 May 2011 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Taxation (Canterbury Earthquake Measures) Act 2011 Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions to employees Working for Families: family scheme income – “other payment” category Extension of the redundancy tax credit Tax relief for donated trading stock This special report provides early information on changes contained in the Taxation (Canterbury Earthquake Measures) Bill enacted on 24 May 2011. This special report precedes coverage of the new legislation that will appear in a Tax Information Bulletin to be published later this year. Tax relief for employers’ welfare contributions to employees Changes included in the Taxation (Canterbury Earthquake Measures) Act 2011 provide an exemption for certain welfare contributions made by an employer to employees as a result of the two major Canterbury earthquakes. The exemption may be applied to: • accommodation; • “sundry” fringe benefits when the employer cannot reasonably estimate which employees received which benefits; and • the first $3,200 per earthquake of monetary remuneration and fringe benefits of the kind where the employer can reasonably be expected to know which employees received which benefits. Background Under existing tax law (with a few limited exclusions), payments made from an employer to an employee and fringe benefits provided to an employee are taxable, either as monetary remuneration or by way of fringe benefit tax (FBT). Following the major Christchurch earthquakes of 4 September 2010 and 22 February 2011, a number of employers made ex gratia welfare contributions of cash or benefits to their earthquake-affected employees. Several requests were made asking that these contributions not be subject to taxation. Page 2 On 28 March 2011, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue released details of changes to tax legislation agreed to by Cabinet, including three inter-linked tax exemptions for employers and their employees for earthquake-related employer welfare contributions. Key features Income tax exemption New section CZ 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that income (which could include accommodation benefits) derived by an employee from an employer is exempt income if: • it was provided by the employer for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes of 4 September 2010 or 22 February 2011, as defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011; • otherwise it would have been taxable income; • it was derived in the eight weeks after each of these earthquakes; • it was not paid in substitution for wages or salary; • the amount provided does not depend on the seniority of the employee; • the employee is associated with the employer, it was also available to an unrelated full- time employee; and • the employer elects to treat the income as being exempt income of the employee. Extent of the exemption All accommodation benefits as defined in section CE 1(2) are exempt. In relation to each of the two major earthquakes the first $3,200 paid to each employee, other than accommodation benefits, is also exempt. Fringe benefit tax exemption New section CZ 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that benefits received by an employee from an employer are exempt from FBT if: • it was provided by the employer to employees for the purpose of relief of employees from the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquakes of 4 September 2010 or 22 February 2011, as defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011; • otherwise it would have been a fringe benefit; • it was received by the employee in the eight weeks after each of these earthquakes; • it was not provided in substitution for wages and salary; • its provision and amount does not depend on the seniority of the employee; • the employee is associated with the employer, it was also available to an unrelated full- time employee; and • the employer elects to treat the benefit as not being a taxable benefit. Page 3 Extent of the exemption All “sundry benefits” are exempt – for example, benefits that were provided at a drop-in centre. Often, if not always in this case an employer would have no idea which employee had received what benefits. Accordingly, if the employer cannot estimate the value of these benefits provided to each employee, they are treated as exempt. If the employer can estimate the value of a benefit that an employee has received in relation to one of the two earthquakes, it will be exempt FBT to the extent that the $3,200 employee exemption for that earthquake has not been used to exempt employee income. Application date These amendments are treated as coming into force on 4 September 2010. Working for Families: family scheme income – “other payment” category The “other payments” category in the definition of “family scheme income” has been amended to ensure payments given to support people affected by events such as the Canterbury earthquakes in September 2010 and February 2011, and other similar events in the future, are excluded from the definition of family scheme income for up to 12 months. Background The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 introduced a more comprehensive definition of “family scheme income”. This new definition of family scheme income applies for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, and community services cards for those with dependent children, from 1 April 2011. The definition will also be used for student allowance parental income test purposes when the necessary regulations come into force later this year. People adversely affected by the Canterbury earthquakes have received payments from relatives and employers to help them to recover from the earthquakes, replace damaged items and meet everyday living expenses. Under the new definition of family scheme income, these payments could be potentially included in family scheme income, affecting the recipient’s entitlements to various benefits including WFF tax credits. Key features The Taxation (Canterbury Earthquake Measures) Act 2011 ensures that payments given to support people adversely affected by the Canterbury earthquakes, and similar events in the future, are excluded from the definition of family scheme income. Section MB 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended so that payments made to relieve the adverse effects of emergency events declared by the Commissioner are excluded from the “other payment” category in the family scheme income definition for a specified period of up to 12 months. Page 4 New section 91AAS of the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner to make a determination declaring an event, which meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of “emergency” in section 4 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, an emergency event for family scheme income purposes. The requirements of these paragraphs generally relate to a state of emergency caused by natural disasters. The determination also specifies a period of up to 12 months from the date of the event. The Commissioner will make the determinations in relation to the Canterbury earthquakes and the determinations will be published in a future issue of the Tax Information Bulletin. Application date The amendments come into force on 1 April 2011. Extension of the redundancy tax credit As part of Budget 2010, the redundancy tax credit was cancelled with effect for redundancies after 30 September 2010, the date that the 33% tax rate applied from. Following the 4 September 2010 earthquake this was reconsidered, and cancellation was delayed so that it applied to redundancies after 31 March 2011. As a consequence of the 22 February 2011 earthquake, the cancellation of the redundancy tax credit has been further delayed so that it will now apply to redundancies after 30 September 2011. If the redundancy is on or before 30 September 2011, the tax credit will apply according to subpart ML. On 1 April 2012 subpart ML and the section YA 1 redundancy definition will be repealed. Application dates The extension is treated as coming into force on 1 April 2011, the previous date of cancellation. The cancellation is effective 30 September 2011, and the relevant legislation is itself repealed on 1 April 2012. Tax relief for donated trading stock This item provides information on the tax treatment for businesses that have made, or are contemplating making, donations (or supplies for less than market value) of trading stock for relief from the Canterbury earthquakes. Changes introduced in the new Act provide that: • an anti-avoidance rule applying to disposals of trading stock at below market value does not apply to disposals of trading stock by a person to a person who is not an associated person for the purpose of relief from the adverse effects of a Canterbury earthquake in the period beginning on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2012; and Page 5 • a gift by a person to a person who is not an associated person shall not constitute a dutiable gift if the gift is of trading stock, and made for the purpose of relief from the adverse effects of a Canterbury earthquake, and made within the period beginning on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2012. Background Under the current rules (with a few limited exclusions), a person who disposes of trading stock for no consideration, or an amount that is less than the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal, is treated as deriving an amount equal to the market value of the trading stock at the time of disposal. Gift duty is also payable on dutiable gifts made by a person if they exceed an aggregate value of $27,000 in a 12-month period. For gift duty purposes, a gift is something given, other than by will, when the person making the transfer (the donor) does not receive fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth. Following the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011, several public calls were made to Ministers and officials seeking legislation to provide tax relief for donated goods, especially trading stock donated by businesses. On 28 March 2011, the Minister of Revenue and the Minister of Finance released details of proposed changes to tax legislation agreed to by Cabinet, including an exemption so that businesses do not have to pay tax or gift duty on trading stock they have donated within four months of either the 4 September 2010 or 22 February 2011 Canterbury earthquakes. In response to feedback received following this announcement, Cabinet agreed to extend the eligible period for the tax relief so that it covered the period beginning on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2012. Key features Donations of trading stock for relief of Canterbury earthquakes New section GZ 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that section GC 1 (Disposals of trading stock at below market value) does not apply to the disposal of trading stock by a person to a person who is not an associated person: • for the purpose of relief from the adverse effects of a Canterbury earthquake, as defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011; and • in the period beginning on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2012. The meaning of trading stock in new section GZ 3 is that contained in section EB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Page 6 Exemption for certain gifts of trading stock New section 73B of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 provides that a gift by a person to another person who is not associated under the Income Tax Act 2007 will not be subject to gift duty if the gift is: • of trading stock as defined in section EB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007; • made for the purpose of relief from the adverse effects of a Canterbury earthquake, as defined in section 4 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011; and • made within the period beginning on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2012. Application date The application date for the changes providing tax relief for donated trading stock is 4 September 2010.

SPEECH

### Keynote Adress to  
KPMG 2011 Christchurch Tax Briefing

#### Russely Golf Club, Christchurch  
4pm Thursday 9 June 2011

Good afternoon.

Much has happened recently on the tax front which is of direct relevance to you and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about this afternoon.

But first, let me say that I am very pleased to be here today.

Pleased to be invited to the KPMG Tax briefing, but especially pleased to be back in Christchurch.

The fact that you have organised a conference and are holding it here in Christchurch, tells me that you are getting back to business as usual.

And that is precisely what Christchurch needs.

It is at once a vote of confidence in this city and a practical means of helping in its rebuilding and reinvigoration.

### Earthquake

Just as you are doing your bit, I can assure you the Government is completely committed to doing its large chunk of that job too.

To help Christchurch get back to business, Parliament last month passed legislation which will provide earthquake relief to the citizens and businesses of Canterbury.

I am sure you are familiar with the content of the legislation, but briefly, it:

*   provides an exemption from tax and gift duty on trading stock businesses have donated for earthquake relief;
*   makes certain welfare contributions made by employers to their employees tax-free;
*   extends the redundancy tax credit from its current end date of 31 March to 30 September 2011;
*   ensures that certain payments do not count as family income where people receive Working for Families tax credits.

These changes to tax legislation were necessary - our current tax laws were simply not designed for such extraordinary circumstances as disaster on the combined scale of the two Christchurch quakes

Also Orders in Council have been promulgated, the most important of which gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue significant flexibility with regard to deadlines for tax obligations.

Inland Revenue also swung into action over charities and donations, providing operational solutions and timely advice around the interpretation of current law and the tax treatment of donations and the charitable status of particular organisations.  
  
I was especially pleased with a flyer the department sent out with its end of year charitable tax credit claim forms letting donors know that they could donate their tax credits, or rebates, to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.

I understand that at least $80,000 has been donated to the Appeal through this initiative alone.  
  
The Commissioner and his officials have also encouraged charitable donations from overseas by contacting overseas jurisdictions to help smooth the tax treatment of donations to the Appeal.

I am delighted that these practical measures have been well received by national and Christchurch-based tax communities.

This is still an evolving situation, with new challenges and issues arising all the time, so I expect to bring further earthquake-related depreciation changes to the House later this year.

On a human level, along with everyone else in Christchurch, Inland Revenue staff have, naturally been affected by the earthquake.

Like KPMG and much of Christchurch's CBD, Inland Revenue staff are working from temporary office space.

The department has a number of its people working in the community and with other agencies including the Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Economic Development, Department of Labour, Canterbury Development Corporation and Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce.

The department is assisting CERA with economic data for the purposes of modelling to understand the economic impacts of the earthquakes.

CERA is also getting hands-on help from the department, with a number of Inland Revenue staff seconded to it.

I would like to turn now to the Budget handed down last month..

### Budget 2011

Budget 2010 set the scene last year when it brought in a number of changes to strengthen our tax system.

A sound tax system is a good platform for Government to begin consolidating and strengthening the economy and getting on with rebuilding Christchurch and both its and the national economy.

If we are to ride out future economic shocks, we urgently need to reduce our dependence on overseas debt, build up our capital and return the economy to surplus as quickly as possible.

If we cast our eyes overseas, the outlook is not encouraging.

Japan, reeling from the twin onslaught of a devastating earthquake and lethal tsunami, compounded by the threat of nuclear power station meltdown, is going to have an effect on world markets.

Ireland, not so long ago trumpeted as an economic miracle, has now joined the company of Portugal, Spain and Greece, and is noted today for its economic woes.

The Government is determined to avoid that fate for New Zealand.

I think Budget 2011 has gone a long way to warding that off.

Notably, we have preserved our credit rating and that has been achieved by delivering a Budget that addressed certain key points - curbing government spending and improving national savings while still continuing to meet the Government's obligations and take account of other priorities.

To weather future economic shocks, it is crucial that spending is contained and focused on those who really need it.

The changes to Working for Families and KiwiSaver will make these programmes more sustainable by focusing them better to ensure that Government spending is directed to where it is needed most and eliminating unsustainable spending.

### Working for Families

The cost of Working for Families has roughly doubled from about $1.5 billion in 2005/06 to about $2.8 billion this year.

In the current economic environment, that level of spending is no longer sustainable, if ever it was.

Indeed, without changes, the scheme would quite quickly become unaffordable.

The government was not prepared to entertain that possibility, so acted now to secure Working for Families for the future.

Therefore, Working for Families recipients on higher incomes will find their tax credits will reduce at a faster rate and the reductions will begin at an earlier point in their salary scale.

Some will no longer qualify.

I think New Zealanders have recognised that is simply fair and necessary.

The amount paid for older teenagers will not be indexed for inflation until the amounts for younger children catch up.

All Family Tax Credit amounts will then be adjusted for inflation.

Together, these changes will save $448 million over the next four years, as against what the scheme was forecast to cost.

The total cost of Working for Families will reduce to $2.6 billion in 2014/15, yet the scheme remains a generous one and targeted to assist those most in need.

Low income families and beneficiaries will be largely unaffected by these changes, and the majority of families currently receiving Working for Families will get an increase in their payments on 1 April 2012.

### KiwiSaver

The other big spending programme tackled by Budget 2011, was KiwiSaver.

First of all, let me say that the Government is committed to improving national savings, but it has to be real saving.

KiwiSaver has been good at encouraging the savings habit among New Zealanders, but like any taxpayer-funded programme, spending needs to be prudent.

Currently more than $1 billion a year of what goes into KiwiSaver accounts comes from the Government, through subsidies and tax breaks.

Over time, government has put in nearly half the money that now sits in KiwiSaver accounts.

This is not doing anything for national savings as the Government needs to borrow to pay that money into individuals' accounts.

Instead of contributing to national savings, it is putting us further into the red.

Under its current settings, it is certainly not sustainable.

To continue to be an efficient part of the savings landscape, KiwiSaver needs to be an affordable retirement saving scheme for members, employers, and taxpayers.

The changes to KiwiSaver will ensure the future of KiwiSaver by making the scheme more affordable, while continuing to encourage real savings through a higher level of private contributions.

By any measure, Kiwisaver has been extraordinarily successful.

Today, more than 1.7 million New Zealanders are KiwiSavers, and that number is projected to reach 2 million next year.

Yet, when it was established, it was forecast that uptake would be far more modest - with only 700,000 KiwiSavers by 2015.

The government's fiscal projections of KiwiSaver's costs were based on those projections, so it has been important to act now to secure the scheme's long-term future.

### Thin capitalisation

And another change announced in Budget 2011 was the change to the minimum equity percentage for foreign-owned banks.

This will ensure that these banks pay their fair share of tax, better reflecting the higher levels of regulatory and commercial capital they now hold.

### Fairness

The Budget also announced upcoming reviews which had fairness as a major theme.

Consultation documents will be released later this year looking at the tax rules relating to three issues: employee benefits, the livestock valuation election rules and assets used both privately and to earn income.

If you have a view on these matters, I urge you to make a submission.

The intention of these reviews is to ensure we all pay our fair share of tax.

I will give you an overview of those three areas to be investigated, but first, let me say that I am not suggesting that people everywhere are ripping off the system.

Perhaps some are, but for the most part, people are simply operating within the current rules, which may, in some instances be more generous than they should be.

It is time to review these rules because the Government has a strong focus on ensuring fairness in the tax system.

Budget 2010 broadened the definition of income for social assistance purposes, such as entitlement to Working for Families, to provide a better measure of family income and to prevent people structuring their affairs to inflate their entitlements.

### Employee benefits

Now the question being considered is whether a wider range of benefits provided to employees should be included in the tax net.

Of particular concern is that, in some situations, salaries can be traded off for non-cash benefits which are not taxed.

One result is that people are not taxed equally or some receive entitlements under social assistance programmes that others do not.

This is unfair to the tax-paying public which foots the bill for these assistance programmes.

### Livestock valuation election

Some of you with rural clients or interests may be familiar with the livestock valuation election rules.

There are two main livestock valuation methods - the herd scheme and national standard cost and these differ in design and intent, and ultimately outcome, with substantial possible difference in values between them.

The fairness question that has arisen is when a farmer is able to switch back and forth between the two methods with relative ease, taking tax-free herd scheme gains when livestock values are increasing and tax deductible write-downs as values decrease.

The net result can be that the increases in market valuations go untaxed, while the tax system can allow decreases in valuation to be eligible for tax deductions.

I think ultimately people do have a sense of fairness and when they know that something is not fundamentally fair to all concerned, there is no particular protest when it is being put right.

An officials' issues paper is likely to be released on this in early July.

### Mixed use assets

After the Budget announcement of an upcoming review of the tax treatment of mixed use assets, there was some concern that Government was looking to impose what some media termed a "recreation tax".

Let me clear that up right now.

The Government has nothing against anyone owning a holiday home - good on you if you do.

An asset such as a holiday home that is used exclusively for private use and therefore with no tax deductions claimed, is not being looked at.

The Government's concern is best illustrated by the example of a family bach, used by the family five weeks a year, and rented out five weeks a year.

There is no issue with the owners claiming tax deductions relating to the five weeks per year that the bach is rented out, and it is clear that no deductions can be claimed for the five weeks per year when it is used by the family.

The question is whether it is fair for the owners to potentially be able to claim deductions for the 42 weeks per year that the bach is empty.

It seems to me that if deductions are allowed on a basis which is too generous, there would be two undesirable consequences.

First, it would be unfair on other taxpayers.

Second, it would provide an incentive to invest in these kinds of assets at a time when New Zealand needs more investment in productive sectors of the economy.

A discussion document will be issued later this year exploring this issue and calling for submissions.

In the meantime, I just say to some in the media that their excitement is unnecessary and inaccurate, that it is Labour that does envy taxes, not this government, and that in the end, fair is fair.

### Student Loans

The Budget also included announcements of changes to the Student Loans scheme.

Our loans scheme is one of the most generous in the world.

The question must be asked though, is this spending justified?

Can we afford it?

The scheme is important for ensuring ready access to tertiary education and the Government is committed to its continuation.

Indeed, the Government is committed to interest free loans, but is still looking at ways to improve value for money and personal responsibility.

However debt has mounted steadily since the scheme's introduction and some trimming is essential.

The proposed changes include:

*   Part-time, full-year students' course-related cost entitlements are to be removed.
*   The repayment threshold of $19,084 will be held until 2015.
*   Business and investment losses will not be allowed to reduce income for Student Loan purposes.
*   Eligibility for Student Loans will be restricted for those with an overdue student loan repayment obligation of $500 or more and who have been in default for one or more years from February 2012.
*   All new loan applications will require a contact person for study commencing after 1 January 2013.
*   The exemption to the two-year stand-down for new permanent residents will be extended to include people sponsored into New Zealand by a family member who was granted residence on the basis of their protected persons status.
*   Student loan eligibility for borrowers aged 55 and over will be restricted to tuition-fees only from 1 January 2013.
*   The repayment holiday for overseas based borrowers will be reduced from three years to one year, effective from 1 April 2012.
*   A cap on aviation fees of $39,273 (GST excl) will be introduced from 1 January 2012.

I will be introducing a bill containing the proposed changes to the House later this year

More immediately, there has been recent media coverage of the Government's new approach to collecting debt from defaulters in Australia which includes legal action.

This was a more proactive approach which began in November last year and has yielded some very good results with over $2 million in repayments collected in just the first six months of its operation.

Considering the results we have achieved in Australia, my colleague, the Minister of Tertiary Education, Hon Steven Joyce, and I are currently considering scaling up the initiative in both Australia and Britain.

I think it is important to ramp up our approach.

For too long a small group of borrowers have reneged on their loans which is unfair to taxpayers and also to those borrowers who are doing the right thing and repaying their loans.

### Compliance

Of course debt does not just exist in the Student Loan scheme.

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance as that is the most efficient way to gather taxes.

However not all taxpayers comply readily or pay their tax debts.

As I have said before, we all need to pay our fair share and the Government has a very strong focus on ensuring fairness in the tax system.

This is an ongoing effort and over the last two Budgets, measures have been introduced specifically aimed at ensuring we all pay our fair share of tax.

Budget 2010 allocated funding of $119.3 million over four years for:

*   reducing debt
*   uncovering and taxing the hidden economy, and
*   increasing property compliance

This is the sharp end of compliance and ensuring fairness.

It is giving teeth to be used as necessary when there are those who simply will not play their part and pay their taxes.

Inland Revenue has used this extra funding to enhance existing fraud and evasion work undertaken by the department.

It has focused on high-risk areas and has undertaken extra audit and educational work in the hospitality sector where its intelligence procedures have indicated non-compliance.

The additional funding has also allowed Inland Revenue to upgrade its intelligence-gathering capabilities and it is preparing to undertake compliance work across a range of industries in the coming year.

Stepping up their activities in recent times, there have been some notable successes including a voluntary disclosure for $2.2 million from one restaurant and prosecutions of several tax cheats.

You may have seen the media coverage.

Inland Revenue has also intensified efforts to prevent people falling into debt.

For example, a number of your clients will have received text messages, letters or phone calls reminding them to make their payments.

Leading up to the 7 February due date for paying 2010 income tax, the Inland Revenue reminder campaign achieved an 11 percent increase in assessments paid on time.

Of course, the Government is very aware of circumstances in Christchurch and taking people's and businesses' circumstances and realities into account.

"Fairness" is not just about tax cheats, but also about ensuring that tax debts are paid.

This is of course, subject to hardship and instalment arrangements in place with Inland Revenue.

Inland Revenue has the power to act reasonably and sensibly and I expect it to do so.

For example, after the February earthquake, to the extent possible, the Department halted all proactive debt recovery work in the earthquake-affected area.

As things start to return to something closer to normal, these activities will pick up again, but I am assured by the Commissioner that Inland Revenue is very conscious of the difficult position many in Christchurch face.

Next month Inland Revenue will again publish its areas of compliance focus.

These are specific areas where Inland Revenue has identified risk and is developing plans to address them.

You could help by also paying close attention in these areas.

As tax agents you wield significant influence in ensuring your clients play their part in making New Zealand a great place to live.

### Global Forum report

Overall, I am pleased with the progress we have made with our tax system and a recent international report just released, endorses this view, giving the New Zealand tax system a high pass mark when measured against the international standards for transparency and exchange of information.

A highly respected tax system is important in facilitating investment into New Zealand and makes it easier for New Zealand business to invest offshore

There is of course, room for improvement and we shall continue to do so.

### Conclusion

Improving the fairness of the tax system to ensure that we all pay our fair share of tax is ongoing work, and the Government is progressively eliminating unfairness.

The large majority of people do pay the right amount of tax, but there are a few who do not and Inland Revenue takes appropriate action to protect the integrity of the tax system.

I do not need to remind anyone here that the Government needs taxes in order to fund health, education, roading, justice, conservation and rebuilding Christchurch, along with a host of other essential services.

We all use these services, so we all need to contribute our fair share to the funding.

I hope your conference is enjoyable and productive.

Answer: Yes, the Most Favoured Nation obligation was triggered on 1 May 2010. From that date, the following provisions shall apply as if they had been specified in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Mexican DTA. The dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident at a rate exceeding 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner of those dividends is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends. The dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned, directly or indirectly through one or more residents of either Contracting State, shares representing 80 per cent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a 12 month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends meets one or more of the following criteria: (a) The company has its principal class of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (iv)(a) and (b) of the definition below and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges specified in paragraph (iv). (b) The company is owned directly or indirectly by one or more companies: (I) whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (iv)(a) and (b) of the definition below and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges specified in paragraph (iv); or (II) which, if that company or each of those companies owned directly the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid, would be entitled to equivalent benefits in respect of such dividends under a tax treaty between the State of which that company is a resident and the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident. (c) The company does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (a) or (b) but the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State determines that the first sentence of the following paragraph does not apply. The competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall consult the competent authority of the other Contracting State before refusing to grant benefits under this subparagraph. The new, lower rates shall not apply if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of those new rates. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. The term �recognised stock exchange� means: the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, BMV); the securities markets (other than the New Zealand Debt Market) operated by New Zealand Exchange Limited; and any other stock exchange agreed upon by the competent authorities. Competent Authority Determinations Question: With respect to the previous question, how do I apply for a competent authority determination that a zero-rate of withholding tax will apply to the payment of a particular dividend? Answer: You will need to apply in writing to the relevant taxation authority requesting competent authority consideration of the matters by setting out in some detail the relevant facts and circumstances of your case, before payment of the relevant dividend.

29 July 2011 Mexico double tax agreement – frequently asked questions Lower non-resident withholding tax rates for dividends Question: Has the Most Favoured Nation obligation contained in Article 9 of the Protocol to the double tax agreement between New Zealand and Mexico (“the Mexican DTA”), that relates to the treaty withholding rate for dividends, been triggered? Answer: Yes, the Most Favoured Nation obligation was triggered on 1 May 2010. From that date, the following provisions shall apply as if they had been specified in paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Mexican DTA. i. The dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident at a rate exceeding 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner of those dividends is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends. ii. The dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State that has owned, directly or indirectly through one or more residents of either Contracting State, shares representing 80 per cent or more of the voting power of the company paying the dividends for a 12 month period ending on the date the dividend is declared and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends meets one or more of the following criteria: (a) The company has its principal class of shares listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (iv)(a) and (b) of the definition below and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges specified in paragraph (iv). (b) The company is owned directly or indirectly by one or more companies: (I) whose principal class of shares is listed on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (iv)(a) and (b) of the definition below and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges specified in paragraph (iv); or (II) which, if that company or each of those companies owned directly the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid, would be entitled to equivalent benefits in respect of such dividends under a tax treaty between the State of which that company is a resident and the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident. (c) The company does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (a) or (b) but the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State determines that the first sentence of the following paragraph does not apply. The competent authority of the first- mentioned Contracting State shall consult the competent authority of the other Contracting State before refusing to grant benefits under this subparagraph. iii. The new, lower rates shall not apply if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of those new rates. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. iv. The term “recognised stock exchange” means: (a) the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, BMV); (b) the securities markets (other than the New Zealand Debt Market) operated by New Zealand Exchange Limited; and (c) any other stock exchange agreed upon by the competent authorities. Competent Authority Determinations Question: With respect to the previous question, how do I apply for a competent authority determination that a zero-rate of withholding tax will apply to the payment of a particular dividend? Answer: You will need to apply in writing to the relevant taxation authority requesting competent authority consideration of the matters by setting out in some detail the relevant facts and circumstances of your case, before payment of the relevant dividend. For New Zealand subsidiaries of Mexican parent companies, please direct your correspondence to: New Zealand Competent Authority International Audit Unit Large Enterprises P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Your letter to the New Zealand Competent Authority should include the following: • background details as to corporate structure since 1 January 2008; • any material changes in capital structure since 1 January 2008; • recent trading history (including why the dividend is unimputed); • confirmation that the 80% voting power requirement has been met; and • why it is considered the first sentence of the third paragraph of the criteria set out above does not apply.

### Feedback sought on options for tax fairness

Two issues papers released today for public consultation continue the Government's focus on ensuring fairness in the tax system, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne say.

The issues papers, which were announced in Budget 2011, provide options for making the tax system fairer in two areas:

Livestock valuation - this paper presents options for fairer rules covering livestock valuation elections. Mr Dunne says the current rules appear to be too loose, allowing farmers to switch between valuation methods providing an unfair tax advantage.

Mixed use assets - this paper provides options to address unfairness in the tax treatment of assets such as holiday houses used for both private and income-earning purposes.

Mr Dunne says unfairness arises when some owners claim their house is available for rent during the significant periods of the year the house is empty.

"This provides them with a basis for claiming tax deductions for expenses relating to the period the property is empty. Claiming these deductions could be regarded as unfair, particularly if the owner holds the asset primarily for private enjoyment," Mr Dunne says.

Officials are also working on a third issues paper focusing on the tax and social assistance treatment of salary traded off for other benefits. This will be released separately once policy analysis is complete.

"Tax dollars are needed for a wide range of government services such as health, education, justice, lowering the road toll, reducing family violence, immunisation programmes and conservation," Mr Dunne says. "Taxes also pay for work in Christchurch on roads, hospitals, schools and emergency recovery.

Mr English says it's important that everyone pays their fair share of tax.

"By tightening the rules around property investment, aligning the top personal and the trustee tax rates and by ensuring greater fairness in social assistance programmes, Budget 2010 had a strong focus on fairness and integrity of the tax system.

"Today's announcement continues that focus," Mr English says.

The closing date for submissions is 30 September 2011. The two issues papers and fact sheet are available on the Inland Revenue policy website at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/year/2011

### Mixed-use assets – fact sheet

#### Overview

The officials’ issues paper – Mixed-use assets – suggests new tax rules for determining the deductibility of expenditure relating to assets used both privately and for income earning (mixed-use assets).

A review of the deductions available for mixed-use assets was announced as part of Budget 2011.

The suggested new rules categorise mixed-use assets into different groups based on the underlying use of the asset, and prescribe the level of deductions that owners in each group can claim.

The suggested new rules apply to assets:

*   used for both private and income earning purposes;
*   that have a cost of $50,000 or more (except land where the rules apply no matter the cost);
*   that are unused for at least two months of the year; and
*   rented on a short-term basis.

The suggested new rules apply to assets held by partnerships, by trusts, and by companies that are close companies, qualifying companies and look-through companies.

#### Why?

When assets (for instance, holiday homes, planes and yachts) are used partly for private purposes and partly to derive assessable income, it is necessary to determine what proportion of expenses can be deducted in deriving that income.

However, deciding whether expenditure is attributable to income earning use (deductible expenditure), or to the private use of the asset (non deductible expenditure), can be difficult. The problem is particularly evident if expenditure relates to periods where the asset is not being used.

_**Example**_

A family holiday house is used by the owner and the owner’s family for 5 weeks of the year and rented out for 5 weeks of the year.

There is no concern about the family claiming deductions which relate to the 5 weeks the holiday house is rented. It is equally clear that no deductions can be claimed for the 5 weeks when the holiday house is used by the owner and the owner’s family.

The issue is to what extent the family should be able to claim deductions which relate to the 42 weeks of the year the holiday house was empty?

Currently, some owners are claiming that their property is available for use for the time when the property is not in use. This provides them with a basis for claiming tax deductions for expenses relating to the period the property is empty.

This amount of deductions could be regarded as overly generous. In reference to the example, it doesn’t seem fair or appropriate for the owner to claim expenses for the full 42 weeks when the holiday house was not in use, given the personal and rental use was equal and if the main reason why the family acquired the holiday house was for their private enjoyment.

#### The options

The issues paper suggests two options that prescribe the level of deductions owners of mixed use assets can claim.

The first is referred to as the two-outcome option. This option distinguishes between asset owners who can claim all expenditure for unused time and those who can claim none. For the owner to be able to claim all expenditure for unused time, the following criteria must be met:

*   the asset must be used to earn income for 62 days or more in a year;
*   the asset must be marketed as available for rental in a realistic way for the entire period in which it is reasonable to rent it out; and
*   private use must be less than 15 percent of income earning use.

The second is referred to as the three-outcome option. This option distinguishes between owners who can claim all expenditure for unused time, those who can claim some, and those who can claim none. For the owner to be able to claim all expenditure, the following criteria must be met:

*   the asset must be used to earn income for 62 days or more in a year;
*   the asset must be marketed in a realistic way for the entire period in which it is reasonable to rent it out; and
*   private use must be less than 10 percent of income earning use.

Under the three-outcome approach, if the first two criteria are met, but private use is more than 10 percent of income earning use, a proportion of expenditure attributable to the unused period will be deductible.

Both options attempt to draw objective boundaries between those asset owners that are likely to have mainly an income earning objective and those whose main objective is to use the asset privately

The options will apply to mixed-use assets held in partnerships, trusts, and companies that are close companies, qualifying companies and look-through companies (with private use being treated as use by a partner, a settlor, a beneficiary or an associate of any of them).

### Mixed-use assets – questions and answers

**Q: Why is the Government looking to change the rules in this area?**

A: The changes suggested are about fairness. For example, under the current rules, the owner of, say, a holiday house can rent the property out for a few days a year even though its main purpose is to provide holiday accommodation for the owner and the owner’s family. Unfairness arises because some owners claim that the house is available for rent during the significant periods of the year when the house is empty. This provides them with a basis, under current law, for claiming tax deductions for expenses relating to the period the property is empty. The result is often inflated tax deductions used to offset not only the rental income, but also other income such as salary and wages.

**Q: What assets will be covered by any new rules?**

A: The suggested new rules would apply to assets that:

*   are used for both private and income earning purposes;
*   have a cost of $50,000 or more (except land where the rules would apply irrespective of cost);
*   are unused for at least two months of the year; and
*   are rented out on a short-term basis.

However, these are only suggestions and submissions are sought on what assets should be subject to the suggested new rules.

**Q: When will these proposals become law?**

A: Officials are seeking submissions on the options outlined in the issues paper. Only after officials have considered the feedback will final proposals be developed. It is likely that proposals will be submitted to Government for decisions sometime next year.

**Q: How many people could be affected if the rules are changed?**

A: Officials expect that around 15,000 mixed-use residential properties may be affected. Other assets that may be affected include assets such as yachts and aircraft which are both rented out and used privately.  
  
**Q: How much revenue will this raise?**

A: The suggested changes would be revenue positive. Exactly how much additional revenue would be collected depends on the shape of the final proposals.

**Q: Will new rules in this area increase complexity?**

A: The approaches outlined in the issues paper attempt to strike a balance between fairness, certainty and complexity. Two approaches are suggested - one approach presents a relatively simple method of prescribing allowable deductions, while the other provides a slightly more complex solution – but arguably with fairer results. Whether and by how much complexity increases will depend on which approach is adopted.

While the new rules may be more complex to apply, they would provide additional certainty to taxpayers as they clearly prescribe the amount of deductions that may be claimed.

**Q: How do other countries deal with this issue?**

A: This concern is not unique to New Zealand. A number of other countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have developed rules along similar lines to determine the deductions that mixed-use asset owners can claim.

**Q: What will this do to values of holiday homes?**

A: It is difficult to predict the effect on property values, as no firm proposals have been developed. In addition, property values are influenced by numerous factors, the tax rules being just one. It is very difficult to isolate the effect that changes to tax rules may have on this process. However, officials expect that any changes made will have limited effects.

**Q: Will this increase the costs of renting a holiday home?**

A: Again, various factors influence the cost of renting a holiday home, the tax rules being just one.

Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill introduced
=============================================

A bill tabled in Parliament today proposes a number of changes to improve the efficiency and fairness of the student loan scheme, and encourage borrowers to take greater responsibility for their loan repayments. They include measures to improve current loan repayment levels, removing the ability to offset losses against a borrower’s net income in order to reduce their repayment obligation, reducing the current repayment holiday period from three years to one year and requiring borrowers to apply for the repayment holiday.

### Dunne: student loan ‘contact person’ to become law

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has tabled new student loan legislation in Parliament to make it mandatory to provide a New Zealand-based contact person when applying for repayment holidays, which will also be cut from three years to one year for those travelling overseas.

The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill introduced in Parliament today contains reforms announced in Budget 2011 and follows on from the Student Loan Scheme Act passed by Parliament last month which allows for defaulters’ loans to be recalled in full.

The Student Loans Budget package included a change requiring every new loan application received by StudyLink to include a contact person as a condition of getting a student loan. This bill will allow for that contact information to be provided to Inland Revenue by StudyLink.

“Essentially, we are cleaning up the whole area around defaulting on student loans and addressing the overall size of student loan debt,” Mr Dunne said.

“This latest bill contains a range of amendments designed to improve the rate of repayments,” he said.

The key features include:

*   Providing for Inland Revenue to receive details of a borrower’s contact person from StudyLink, which manages student loans applications. Every new loan application must include a contact person as a condition of accessing a student loan.
*   excluding losses from the calculation of income for student loan repayment purposes
*   reducing the repayment holiday from three years to one
*   requiring borrowers to apply for their repayment holiday and provide a contact person when they do so.

“New Zealand’s student loan scheme is one of the more generous ones internationally, but this comes at a real cost to taxpayers.

“These changes will make the scheme fairer for taxpayers as well as for the vast majority of loan borrowers who do the right thing,” he said.

Mr Dunne said the move towards Inland Revenue and StudyLink having access to a compulsory contact person when taking out a student loan would counter the problems that have occurred where students head off overseas and are lost track of, making it difficult to enforce repayment.

Inland Revenue currently holds overseas addresses for less than a quarter of the estimated 91,000 overseas-based borrowers. In addition to this, it also holds details for nominated people for some overseas-based borrowers.

“When Inland Revenue has a contact person for a borrower – probably in most cases a close relative – there can be a useful reminder from home that this debt is still there and needs to be met, and there are some pretty clear ramifications if you do not,” he said.

“It also gives Inland Revenue a clearer line for making contact with borrowers.”

Mr Dunne said reducing the repayment holiday for those travelling overseas from three years to one year was because three years has been perhaps overly generous and not useful in signalling to people that they still have an obligation to repay their loans, no matter where they are.

“By years two and three of their travels it is reasonable to assume people are earning income somewhere around the world, so it is equally reasonable to expect that they can resume their loan obligations,” he said.

Full details of the bill are available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz

### Speech

### Keynote Address to NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) 2011 Tax Conference

### Auckland, 9.30am Friday 11 November

Good morning and thank you for again inviting me to open this conference - New Zealand's premier tax conference.

We are almost at the end of the year and at the end of the first term of the current Government.

And what a year this one has been.

In just this past 12 months, we have not only had to continue to deal with the effects of the worst economic crisis in living memory, but we have also had to contend with some of New Zealand's worst earthquakes and more recently, the Rena foundering on the Astrolabe reef - New Zealand's worst maritime ecological disaster.

Add in Pike River and it truly has been New Zealand's annus horribilis.

Thank goodness for the Rugby World Cup, which was a treat for us all and a fillip for the nation's spirits at a time when we have sorely needed it.

But through this incredibly difficult time, I think we should take some time to reflect on what we have achieved because it is not inconsiderable.

The earthquakes and their ongoing effects have been the biggest combined event of the last 12 months.

#### Earthquake

On the tax front, in responding to them, legislation was passed in May that:

*   provided an exemption from tax and gift duty on trading stock that businesses donated for earthquake relief;
*   made certain welfare contributions made by employers to their employees tax-free;
*   extended again the redundancy tax credit, this time to 30 September 2011; and
*   ensured that certain payments do not count as family income where people receive Working for Families tax credits.

Orders in Council were also promulgated, addressing a range of issues, such as waiving interest on late tax payments and giving the Commissioner of Inland Revenue significant flexibility around easing deadlines for tax obligations.

More recently amendments to the depreciation rules which allow roll-over relief for depreciation recovery and to the timing of deemed sales of destroyed insured assets have been enacted.

Further earthquake-related work is under way, mainly in the depreciation and insurance claims area,

A thin capitalisation amendment is also proposed.

In response to the earthquake, New Zealanders opened their hearts and have displayed great generosity.

Many took up the option of not just donating, but also donating their tax credits as well to the Earthquake Appeal.

Latest figures show that just over 2100 people donated a total of $394,000 in donations tax credits to the Appeal.

For Christchurch, and nationally, the Government believes that we have in place the key components to stimulate the economy and promote growth and we expect to return to Budget surplus by 2014/15.

I would like to talk about some of the gains we have already made in the tax arena.

#### Removing obstacles to growth

Firstly, there are a number of significant ways in which are working to remove obstacles to growth.

To stimulate the economy, we can help level the playing field for New Zealand firms to allow them to expand and compete internationally, and the Government has been busy in this area.

The international tax rules have been progressively reformed to bring New Zealand's rules more into line with our international trading partners and help New Zealand-based businesses to compete more effectively in foreign markets.

Over the last year New Zealand has also continued to expand its tax treaty network.

A treaty with Turkey entered into force in July, while a treaty with Hong Kong signed last year is expected to enter into force this month.

Existing double tax agreements with Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are being renegotiated.

And two new DTAs are being negotiated - one with Vietnam and the other with Papua New Guinea.

Other work in this area includes extending our network of tax information exchange agreements.

These allow countries to exchange relevant information and are an important benchmark in meeting OECD standards for transparency.

They are also a tool for improving compliance.

#### Improving compliance

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance.

The good news is that the great majority of taxpayers comply with their tax obligations, because our system is essentially a simple, broad-based tax system.

And importantly to the person in the street - it makes sense and, crucially, is seen as fair.

Work continues on reducing complexity, improving fairness and maintaining the integrity in the tax system and some important gains have already been made.

Chief among these are the alignment of the top personal and trustee rates.

It has been said that every system is perfectly designed to produce the results that it does.

And this was certainly true of our tax system with its previous tax rates and the explosion of family trust-owned structures.

The Penny and Hooper case clearly illustrated that.

While the average taxpayer will always be likely to support Inland Revenue pursuing artificial and contrived arrangements that have the effect of allowing a few to avoid taxes that most pay and offend our basic sense of fair play that of itself is not a sufficient policy rationale for doing so.

We need to take a more balanced view.

Both the courts and Inland Revenue have made it clear that businesses are free to use company and trust structures - as long as these are not used in an artificial and contrived manner to try to defeat tax law.

I am pleased that Inland Revenue in its Revenue Alert moved quickly to allay fears of administrative over-reach as well as providing welcome clarity and guidance following the Penny and Hooper decision.

The department has again emphasised that they will focus only on the most serious and artificial cases.

To my mind, that is a very sensible and pragmatic approach.

The alignment of the top personal and trustee rates in Budget 2010 has reduced the future opportunity for such cases.

Also flowing out of Budget 2010 and related to these issues, an additional $274 million funding over 10 years was allocated to Inland Revenue to undertake increased compliance work in:

*   debt compliance
*   tackling the hidden economy
*   property compliance.

Improving compliance is a priority because it is important that everyone pays their fair share.

Taxes pay for our hospitals, schools, police, infrastructure, conservation work and generally the resources and assets we share as a common good in our society.

Inland Revenue reports that more tax is being paid on time and inroads are being made into the hidden economy with more people coming forward with voluntary disclosures.

For the year ended 30 June 2011

*   cash collected was $115.3 million against a target of $100 million, and
*   discrepancies raised totalled $137.8 million against a target of $83 million.

That is a very positive outcome and a healthy rate of return.

For debt compliance, the target rate of return for each dollar invested was 8:1 and the actual rate achieved was 9.5:1.

For the hidden economy, the target was 3.4:1 while the actual was 5.8:1.

And for property compliance, the target rate of 6.8:1 was surpassed with an actual rate of 7.5:1 achieved.

As I have said, the vast majority of taxpayers comply and it must be noted that Inland Revenue's emphasis is on prevention and assistance before it takes recovery and enforcement action.

Another issue that needs to be addressed is around foreign superannuation.

The current rules for taxing New Zealand residents on their foreign superannuation are complex, and in some situations it is not clear that they achieve the correct policy outcome.

A policy review of taxation of foreign pension schemes will be included in the work programme for next year.

A discussion document is expected be released in the first half of 2012, with legislation likely to be introduced in late 2012.

I am aware that there may be cases where taxpayers are not certain whether they have paid the correct amount of tax on their foreign superannuation.

I understand that Inland Revenue will be taking a pragmatic approach to such cases prior to the release of the discussion document

#### Reducing compliance costs

A good tax system also seeks to minimise compliance costs and here, too, we have made progress.

If part of the tax system is no longer working as intended or has become obsolete, and is simply imposing undue compliance costs, then questions must be asked about its continued existence.

That is a pretty good description of why gift duty is no longer in place.

It continued to impose $70 million of compliance costs on New Zealanders each year, while no longer serving its intended purpose.

It returned a pittance.

Something like a million a year for that $70 million in compliance costs.

It was a relic of the estate duty era, long since passed, and overtaken by other developments.

A range of existing rules in the Income Tax Act better target tax avoidance arrangements involving gifts.

And last year's Budget further reduced opportunities for avoidance by aligning the trust and top personal rates.

It is therefore a source of great personal satisfaction for me that on 1 October this year, gift duty was finally relegated to the history books.

Gift duty's abolition does not mean it is now open slather for people to be able to gift away assets in order to now qualify for various asset tested government programmes from which they would have been hitherto excluded.

Health and Ministry of Social Development officials have their own legislation to cover such situations, and we would expect that to be enforced no less vigorously now that gift duty has been abolished to prevent potential abuses. For its part, Inland Revenue will continue to monitor the situation, and a post-implementation review will ensure that existing measures are operating as intended.

From reducing compliance costs I would now like to turn to fiscal restraint - a prime focus for the Government.

#### Fiscal restraint

The global economic outlook remains fraught, with the United States and Eurozone hanging precariously on the edge of serious recession.

The uncertainty has of course affected us here with our recent sovereign credit downgrades, and this illustrates why it is crucial that we as a nation work to reduce debt and particularly our dependence on foreign debt.

The Government has repeatedly stated its intention to reduce expenditure.

This makes sense because fiscal restraint supports growth by building confidence.

Fiscal restraint and prudently managed debt gives the assurance that the government will not raise or impose further taxes so businesses can make plans for expansion and hire new staff.

And of course it also helps to keep interest rates low, which is good for growth.

So it was imperative that the Government acted to make efficiency savings.

As you know, Budget 2011 made adjustments to KiwiSaver, Working for Families and student loans - three large government spending programmes.

Take KiwiSaver as an example.

Before the Budget changes, more than $1 billion a year of what went into KiwiSaver accounts came from the Government, through subsidies and tax breaks.

This was doing nothing for national savings as the Government needed to borrow to pay that money into individuals' accounts.

Maintaining that level of expenditure was, frankly, dicing with debt.

Therefore, the changes we have made to Working for Families and to KiwiSaver will makes those schemes more targeted and more sustainable over the long term.

And I must stress that the Government is committed to KiwiSaver.

In fact, a one-off enrolment exercise, targeting employees who have not changed their jobs since the introduction of KiwiSaver in 2007 was recently announced by the Minister of Finance.

This exercise will take place in 2014/15 subject to returning to surplus, as part of the Government's programme to build genuine national savings.

A consultation paper on the design of the exercise will be released next year and will focus on costs for employers and administration costs of the scheme for government.

And the proposed changes to student loans which will tighten up the rules around eligibility and repayments will ensure that people can continue to access tertiary education without being a burden to taxpayers.

#### Conclusion

The Government's priorities are focused firmly on getting the New Zealand economy on its feet again and making it stronger than before and these are some of the measures that Government is taking to build confidence and stimulate the economy.

New Zealand received some significant knocks over the past year but we have responded to them well.

And from the successes we have had, you can see that the Government is supporting the business sector by providing an environment which creates jobs and wealth.

Thank you.

The intention of the proposed changes was to support the Government’s goal of a tax system that supports innovation and growth, without imposing unnecessary compliance costs upon taxpayers. With this in mind, the discussion document and forum outlined several proposals to reform the way tax is administered. The key proposals were to: • reduce the use of paper forms in administering the tax system and increase online services and technology, including a proposal to mandate the use of electronic services; • reform the PAYE and personal tax summary process, including a proposal to make PAYE a final tax for many taxpayers; and • introduce a new framework for sharing information, where appropriate and with safeguards, with other government agencies. While generally supportive of the overall objective to make tax administration more efficient by making greater use of online services, submissions were not supportive of the proposals to mandate their use, or of the proposal to make PAYE a final tax. The proposed changes in the bill take into account the views expressed by submitters, while still aiming to achieve the Government’s goals for an efficient, innovative tax system. The proposals include: • requiring taxpayers who choose to file a tax return to file tax returns for the previous four years as well as for the current year; • removing the requirement for taxpayers to file an income tax return merely because they receive Working for Families; • amalgamating the two main income tax return forms (the PTS and the IR 3 forms); • allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to authorise data storage providers to store their clients’ tax records offshore, and being able to revoke any such authorisation; and • allowing taxpayers who submit their returns electronically to store them electronically. Overall, these proposals should reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals, while helping Inland Revenue to achieve its goal of delivering the bulk of its services online in the future. The proposals will also be supplemented by an internal strategy aimed at moving taxpayers to electronic services. 4 As part of Inland Revenue’s drive for greater efficiency across Government, the new information-sharing framework raised in the discussion document Making tax easier was included in the recently enacted Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. 5 AMALGAMATING INCOME TAX RETURN FORMS (Clauses 15, 60, 74, 87, 88(11) and (12)(a)(i), 100(2), (5) and (6), 101, 102, 106, 107, 108, 109, 112, 114, 115−117, 121 and 123−129) Summary of proposed amendment The bill contains several clauses which will remove the distinctions between the two major income tax returns currently available for individual taxpayers to file – either a personal tax summary or an IR 3 income tax return. The result will be that the forms are effectively “amalgamated” and replaced with one income tax return form making the process simpler for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to deal with. Application date This amendment will apply for the 2014−15 and later tax years. Key features The two forms currently used by individual taxpayers will be replaced with a customised, web-based income tax return form. This will operate over a secure connection and will require taxpayers to answer questions about their income and expenses. Where possible, details will be pre-populated with information already held by Inland Revenue. Paper forms will be available only in limited circumstances. In order to deliver a simpler income tax return for individual taxpayers, the distinction between the two income tax returns will be removed. The proposed change is a significant step towards achieving Inland Revenue’s goal of delivering the major part of its services to taxpayers online. Background Tax simplification changes made in the 1999−2000 tax year introduced income statements into the tax Acts and the administration of individual filing requirements. Commonly referred to as personal tax summaries, they were designed for taxpayers who received the majority of their income from sources that had tax withheld, such as salaries and wages. They are pre-populated with any salary and wage information that Inland Revenue has about the individual. In addition to income statements, taxpayers with additional income that is not taxed at source must file an IR 3 income tax return, which is longer and more detailed than a personal tax summary. Many taxpayers have found the distinction between the two forms confusing, and identifying which form a taxpayer should file has, in the past, been resource-intensive for Inland Revenue. 6 Delivering tax returns through online services provides an opportunity for Inland Revenue to ask taxpayers about all of their income, instead of restricting it to the types of income information it has on record. In this way, tax returns can be tailored to individual requirements, and be as comprehensive or as simple as necessary. This policy change requires the repeal of Part 3A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This part was originally inserted in 1998 and is specific to the income statement process of tax filing. With the proposed amalgamation of the tax return forms, the rules in Part 3A around the issuing, receipt, details and processes of income statements are no longer necessary. References to income statements throughout the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007 will also be removed. To retain flexibility, the Commissioner will have the power under new section 92AC to make an income tax assessment for any person. The application date of the 2014−15 and later tax years has been chosen to allow sufficient time for implementation of the changes in Inland Revenue systems. Officials have taken this as an opportunity to re-write section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 − as new section 33AA. This provision is based on the premise in section 33 that all taxpayers must file, and sets out who is not required to file. It has been substantially altered since it was first enacted, so it has been re-written to make it more comprehensible. 7 REQUIRING TAXPAYERS WHO ELECT TO FILE TAX RETURNS TO FILE ACROSS THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS (Clauses 88(12)(a)(ii), 106 and 108) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will require taxpayers who are not required to file tax returns, but who choose to do so anyway, to file for the previous four tax years, in addition to the year in which they have chosen to file. Application date The “four year rule” proposal will have a phased application. It will apply for the 2014−15 and later tax years. Under this phased approach, taxpayers covered by the proposed amendment who elect to file on or after 1 April 2015 would file for the 2014−15 tax year and would square up only for that year. However, taxpayers covered by the proposed rule who choose to file for the 2015−16 tax year would also be required to file for the 2014−15 tax year if they had not already done so. It is proposed that the application would continue in this manner until it is fully phased in by 2019. For the 2018−19 tax year, taxpayers covered by the proposed policy who choose to file for that year, would be required to also file for the previous four tax years (2014−15, 2015−16, 2016−17 and 2017−18), if they have not already filed for those years. Key features The four-year rule is intended to apply to taxpayers who are not required to file a return of income under the proposed new section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under the proposed rule, when taxpayers in this category of non-compulsory filers choose to file a return, they will be required to file returns for the previous four years, in addition to the year in which they have chosen to file. Taxpayers will still be able to check their overall tax position for the back years before filing their returns, as is the current practice. This rule is also intended to be phased into application over four years. Background Currently, taxpayers who are not required to file a tax return, or be issued one by the Commissioner, can choose to have an assessment anyway. Over recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of taxpayers in this category choosing to have an assessment. For the 2004 tax year, approximately 200,000 taxpayers chose to submit a return, spread over 60 months. By 2007, the 8 volume of taxpayer-requested tax filing reached 200,000 tax returns in just seven months. This increase has been driven in part by an increased awareness of the ability for taxpayers to “cherry pick” the years in which they are due a refund of over-deducted PAYE withholding payments and then file in those years only. In the majority of cases they choose to not file in years when PAYE has been under-deducted. The net result to the Crown revenue is that Inland Revenue is paying out significant amounts of over-deducted PAYE, without collecting amounts of under-paid PAYE. The policy proposal to address this problem is to require taxpayers who are in the category of non-compulsory filers, and who choose to have an assessment, to file across the previous four tax years, with any over-deductions of PAYE potentially being offset by any under-deductions. The proposal does not prevent taxpayers from seeking refunds of overpaid tax, but introduces more fairness into the system than currently exists. 9 REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT TO FILE A TAX RETURN FOR TAXPAYERS WHO RECEIVE WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS (Clauses 88(12)(a)(i), 106, 108, 109, 111 and 120) Summary of proposed amendment Currently, taxpayers who receive Working for Families tax credits are required to file an income tax return or receive a personal tax summary. This requirement also extends to a recipient’s spouse or civil union or de facto partner. The proposed amendment will remove this requirement for Working for Families recipients who are not otherwise required by law to file an income tax return. Application date This amendment will apply for the 2014−15 and later tax years. Key features Under the proposed amendment, a Working for Families recipient (and their spouse, civil union or de facto partner) will no longer be required to file an annual tax return, if they are not otherwise required by law to file. They will, however, still be required to provide family scheme income information and family details to square up their Working for Families entitlement against their actual circumstances each year. It is estimated that the proposed amendment will remove the compliance cost of annual income tax return filing for 260,000 taxpayers. Background The key information that Inland Revenue needs to determine a family’s entitlement to Working for Families tax credits is a recipient’s family scheme income, and family details (such as the details of the children in their care). In the past, some of this information has been obtained by requiring recipients to file tax returns or receive a personal tax summary. This in turn has contributed to large numbers of taxpayers filing or receiving annual tax returns. Requiring this group to file an annual tax return to assess their annual income tax liability merely because they receive Working for Families is unnecessary. The amount of PAYE that has been withheld from recipients’ salary and wages is not needed to determine their entitlement to the tax credits. Depending on the source of their family income, some taxpayers will still be required to file an annual income tax return. Others will be able to file if they choose to. However, if they are not otherwise required by law to file a tax return, they will be subject to the new four-year rule. 10 SIMPLIFYING RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESSES (Clauses 103(2) and (3), 104 and 110) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments to modernise the record-keeping requirements of businesses by making it easier for taxpayers to store records offshore through applications from their data storage providers, and by allowing taxpayers who submit returns electronically to store them electronically. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Generally, taxpayers are required to store their records in New Zealand. As taxpayers are increasingly managing their tax obligations through their payroll or accounting software, the use of offshore data storage for information, records and returns is growing. While the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can authorise taxpayers to store their records offshore, applications can only be made individually. A proposed amendment will change who can apply, so that Inland Revenue-approved data storage providers can apply on behalf of their clients. This will make it easier for taxpayers to store their data offshore, if they choose. The Commissioner will also be able to revoke an authorisation. A further amendment proposes to allow taxpayers to submit and store tax returns electronically, thereby removing the current requirement to retain a hard copy. Background The proposed amendments have been developed to make it easier for taxpayers to conduct their tax compliance activities electronically, and to help Inland Revenue deliver the bulk of its services online. Inland Revenue will provide administrative criteria for the authorisation, which will outline the standards required of data storage providers. The principle for these proposals and for the criteria is that there should be no greater obligation on data storage providers than currently exists for the storing of business records in any other format, so long as the Commissioner’s access to those records is not unnecessarily compromised. 11 TAX TREATMENT OF PROFIT DISTRIBUTION PLANS 12 13 TAX TREATMENT OF PROFIT DISTRIBUTION PLANS (Clauses 6−10, 82, 83, 85, 88 and 108) Summary of proposed amendment The tax treatment of profit distribution plans (PDPs) is being amended so that shares issued under a PDP will be treated as a taxable dividend. This will mean PDPs are given the same tax treatment as other similar arrangements. Application date The amendments will apply to shares that are issued under PDPs from 1 July 2012. Background A PDP is a scheme used by companies to retain capital. Under a PDP a company issues bonus shares to all shareholders and offers to repurchase the shares immediately after the shareholder receives them. If the shareholder does not elect for the company to repurchase some or all of their bonus shares, the default option is for the shareholder to retain the bonus shares. The current tax treatment of PDPs was the subject of a specific Inland Revenue product ruling in 2005 (BR PRD 05/08). The ruling held that, subject to certain conditions, a distribution of shares under a PDP is treated as a non-taxable bonus issue and consequently does not constitute a dividend in the hands of the shareholder. If shareholders elect for their shares to be repurchased, the cash amount they receive is treated as a taxable dividend and imputation credits can be attached. In April 2009, the Government announced its intention to amend the law to ensure that bonus issues of shares distributed under PDPs are taxed in the same way as shares issued under other dividend reinvestment plans. In June 2009, officials released the consultative issues paper, The taxation of distributions from profit distribution plans. The issues paper proposed that a distribution of shares under a PDP should be treated as a taxable dividend. The key concerns that the Government has with the tax treatment of PDPs are: Inconsistent tax treatment with other arrangements There are other arrangements that are substantially similar to PDPs. For example, under both a dividend reinvestment plan and a bonus issue in lieu, shareholders are effectively given the choice of whether to receive shares or a cash dividend. Under these plans, regardless of whether shareholders receive shares or a cash dividend, they are treated as 14 receiving a taxable dividend. To ensure consistency and coherence in the tax system, a similar tax treatment should be afforded to PDPs. While accepting that the legal form of each plan differs, in substance they are the same and can be used as a means to retain capital in a company. Potential for imputation credit streaming The current tax treatment of PDPs effectively allows for streaming of imputation credits through a shareholder self-selection process. This can occur when shareholders elect for the company to repurchase their bonus shares depending on whether or not they can utilise imputation credits that would be attached to a cash dividend. Shareholders that are unable to utilise imputation credits (for example, exempt or non-resident taxpayers) may elect to receive bonus shares that are non-taxable. As the bonus shares are non- taxable, imputation credits will not be attached, preserving the credits for shareholders who can best use them. This defeats the current policy settings that are in place for the imputation system. Shareholders may not be taxed at their correct tax rate PDPs are attractive to shareholders on high personal tax rates, relative to alternative share reinvestment plans. This is because high-rate shareholders are able to choose to receive the non-taxable bonus issue of shares, meaning they are effectively taxed at the company tax rate, rather than at their personal tax rates. By contrast, New Zealand taxpayers on personal tax rates below the company tax rate will tend to prefer the cash dividend because the imputation credits attached to it will generally reduce their tax liabilities. The Government deferred its final decisions on the taxation of distributions from PDPs until after the Victoria University Tax Working Group (TWG) and the Capital Market Development Taskforce (the Taskforce) reported. While the TWG did not comment on PDPs, the Taskforce stated that it: ...considers it important that the tax system treats substitutable transactions neutrally. If PDPs are substitutable for ordinary dividend payments with optional reinvestment, the tax treatment should ideally be identical in both cases. The same goes for other close substitutes. Otherwise, there is a danger that investment decisions will be biased towards companies that offer PDPs, and that there could be significant loss of tax revenue from normal dividend taxation. At the same time, the Taskforce considers it desirable that the tax system does not impede the supply of capital. A decision on the tax treatment of PDPs should, therefore, take into account the fact that PDPs are an effective way for companies to raise capital. Recommendation: We recommend that changes to the tax treatment of PDPs should be made as part of a broader review of tax settings and take into account any adverse impacts on capital-raising costs. Following the Taskforce’s report, the Government decided that the tax treatment of PDPs should be amended as originally proposed. Consultative draft provisions were 15 sent to interested parties in May 2011, and the feedback received on the drafting has been taken into account in determining the changes made in this bill. Detailed analysis A definition of “profit distribution plan” is being inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007. In addition, amendments are being made to ensure that, for tax purposes, bonus shares issued under a PDP are treated in the same way as a bonus issue in lieu. These amendments include changes to the rules for available subscribed capital, resident withholding tax and non-resident withholding tax. If a shareholder elects, as part of the PDP, for the company to repurchase their shares, the cash amount they receive will not be treated as a taxable dividend, but rather the receipt of the bonus shares will be treated as a taxable bonus issue. This is to prevent double taxation. Amendment to the tax treatment of bonus issues in lieu The tax treatment of bonus issues in lieu is being amended so that the amount of a dividend is the money or money’s worth offered as an alternative. Previously, resident withholding tax was required to be deducted from the alternative amount. The new tax treatment is not expected to have any significant effects to the tax treatment of bonus issues in lieu, but is intended to make the tax treatment simpler. For the purposes of a PDP, the amount of the dividend will similarly be the amount offered by the company for the repurchase of the share. Remedial amendment to filing requirements A minor amendment is being made to the current filing requirements for natural person taxpayers. This change is necessary to reflect changes in the personal tax rates. 16 17 TAX TREATMENT OF UNSUCCESSFUL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT 18 19 TAX TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURE ON UNSUCCESSFUL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (Clauses 17 and 163) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment allows an immediate deduction for expenditure incurred on unsuccessful software development projects in the year that the development is abandoned. Application date The amendment applies for the 2007−08 and later income years. The application date is retrospective to give certainty to taxpayers who have previously relied upon a 1993 Inland Revenue policy statement to claim a deduction for the costs of unsuccessful software development. Key features The amendments allow a deduction when a person incurs expenditure on developing software for use in their business and the development of this software is abandoned. The person is allowed a deduction for the expenditure incurred in the development of the software if no other deduction has been allowed for the expenditure under New Zealand legislation. The deduction will be allowed in the income year that the software development project is abandoned. Background On 4 April 2011 the Commissioner of Inland Revenue issued a general notice advising taxpayers that they should not rely on certain parts of a 1993 policy statement, “Income tax treatment of computer software”. The statement indicated that capital expenditure incurred on developing unsuccessful software qualifies for an immediate tax deduction. The 2011 general notice indicated that this is no longer the Commissioner’s view of the law and it should not be relied upon. It advised, therefore, that this part of the 1993 statement should be treated as being withdrawn from the beginning of the 2011−12 income year. As a consequence of the Commissioner’s revised view of the law, it is possible that some expenditure on unsuccessful software development may never be deductible (either immediately or over time). The non-deductibility of unsuccessful capital expenditure would be an example of so-called “blackhole” expenditure. This raises a policy concern because disallowing a deduction for such expenditure could discourage firms from undertaking otherwise sensible investment. 20 The changes proposed in the bill will give taxpayers greater certainty over the tax treatment of the costs of unsuccessful software development. 21 KIWISAVER MEASURES 22 23 KIWISAVER EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES (Clauses 96, 154, 157 and 159) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and the Income Tax Act 2007 to increase the default and minimum employee contribution rates for KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds from 2% to 3% of an employee’s gross salary or wages. The bill also increases the compulsory employer contribution rate from 2% to 3% of gross salary or wages. Application date The new employee and employer contribution rates will apply from 1 April 2013. Key features The minimum employee contribution rate is being increased from 2% to 3% of gross salary or wages from 1 April 2013. The increased rate automatically applies to all employees who have been contributing at a 2% rate to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. The default contribution rate for KiwiSaver members who do not select a rate also increases from 2% to 3% of gross salary or wages from 1 April 2013. The rate at which compulsory employer contributions are made will increase from 2% to 3% of gross salary or wages, from 1 April 2013. A provision is included in the bill to protect providers from potential non-compliance with securities enactments in relation to their prospectuses and investment statements following these contribution rate changes. This gives providers time to revise their prospectuses and investment statements to reflect the new rates. Background The Government announced changes in Budget 2011 that will see KiwiSaver funds continue to grow, but with a larger share of contributions coming from members and employers, through increased contribution rates, and a lower share from the Government. Employees who are enrolled in KiwiSaver must pay employee contributions, unless they have taken a contributions holiday. Currently, employee contributions are deducted from salary or wages at a rate of 2%, 4% or 8% of gross salary or wages. The minimum deduction rate of 2% is increasing to 3% from 1 April 2013. Employees contributing at higher rates (4% or 8%) will be unaffected by the change. 24 The default contribution rate applies to employees who are automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver when they start new employment, unless they select their own contribution rate. This is the same as the minimum contribution rate, and so will increase to 3% from 1 April 2013. An employer must pay KiwiSaver employer superannuation contributions for an employee for whom they are required to deduct personal contributions from the employee’s salary or wages. This contribution rate will increase from 2% to 3% of gross salary or wages, from 1 April 2013. The new contribution rates apply to employer contributions made for, or employee contributions deducted from, an employee’s first payment of salary of wages for a pay period that starts on or after 1 April 2013. 25 CONSOLIDATION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR KIWISAVER CONTRIBUTIONS HELD BY INLAND REVENUE (Clause 156) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to consolidate and pay interest due on employee and employer contributions for the period they are in the KiwiSaver holding account, on a periodic basis. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The amendment will allow the Commissioner to consolidate interest due on employee and employer contributions for the period they are in the KiwiSaver holding account, and credit it to members on a periodic basis − for example, weekly, monthly or quarterly. The maximum period over which interest may be consolidated is three months. The amendment applies from the date of enactment. However, it is likely to take a few months following enactment for Inland Revenue to make the necessary IT changes to credit this interest on a periodic basis. The amendment does not affect the method of calculation of interest due; this will still be computed on a daily basis. Background Section 72 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 requires the Commissioner to establish the Inland Revenue KiwiSaver Holding Account into which employee and employer contributions are received before being passed on to the provider. The Commissioner pays interest on contributions that are held by Inland Revenue until they are forwarded to the member’s KiwiSaver scheme. For the purposes of computing the interest due, employee contributions are treated as received by Inland Revenue on the 15th day of the month in which the deduction is made by the employer. Employer contributions are treated as received on the first day of the month in which the money is actually received by Inland Revenue. Section 88 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that interest must be credited to the member’s account and then on-paid to their provider at the same time as the amount of the employee or employer contribution is on-paid. This can create lots of small regular credits, many for a few cents, especially if contributions are credited to members’ 26 accounts in several stages. This creates a large volume of low-value transactions, using IT functional and storage capacity and lots of small entries on members’ statements. 27 CROWN GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO KIWISAVER (Clause 155) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to enable the Commissioner to operate the Crown guarantee of employee contributions in cases where he has sufficient evidence that the employee has incurred a deduction from their salary or wages, but the employer has not filed an employer monthly schedule (EMS). Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The amendment will allow the Commissioner to use the Crown guarantee to pay an employee’s contributions to their KiwiSaver provider when the employer has not filed an EMS, but there is other evidence that the contributions were deducted from their salary or wages. The employer’s obligation to file an EMS showing these contributions, or to pay the amounts due to the Commissioner, is unaffected by this amendment. Background Section 78 of the KiwiSaver Act provides that an employee’s KiwiSaver deductions are guaranteed by the Crown, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the employer has taken the deduction from the employee’s salary or wages and the employer has filed an EMS. The purpose of the Crown guarantee is to ensure that the full amount of the employee’s deduction is always forwarded to their provider, even when their employer has not forwarded the money to Inland Revenue. Under the current legislation, the Commissioner can only use the Crown guarantee when the deduction is shown on the employer monthly schedule (EMS). This leads to difficulties and delays if the employer does not file an EMS. Even if an employee is able to provide satisfactory evidence that the contributions were deducted from their wages − for example, a payslip or payroll printout − without the EMS the Crown guarantee technically cannot be used. This is not consistent with the original policy intent. 28 29 WORKING FOR FAMILIES 30 31 FAMILY SCHEME INCOME AND WITHDRAWALS FROM KIWISAVER (Clause 61) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that a withdrawal made from KiwiSaver after the member has reached the date of entitlement to withdraw is not regarded as family scheme income of the individual under the Working for Families (WFF) tax credits rules. The amendment also applies to earlier withdrawals made under the KiwiSaver first home purchase, significant financial hardship and serious illness rules, and to withdrawals from complying superannuation funds. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2007, the date when KiwiSaver started. Key features Section MB 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to ensure that if an individual makes a withdrawal from their KiwiSaver fund under first home purchase, significant financial hardship and serious illness rules, or after the “end payment date”, this will not be counted as family scheme income. The amendment will also apply to withdrawals made from complying superannuation funds. Background Section MB 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains a provision to address situations when a person’s income for WFF tax credit entitlement purposes is apparently reduced by channelling income through a superannuation scheme. This rule means that the distributions received are counted as the individual’s family scheme income (to the extent that the distribution does not consist of amounts that the individual contributed themselves). Section MB 5 applies if an individual receives a distribution from the superannuation scheme in an income year and: • the employer of the individual has made contributions to that superannuation scheme, either in the current income year or in either of the previous two income years; and • the individual continues to work for that employer for at least one month after receiving the distribution; and 32 • the distribution was not a result of their retirement from employment with that employer. The KiwiSaver rules in Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 govern when members may withdraw their funds. The general rule permits withdrawal on or after the KiwiSaver “end payment date”, which is the later of the date that the member reaches the NZ superannuation qualification age (currently 65) or five years from the date of joining KiwiSaver (or a complying superannuation fund). KiwiSaver schemes must allow withdrawals before the “end payment date” for certain purposes; including: • first home purchase; • significant financial hardship; and • serious illness. A withdrawal from KiwiSaver (or a complying superannuation fund) is regarded as a distribution from a superannuation scheme. This means that the amounts withdrawn under these KiwiSaver provisions could be included as part of an individual’s family scheme income if the individual continues to work for their employer after making the withdrawal, and their employer has made employer contributions to KiwiSaver in the current or previous two income years. This outcome is inconsistent with the original policy intention. 33 IN-WORK TAX CREDIT AND MAJOR SHAREHOLDER EMPLOYEES OF A CLOSE COMPANY (Clauses 65(2) and (3) and 66) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the requirements for the in-work tax credit to allow a major shareholder employed by their close company to meet the requirement of a full-time earner, regardless of whether they receive wages or a shareholder salary. A major shareholder employed full-time in a close company will qualify for the in-work tax credit if: • they meet all other requirements for the in-work tax credit such as age, residence and care of a dependent child; • they meet the work hours requirement of the definition of a full-time earner in relation to the close company; and • the company derives gross income in the income year. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features Section MD 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to allow a major shareholder employed in a close company to meet the full-time earner requirement for the in-work tax credit. A major shareholder who is a full-time earner in relation to a close company will not have to meet the requirement to derive income as set out in section MD 9(2). Instead, the close company they are a major shareholder in and work for must derive gross income in the income year. The person will still be required to meet all the other requirements for the in-work tax credit as set out in sections MD 5 to MD 8 relating to age, care of a dependent child, residence and not receiving a benefit. The person will also be required to meet the required hours of full-time earner as set out in section MA 7. A full-time earner is a person who is normally employed for at least 20 hours a week, if they are a sole parent, or at least 30 hours a week in combination with a spouse, civil union or de facto partner. The terms “major shareholder” and “close company” are defined in section YA 1. A major shareholder is a person who owns, or has the right to acquire, or power to control, at least 10 percent of the ordinary shares or voting rights, or control of the company. A close company means a company in which five or fewer natural persons hold more than 50 percent of the interests; or if a market value circumstance exists, five or fewer natural persons hold more than 50 percent of the market value interests. All natural persons associated at the time are treated as one natural person. 34 Consequential amendments are being made to section MD 10, which relates to the calculation of the in-work tax credit. Background Some shareholder-employees work full-time for their company but are unpaid for their work effort because, for example, the company has made a loss for that year and has restricted cashflow. This could occur in start-up companies, for example. Under the current full-time earner requirements, the shareholder employee would not qualify for the in-work tax credit as they did not derive income as set out in subsection MD 9(2). Other business owners, such as partners in a partnership or a sole trader, in the same situation do qualify for the in-work tax credit as they earn income from a business, even if the business makes an overall loss, as long as the business derives gross income. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains a provision to restrict opportunities for major shareholders in a close company to inflate their entitlement to Working for Families tax credits. The net income of the close company (less any dividends paid to the major shareholder) is attributed to a major shareholder in proportion to their interest in the close company under section MB 4. This attributed income counts towards the person’s family scheme income used for abating any Working for Family tax credits. In contrast, the attributed income does not apply for the purposes of the full-time earner requirement for the in-work tax credit under section MD 9. 35 IN-WORK TAX CREDIT AND ACC SURVIVOR SPOUSE PAYMENTS (Clauses 59 and 65(1)) Summary of proposed amendment This remedial amendment removes the requirement for a person to be receiving income from a work activity from the requirements of a full-time earner in section MD 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This amendment will clarify that a person who is receiving ACC payments as a surviving spouse or partner of a deceased claimant is entitled to receive the in-work tax credit if the deceased claimant would have qualified before the accident causing death. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2008. Key features Section MA 7, which defines “a full-time earner”, is being amended to provide that a person receiving ACC weekly compensation as a surviving spouse or partner of a deceased claimant is treated as being employed, during the week in which compensation is paid, for the number of hours that the deceased claimant would have been employed previously but for their accident causing death. Section MD 9, which contains the full-time earner requirements to qualify for an in- work tax credit, is being amended to remove the requirement for the full-time earner to be receiving income directly from a “work activity”. This will allow a surviving spouse to meet the requirements of the section if they derive income as set out in section MD 9(2), which includes ACC weekly compensation payments. These changes are consistent with the intended policy outcome. The regulation on this issue was clearer before the Income Tax Act 2007, which is why the clarifying amendment applies from 1 April 2008, being the commencement date of that Act. A person receiving ACC weekly compensation, including a surviving spouse of a deceased claimant, should continue to receive the in-work tax credit the family previously qualified for, when the person or their spouse is no longer able to work due to incapacity. Background A person can receive weekly compensation as a surviving spouse or partner of a deceased claimant under clause 66 of schedule 1 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. While there is a provision in section MA 7(2)(b) for a person who is incapacitated to be deemed to still be employed, it is not clear that it applies when a person is a surviving spouse. 36 Furthermore, the wording in section MD 9 requires a person to be receiving income from a work activity and deriving income or compensation as set out in section MD 9(2), (3) and (4). While an injured person receiving weekly compensation would meet this requirement, it is unclear that a surviving spouse would qualify as the weekly compensation they receive is not from their work activity but from the deceased spouse’s work activity. 37 FOSTER CARE ALLOWANCES AND FAMILY SCHEME INCOME “OTHER PAYMENTS” CATEGORY (Clause 62) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the “other payments” category in the definition of “family scheme income” so that foster care allowances made under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 are excluded from family scheme income. This definition of income is used for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits and some community services card purposes, and will be used for the parental income test for student allowance purposes from next year. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Foster care allowances made under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 will be excluded from the “other payments” category in the family scheme income definition. Excluding foster care allowances from family scheme income is consistent with the treatment of orphans and unsupported child benefits, and reflects current policy. Background Caregivers who receive orphans and unsupported child benefits and foster care allowances are not entitled to claim the family tax credit relating to the child for whom the benefit is received, but are eligible for the in-work tax credit relating to that child. Both benefits and allowances are exempt from income tax. Foster care allowances from Child, Youth and Family help to reimburse caregivers for the day-to-day costs of fostering a child. These allowances are intended to cover the costs of board, personal items such as clothes and pocket money. The amounts vary according to the child’s age and specific special needs. Foster care allowances are made under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 and fall under the “other payments” definition, as a payment to the caregiver used to meet usual family living expenses. In contrast, orphans and unsupported child benefits from Work and Income, which are similar to the foster care allowances, are specifically excluded from the “other payments” category, as these payments are made under the Social Security Act 1964. 38 39 GST CHANGES 40 41 GST-APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF “LAND” TO LEASES (Clause 135) Summary of proposed amendment The GST legislation is to be amended to clarify the application of the exclusion of “commercial leases” from the definition of “land” so that an assignment of a commercial lease will not be covered by the exclusion. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Under the current GST legislation, the definition of “land” excludes commercial leases which do not involve a large proportion (more than 25%) of consideration being paid at any one time. There has been some uncertainty about whether assignments of leases are covered by the exclusion. Consequently, the bill clarifies that a transfer of a lease does not exclude the lease from the definition of “land” for GST purposes. Background To prevent “phoenix” fraud transactions, the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 introduced rules that require supplies between registered persons that involve land to be charged at the rate of 0%. To reduce any uncertainty regarding which transactions must be treated as involving “land”, and to ensure that most land-related supplies that could give rise to “phoenix” fraud concerns are zero-rated, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was amended to include a new definition of “land”. An assignment of a lease involves an assignee paying for the right to take over the lease. Therefore, this type of transaction could potentially be used for “phoenix” fraud purposes. As such, it is important that assignments of leases are covered by the definition of “land” and are subject to the zero-rating rules. 42 TREATMENT OF SERVICES ACQUIRED BY A PURCHASER (Clause 141(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to clarify that the purchaser of goods and services zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb) must account for output tax on any non-taxable use of the services acquired as part of the wider supply. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Section 20(3J)(iii) of the GST Act is being amended to require purchasers to account for output tax on any non-taxable use of services. Background The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 made a number of changes to the GST Act, strengthening the rules in order to prevent “phoenix” fraud schemes by requiring vendors to zero-rate certain transactions that involve land. If land forms part of a wider supply and the zero-rating rules apply, the whole supply rather than just the land component of the supply is zero-rated. To ensure that any non-taxable use of a zero-rated acquisition is accounted for by the purchaser, section 20(3J) requires the purchaser of zero-rated goods to account for output tax on any non-taxable use of the goods. The legislation, however, fails to state that the purchaser must also account for output tax on any non-taxable use of the services acquired as part of a wider supply. 43 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS IN SECTION 78F (Clause 152(1) and (2)) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to clarify that when a contractual purchaser in a land transaction nominates another person to receive the land, the contractual purchaser may provide information to the supplier as required by section 78F in relation to the nominated person. The supplier will be able to rely on the information provided when determining the GST treatment of the supply. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Since a supply of land may involve a contractual purchaser nominating another person to become a recipient of the supply, the wording of section 78F is being clarified to ensure that the contractual purchaser may provide the information to suppliers in respect of the ultimate recipient’s circumstances. The section is also being amended to ensure that the supplier may rely on that information in determining the appropriate GST treatment of the supply. Background Section 78F of the GST Act requires the recipient of a supply that involves land to provide information to the supplier about their registration status and intentions in relation to the land. This information may then be used by the supplier to determine whether the supply is zero-rated or standard-rated. When the ultimate recipient is a person nominated by the contractual purchaser to the agreement for sale and purchase (a nominee), it is the nominee’s registration status and intentions in relation to the land that must be used to determine the GST treatment of the supply. Since section 78F refers to the “recipient” as the person that is required to provide information, the section may be interpreted as not allowing the contractual purchaser to provide the information on the nominee’s (recipient’s) behalf and, as a result, not permitting the supplier to rely on that information. To avoid any doubt, the wording of the section is being clarified to ensure that the contractual purchaser may provide the information and the supplier may rely on it. 44 CLARIFYING THE APPLICATION OF THE “CONCURRENT USE OF LAND” PROVISION (Clause 146) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to clarify the application of the “concurrent use of land” provision in section 21E of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The proposed change provides that “concurrent” means the same part of the land is simultaneously (“concurrently”) used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 21E of the GST Act provides a formula that must be used to apportion the taxable and non-taxable use of land in situations when the mixed use occurs “concurrently”. The provision was intended to apply when the same area of land is equally and simultaneously is used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. The wording of the provision is being amended to ensure that it applies as intended. Background Section 21E of the GST Act provides guidance when a person rents out land (exempt use) or uses land for private purposes while simultaneously using it for making taxable supplies, such as taking steps to sell it. This type of mixed use is most likely to affect property developers. The provision is not intended to apply when land is used for both taxable and non- taxable purposes, but that use either relates to different parts of the land or is not simultaneous. Concerns have been raised, however, that the provision as currently drafted may be interpreted too broadly and may, in some situations, produce unintended results. 45 ADJUSTMENTS ON DISPOSALS BEFORE THE END OF AN ADJUSTMENT PERIOD (Clause 147) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to clarify that a person must make a final apportionment of input tax when goods or services are disposed of during an adjustment period. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features On the acquisition of goods or services a purchaser may only claim input tax deductions to the extent that they intend to use the goods or services for making taxable supplies. However, if the actual taxable use of goods or services differs from the intended taxable use and no exclusions apply, the purchaser may be required to adjust the input tax deduction previously claimed to reflect the actual taxable use (sections 21 and 21A). Adjustments for any differences between the actual taxable use and the intended taxable use are done at the end of an adjustment period, which is usually a period of one year. Section 21G(4) sets out the maximum number of adjustment periods for apportioning goods and services. The legislation does not, however, provide guidance on whether a section 21 and 21A adjustment is required if goods or services are disposed of before the end of an adjustment period. The proposed amendment provides that when goods or services are disposed of before the end of the last adjustment period, the current adjustment period is treated as the final adjustment period ending immediately before the date of disposal. As a consequence, a person would be required to make their last adjustment under sections 21 and 21A in the final adjustment period. This final adjustment will ensure that the input tax deducted by the person in relation to the taxable use of the asset throughout the ownership of the asset, reflects the actual taxable use of the asset. Background From a tax policy perspective, a person who acquires goods or services should only be able to claim input tax deductions to the extent that the goods or services are used for taxable purposes. The new apportionment rules achieve this result by requiring a person to estimate their intended taxable use of goods and services on acquisition, and by making subsequent adjustments to the input tax deduction if the estimate proves to be incorrect. These subsequent adjustments are made at the end of relevant adjustment periods. For assets other than land, the number of adjustment periods is capped. 46 It has been noted that the rules do not expressly stipulate whether a person is required to make a final adjustment when a disposal occurs before the end of an adjustment period. Moreover, it has also been contended that the legislation may be interpreted as requiring the person to make adjustments after the disposal of goods or services until they reach the end of their last adjustment period. 47 TAXABLE USE OF MOTOR VEHICLES (Clause 143) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended so it expressly allows the taxable use of motor vehicles to be identified by using a three-month logbook period. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Under the apportionment rules that came into force on 1 April 2011, a person can claim an input tax deduction by reference to the actual taxable use of goods or services, subject to certain exclusions. The bill will amend the GST apportionment rules by inserting a cross-reference to the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow the actual taxable use of a motor vehicle to be identified by using the three-month logbook period. This method of identifying taxable and non- taxable use may also be used for identifying the intended taxable use of the motor vehicle as estimated on acquisition of the vehicle – which may be useful if the vehicle is purchased as a replacement for another motor vehicle for which usage has been determined by the logbook method. Background Before the introduction of the apportionment rules, Inland Revenue issued guidelines which allowed a person to identify the taxable use of a motor vehicle by reference to a three-month logbook method. Under that method, a logbook could be kept for a minimum of three months to work out the taxable and private use of the motor vehicle. The taxpayer could then use the result of the three-month record as the approximation of their taxable and private use over the next three years, unless the use of the vehicle changed by more than 20 percent. As the new apportionment rules require taxpayers to be able to identify the actual taxable use of a motor vehicle, the rules arguably have the effect of overriding the logbook guidelines. Expressly allowing taxpayers to use the three-month logbook method for GST and income tax purposes should decrease compliance costs for affected taxpayers. 48 APPLICATION OF SECTION 21B (Clauses 136(2) and 145) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to allow a registered person to claim input tax deductions in respect of imported and second-hand goods acquired before registration and to remove the $5,000 minimum requirement for apportioning goods and services acquired before registration. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Section 21B of the GST Act allows a registered person to claim input tax deductions for goods or services acquired before registration. As currently drafted, the provision allows input tax deductions only when GST has been charged by the vendor under section 8(1) of the GST Act. Moreover, section 21B does not apply if the original cost of goods or services, excluding GST, was $5,000 or less. Since GST may be charged on the importation of goods or be imbedded in second-hand goods purchased from an unregistered person, section 21B will be amended to allow a registered person to claim input tax deductions for imported and second-hand goods acquired before registration. In addition, it is proposed to repeal the $5,000 minimum threshold in section 21B(4). This will allow GST-registered taxpayers to claim input tax deductions for all goods and services acquired before registration. Background Section 21B was enacted as part of the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010, with effect from 1 April 2011, and allows a registered person to make an adjustment in order to claim input tax deductions for goods or services acquired before registration. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that GST imposed on goods or services purchased by a person before their registration is not a cost on the business when those goods or services are used in the business after the person registers for GST. Specifically, section 21B operates by requiring a person to treat the period that starts on the date of acquisition and ends on the first balance date that falls after either the time of registration or at a later time when the person uses the goods or services for making taxable supplies as the person’s first adjustment period for the purposes of the GST apportionment rules. 49 As the legislation operates on the assumption that the person is making a “subsequent” adjustment of the input tax, like the general apportionment rule, the adjustment is allowed only if the original cost of the goods or services was more than $5,000 (section 21B(4)). As an unregistered person is unable to claim any input tax on the acquisition of goods or services, the effect of the minimum threshold is to preclude them from being able to claim any input tax on goods or services purchased for $5,000 or less. Furthermore, as currently drafted, section 21B allows input tax deductions only when GST has been charged by the vendor under section 8(1) and not in respect of second- hand or imported goods. This is not an appropriate outcome as the GST component should be recoverable by a purchaser if the acquired goods are used for making taxable supplies. 50 INPUT TAX AVAILABLE FOR IMPORTED GOODS (Clauses 136(3) and 141(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to prevent a registered person from claiming input tax deductions in respect of goods entered for home consumption (imported goods), when they deliver or arrange the delivery of the goods to a person in New Zealand. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed amendment will prevent a person from claiming input tax deductions in respect of imported goods, when they merely deliver, arrange the delivery or make the delivery of the goods more easily achieved to a person in New Zealand. Background The GST Act defines “input tax”, in relation to a registered person, as including GST paid on goods entered for home consumption (imported goods) by the person. Before the introduction of the new apportionment rules, the definition did not apply to the delivery of goods to a person in New Zealand. This ensured that, for example, a courier firm was not able to claim input tax in respect of imported goods when they merely arranged delivery of the goods in New Zealand. As a result of the changes to the wording of the definition of “input tax” to accommodate the new apportionment rules, the restriction on the ability to claim input tax has been removed. A registered person could arguably claim input tax deductions in respect of GST paid in the process of delivering the goods to a person in New Zealand. 51 ADJUSTMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES ACQUIRED BEFORE 1 APRIL 2011 (Clause 148) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to clarify the treatment of goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011 but which have not been subject to either the change-in-use rules or apportionment rules until after 1 April 2011. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features Section 21H is a transitional provision that specifies which rules – the former change- in-use adjustment rules or the new apportionment rules – should be used for goods and services acquired before the date of introduction of the new apportionment rules (1 April 2011). To clarify the treatment of goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011 but which have not been subject to either the change-in-use rules or the apportionment rules until after 1 April 2011, section 21H is being amended so that: • if the taxpayer has already claimed an input tax deduction for the goods or services, they should apply the old change-in-use adjustment rules; or • if the person has not deducted any input tax for the goods or services, they should apply the new apportionment rules. For the purpose of the new apportionment rules, the first adjustment period is treated as starting on the date of acquisition of the goods or services and ending on the date that is the later of the first balance date falling after the date on which they were first used for making taxable supplies, or the date on which the person becomes a registered person. A “savings” provision will also be introduced to allow taxpayers who have already applied either the old change-in-use adjustment rules or the new apportionment rules before the amendment is introduced to continue with their chosen treatment. Background The new apportionment rules apply to supplies made on or after 1 April 2011. In accordance with the transitional provision (section 21H) as currently drafted, goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011 which are used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes remain subject to the old change-in-use adjustment rules. 52 Section 21H leaves some uncertainty around the treatment of goods and services acquired before 1 April 2011 but which have not been subject to either the change-in- use rules or apportionment rules until after 1 April 2011. This may occur, for example, if the goods or services were exclusively used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes or because the person was not registered for GST before 1 April 2011. 53 GST REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS IN UNDISCLOSED AGENCIES (Clause 152(3)) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to modify the information requirements relating to transactions that involve land to allow unregistered agents for undisclosed principals to provide the agents’ IRD numbers to suppliers. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features The proposed amendment will modify section 78F which requires a recipient of a supply that involves land to provide certain information to the supplier and allow an unregistered agent for an undisclosed principal to provide the agent’s IRD number to the supplier. Background The Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 amended the information requirements in section 78F of the GST Act for transactions that involve land to allow an agent for an undisclosed principal to make limited representations to the supplier for the purposes of the GST zero-rating rules. This may be done, however, only if an agent is registered for GST and provides their registration number to the supplier. In some situations, an agent may be not registered for GST. Law firms, for example, often use “solicitor’s nominee companies” as agents for undisclosed principals. These companies may not have a taxable activity and may not therefore be registered for GST. Requiring these companies to carry on a taxable activity and register for GST so they can act as agents for undisclosed principals would introduce an unnecessary compliance burden. 54 TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING NOMINATIONS (Clauses 149 and 151) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to repeal the rule that deems a supply to be made to the nominee when the contractual purchaser and the nominee have a different registration status. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Key features When a supply of goods or services is made to a person nominated by a contractual purchaser, section 60B of the GST Act determines whether the supply is treated as being made to the contractual purchaser or the nominated person. The proposed amendment will repeal section 60(5) which states that when the contractual purchaser and the nominated person have a different GST registration status, the supply must be treated as made between the supplier and the nominated person. A “savings” provision will be introduced to protect taxpayers who may have already claimed input tax deductions in reliance on section 60(5). Background The Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 enacted a number of changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, including clarification of the GST treatment of transactions that involve nominations. The nomination rules adopt an “economic substance” approach so that the GST consequences of a transaction involving a nomination (such as the entitlement to an input tax deduction) reflect the commercial reality of the transaction. The new rules apply from 1 April 2011. Nominee transactions ordinarily involve a purchaser nominating another person (a nominee) to receive the goods or services in question and/or settle the transaction. Under the new default “economic substance” nomination rule, a single GST supply is deemed to exist between the supplier and the person who provides the consideration relating to the supply. Depending on the facts, the latter could be either the contractual purchaser or the nominee. To prevent “phoenix” fraud, the 2010 Act also introduced rules that require supplies of land to be zero-rated in certain circumstances. To ensure that the new zero-rating of land rules (which were also enacted in the 2010 Act) could not be bypassed by parties using nominations, the default “economic substance” rule was modified in respect of 55 transactions that involve land to deem a supply as always occurring between the supplier and the nominee. As a result of an oversight, a similar supplementary rule also applies to transactions that do not involve land when the contractual purchaser and the nominee have a different registration status. Application of the rule in these situations may give rise to inappropriate GST outcomes, such as the denial of input tax deductions to the contractual purchaser. For this reason, the legislation should be amended to ensure that the default “economic substance” approach applies without the modifying provision to all transactions that do not involve land. Minor drafting changes The following changes are being made to correct minor errors in the GST ACT: • Section 21A(c) is being amended to also refer to section 21(2)(d). • The reference to “principal purpose” in section 20A(2) is being deleted. • A cross-reference in section 21H(1) is being amended to refer to “21 to 21H”. 56 REVERSE CHARGE RULES (Clauses 138 and 139) Summary of proposed amendments Changes are being made to the reverse charge rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to ensure that they operate as intended and with minimal compliance costs to business. They will: • amend section 8(4B)(b)(ii) of the GST Act to change the reverse charge threshold from 90 percent to 95 percent; and • amend section 9(2)(h) to change the time of supply from the first day of the relevant adjustment period to the last day of that period. Application date The new rules will apply from 1 April 2011, being the date the amendments to the reverse charge rules took effect. Key features The reverse charge rules in section 8(4B)(b) are in two parts. The main rule applies on acquisition if the intended taxable use of the service is less than 95 percent. The second rule applies if the original acquisition estimate was higher than 95 percent, but the actual taxable use of the services drops below 90 percent. It is this second rule that is at issue. The 90 percent figure was set to tie in with the rule in section 21(2)(c) that only requires adjustments to be made when the percentage of taxable use deviates by more than 10 percent. In other words, the 90 percent "built in" the difference between 100 percent and 90 percent when no adjustment is generally required. However, the 90 percent figure does not take into account the other limb of section 21(2)(c), which requires an adjustment if the difference in GST is greater than $1,000. It may therefore be possible for a taxpayer to avoid making an adjustment if it was less than 10 percent, even if the GST at stake was considerably more than $1,000. To address this concern, the second reverse charge threshold in section 8(4B)(b)(ii) is being changed to 95 percent. This will mean that, once the percentage of non-taxable use of the service exceeds 5 percent, the reverse charge rules will apply and the change-in-use adjustments will automatically follow in appropriate circumstances. This will also make the secondary rule consistent with the threshold applied to the main reverse charge rule. 57 Time of supply for reverse charge Under sections 8(4B)(b)(ii) and 9(2)(h), a registered person that imports services for a taxable purpose, but later applies those services for a non-taxable purpose, is treated as supplying those services to themselves on the first day of the adjustment period that their non-taxable use becomes greater than 10 percent (soon to be 5 percent, as above). However, an “adjustment period” is always approximately a year in length. The rule may therefore produce difficulties for a registered person that returns GST on, for example, a monthly basis. This would occur because the first day of the adjustment period would be in a different GST filing period − meaning that previous returns may need to be adjusted. Section 9(2)(h) is therefore being amended so that the supply is treated as occurring on the last day of the relevant adjustment period. This should prevent the taxpayer having to incur compliance costs through amending previous returns. 58 GST AND LATE PAYMENT FEES (Clause 137) Summary of proposed amendment The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is to be amended to clarify that late payment fees charged by businesses to customers are subject to GST. The proposed amendment is a result of a recent interpretation of the law which concluded that no GST is chargeable on late payment fees. This interpretation is inconsistent with the policy of a broad- based tax, and with Inland Revenue’s public interpretation which has been that late payment fees are subject to GST whereas penalty interest is not. Application date The amendment will apply for taxable periods ending on or after 1 April 2003. As the purpose of the amendment is to clarify the current law, the application date has been aligned, as closely as possible, with the statutory time-bar for claiming GST refunds – specifically, with the last possible year in which taxpayers could possibly seek a refund of overpaid GST. The amendment also contains a “savings” clause which preserves the past GST treatment of late payment fees by taxpayers who have, before the date of introduction of this bill, adopted a regular practice of not charging GST on the fees. For these taxpayers, the amendment will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features A new provision is being inserted into section 5 of the GST Act to clarify that GST is chargeable on late payment fees. The provision will apply retrospectively for taxable periods ending on or after 1 April 2003. The new provision contains a savings clause which will preserve, up until 1 April 2012, the past GST treatment of late payment fees by some taxpayers. The purpose of the savings clause is to ensure that the retrospective amendment does not penalise taxpayers who have, in good faith, taken an interpretation of the law that was open to them at the time. It would apply to taxpayers who, before the date of introduction of this bill, relied on the provisions of the GST Act as they were before this amendment, and who adopted a regular practice of not charging GST on late payment fees. Taxpayers who fall within the savings clause will have until 1 April 2012 to make any necessary systems changes in order to comply with the amendment. Background Under the GST Act, GST is only charged on taxable supplies of goods and services. The term “supply” is defined very broadly in keeping with the policy of GST having the broadest base as is practically possible. Late payment fees are fixed fees charged by a business to customers who are late in paying their accounts. These fees are common across a range of sectors and charging GST on these fees is common practice. The fees are different from penalty and default interest payments which are specifically GST-exempt in the same way as other financial 59 transactions. A recent interpretation of the law, however, has concluded that no GST should be imposed on late payment fees as there is an insufficient connection between the fee and the underlying supply of goods and services, even though the fee may represent the cost of administering the late payment. This is inconsistent with the policy of a broad-based tax, and with Inland Revenue’s public interpretation which has been that late payment fees are subject to GST but penalty interest is not. The interpretation may create scope for businesses to restructure similar fees and charges to take advantage of this interpretation, thereby raising base maintenance concerns. Late payment fees should be treated in the same manner as prompt payment discounts, for example, where the intention of the legislation is that amounts with or without discount are fully subject to GST. The lack of clarity around application of the rules also gives rise to an ongoing fiscal risk, as a result of taxpayers, many of whom currently charge GST on late fees, no longer charging it. Applying the measure retrospectively will avoid the possibility of refunds being claimed to take advantage of the recent interpretation, with potential windfall gains to the supplier. 60 LIQUIDATORS AND RECEIVERS CHANGING GST ACCOUNTING BASIS (Clause 140) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to preclude liquidators, receivers and voluntary administrators switching from the payments basis to the invoice basis when accounting for GST. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key feature New section 19(3B) of the GST Act 1985 will prevent a liquidator, receiver, or administrator (as defined in section 239B of the Companies Act 1993) of a registered person who accounts for tax payable on a payments basis applying to change the registered person’s accounting basis to an invoice basis. Background If a registered person meets certain conditions, for example, when the total value of taxable supplies for a 12-month period has not, or is not likely to exceed $2 million, the registered person may account for GST on a payments basis. The majority of registered persons (approximately 80 percent) account for GST using the payments basis. The GST Act 1985 allows registered persons who are accounting for GST on a payments basis to change to the invoice basis by applying to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. There are currently no restrictions on registered persons making this accounting basis change. It has become standard practice for liquidators and receivers to adopt the invoice basis for accounting for GST, immediately upon becoming a liquidator or receiver of a registered person that accounts for GST on a payments basis. Moving to an invoice basis allows the liquidator or receiver to claim input tax credits for supplies received for which no payment has been made. Changing the accounting basis often results in refunds being made to the liquidator or receiver despite in many cases there being no realistic prospect that the debt, to which the input credit relates, will ever be paid. The current practice does not seem to have a commercial purpose other than to generate GST refunds. 61 SECOND-HAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDIT (Clause 136(1)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the definition of “input tax” in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as it relates to second-hand goods, as a remedial base maintenance measure. It prevents a situation where GST is paid once but input tax credits can be claimed twice on the same goods. Application date The amendment applies from the date of the introduction of the bill. Key features Section 3A(2)(b) is being replaced to deny a second-hand input tax credit when the goods: • are supplied by a non-resident; and • have previously been supplied to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996. It does not matter if the person who enters the goods was registered for GST purposes at the time the goods were entered or was registered at a later date. Background In 1995, an amendment was made to the GST Act 1985 to counter the situation where input tax credits were being claimed twice on the same goods: once when the goods were imported under a lease, and again through the second-hand goods input tax credit, when goods situated in New Zealand were purchased from the non-resident owner. The 1995 amendment ensured that a second-hand goods credit could not be claimed when the sale of goods is a non-taxable supply by a non-resident, and any GST originally charged at the border on the goods has already been claimed. Detailed analysis Both the 1995 amendment and the amendment in this bill concern the following situation. Goods are leased from a non-resident to a resident. The resident lessee, who is registered for GST, enters the goods for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996. The New Zealand Customs Service charges GST on the value of the assets, and the registered lessee would claim an input tax credit. At a later point, the non-resident owner would sell the goods, now situated in New Zealand, to a GST registered person. As the seller is a non-resident, the supply is not a taxable supply and GST output tax is not charged. However, as the goods are already situated in New Zealand, the registered purchaser is potentially able to claim a second-hand goods 62 credit. This could lead to GST input credits being claimed twice, while GST is paid only once. The 1995 amendment denied a second-hand goods credit if the non-resident selling the goods is the same non-resident who has previously supplied (i.e. leased) the goods to the registered person (the lessee) who had entered the goods for home consumption. The amendment in this bill extends the section to also deny a second-hand tax credit in situations where the non-resident owner who sells the goods to a registered person in New Zealand is not the same person who originally leased the goods to a registered person in New Zealand. It also covers the situation when the lessee who entered the goods for home consumption was not registered for GST at the time of entry, but registers after the event and claims a GST input credit under section 21B. 63 GST AND THE CREDIT CARD SERVICE FEE (Clause 131) Summary of proposed amendment Section 226C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to clarify that fees charged under that section are GST-exclusive. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Clause 131 amends section 226C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify that GST does not apply to the amount of fees charged under that section. Background Section 226C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to charge taxpayers a fee, if they choose to pay their tax and social liabilities by credit card. The current fee is set at 1.42 percent of the total transaction and may be changed by Order in Council. The change proposed in the bill makes it clear that if GST is payable on a particular service fee, the amount set in legislation is exclusive of GST. The fee is passed on to domestic-based student loan borrowers and child support parents by Inland Revenue because the cost of absorbing the fee is too high. These individuals also have other practical ways in which they are able to comply with their repayment obligations, such as via internet banking. Inland Revenue will, however, continue to absorb the fee for credit card payments made by overseas liable parents and overseas student loan borrowers to help reduce their compliance costs. 64 65 BANKING GROUP’S EQUITY THRESHOLD 66 67 BANKING GROUP’S EQUITY THRESHOLD (Clause 31) Summary of proposed amendment The bill increases the minimum equity threshold of a reporting bank’s New Zealand banking group for a tax year from 4 percent of risk-weighted exposures (RWEs) to 6 percent of RWEs. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features Section FE 19(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains a formula which a reporting bank must use to calculate the minimum equity threshold of its New Zealand banking group for a tax year. The formula contains a multiplier to be applied to the value of RWEs less deductions from equity value. This formula is to be amended by increasing the multiplier from 0.04 to 0.06. The new formula will apply only for measurement dates under section FE 8(3) for periods beginning on or after 1 April 2012. Background Since 2005, a special form of thin capitalisation rule has applied for foreign-owned banks. The rule requires a New Zealand banking group to hold equity equal to at least 4 percent of its New Zealand assets − specifically, 4 percent of its RWEs (less deductions from equity value). The rule has the effect of limiting the interest deductions foreign-owned banks may take against their New Zealand sourced income for tax purposes. It is proposed that the minimum equity threshold for tax purposes be increased from 4 percent to 6 percent of RWEs from 1 April 2012. The proposed increase for tax purposes is consistent with recent changes in the commercial and regulatory environment facing banks, which has seen average regulatory capital ratios steadily increase, while the average tax capital ratio has remained near the prescribed minimum. 68 69 REMEDIAL MATTERS 70 71 APPLICATIONS FOR OVERSEAS DONEE STATUS (Clause 98) Summary of proposed amendments The bill adds four new charitable organisations to Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This will allow donors to obtain tax credits on their donations to the following organisations whose activities are largely focussed overseas. • Aotearoa Development Cooperative • Deepavali Charitable Trust • Orphans of Nepal • School Aid: Global Partnerships Through Schools Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2013. Background Donations to listed organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a tax credit of 33⅓% of the amount donated, up to their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply some or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for charitable donee status by Parliament. These organisations are listed in Schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The four charitable organisations being added to Schedule 32 are engaged in the following activities: • Aotearoa Development Cooperative (ADC) works with poor communities in Burma to establish community-owned microfinance institutions that provide small loans for business development. • The Deepavali Charitable Trust provides funds to schools and hospitals in India and developing parts of Asia and, when necessary, provides support to those in need in India and developing parts of Asia in cases of natural disaster (such as the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami) and famine. • Orphans of Nepal provides basic necessities for orphaned children in need in the Kathmandu Valley, including food, accommodation, clothing, health care and education. 72 School Aid aims to assist schools and children in developing countries. The organisation has set up an investment fund, the profits from which go to schools in poor countries. 73 NON-RESIDENT FILM RENTERS’ TAX (Clauses 5, 12, 19, 56, 68, 72, 84, 88, 91, 92 and 93) Summary of proposed amendment The rules for taxing non-resident film renters in the Income Tax Act 2007 are being replaced with non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) to rationalise and simplify the New Zealand income tax rules applying to non-residents. Application date NRWT will apply to amounts derived by non-residents from renting films in New Zealand from the date of enactment. Key features Currently, the Income Tax Act 2007 treats 10 percent of gross receipts derived by a non-resident company from renting films in New Zealand as income with no deductions, giving an effective tax rate of 2.8%. The bill will replace the current tax of 2.8% on gross film rentals with NRWT. Practically all amounts currently subject to the non-resident film renters’ tax come within the “royalty” definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and in New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs). Such amounts will therefore be subject to NRWT once provisions relating to non-resident film renters are repealed. Although the standard NRWT rate on royalties is 15%, the rate applying to most non-resident film renters would be 5% or 10% under New Zealand’s DTAs. Background The current rules for taxing non-resident film renters have existed in various forms since 1928. They were originally enacted because of the difficulties in accurately determining the net profit derived by non-residents from renting films in New Zealand. The current rules are an historical anachronism for which there is no longer a sound policy rationale. It appears that the non-resident film renters’ tax was not replaced in 1964 when NRWT was introduced because of the 1948 DTA between the United States and New Zealand. That DTA prevented New Zealand taxing the income of United States film renters except to the extent allowed under the existing rules. The 1982 DTA between New Zealand and the United States (which replaced the 1948 DTA) and the current DTA (in force from November 2010) contain no similar restriction on New Zealand’s ability to tax income derived from New Zealand by the United States-resident film renters. 74 TIMING OF DETERMINING SERIOUS HARDSHIP (Clause 131) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act 1994 is being clarified to ensure that when a serious hardship application is made, the financial position considered by Inland Revenue is the financial position at the date the application for relief is made. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key feature New section 177(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will provide that when determining whether recovery would place a taxpayer in serious hardship, Inland Revenue will consider the taxpayer’s financial position at the date on which the application for relief is made. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 prevents Inland Revenue from recovering outstanding tax to the extent to which recovery would place a taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship. The Act defines “serious hardship”. Under the debt rules, late payment penalties stop being imposed when a taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue seeking relief. This provision is aimed at encouraging taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue when they are having problems paying their tax. It was intended Inland Revenue would consider the taxpayer’s financial position at the time the taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue. A recent Court of Appeal decision, Larmer 1 , found that serious hardship could be determined at the time of application or, alternatively, at the time the tax became due. Determining serious hardship at the time tax becomes due is not consistent with the policy intent and could lead to inconsistent application of the provision. The debt rules provide incentives for taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue if they cannot pay their tax. In such cases Inland Revenue can enter an instalment arrangement and if necessary write off part, or all, of the outstanding amount − for example, when payment would place a taxpayer in serious hardship. To determine if an individual will be placed in serious hardship, Inland Revenue will request relevant details of the person’s financial position − for example, details of bank accounts and assets held. 1 CA61/2010 75 It could in practice be very difficult, and in some cases impossible, for Inland Revenue to determine whether a taxpayer was in serious hardship when the tax became due. This is because this could be a date years before the application for relief is made and it could be difficult to reconstruct a person’s affairs. It would also remove the incentive on taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue when they cannot pay their tax. 76 RATE FOR EXTINGUISHING TAX LOSSES WHEN TAX IS WRITTEN OFF (Clause 132) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to reduce the rate used to extinguish the tax losses of companies when their tax is written off. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key feature The rate used for extinguishing losses of companies who have tax written off is being reduced to 28%. The rate for other taxpayers will remain at 33%. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 allows Inland Revenue to write off tax which cannot be recovered in certain cases. If Inland Revenue writes off tax for a taxpayer who has a tax loss, it must extinguish all or part of the taxpayer’s tax loss in proportion to the amount written off by dividing the amount written off by 33% and reducing the tax loss by that amount. Currently, the legislation provides a single rate of 33% for extinguishing tax losses. When the provision was introduced, the company tax rate was 33% and the top marginal tax rate for individuals was 39%. Submissions on the provision, when it was introduced in 2002, noted that the rate used for extinguishing tax losses should be the taxpayer’s marginal tax rate. Officials’ response was that a single rate was preferred for simplicity reasons, and the 33% rate would generally either be accurate or taxpayer- friendly. Since the provision was introduced in 2002, tax rates have reduced. The top marginal rate for individuals is now 33% and the company tax rate has been lowered from 33% to 28%. Given these changes to rates, the 33% rate for extinguishing losses is too generous in all cases for companies because they are taxed at a flat rate of 28%; in other words, insufficient company losses are extinguished under the current 33% rate. The rate for 77 other taxpayers should remain at 33% to ensure individuals on the top marginal tax rate do not have their losses over-reduced. 78 EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME AND CERTAIN TREATY OF WAITANGI SETTLEMENTS (Clause 88) Summary of proposed amendment Legislation is being amended to ensure that transactions in emissions units which are transferred through certain entities as part of Treaty settlements still give rise to exempt income. Application date The amendment will apply from 9 June 2009 which is just prior to the date any pre- 1990 forest land emissions units were allocated to any relevant entities. Key features When pre-1990 forest land emissions units are disposed of, the income which arises is treated as exempt income under section CX 51B of the Income Tax Act 2007. This amendment extends the definition of pre-1990 forest land emissions units in section YA 1 so that units which are received by an iwi from a representative entity as part of a Treaty settlement process fall within the definition. This will ensure that the disposal proceeds received by that iwi are also treated as exempt income. Background A one-off allocation of emissions units is made by the government to owners of pre- 1990 forestry land to compensate them for the additional costs that will arise as a result of the Emissions Trading Scheme if they change the use of their land. For owners who hold the land on capital account, the disposal of these units is treated as giving rise to exempt income. Ordinary rules apply to any subsequent transactions in those units. Some Treaty of Waitangi settlements which involve forestry land are being implemented in two stages. The land and other assets are initially transferred by the Crown to an entity which represents a number of iwi, and that representative entity will subsequently transfer those assets to the iwi it represents. 79 EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME AND NEGOTIATED GREENHOUSE AGREEMENTS (Clause 21) Summary of proposed amendment Legislation is being amended so that the accrual income rules apply when a party to a Negotiated Greenhouse Agreement (NGA) receives emissions units in relation to the impact of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) on the price of inputs. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 July 2010. Key features Section ED 1B of the Income Tax Act 2007 treats the entitlement to receive emissions units from the Crown under the ETS industrial allocation process as giving rise to income on an accrual basis. This amendment completes the extension of that accrual basis to parties to a NGA who receive emissions units in recognition of the impact of the ETS on the price of their inputs. Background NGAs were entered into between the Government and two businesses some years before the introduction of the ETS. Arrangements have subsequently been agreed between these emitters and the Crown under which the Crown will transfer emissions units to these businesses in recognition of the impact of the ETS on the price of their inputs. An earlier amendment was made to section ED 1B to deal with this issue, but was not wide enough to cover the procedure subsequently negotiated with another of the NGA parties. 80 ANNUAL CONFIRMATION OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendment The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2012–13 tax year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same rates that applied for the 2011–12 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2012–13 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2012–13 tax year will be set at the rates specified in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 81 MAKING RWT CERTIFICATES AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY (Clause 105) Summary of proposed amendment Interest payers are required to send depositors resident withholding tax (RWT) withholding certificates at the end of the tax year. Interest payers can provide RWT withholding certificates electronically, provided that the recipient agrees to receive the certificate in that way. In accordance with the original policy intention, this amendment clarifies that interest payers can meet this requirement by making RWT withholding certificates available on their websites, as long as the recipient agrees to receive the certificate in that way. Application date The amendment will apply to RWT withholding certificates provided on or after 1 April 2002 that relate to interest or specified dividends paid in the 2001−02 and subsequent income years to align with the application date of the provision when it was originally introduced. 82 EMPLOYER SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION TAX AND PAST EMPLOYEES (Clauses 75 to 81, 103, 113, 112 and 130) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to codify the long-established practice of deducting employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) from superannuation contributions made on behalf of past employees. It also provides that a 33% rate of ESCT applies to these contributions. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2008, unless a return was filed before the introduction of this bill on a different basis. The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2011 contained some other changes to the ESCT rules, which apply from 1 April 2012. This necessitated the amendments being drafted in two stages, but the overall outcome is the same. Key features The definition of an “employer’s superannuation cash contribution” is being clarified to include superannuation contributions paid by a person for the benefit of their past employees − that is, even when there is no current “employer” and “employee” relationship. This means that the person paying the superannuation contribution, although no longer technically “an employer” of these past employees, must still deduct ESCT from these superannuation contributions. The rate at which ESCT must be deducted from these contributions is set at 33%. The variable rates that employers must apply to contributions on behalf of current employees from 1 April 2012 are not used because the variable rates rely on recent salary or wage information that is not applicable in the case of a past employee. A provision is being included so that the amendments do not apply to people who filed a return before the date of introduction of the bill on a different basis. Instead Inland Revenue will consider the basis on which they have filed their return in light of the current legislation. 83 DEDUCTIBLE OUTPUT TAX (Clause 88(3)) Summary of proposed amendments The definition of “deductible output tax” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to correct an oversight that occurred when the definition was introduced in 2011. The definition is relevant (in this context) to section DB 2 of the Act. Under the previous version of section DB 2, output tax payable in respect of a supply of fringe benefits under section 21I of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was explicitly available as a deduction for income tax purposes. In expanding the provision to provide for the new apportionment rules in the GST Act, the reference to section 21I was inadvertently removed. There is no policy reason why such output tax should not be available as a deduction because it represents a real cost to the taxpayer. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011, to clarify that output tax charged under section 21I has always been available as a deduction. 84 HARDCOPY RETURNS (Clause 110) Summary of proposed amendments Section 36(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that, when a return is transmitted electronically, a hardcopy of that return must be signed and retained. Although section 36 generally gives approval for electronic returns to be transmitted by a “taxpayer, registered person, or agent of a taxpayer or registered person”, section 36(3)(b) provides that the hardcopy return “shall be signed by the taxpayer or registered person”. This has led to some confusion over whether these hardcopy returns can be signed by agents. An amendment is proposed to section 36(3)(b) to clarify that an agent of a taxpayer or registered person can sign the hardcopy of the transmitted return. This accords with the policy behind the provision and with current practice accepted by Inland Revenue. Application date This amendment will take effect from the date of enactment. 85 COMMISSIONER GIVEN DISCRETION NOT TO RULE ON RECONSTRUCTION PROVISION (Clause 118) Summary of proposed amendment Section GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the power to reconstruct a tax avoidance arrangement to counteract the tax advantage gained. An amendment is proposed that will give the Commissioner a discretion whether to make a private ruling to the extent to which it would be a ruling on how section GA 1 applies or would apply. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The discretion to make a ruling is only in relation the application of section GA 1, and is not a general widening of the Commissioner’s general discretion to make a ruling. Background Currently, the Commissioner is required to rule on how section GA 1 applies, or would apply when a taxpayer requests such a ruling. This occurs in some instances where the Commissioner has determined that the taxpayer’s arrangement constitutes tax avoidance. Requiring the Commissioner to make a ruling on exactly how the Commissioner would apply the reconstruction provision is not ideal, and can be difficult to do without an investigation. Giving the Commissioner a discretion to make a ruling will allow the Commissioner to provide a ruling when its position regarding reconstruction is clear, and will allow the Commissioner to refrain from making a ruling if the position is uncertain. 86 PRIVATE RULINGS FOR ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENTS (Clause 119) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will require those making an application for a private ruling relating to transfer pricing to examine the application and confirm, in a notice submitted at the same time as their application for a ruling is submitted, that to the best of their knowledge, the information disclosed in the application is comprehensive. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Applicants for private rulings relating to advance pricing agreements will be required to be more involved in the application process. The amendment will require them to examine the application personally and make a declaration as to the comprehensiveness of the information provided in support of their application. Background Inland Revenue has some concerns about the completeness of some advance pricing agreement applications and documentation packages. As transfer pricing is driven by the facts available, problems can arise if the key facts are not provided, or if information provided is not comprehensive. Currently, tax agents can make an application of behalf of an applicant, and can sign the declaration on the application form that “the details contained in this application are true and correct”. The new requirement will be in addition to the requirement in section 91ED(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that the application must disclose all relevant facts and documents relating to the arrangement for which the ruling is sought. Its inclusion is to ensure that the applicant has personally examined the application and stated that to the best of their knowledge, the information disclosed for the application is comprehensive. 87 CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX (DETERMINATIONS) REGULATIONS 1987 (Clauses 176 to 178) Summary of proposed amendments Regulation 10 of the Income Tax (Determinations) Regulations 1987 is being amended to change the reference to “the Gazette” to “a publication chosen by the Commissioner” following a similar change in respect of binding rulings made in 2010. The current fee- waiver provision will also be amended to make it more flexible. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The current fee-waiver provision only permits the fees for a financial arrangement determination to be waived in whole or in part in “exceptional circumstances”. The new fee-waiver provision will allow greater flexibility based on what the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. Background The proposed removal of the reference to “the Gazette” follows changes which were made to the Tax Administration Act in 2010, where the requirement to publish the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette was replaced with a requirement to publish in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. As with the previous change, this is aimed at streamlining the process and avoiding the duplicate publishing of the determinations (which are published in Tax Information Bulletins and available on Inland Revenue’s website). The fee-waiver provision in the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 was similarly amended in 2010 to provide the Commissioner with greater flexibility to waive fees in circumstances where it is considered to be fair and reasonable to do so. 88 CHANGES TO THE TAX ADMINISTRATION (BINDING RULINGS) REGULATIONS 1999 (Clauses 179 to 181) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that the fees charged for binding rulings be increased to take into account increasing costs of providing a ruling and be expressed as “plus GST (if any)” to give greater clarity for taxpayers. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Fees payable for a binding ruling made by Inland Revenue are set out in Regulation 3 of the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999. The fees currently comprise an application fee of $310 and a further fee of $155 an hour (or part-hour), beyond the first two hours, spent in consideration of the application by the Commissioner. Regulation 7 currently provides that the fees include GST. It also provides that for a supply which is zero-rated under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the fee prescribed by the regulations is reduced by an amount equal to the GST portion of the fee. The new fees will be $280 plus GST (if any) for the application fee, and $140 plus GST (if any) for the further fee. The reference in Regulation 3(1)(b)(ii) to the fees payable for applications received before 1999 will be revoked as it is no longer relevant. Regulation 7 will also be revoked. Background The change to a “plus GST (if any)” basis stems from the GST rate increase on 1 October 2010 from 12.5% to 15%. The change to a “plus GST (if any)” basis expresses the fees which are payable for supplies which are zero-rated in a less complex manner. The fees have not been increased since 1999. The increases proposed are minor, and will help to meet costs involved in providing rulings. 89 CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX (DEPRECIATION DETERMINATIONS) REGULATIONS 1993 (Clauses 171 to 175) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that the fees payable for depreciation determinations made by Inland Revenue be increased to take into account the increased costs of providing determinations, and be expressed as plus any GST. The bill also proposes that a new additional consultation reimbursement fee be added, which relates to applications for determinations of provisional rates under section 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The initial fee and processing fee will both be increased, and the $300 cap on the departmental consultation reimbursement fee will be removed. The fees will be expressed as “plus GST (if any)”. Cross-references in the regulations will be updated to include reference to the new additional consultation reimbursement fee. The fee waiver provision will be amended to provide the Commissioner with greater flexibility to waive fees in circumstances where it is considered fair and reasonable to do so. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features The fees which are payable for depreciation determinations made by Inland Revenue are set out in Regulation 9 of the Income Tax (Depreciation Determinations) Regulations 1993. The fees currently comprise an initial fee of $50, a processing fee of $30 per hour (or part-hour) beyond the first two hours spent in processing of the application, a departmental consultation reimbursement fee, and an additional consultation reimbursement fee. The initial fee will be increased to $150 plus any GST and the processing fee will be increased to $75 plus any GST per hour (or part hour) beyond the first two hours. The consultation reimbursement fee which an applicant is liable to pay Inland Revenue is currently capped at $300. This $300 cap will be removed, so the departmental consultation fee will be equal to the amount of fees paid by the Commissioner to consultants. The wording will also change from “paid by the Department” to “paid by the Commissioner”. The bill also proposes that an additional consultation reimbursement fee be added. An applicant for a determination of a provisional rate will be liable to pay this fee if the Commissioner has declined to issue a determination, or has issued a determination which is unfavourable to the applicant and the applicant requests further work. 90 Similarly, an additional consultation reimbursement fee will apply following a conference if the applicant requests further work and the extra work or the conference do not cause the Commissioner to issue a determination which is favourable to the applicant. Regulation 12 currently provides that the fees prescribed in the regulations include goods and services tax. This will be revoked as the GST treatment of the fees will be addressed in Regulation 9. The cross-references in Regulation 10(1) and 10(2) of the Income Tax (Depreciation Determinations) Regulations 1993 will be updated to include a reference to the new additional consultation reimbursement fee. The current fee-waiver provision only permits the fees for a depreciation determination to be waived in whole or in part in “exceptional circumstances”. The new fee-waiver provision will allow more flexibility based on what the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. Background Fees for determinations made by Inland Revenue were set on the basis of full-cost recovery when they were introduced in 1993. The fees have not increased since the regulations came into force, although the costs involved in providing depreciation determinations have increased substantially. Increasing the fees and removing the cap on the departmental consultation reimbursement fee will better reflect the costs to Inland Revenue of providing the service. Taxpayers can apply for determinations on provisional rates, special rates and a higher maximum pooling value. Fees are currently not payable on determinations of provisional rates. The proposed new additional consultation reimbursement fee will mean that some fees may be payable for determinations of provisional rates. Currently, a taxpayer who has had their application for a provisional rate determination declined, or who has received a determination which is unfavourable to their position, can request further work, even when there is little chance of their application being successful. Fees may be payable in these instances to reflect the costs to Inland Revenue of any further work undertaken. The fee-waiver provision in the Income Tax (Depreciation Determinations) Regulations 1993 is not currently used as the fees do not come close to recovering the costs to Inland Revenue in providing determinations. As the fees are being increased to a level which will better reflect the costs to Inland Revenue in providing determinations, the fee- waiver provision is being amended to offer greater flexibility to the Commission to waive fees in circumstances where it is considered to be fair and reasonable to do so. The current fee-waiver mirrors the former fee-waiver provision in the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 which was amended in 2010 to provide greater flexibility based on what the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. It is proposed in this bill to similarly amend the fee-waiver provision in the Income Tax (Determinations) Regulations 1987. 91 AMENDMENTS TO THE PIE RULES (Clauses 16, 29, 40 to 55, 95 and 167) Summary of proposed amendment The bill contains several remedial amendments to the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules, including some amendments to the recently enacted rules for foreign investment PIEs. Some amendments are to correct minor anomalies in how the rules operate while others are to correct minor technical errors. Application date The amendments will apply from the date of enactment unless otherwise stated. Key features The amendments will: • narrow the capital gains exemption that applies to PIEs investing in New Zealand and Australian listed shares, to ensure that it applies only to shares that provide an equity interest; • amend section HM 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which requires all investors to have the same rights to investment proceeds to clarify that it should not apply when a PIE invests in financial arrangements only; • add Quayside Holdings Limited, the investment arm of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, to schedule 29, which will mean its investments will be exempt from some of the requirements of the PIE rules; • amend the flow-through rule to ensure expenses are treated appropriately in all situations; and • correct minor drafting errors. Detailed analysis Tax exclusion for non-participating shares Section CX 55 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that income from a PIE’s share- trading gains from New Zealand and certain Australian shares is generally excluded. When this rule was developed, it was only intended that it would apply to shares that provide a true equity interest in the underlying company. Reflecting this intention, the share-trading exclusion does not apply to non-participating redeemable shares at present. Nevertheless, some types of share do not provide a true equity interest yet do not fall within the definition of a non-participating redeemable share. Further, some elements 92 of the definition are of no concern from a policy perspective – for example, it is irrelevant whether or not a share carries voting rights. Accordingly, the bill will modify the share-trading exclusion to more closely reflect the original policy intent. Specifically, the share-trading exclusion will not apply to shares that are: • a fixed-rate share; or • a share to which the amount payable on its cancellation is no more than the original subscription amount of the share. Application of anti-streaming rule for cash PIEs Section HM 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out a specific rule to prevent the streaming of different types of investment proceeds to different investors. This rule is designed to combat tax minimisation strategies and generally operates as intended. It can, however, be read in a way that causes difficulties for so-called “cash PIEs” (i.e. term deposits that have been structured as PIEs) because of the way these PIEs are often structured. The bill amends section HM 17 to clarify that it does not apply to PIEs that invest only in financial arrangements, such as cash PIEs. The clarification will ensure that cash PIEs can continue to structure themselves in the most commercially sensible manner. As all amounts received under a financial arrangement, whether capital or revenue in nature, are taxable, allowing such streaming does not provide any tax advantage. Flow-through rule for foreign investment PIEs To facilitate the use of inter-PIE investment of foreign investment PIEs, a flow-through rule was created. The rule allows one PIE (PIE A) to treat its share of the gross income derived by another PIE (PIE B) as if the income had been derived directly. Say, for example, PIE B derived $100 of gross income and wishes to charge PIE A $10 in fees (leaving $90 net). Under the flow-through rule, PIE A would be treated as deriving $100 of income. However, for the flow-through rule to work effectively, the treatment of expenses also needs to be considered. If PIE B attributes the full $100 of income to PIE A and sends a separate bill for $10, it is clear that PIE A will have incurred $10 of expenditure. However, say instead PIE B deducts the $10 from the amount it pays to PIE A, so only $90 is attributed. In this case it is unclear whether PIE A has incurred the $10 of expenditure, even though it will be deemed to have earned the full $100 under the flow-through. To ensure the appropriate result is achieved, the bill introduces new subsection HM 6B(4). The subsection clarifies that a PIE using the flow-through rule is deemed to have incurred expenditure equal to the difference between the amount of income deemed to have been derived under the flow-through and the amount actually attributed to the PIE. In the example above, PIE A is treated as deriving $100 of income under the flow-through mechanism but has only been attributed $90 of income. Accordingly, subsection HM 6B(4) will deem PIE A to have incurred a $10 expense. This clarification applies from the beginning of the 2012−13 income year. 93 Adding Quayside Holdings to schedule 29 Normally an entity can only own up to 20 percent of a PIE and there must be at least 20 investors in a PIE. The rationale for these restrictions is to ensure that PIEs are widely held, so a single investor cannot dominate the actions of a PIE. Entities listed in schedule 29, however, can hold up to 100 percent of a PIE and can be a PIE’s sole investor. This is on the basis that such entities are themselves widely held. The PIE will therefore, in effect, still be widely held even if one such entity has a significant interest in it. The bill adds Quayside Holdings to schedule 29. Quayside’s investments are held for the benefit of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council’s ratepayers. As such, it is effectively widely held. In addition, Quayside is similar in function to other entities already listed on schedule 29, such as Auckland Council, EQC and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. All these entities invest for the benefit of a significant sector of the public. Minor drafting errors Amendments in the bill correct the following minor drafting errors: • section HL 21(13) is being replaced by new section HL 21(9B), which will correctly modify an investor’s prescribed investor rate as opposed to their portfolio investor rate with application from 1 April 2008. A similar amendment is being made to section HL 20 of the Income Tax Act 2004 with application from 1 October 2007; • the erroneous reference to “an exiting investor referred to in section HM 61” will be removed from the definition of zero-rated investor; • the rule that provides how a PIE should allocate tax credits will be amended to correctly apply to all types of credit, other than PIE-specific credits; • references to “tax year” and “income year” in section HM 34 will be corrected, with application from the beginning of the 2011−11 income year; • references to defined terms in sections HM 35B and EZ 63 will be corrected, with application from the beginning of the 2010−11 income year and 30 June 2010, respectively; • sections HM 51(1)(b) and HM 53(1)(b)(ii) are being amended to provide that transitional residents that have elected a 0% tax rate cannot benefit from certain tax credits; • section HM 32(3) is being re-worded (with effect from the date of enactment), while sections 64(3) and 65(5) will be amended (with effect from the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011) to clarify the policy intent; and • cross-referencing errors will be corrected in sections HM 11(2) and (3), HM 12(2) and HM 19C(2), with effect from the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. 94 FDP ACCOUNT (Clauses 69 and 70) Summary of proposed amendment The bill includes two remedial amendments to the foreign dividend payment (FDP) account rules so that when a company pays further income tax as a result of having a FDP debit balance, a FDP credit arises that eliminates the FDP debit balance. In the absence of the remedial amendments, the FDP account would remain in debit for the following year, triggering an additional tax liability, even though the correct amount of further income tax has already been paid. Application date The amendments apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009, as this is consistent with earlier FDP changes that created the issue. Key features Under the existing law, a company that has an FDP debit balance at the end of the tax year, or at the time that the company stops being resident in New Zealand, is required to pay a further income tax equal to the FDP debit balance. New sections OC 30(4) and OC 31(3) create an FDP credit for an amount of further income tax paid in these circumstances. Background As part of the 2009 international tax changes, an exemption was implemented for foreign dividends paid to companies. This meant that a special tax on foreign dividends, called a foreign dividend payment (FDP), was repealed. FDP credit accounts were retained for five years to allow companies to distribute FDP credits to shareholders. Previously, if a FDP account had a debit balance at the end of the year (for example, because excess credits were distributed), an additional FDP liability would be payable. In 2009 this liability was replaced with a further income tax liability to reflect the fact that FDP was repealed. An unforeseen consequence of this change is that once a FDP account went into debit, the account would remain in debit for the following year, triggering an additional tax liability, even though the correct amount of further income tax has already been paid. 95 NRWT AND PARTLY IMPUTED DIVIDENDS (Clause 86) Summary of proposed amendment The bill includes a remedial amendment to the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules to ensure that some partly imputed dividends are not overtaxed compared with the rate that would apply to an equivalent unimputed dividend under a double tax agreement (DTA). Application date The amendment applies from 1 February 2010, being the date that the NRWT rate on imputed non-portfolio dividends was reduced to nil. Key features The bill clarifies how New Zealand’s domestic law and double tax agreements should interact when a company pays a partly-imputed dividend to a non-resident who would qualify for relief under a double tax agreement. Under the proposed new rules, taxpayers will calculate the post-treaty tax rate that would apply to an equivalent unimputed dividend. This rate will apply to the unimputed portion of the dividend (section RF 11B(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007). Subject to certain conditions being met, the imputed portion of the dividend may then qualify for the 0% NRWT rate under section RF 11B(a), or failing that, the 15% rate under section RF 7. This approach is likely to be consistent with how taxpayers have been applying the existing law. Background The rate of NRWT that applies to dividends depends on whether the dividend is imputed or unimputed, and whether the shareholder is from a country which has a DTA with New Zealand. The problem for partly imputed dividends is that DTAs reduce the NRWT that applies to the total dividend (the average rate of NRWT) as opposed to the rate that applies to the unimputed portion (the marginal rate). This means there may be little or no relief of NRWT in respect of the unimputed portion of the dividend. For example, if a dividend was half imputed and half unimputed, the average NRWT rate would be 15% which would not be reduced further by the DTA. In contrast, if the same amount could be paid as two separate dividends, an imputed dividend and an unimputed dividend, there would be DTA relief on the unimputed dividend so that the average rate on both dividends would be 7.5%. 96 To correct this inconsistency, the bill provides for a lower rate of NRWT on the unimputed portion of a dividend when a DTA would have provided for a lower rate if the entire dividend had been unimputed. Detailed analysis Clause 86 of the bill replaces section RF 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007. The new section RF 11B is described below. Section RF 11B(a) applies to the extent that a dividend is fully-imputed. It provides a 0% rate of NRWT to the fully-imputed portion of a dividend if the conditions of section RF 11B(a)(i) or RF 11(a)(ii) are met. Section RF 11B(a)(i) requires that the shares be directly held by a non-resident and which have a 10% or greater voting interest in the company paying the dividend. Section RF 11B(a)(ii) requires the dividend to be held by a non-resident who does not have a 10% or greater voting interest but who would nonetheless receive a less than 15% rate under a double tax agreement. Currently, New Zealand has no DTAs that provide for this. Section RF 11B(b) applies to the extent to which the dividend is not fully-imputed. It requires the taxpayer to calculate a post-treaty tax rate by assuming that no imputation credits are attached to the dividend (including any portion of the dividend that is in fact imputed). This tax rate is then applied to the unimputed portion of the dividend. 97 DEFINITION OF “HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENT” (Clauses 88 and 168) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the definition of “hire purchase agreement” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to correct a drafting error. Application date The amendment will apply from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004, with a “savings” provision for people who filed returns before the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The definition of “hire purchase agreement” in the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to clarify that an agreement where the goods are let or hired to a person with an option to purchase does not require that option to be actually exercised. Background The definition of “hire purchase agreement”, which originates from the Hire Purchase Act 1971, is intended to cover two types of hire purchase agreement recognised by long-standing case law. The first is one where the goods are let or hired to a person with an option to purchase (the “option to purchase agreement”). 2 The second is one when a person has agreed to purchase the goods with a condition (a “conditional contract of sale”). 3 The main difference between the two is whether or not the person has agreed to purchase the goods at the time the relevant contract is entered into. The rewrite of the hire purchase agreement definition in the Income Tax Act 1994 contained a drafting error. The option to purchase agreement in the definition imports the conditional contract of sale element – it is not intended that the person’s actual agreement to purchase the goods is also required. 2 Helby v Matthews \[1895\] AC 471 (HL). 3 Lee v Butler \[1893\] 2 QB 318 (CA). 98 LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS – LOSS LIMITATION RULES (Clause 39) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that a loan by a limited partner to their limited partnership is counted when calculating their basis for the purposes of the loss limitation rules. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2008, being the date the limited partnership rules started. Key features The limited partnership rules contain loss limitation provisions to ensure that the amount of tax deductions a limited partner may claim in a year is restricted if the amount of the deductions exceeds the tax book value of their investment (the partner’s basis). The definition of “capital contribution” in the “investments” item of the loss limitation formula is being amended to clarify that it includes a loan made by a limited partner to a limited partnership, and a credit balance in the limited partner’s current account with the partnership. 99 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANIES − MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS (Clauses 33 to 36, 88 and 150) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains several remedial amendments to the look-through company (LTC) rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to ensure the rules are consistent with the original policy intent. The amendments cover: • Qualifying company amalgamations • Tax elections, and valuation and timing methods • Disposal of financial arrangements • Fringe benefits provided to working owners • Flat-owning companies • Look-through counted owner test • GST group-filing rules Except where indicated otherwise, these amendments will apply from 1 April 2011, when the LTC rules became effective. Qualifying company amalgamations (Clause 33) When the LTC rules were introduced, the qualifying company (QC) rules were grandparented. The intention was that no new companies could use the QC rules after 1 April 2011; only companies that were already QCs (including loss attributing qualifying companies before that date could continue to use the QC rules. This amendment ensures that a new company cannot enter into the QC rules through an amalgamation that is not a resident’s amalgamation. The amendment provides that following an amalgamation between a non-QC company and a QC, the resulting amalgamated company cannot use the QC rules. The amendment will apply to amalgamations on or after the date of enactment. Tax elections, and valuation and timing methods (Clause 34) This amendment provides that elections concerning the tax treatment of an LTC’s income or property, or any valuation or timing methods adopted in relation to an LTC’s income or property, are made or established by the LTC, not each owner. The elections made, or valuation and timing methods adopted, by the LTC are then binding on the owners in respect of their look-through interests in the LTC’s property. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. 100 Disposal of financial arrangements (Clause 35) When an owner disposes of some or all of their interests, and those interests include a financial arrangement or an excepted financial arrangement, the owner is not required to perform a base price adjustment for their interest in a financial arrangement if, among other things, the LTC is not in the business of holding financial arrangements. This amendment clarifies that is not necessary to consider whether any of the owners of the LTC have a business of holding financial arrangements in a capacity other than as an owner. It is only the LTC’s business that is relevant. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Fringe benefits provided to working owners (Clause 88) A shareholder of an LTC who personally and actively performs duties for the LTC under a contract of employment may, if certain conditions are met, be treated as an employee and be referred to as a “working owner”. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) does not apply to fringe benefits received by working owners. Instead the cost of providing the benefit is a distribution of profit to that owner, to the extent of the private use element. The “private” costs are non-deductible to the other owners. This amendment clarifies that a “working owner” is not treated as an employee for FBT purposes, by re-drafting the rule for “working owners” so that it is written in a similar style as the same, longer-standing, rule for “working partners” in a partnership. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Flat-owning companies (Clause 88) This amendment ensures that the definition of “flat-owning company” applies when that term is used in the definition of “look-through company”. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. Look-through “counted owner” test (Clause 88) An LTC must have five or fewer “look-through counted owners”. The shareholdings of look-through owners who are relatives are aggregated, and they are treated as one look- through counted owner. The definition of “relative” includes, among other things, a person connected with another person by being the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit. This was not the intended policy outcome in relation to trustee owners of LTCs, who should be treated as separate look-through owners. This amendment limits the meaning of “relative” for the purposes of aggregating interests in an LTC, by excluding a person connected with another person by being the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit. 101 The amendment will apply from an LTC’s first income year starting on or after the date of enactment. GST group registration rules (Clause 150) An LTC is not generally regarded as a company for income tax purposes. However, for GST purposes, an LTC is a company and is the GST registered entity. The LTC is responsible for complying with any GST requirements, not each individual owner. Therefore LTCs should be able to use the GST group registration rules. This amendment provides that the income tax rules for defining a “group of companies” will include an LTC to the extent that these rules are used to define a group of companies within the GST group registration rules only. This will allow LTCs to meet the requirements for GST group registration. The amendment will apply from 1 April 2011. 102 MEASUREMENT OF COST – FIF RULES (Clauses 24 and 25) Summary of proposed amendment When the new foreign investment fund (FIF) rules were introduced, a temporary 5-year exemption was provided for investments in grey list companies with significant New Zealand shareholdings. Investments in Guinness Peat Group plc (GPG) qualified for this exemption. This exemption will expire from the beginning of the 2012−13 income year. This will mean that many shareholders in GPG will calculate tax under the FIF rules from 1 April 2012 using the fair dividend rate (FDR) method. Because of the expiry of the exemption, a minor remedial amendment is required to define how “cost” is measured for the FIF rules. The FIF rules do not apply to natural persons (or to certain trusts) if the cost of their FIF investments is equal to or less than $50,000. For the purposes of determining cost, section EX 68 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a taxpayer can use half an investment’s 1 April 2007 value in place of its cost if it was purchased before 1 January 2000. This is because such an investment’s cost may not be readily available. For investments to which the temporary 5-year exemption applied, this modification to “cost” is not appropriate. It may be difficult to obtain price data for long-held investments purchased after 1 January 2000. Accordingly, it is proposed that a taxpayer be able to elect to treat the cost of an investment in a FIF as its market value at 1 April 2013 if that investment was previously covered by the 5-year temporary exemption and the investment was entered into before 1 January 2005. The investment’s market value, as opposed to half its market value (as in the existing rule), will be used because share prices are historically very low. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2012−13 income year. 103 FIF REMEDIAL (Clause 23) Summary of proposed amendment The provision in the Income Tax Act 2007 that provides an exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for shares held in certain Australian companies is being updated to reflect the updated ASX Operating Rules. Application date The change will apply from the introduction of the updated rules (1 August 2010). 104 TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE LIFE INSURANCE TRANSITIONAL RULES (Clauses 2(16), 26 and 27) Summary of proposed amendments Technical changes are proposed to the application and effect of the transitional rules for life insurance policies sold before the commencement date of the reforms to the taxation of life insurance in 2010. The changes affect both profit participation policies and life risk policies. Application date The proposed changes apply from 1 July 2010, or earlier at the life insurer’s election for an income year that includes 1 July 2010. Key features The changes: • Clarify that a simplified method for taxing profit participation policies (sold before 30 June 2009) continues to apply if those policies are later transferred or sold to another life insurer and certain conditions continue to be met. Consequential changes are also proposed to preserve transitional relief available to life risk policies in the event those policies are sold or transferred to another life insurer. • Clarify that transitional relief continues to apply to life risk policies that are cancelled by the policyholder but later restored by the life insurer on the same terms and conditions. The restoration would need to occur within 90 days from when the life insurer receives notice of the cancellation. • Remove ambiguities about how the transitional rules apply to life reinsurance contracts. Background Changes to the taxation of life insurance business, enacted by the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009, included a set of transitional rules designed to grandparent life insurance policies sold before the date the new rules started. Grandparented life policies are eligible for relief that preserves, for a limited period, the application of the previous life taxation rules. Ongoing consultation with life insurers about the effect of the taxation reform has continued to identify a number of remedial, and often technical, issues with the operation of the transitional rules. Many of these issues are connected with the range and variation of life products on offer and the legal nature of the policies sold. 105 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL AMENDMENTS The following amendments reflect the recommendations of the Rewrite Advisory Panel’s consideration of submissions on the rewritten Income Tax Acts. The Panel monitors the working of the Income Tax Act 2007 and reviews submissions on what may be unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommends legislative action, when necessary, to correct any problems. Application date Unless otherwise stated, all of the following rewrite amendments apply retrospectively, with effect from the beginning of the 2008−09 income year. Valuation of livestock (Clause 20) As part of the rewrite of the trading stock rules in subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 1994 into the Income Tax Act 2004, the livestock valuation rules were separated from the general trading stock rules (subpart EB). The livestock valuation rules were placed in a separate subpart (subpart EC). Subpart EC was re-enacted in the Income Tax Act 2007. However, under section EE 1 of the 1994 Act, the trading stock valuation rules in subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 1994 applied to a person carrying on a business. Therefore in the 1994 Act, the livestock valuation rules applied only to a person carrying on a business and to their livestock held as part of the normal incident of carrying on that business. This aspect of section EE 1 was rewritten into subpart EB but was inadvertently not included in the provisions of subpart EC. This amendment restores the business nexus to subpart EC in both the 2004 and 2007 Acts. This requirement extends to all livestock for which there is a purpose of sale. The business nexus will normally be satisfied for livestock held over several years, such as dairy cattle, sheep, goats and the like, which are held for their fleece or their progeny (or both). The business nexus would normally be satisfied for this type of livestock because the disposal of these animals beyond their useful life is a normal incident of a farming business. Application date The amendment to the livestock valuation rules to restore the business nexus apply from the beginning of the 2005−06 income year. However, a savings provision applies for tax positions taken before 31 May 2011. 106 Trustee income (Clause 38) If income derived by at trustee for an income year is not distributed as beneficiary income, that income is included in the trustee’s taxable income as trustee income. In most circumstances, trustees are taxed on income derived if it is either sourced from New Zealand or derived by a trust having a resident settlor. Section HC 25 provides support to the settlor basis for taxing trusts by ensuring that a non-resident trustee of a trust having a resident settlor (and certain other trusts) is taxable on income derived from sources outside New Zealand. The Rewrite Advisory Panel noted that section HC 25(1) contains an ambiguity and could be read as applying to income derived from a source outside Zealand by a non- resident trustee of a trust having a resident settlor even if that income is distributed as beneficiary income. The Panel also identified that as the Interpretation Act 1999 provided for headings to sections to be relevant indicators for statutory interpretation, there is no unintended change in outcome. Therefore, the Panel concluded it is unnecessary to provide for a retrospective amendment. This amendment clarifies that section HC 25 applies to income derived by a trustee in an income year that is not also beneficiary income. The Panel considered this amendment will assist the reader in understanding the effect of the provision. Employment income (Clause 88(7)) The amendment resolves an ambiguity in the definition of “employment income” and ensures that the definition applies to shareholder-employees. Employment income is defined in the 2007 Act as income referred to in section CE 1. Under this provision, for shareholder-employees to derive employment income, the income they derive must come within the meaning of salary or wages. However the definition of “salary and wages” in section RD 5 might not include income of a shareholder-employee who has elected to opt out of the PAYE rules. The election to opt out of the PAYE rules is permitted in relation to drawings taken from the company in anticipation of a salary being subsequently declared. This amendment ensures that the income of a shareholder-employee who has elected that employment income is not subject to the PAYE rules, remains treated as employment income for the purpose of non-PAYE provisions. Examples of employment income provisions that apply to shareholder-employees are sections CE 1, EA 4 and EI 9. 107 Minor maintenance items The bill also contains a series of amendments for minor maintenance items arising from the rewrite of income tax legislation that have been referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. These may include any of the following: • ambiguities; • compilation errors; • cross-references; • drafting consistency, including readers’ aids − for example, the defined terms lists; • grammar; • punctuation; • spelling; • consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments; or • the consistent use of terminology and definitions. The following minor maintenance items are included in this bill.

Although many parents reach private agreement on their financial contributions and care arrangements, many cannot. The scheme, therefore, provides a back-up for those parents who cannot mutually agree on their relative financial contributions to support their children. It also applies when the receiving parent receives a state-provided benefit. While the current child support scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are concerns that the scheme is now, in many cases, out of date. The amendments in the bill aim to reduce these and other concerns. The changes provide for a fairer and more transparent assessment calculation for child support payments that takes a wider range of individual circumstances and capacities to pay into account. The bill also includes changes to the rules relating to the payment of child support, the imposition of penalties, and the writing-off of penalties. Broadly speaking, the changes in the bill fall into three categories: • a new child support calculation formula; • secondary changes to update the child support scheme; and • amendments to the payment, penalty and debt rules for child support. Child support formula The new formula introduced in the bill will provide a more equitable system of financial support in a variety of circumstances. In particular, it will better reflect many of the social and legal changes that have occurred since the introduction of the current scheme, such as the greater emphasis placed on separated parents sharing the care of and financial responsibility for their children. This in turn will increase the incentives for parents to meet their child support obligations. The new formula bases child support payments on: • a wider recognition of shared care, based, in the first instance, on there being care of at least 28 percent of nights in a year; • the income of both parents; and • the estimated average expenditures for raising children in New Zealand. Secondary changes to update the child support scheme The bill also includes amendments which affect the operation of the child support formula and scheme more generally. The amendments: 4 • allow Inland Revenue to rely on parenting orders and agreements when establishing care levels; • introduce a Commissioner’s discretion to make it easier for significant daytime care to be recognised for shared care purposes in addition to nights; • more closely align the definition of “income” for child support purposes with the broader definition of “family scheme income” for Working for Families purposes; • introduce a Commissioner’s discretion to allow, in certain circumstances, various prescribed payments to be recognised for child support payment purposes; • recognise re-establishment costs, following a separation, as an administrative review ground in certain circumstances; and • reduce the qualifying age of children subject to the child support scheme from under 19 to under 18, unless they are 18 and enrolled in full-time secondary education. Changes to payment, penalties and write-off rules The rules relating to payment, penalties and the write-off of child support debt play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations on time. A system that is overly penal and inflexible can lead to very high debt levels that discourage parents from contacting Inland Revenue and arranging payment. The changes in the bill are aimed at encouraging parents to make timely payments of child support. To that end, the bill: • allows for compulsory deductions of child support from the employment income of paying parents; • introduces a new two-stage initial penalty, with the current full 10 percent only being charged if the debt remains unpaid after 7 days; • reduces the incremental monthly penalty from 2 percent to 1 percent after a year of non-compliance; • changes the circumstances in which penalties can be written off, including when a paying parent enters into an instalment arrangement or is in serious hardship, when debt recovery is a demonstrably inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources, or when only a low level of penalty debt is outstanding; and • allows Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt owed to the Crown, in relation to a receiving carer who is on a benefit, on serious hardship grounds. Application dates The amendments in the bill apply in two phases. The new child support formula will apply for assessment periods from 1 April 2013. Owing to the significant systems and other administrative changes involved in their implementation, all other changes to the child support scheme will apply from 1 April 2014. 5 A NEW CHILD SUPPORT FORMULA (Clauses 9, 11, 23 and schedule 1) Summary of proposed amendments The comprehensive new child support formula introduced by the bill will base child support payments on: • a wider recognition of shared care; • the income of both parents; and • the estimated average expenditures for raising children in New Zealand. Lower levels of shared care To deal with concerns about insufficient recognition of regular shared care of children, and the costs associated with that care, the revised formula will accommodate lower levels of shared care by way of tiered thresholds, commencing from 28 percent of nights (the current formula recognises shared care only if it amounts to at least 40 percent of nights). Total income of both parents Both parents’ incomes (less a living allowance for each parent) will be included in the formula, with the costs of raising children being apportioned according to each parent’s share of total net income. When a parent has other dependent children or is paying child support for children in other relationships, the parent’s income will be reduced for the assumed expenditure on those children, based on the same method of calculation as for other children, before calculating their child support contribution. Expenditures for raising children The formula will use a new scale of costs (expressed as percentages of child support income) that reflects more up-to-date information on the expenditure involved in raising children (after allowing for likely tax credits). These percentages vary with the number of children, the age of the children (the percentage being higher for children over 12 years), and the total income of the parents. As income rises, the percentages progressively decline to reflect that the proportion of income spent on children declines as income rises. Given that the additional expenditure becomes increasingly discretionary as income rises, the new formula will, as currently, also include a cap on the amount of child support payable. New child support formula The net effect of these changes is that, under the new formula, the costs will be apportioned between the parents according to the relative difference between their respective shares of combined child support income as adjusted by their share of each child’s care when the proportion of that care is at least 28 percent. 6 Non-parent carers may be eligible to receive a proportion of any child support payments if they care for the child for at least 28 percent of the time. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2013. Key features Summary of key steps in determining child support payable for a particular child ↓ Step 2: Work out the parents’ combined child support income ↓ Step 3: Work out each parent’s income percentage (section 31) ↓ Step 4: Work out each parent’s and non-parent carer’s percentage of care for the child ↓ Step 5: Work out each parent’s and non-parent carer’s care cost percentage for the child (section 16 and schedule 1) that relates to their care percentage ↓ Step 6: For each parent, subtract their care cost percentage from their income percentage (section 18). If the answer is positive (i.e. the income percentage exceeds the care cost percentage), the parent is a liable parent. If the answer is negative, (i.e. the income percentage is less than the care cost percentage), the parent is a receiving carer ↓ Step 7: Work out the expenditure for the child using the child expenditure table (section 36D), taking into account the combined child support income amounts of the parents, the number of children in the child's child support group; and the age of those children. This expenditure amount is divided by the number of children in the child support group to get a per child amount ↓ Step 8: The annual rate of child support payable by the parent for the child is worked out using the formula (section 29): (parent’s income percentage – parent’s care cost percentage) x expenditure on the child ↓ Step 9: The amount that a carer receives is determined in sections 36A-C. A receiving parent receives an amount calculated applying the formula in step 8, based on their income and care cost percentages. If this is less than the amount that the liable parent pays, the balance is split between any other receiving carers ↓ Step 10: When a parent is paying child support for more than one child support group, the amount may be capped. If the amount calculated at step 8 is more than the amount calculated under the multi-group cap (section 29), the multi-group cap amount applies. This cap ensures the liability is no more than it would be if all the children from the various child support groups were living together ↓ Step 11: The amount payable may also be subject to minimum annual rate (section 30) Step 1: Work out each parent’s child support income amount (section 32). This is the parent’s taxable income plus adjustments to take into account a number of other forms of “income” (section 33), less: - a living allowance (section 34); - any allowance for other dependent children (section 35); and - any allowance for other children from other relationships (referred to as child support groups) for whom the parent is paying child support (section 36) 7 Analysis of key features Clause 9 repeals sections 8 to 24 and introduces new sections 7B to 19. New sections 14 to 16 relate to establishing the proportion of ongoing daily care that each carer of a child provides to the child. A person who provides at least 28 percent of ongoing daily care (which equates to two nights per week on average) is entitled, under new section 16, to a “care cost percentage” in relation to the child. This gives recognition for the parent’s costs for the care they provide. The care cost percentages are set out in new schedule 1. New section 14 provides that the Commissioner must establish the proportion of ongoing daily care that each parent and non-parent carer provides to a qualifying child. It also provides that if two or more people who live together provide that care, only one person may be treated as the carer with the care provided by both people being treated as care provided by that person. If one of the people is the parent, that person must be treated as the carer. New section 15 identifies how the Commissioner establishes the proportions of ongoing daily care each carer provides. This is described in more detail in “Recognition of care for child support purposes” later in this commentary. New section 16 determines, on the basis of the proportions of care already established, each carer’s care cost percentage. This is done by reference to the table in new schedule 1. A proportion of care that is less than 28 percent results in a care cost percentage of 0 percent. A proportion of care of 72 percent or more results in a care cost percentage of 100 percent. Proportions of care between 28 percent and 72 percent have different care cost percentages attributable to them. New section 17 provides for the Commissioner to identify the liable parents and receiving carers of qualifying children. This requires that the care cost percentages of every carer, and an “income percentage” of every parent, be determined. A parent whose income percentage exceeds their care cost percentage will be a liable parent. A parent whose income percentage is less than their care percentage will be a receiving carer. A non-parent carer who provides at least 28 percent of ongoing daily care, and therefore has a care cost percentage, will also be a receiving carer. The income of non-parent carers is not taken into consideration in the calculation because, unlike the parents, they are not treated as having financial responsibility for the child. Clause 11 introduces new sections 29 to 36, which replace the current sections that determine the amount of child support liability under a formula assessment. New section 29 sets out a new formula for assessing the annual amount of child support payable in respect of a child. The amount is determined by subtracting a liable parent’s care cost percentage from their income percentage (which must result in a positive percentage, because otherwise they would not be a liable parent) and multiplying the result by the appropriate amount calculated in accordance with the “child expenditure table” that the Commissioner must issue annually in accordance with section 36D. The Commissioner’s table will be based on the expenditure on children table in schedule 2, and will, in most cases, use the combined child support income of both parents when determining the appropriate level of expenditure. 8 However, for liable parents that have more than one child support group (see new section 36), this formula may result in an assessment of child support liability that is higher than would arise if all the parent’s qualifying children were living in a single household, rather than in multiple households. For these parents, an alternative formula, called the multi-group cap, is provided. This provides that their child support liability for each child is 100% minus their care cost percentage for the child, multiplied by the multi-group cost of the child. That multi-group cost is determined under new section 36(5). New section 30 relates to the annual rate of child support liability of a liable parent. At present, there is a minimum annual rate that a liable parent must pay, regardless of the number of children to whom the liability relates. In order to retain this concept, new section 30 provides that, if the sum of the amounts of child support payable in respect of each of a liable parent’s children is less than the minimum amount, the parent must pay the minimum amount. New section 31 describes what a person’s income percentage is in relation to a particular child. It is their “child support income amount” (determined under new section 32) divided by the sum of the child support income amounts of all parents of the child. New section 32 sets out how a person’s child support income amount for a child is determined. The amount is the person’s “adjusted taxable income” minus each of the following: • the person’s living allowance; • any dependent child allowances; and • any applicable multi-group allowance. New section 33 sets out how a person’s adjusted taxable income is determined. This is explained further in “Definition of income for child support purposes” later in this commentary. New section 34 sets out the living. At present, there is a range of different living allowances. Under the new scheme, the allowance for most people will be the amount payable under the domestic purposes benefit to a person with one or more dependent children, as set out in schedule 16 of the Social Security Act 1964. If, however, a parent is receiving a domestic purposes benefit granted under section 27G of the Social Security Act 1964 (because the person is caring at home for someone sick or infirm) their living allowance will be equivalent to the benefit payable to such a person with one or more dependent children. The living allowance is adjusted annually in line with changes to the above benefit rates. New section 35 sets out the dependent child allowance. A parent is entitled to a deduction from their child support income for expenditure associated with each of their other children that they are financially supporting, provided they are paying child support in respect of those children. The dependent child allowance is the parent’s care cost percentage of the dependent child multiplied by the appropriate amount taken from the child expenditure table for that child based on the adjusted taxable income, less living allowance, of that parent alone. 9 New section 36 sets out the multi-group allowance. This allowance applies to a parent who has more than one “child support group”. A child support group is all those children of the parent who share the same other parent. A parent’s multi-group allowance in relation to one child is the sum of the multi-group costs of all other children who are not in the same child support group as that child. Like the dependent child allowance, the multi-group allowance is a way of recognising the costs of other children for whom the parent is contributing. The multi-group cost of a child is worked out according to a formula involving the appropriate amount from the child expenditure table for that child using the adjusted taxable income of the parent (after deducting the living allowance and any dependent child allowances) and assuming that all the children from the various child support groups were living together. The result from the child expenditure table is divided by the total number of children of the parent to get the cost for the particular child. New section 36A provides that, when there is only one receiving carer, and that person is a parent, the proportion of the cost of raising the relevant child for that person is determined by how much their care cost percentage exceeds their income percentage. New section 36B sets out the formula for allocating child support payments when there are one or more receiving carers of a child and none of them is a parent of the child. Non-parent carers receive a proportion of the payment made by the liable parent according to their relative share of the carers’ combined care cost percentages. New section 36C sets out the formula for allocating child support payments when there is more than one receiving carer of a child, and at least one of them is a parent of the child. This formula is, in effect, a combination of the formulas in sections 36A and 36B. New section 36D requires the Commissioner, before the start of each child support year, to approve a child expenditure table that will apply for that child support year. A child expenditure table is based on the “expenditure on children” table in new schedule 2, which prescribes the proportion of child support income regarded as being spent on children. The expenditure on children varies according to the number of children in a household, the child support income of the parents, and the age of the children (the percentage being higher for children over 12 years). The table expresses the annual expenditure on children as a percentage of the combined child support income amount. This expenditure on children reflects more up-to-date information on the expenditure involved in raising children (after allowing for likely tax credits). As income rises, the percentage progressively declines to reflect that the proportion of income spent on children declines as income rises. Given that the additional expenditure becomes increasingly discretionary as income rises, the new formula also includes a cap on the amount of child support payable. 10 Background The primary assumption under the current child support scheme is that the paying parent is the sole income earner and that the receiving parent is the main care provider. However, patterns of parenting have changed since the introduction of the scheme, and it is now more common for both parents to be actively involved in raising their children. Since the scheme’s introduction, there has also been greater participation in the workforce by both parents, meaning that the principal carers of children are now more likely to be in paid work. Some liable parents are concerned that the current scheme does not take into account their particular circumstances. For example, parents may share the care and costs of their children, but have arrangements that do not qualify as shared care for the purposes of the current child support formula. They are also concerned that current payment liabilities do not accurately reflect the true expenditure involved in raising children in New Zealand. The new child support formula is designed to provide a system of financial support that takes into account a wider variety of circumstances. In particular, it will better reflect many of the social and legal changes that have occurred since the introduction of the current scheme, such as the greater emphasis placed on separated parents sharing the care of and financial responsibility for their children. This in turn will increase incentives for parents to meet their child support obligations. It will also be based on a more up-to-date estimate of the expenditures involved in raising children in New Zealand at different income levels. 11 RECOGNITION OF CARE FOR CHILD SUPPORT PURPOSES (Clause 9) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments which allow Inland Revenue to rely on parenting orders and agreements when establishing care levels. It also makes it easier for other daytime care to be recognised when recognising care. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2013. Key features Clause 9 introduces new section 15. New section 15 identifies how the Commissioner establishes levels of ongoing daily care. It provides: • that the Commissioner can rely on the content of care orders or agreements relating to the child; • that the default position is that the proportion of nights that a child spends with a carer equates to the proportion of ongoing daily care that the person provides to the child; • that a carer may challenge the above positions by providing evidence that a care order or agreement should not be relied on, or that the number of nights should not be taken to equate to the proportion of care provided; and • that, if the Commissioner is satisfied on the evidence provided that the number of nights should not be taken to equate with the proportion of care, then the Commissioner may determine the proportion of care on the basis set out in new section 15(5). Section 15(5) states that the Commissioner must have regard primarily to the periods the child is in the care of the carer, and then to the following factors: • how the responsibility for decisions about the daily activities of the child is shared; • who is responsible for taking the child to and from school and supervising the child’s leisure activities; • how decisions about the education or health care of the child are made; • the financial arrangements for the child’s material support; and • which parent or carer pays for which expenses of the child. 12 Background Inland Revenue cannot currently rely on a parenting order or agreement to establish the number of nights a child spends with each parent for child support purposes. Doing so would, however, reinforce what the courts have determined to be in the best interests of the child. This initiative would extend to parenting agreements which, while not enforceable by the courts, nonetheless convey the intentions and expectations of both parents. Parents should, however, be able to rebut a presumption made on the basis of a parenting order or agreement when it can be shown that the order or agreement was not being followed in practice. 13 DEFINITION OF “INCOME” FOR CHILD SUPPORT PURPOSES (Clause 11) Summary of proposed amendment The bill makes changes to the definition of “income” for child support purposes. These changes will closely align the definition with the definition of “family scheme income” for Working for Families purposes. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features At present, only a person’s taxable income is taken into account when determining “income” for child support formula purposes. Clause 11 introduces new section 33, which defines “adjusted taxable income” for the purposes of the child support formula. The bill replicates the definition of “family scheme income” in section MA 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007, except for certain types of income that are not relevant in the child support context. The net effect is that, in addition to taxable income, the following will be included as “income” for child support purposes: • business and other losses that have been offset against taxable income; • income from a trust and companies owned by trusts where the parent is the settlor; • overseas pensions that are exempt from New Zealand tax; • distributions from superannuation schemes that relate to contributions made by a person’s employer within the last two years, when the person has retired early; • income kept in a closely held company; • fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees who control the company; • PIE income that is not “locked in”; • tax-exempt salaries and wages; • 50 percent of the value of private pensions/superannuation payments/annuities; • main income equalisation scheme deposits; and • other payments if the total exceeds $5,000 a year (this captures, for example, income received from a trust where the parent is not the settlor). 14 Background Changes were signalled by the Government in 2010 relating to the way that “income” should be defined for the purposes of Working for Families tax credits and other social policy programmes. For example, from 1 April 2011, losses, including losses from rental properties, are added back so that these losses cannot be used to reduce income when assessing eligibility for Working for Families Tax Credits. Changes were also made to ensure that certain trustee income is counted as part of a family’s total income. Such rules were implemented to counter families structuring their affairs to inflate entitlements to social assistance (or reduce their liabilities). Adopting these rules for the child support scheme will also help to maintain the scheme’s integrity and ensure parents are assessed on their true financial capacity to pay. 15 A NEW DISCRETION TO ALLOW CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO BE RECOGNISED FOR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENT PURPOSES (Clause 27) Summary of proposed amendment The bill gives the Commissioner the discretion to allow certain payments made for a child’s direct benefit to count towards a paying parent’s child support liability, in certain circumstances. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Clause 27 introduces new sections 130, 131 and 131A, which provide for a new payment method for some of the financial support for a child that a liable person is required to pay in a child support year. The new payment method is to be available only if it is acceptable to the Commissioner. It allows, as a payment method, one or more qualifying payments made for the child’s direct benefit during that year if: • the liable parent who is to make or has made the payment is not to provide, or is not providing, in the relevant year, a proportion of ongoing daily care for the child that exceeds 28 percent; • no receiving carer of the child is to be, or is, in that year a parent who is in receipt of a social security benefit (as defined in section 2(1)); • the child’s parents have, before the start of that year, entered into a written agreement to the effect that they intend to pay no less than 10 percent, and no more than 30 percent, of the child support payable for the child in that year, by way of such payments; • no parent of the child making the payments should have any child support debt (including penalties) outstanding; and • the Commissioner is satisfied, on the basis of information available, that each of the payments to be recognised is a payment for the child’s direct benefit made in that year. Background Currently, payments made by a paying parent for the benefit of their children are not credited against the parent’s child support liability. Introducing the ability to do so may provide a greater incentive to pay child support, as a paying parent may be more 16 comfortable that the payment (or at least part of it) is directly benefiting the child according to the paying parent’s desires for the child’s upbringing. 17 A NEW ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW GROUND TO RECOGNISE RE- ESTABLISHMENT COSTS FOLLOWING A SEPARATION, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (Clause 26) Summary of proposed amendment The bill contains provision for a parent to seek an administrative review of a child support assessment to take account of re-establishment costs that were paid out of income that was earned in accordance with a pattern that was established after the parents first separated. Any excluded income in respect of these re-establishment costs should be no more than 30 percent of adjusted taxable income. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Clause 26 introduces new section 105(2)(d) that sets out a new administrative review ground. The new ground is that, at any time within three years starting on the date on which the child’s parents ceased to live together in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, the assessed amount of child support results in an unjust and inequitable financial result because of re-establishment costs incurred by the parent. New section 105(7) sets out specifically when this ground can be used. Under new section 105(7) this ground will be satisfied if the adjusted taxable income of a parent of the child for the child support year concerned includes a proportion that is: • no more than 30 percent of that income; • income from work done by that parent additional to work that he or she did before the child’s parents ceased to live together in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship; • used, or needs to be used, in whole or in part, by a parent of the child in that child support year to meet actual and reasonable costs incurred to re-establish himself or herself, and any child or other person that he or she has a duty to maintain, after the child’s parents ceased to live together in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. New section 105(8) relates to computing the three-year period in which the child’s parents ceased to live together in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. It permits the exclusion of a period of resumed cohabitation with the sole or main motive of reconciliation if the period does not exceed, or the periods in aggregate do not exceed, three months. 18 Background A paying or receiving parent may take on additional employment or overtime to help re-establish themselves after a separation – for example, to buy an alternative family home. Currently, income from secondary employment and overtime is automatically included in a child support formula calculation. Trying to incorporate recognition of all re-establishment costs into the child support formula would not be appropriate. Instead, the bill proposes that re-establishment costs, for a period of up to three years after a relationship separation, become a ground for administrative review. 19 REDUCTION IN THE QUALIFYING AGE OF CHILDREN UNDER THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME (Clause 8) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes reducing the upper age of qualifying children under the child support scheme from under 19 years of age to under 18 years of age, unless the child is still in full time secondary education. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Clause 8 amends current section 5, which identifies which children are qualifying children for whom child support under a formula assessment may be payable. Currently, children under the age of 19 (and who meet the other elements of the definition) are qualifying children. This change reduces the relevant age to children under the age of 18 so long as they meet the other requirements. Children who are aged 18 can still be qualifying children, but only if they are still enrolled at a registered school. Background Currently, child support is normally payable until a child reaches the age of 19 years (so long as the child also meets the other elements of the definition). However, many children start higher education before this age and so have access to the student loan and student allowance schemes, or are otherwise able to work or claim a benefit in their own right. The bill therefore proposes that the qualifying age be changed so that child support payments automatically end when the child reaches 18, unless the child is still in full- time secondary education. In that case, the child would cease to be a qualifying child when they left school. 20 COMPULSORY DEDUCTIONS OF CHILD SUPPORT FROM THE EMPLOYMENT INCOME OF PAYING PARENTS (Clause 27) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes making it compulsory for child support payments to be automatically deducted from the employment income of paying parents. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Clause 27 introduces new section 129 which makes it compulsory for child support payments to be automatically deducted from the income of a paying parent who falls into one or more of the following categories (regardless of when the person’s liability to pay financial support arises, or whether the person has defaulted in a payment or payments of financial support): • a PAYE or ACC income recipient; • a person who is in receipt of a specified social security benefit; and • a person who is in receipt of a basic grant or an independent circumstances grant under the Student Allowances Regulations 1998. Background Receiving parents may be adversely affected by the non-payment of child support by paying parents, or alternatively be concerned about the potential instability of future payments. Currently, child support payments can only be deducted from the employment income of paying parents when those parents have defaulted on their child support payments. Making it compulsory for all child support payments to be automatically deducted from the employment income of paying parents will help to ensure that as many payments as possible are made, and made on time, by giving more certainty to receiving parents. Paying parents will have their payments automatically co-ordinated with their pay periods, whether those periods are weekly, fortnightly or monthly. It is recognised that some paying parents will have concerns about their employers knowing that they are making child support contributions. However, the public interest in operating an effective child support scheme should outweigh these individual concerns. 21 REDUCTION IN CHILD SUPPORT PENALTY RATES (Clause 28) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes replacing the current 10 percent initial penalty for late payment with a two-stage initial penalty where the current full 10 percent is only fully charged if the debt remains unpaid after 7 days. The bill also proposes that the incremental monthly penalty be reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent after a year of non-compliance, which is expected to be complemented with more intensive case management from Inland Revenue. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Clause 28 replaces current section 134 with new sections 134, 134A, 134B and 134C. New section 134 re-enacts section 134, for penalties imposed on or after 1 April 2014, with two changes. One change is that the initial late payment penalty, which is currently the greater of 10 percent of the unpaid financial support or $5, is replaced with: • an initial late payment penalty, at the expiry of the due date, of the greater of 2 percent of the unpaid financial support and $5; and • an additional initial late payment penalty, at the expiry of the seventh day after the due date, of 8 percent of so much of the sum of the unpaid financial support as remains unpaid at that expiry. The other change in new section 134 is to the current 2 percent incremental monthly penalty. The bill proposes that these incremental penalties are adjusted so that, after 12 of those monthly penalties, the monthly penalty rate is reduced from 2 percent to 1 percent, which is expected to be complemented with more intensive case management from Inland Revenue. Background Penalties play an important role in encouraging parents to meet their child support obligations. If they are excessive, however, they can discourage the payment of child support to the detriment of the children concerned. In respect of the initial penalty, a 10 percent rate for any late payment may be seen as excessive if the payment was late only because of an oversight. Introducing a two- 22 stage initial penalty whereby a paying parent is only charged 2 percent if the payment is not made on time, with the remaining 8 percent only being charged if the amount remains unpaid after 7 days, will give the paying parent a week to make any payments inadvertently not made. This may encourage earlier payment and decrease the level of unpaid debt owing by the paying parent. This approach also better mirrors the two- stage treatment adopted for the initial late payment of tax debts. The cumulative nature of the 2 percent incremental penalty means that penalty amounts can grow rapidly, often vastly outstripping the original debt. At some point, parents who would otherwise be willing to pay off their assessed liability may become reluctant to approach Inland Revenue to do so, the high penalty levels acting as a disincentive to compliance. Reducing the incremental penalty from 2 percent to 1 percent will help prevent the current rapid rate of escalation for penalty debt, and will help stop debt reaching levels that paying parents feel are disproportionate to the original debt. Other offsetting enforcement measures, such as intensive case management from Inland Revenue, are expected to be implemented if payments are still not made. 23 WRITING OFF CHILD SUPPORT PENALTIES AND DEBT (Clauses 29 to 42) Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes changing the circumstances in which child support penalties can be written-off. These circumstances include when a paying parent enters into a payment arrangement or cases of serious hardship, when debt recovery is a demonstrably inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources, or when only a low level of penalty debt is outstanding. The bill also proposes that Inland Revenue should also be able to write off assessed debt owed to the Crown, in relation to a receiving carer who is on a benefit, on serious hardship grounds. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2014. Key features Clause 32 inserts a new section 135FA. New section 135FA gives the Commissioner a discretion to give write off, in whole or in part, incremental penalties of a liable person that were unpaid when a payment agreement is entered into on or after 1 April 2014. The discretion is exercisable if the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of those incremental penalties would do either or both of the following: • place the liable person in serious hardship (as defined in section 135G(3)); • involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. Clause 33 amends section 135G, which enables the Commissioner, if specified preconditions are met, to grant relief to a liable person from the payment of incremental penalties. The change relaxes the precondition that requires the liable person to have paid all of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties to which the incremental penalties relate. It is proposed that relief may be granted under section 135G even if the liable person has paid only some, and not all, of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties to which the incremental penalties relate. Clause 34 inserts a new section 135GA, which enables the Commissioner to grant discretionary relief for low-level residual penalty-only debt (initial late payment penalties or incremental penalties or both) if: • the liable person has paid all of the liable person’s financial support debt; and • the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of those penalties would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. 24 Clause 35 repeals section 135H and substitutes new sections 135GB and 135H. New section 135GB requires the Commissioner to write off an initial late payment penalty if a payment arrangement is entered into or made on or after 1 April 2014. The Commissioner’s duty under new section 135GB to write off the initial payment penalty is not subject to a precondition that the Commissioner be satisfied that the arrangement has been fully complied with. Clauses 38 and 39 amend sections 135M and 135N on the availability of relief from ongoing incremental penalties if a payment arrangement or deduction notice is in force. They remove the precondition that every instalment is paid in full in accordance with the payment arrangement. That precondition currently prevents ongoing incremental penalties from being written off if any sum or instalment payable under the agreement is not paid in full in accordance with the agreement. The proposed changes, by contrast, require an incremental penalty imposed at the expiry of a one month period to be written off if a payment agreement or deduction notice is in force, and has been complied with fully, during that period. Clause 42 inserts a new section 180A, which enables the Commissioner to write off some or all of the benefit component of an amount of child support that is payable by the liable person to the Crown, and that is unpaid and in arrears, if: • the receiving carer is or was a social security beneficiary (as defined in section 2(1)) at the time the child support is or was payable; and • the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of that amount would place the liable person in serious hardship (as defined in section 135G(3)). The benefit component of the amount of child support, as defined in new section 180A(2), means so much of that amount as is not payable to the receiving carer under section 142(1)(g). Background Although the primary objective of any changes to the penalty rules should be to recover progressively any existing assessed debt and re-establish the regular payment of child support liabilities, writing off penalties in certain circumstances may help facilitate regular payment or, alternatively, be justifiable on hardship grounds. A wider range of options to write off penalties is proposed for circumstances in which payment would result in the paying parent being placed in significant hardship or it would be a demonstrably inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources to collect the debt because the chances of collection are very low. Likewise, the starting position for writing off penalties should recognise that a paying parent who comes to Inland Revenue to arrange the payment of a debt is trying to comply. Therefore, if an agreed amount is to be written off, it ought to be able to be written off at the start of an instalment arrangement rather than after a significant period of positive compliance, as is currently the case. If the paying parent defaults again, new late payment penalties should be applied. 25 Allowing Inland Revenue to write off low levels of penalty-only debt would allow Inland Revenue, once all assessed child support debt has been paid, to write off all penalty-only debt where recovery of those penalties would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. Inland Revenue cannot currently write off assessed debt because, in many cases, the debt is owed to the receiving parent for the care of the child. When a receiving parent is not on a sole-parent benefit, however, that parent can instruct Inland Revenue to waive the assessed debt. Inland Revenue does not have an equivalent discretion to waive assessed debt owed to and retained by the Crown when a receiving parent receives a sole-parent benefit. The courts can order a debt to be written off, but this is costly and time-consuming. Allowing assessed debt relating to beneficiaries to be written off by Inland Revenue on serious hardship grounds would avoid the need to take this course of action. 26 27 CONSEQUENTIAL MATTERS 28 29 CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13–22, 24, 25 and schedule 2) Summary of proposed amendments The bill also makes a number of consequential amendments to other parts of the Child Support Act 1991 so that it is consistent with the policy changes noted above. The main consequential amendments are: • Clause 5 amends section 2, which is the definition section. Many terms currently used in relation to the formula assessment of child support will no longer be used. These terms include eligible custodian, principal provider of ongoing care, shared custody child, and substantially equal sharing of ongoing daily care. The definitions of these terms are therefore repealed. Some new terms will be used in the new formula assessment scheme and are included in the definition section. These include the following: – care cost percentage (which relates to the costs associated with the proportion of ongoing daily care that a person provides to a qualifying child); – care order or agreement (which is a parenting order or other agreement concerning the proportion of care provided to a child); – carer (which refers to a parent or non-parent who provides ongoing daily care to a child, other than on a commercial basis); – income percentage (which is a parent’s proportion of the combined child support income amounts of all parents of a child); – receiving carer (which refers to a carer in respect of whom child support payments are payable). • Clause 6 amends section 4, which sets out the Act’s objects. The bill does not substantively change the Act’s objects as currently described, but adapts them to reflect the new formula assessment scheme implemented by the bill. • Clause 7 inserts a new section 4A. This gives an overview of child support liabilities under a formula assessment, and is by way of explanation only – it has no direct legal effect. • Clause 10 substitutes a new section 25. This maintains the current approach to the ending of liability to pay child support, but updates the section for consistency with the new formula assessment. • Clause 12 amends section 41, which currently sets out the effect of a liable parent electing, under section 40, to estimate his or her income as lower than it would otherwise be determined to be. Under the new formula assessment, this election will be available to any parent whose income is assessed for formula- assessment purposes. • Clause 13 amends section 72. This section sets out the minimum rates of child support and domestic maintenance payable by a liable person. The amendment updates the section for consistency with the new formula assessment scheme, 30 and resets the starting figure on which minimum payments for child assessment under a formula assessment are set. • Clause 14 substitutes new section 82. Section 82 currently obliges liable parents under a formula assessment to advise the Commissioner of certain changes affecting their living circumstances. The section is amended to extend the obligation to all parents, and to non-parent carers regarding changes affecting their care cost percentage. It adjusts the wording to reflect the new living allowance, dependent child allowance, and multi-group allowance. • Clause 15 substitutes new sections 88, 88A, and 89. These sections set out the minimum specific information that must be included in notices of assessment sent by the Commissioner to parents and carers. • Clause 16 amends section 90, which identifies the appealable decisions of the Commissioner that any person affected by the decision may object to. • Clause 17 amends section 91, which sets out the child support and other assessments against which objections may be made. • Clause 18 amends section 92, which sets out requirements relating to objections. • Clause 19 amends section 96Q by identifying the parties to proceedings under Commissioner-initiated administrative reviews as being the parent who is the subject of the review (the subject parent) and any receiving carer who elects, under section 96Y, to become a party. • Clause 20 repeals sections 100 and 101 on the basis that all appeals relating to objections against an assessment can be made on the more open-ended basis provided for in sections 102 and 103. • Clause 21 amends section 106(1), which identifies the orders that a court may make following an application under section 104 seeking a departure from the provisions of the Act relating to a formula assessment. • Clause 22 inserts a new section 152B. It replicates the effect of section 34, which is to allow the Commissioner to offset payments of child support under a formula assessment to one parent from any payments payable by the other parent. • Clause 24 further amends the Child Support Act 1991 as set out in schedule 2. This provides for some further consequential amendments of a more mechanical nature. • Clause 25 consequentially amends section 16(6) of the Adoption Act 1955.
Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill Commentary on the Bill Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue First published in September 2011 by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill; Commentary on the Bill ISBN 978-0-478-27196-6 CONTENTS POLICY CHANGES 1 Overview 3 Exclude losses from the calculation of net income for student loan repayment purposes 4 Alternative contact person 5 Repayment holiday 7 Extending pay-period assessments to the salaries and wages of all borrowers 9 REMEDIAL MATTERS 11 Consequential amendments 13 1 POLICY CHANGES 2 3 OVERVIEW With approximately 621,000 borrowers with a loan balance with Inland Revenue for collection, and a total nominal loan balance of approximately $12.07 billion, the student loan scheme is a significant Crown asset and a major financial commitment by Government towards supporting those in tertiary education. 1 As such, it is important that the scheme is managed as efficiently as possible and that borrowers comply with their repayment obligations upon completion of their studies. The student loan package announced in Budget 2011 focused on improving the value and fairness of the student loan scheme and encouraging personal responsibility for loan repayments. The changes proposed in this bill bring into effect those decisions. The bill provides for Inland Revenue to receive details of a borrower’s contact person from the loan manager (StudyLink). Every new loan application must include a contact person as a condition of accessing a student loan. When a borrower is in default and cannot be contacted, Inland Revenue will be able to talk to the contact person to try and locate the borrower. In the interests of fairness across the student loan scheme, and to maximise repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers, the bill makes amendments to exclude losses from the calculation of “net income”. The ability to offset losses against net income can reduce their liability for student loan repayment purposes. As a consequence of this policy, the bill also includes amendments to extend the pay- period assessment policy to all salary and wage earnings. Finally, the bill makes a number of amendments to the “repayment holiday” rules to improve repayments from overseas-based borrowers. Under the changes proposed, the repayment “holiday” whereby borrowers can take a break from their repayment obligations while they are overseas will be reduced from three years to one year. Borrowers will also have to apply for a repayment holiday, up to six months from their date of departure from New Zealand, and specify a New Zealand-based contact person. 1 As at 30 June 2011. 4 EXCLUDE LOSSES FROM THE CALCULATION OF NET INCOME FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PURPOSES (Clauses 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 26, 27, 30 and 31) Summary of proposed amendments The bill contains amendments to exclude investment and business losses such as rental losses from the calculation of net income for student loan repayment purposes. The change was signalled in Budget 2011 and is intended to increase personal responsibility for debt repayment, maximise repayments from New Zealand-based borrowers and ensure fairness across the student loan scheme. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features When a borrower has one or more business or investment activities, the income and expenditure from an activity which results in a net loss should be ignored when calculating the net amount earned from both “other income” (business income) and pre- taxed income (for example, interest and dividends). A borrower’s repayment obligation is currently based on net income. Clause 14 replaces the definition of “net income” with a new definition of “adjusted net income”. The definition alters the concept of net income to recognise that a net loss from one activity can no longer be offset against income from another activity in order to reduce a borrower’s repayment obligation. Clause 15 then ensures the adjusted net income figure is used in the formula for calculating a borrower’s other income repayment obligation. Clause 13 ensures that losses are excluded from the calculation of “net pre-taxed income”. Excluding losses from the calculation of net income will mean that some borrowers will have an increased repayment obligation. Background The current definition of “income” for student loan repayment purposes is based on a “net income” approach. In calculating net income, a borrower may subtract annual total deductions (expenses and losses) from annual gross income. The calculation allows for example, a net loss generated from a rental property to be offset against income from other activities, effectively reducing a borrower’s repayment obligation. 5 ALTERNATIVE CONTACT PERSON (Clauses 7, 29, 33 and 35) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments allow alternate contact details provided to the loan manager (StudyLink) as a condition of accessing a student loan to be received and used by Inland Revenue once the loan is transferred. Application date The amendments apply from 1 January 2013. Key features Clause 7 allows Inland Revenue to receive details of a borrower’s contact person from the loan manager. The loan manager is appointed by the “lender” (the Government) under the Student Loan Scheme Act to establish and administer loan balances that have not been transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. When a borrower is in default, Inland Revenue will try and contact the borrower. If this is unsuccessful, Inland Revenue will approach the contact person. Clause 29 provides for Inland Revenue to request the assistance of the contact person when the borrower is in default and cannot be located. The contact person must be willing to act in that capacity. The proposed amendment specifies that Inland Revenue may request the contact person provide the borrower’s current address details, or ask the borrower to notify Inland Revenue of their details. The contact person will only be contacted for the purpose of providing any up-to-date contact details for the borrower. No details of the loan such as the loan balance or the amount of the default will be given to the contact person. Inland Revenue will not use the contact details to follow up on the contact person’s tax obligations. Background While borrowers are required to keep their contact details current, often these become out of date after they complete study. This can be a particular problem if the borrower goes overseas. 6 Having a contact person provides another way for Inland Revenue to locate borrowers who have lost touch to help them manage their loan. The contact details requirement is distinct from the “nominated person” process. Borrowers may nominate a person to act on their behalf while they are overseas. The nominated person can act on behalf of the borrower and can make enquiries, receive statements and correspondence. 7 REPAYMENT HOLIDAY (Clauses 17, 18, 19, 20, 29, 31 and 33) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments reduce the repayment holiday for overseas-based borrowers from three years to one, and require borrowers to apply for a repayment holiday. Borrowers must apply before the expiry of six months from the date of departure and as part of the application process, borrowers must supply details of a contact person who resides in New Zealand. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features Clause 17 makes two significant changes to the repayment holiday provisions. First, the repayment holiday entitlement will be reduced from three years to one year. Secondly, borrowers who intend to go overseas from 1 April 2012 will have to apply to Inland Revenue if they want to enjoy a repayment holiday. To be considered, an application must be received before the borrower becomes overseas-based, typically six months after the date of departure. Applications will be successful only if the borrower supplies a contact person or confirms a contact person that has previously been supplied. The contact person must reside in New Zealand. Clause 29 provides for Inland Revenue to request the assistance of the contact person when the borrower is in default and cannot be located. The contact person must be willing to act in that capacity. The proposed amendment specifies that Inland Revenue may request the contact person to provide the borrower’s current address details, or ask the borrower to notify Inland Revenue of their details. The contact person will only be contacted for the purpose of providing any up-to-date contact details for the borrower. No details of the loan such as the loan balance or the amount of the default will be provided to the contact person. Inland Revenue will not use the contact details to follow up on the contact person’s tax obligations. Borrowers who have used some of their entitlement before 1 April 2012, whether they are currently on a repayment holiday or not, will have their entitlement set to the lesser of one year or their remaining entitlement. 8 Background Since 2007, borrowers have received an automatic three-year holiday from any repayment obligation when they leave New Zealand. The current three-year holiday is generous and can result in borrowers not resuming repayments when the repayment holiday comes to an end. This policy change seeks to improve repayments from overseas-based borrowers. The application process, combined with the requirement to supply a New Zealand-based contact person, signals to borrowers the importance of repaying the student loan when the repayment holiday comes to an end. 9 EXTENDING PAY-PERIOD ASSESSMENTS TO THE SALARIES AND WAGES OF ALL BORROWERS (Clauses 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 21, 22, 23 and 24) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments extend pay-period assessments to the salaries and wages of all borrowers. Borrowers with “other income”, such as rental or business income, will have their salary and wage earnings shift from an annual assessment basis, where the income is spread across a tax year, to pay-period assessments, where the focus is on ensuring correct repayment deductions are made at source. To achieve this, the bill contains amendments to exclude salary and wage income from the calculation of annual student loan repayment obligations for borrowers with “other income”. The amendments will also ensure that repayment deductions are correct in special circumstances such as secondary employment or full-time study. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 April 2012. Key features The bill extends pay-period assessments to all salary and wage earnings. Borrowers with other sources of income will still receive an annual assessment of any income that is not salary or wages. Clause 15 changes the way that repayment obligations are calculated for borrowers with other income so that salary and wage earnings are excluded. Clause 8 gives borrowers with “other income” access to the procedure by which an unused repayment threshold from a borrower's primary employment earnings can be allocated to the borrower's secondary employment earnings. Clause 11 gives borrowers with other income access to the process under which certain borrowers who are full-time students may obtain an exemption from salary or wage deductions. Clause 5 extends the definition of “significant over-deduction” to include borrowers with other income. In the event that a significant over-deduction is identified, Inland Revenue is required to notify the borrower, and the borrower may choose to receive a refund of the over-deduction. 10 Background Pay-period assessments were introduced in the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and are a significant simplification measure, removing the need for the annual square-up assessment for most borrowers’ salary and wage earnings. As part of the Budget 2011 student loan package, it was announced that losses from investments or business activities would no longer be included when calculating a borrower’s repayment obligation. As there is no longer the ability to offset losses, there is no need to distinguish between borrowers who receive other income and borrowers who do not. Pay-period assessments can now be extended to all salary and wage earnings. 11 REMEDIAL MATTERS 12 13 CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses 6, 12, 25, 28, 32 and 34) Summary of proposed amendments The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. These amendments relate to: • Ensuring that where relief from late payment interest is provided, any amounts already paid are offset against any unpaid amount before being available for refund. • The description of the objection process and the timeframe for objections that is required to be included in the contract provided to borrowers. • Minor technical changes to the provision dealing with the imposition of the administration fee to ensure that borrowers are charged an administration fee if they have a loan balance or student loan debt of $20 or more. • A minor error in a date whereby instead of excluding refunds of overpayments made before 1 April 2006 as intended, the amendment incorrectly referred to overpayments before 31 March 2006. • The application date of sections 170A and 173A of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, which should apply from 1 March 2012 instead of 1 April 2012. • Ensuring that a significant over-deduction can be offset against a significant under-deduction before being refunded to the borrower. If a borrower had too much deducted in one period and not enough in another, the over-deduction could be used to satisfy the under deduction.

To achieve this, GST applies to a broad range of goods and services at a uniform rate of 15%. 1.2 The intention of this broad-based approach is to: • reduce the extent to which GST alters consumption decisions in New Zealand by lowering the impact on the relative prices that consumers pay for their goods and services; • reduce the extent to which GST distorts production and resource-use decisions in New Zealand. The approach lessens the extent to which GST alters the competitive position of a New Zealand business in both the market for the goods and services it produces, and the market for the inputs it uses to produce those goods and services, by minimising the impact on relative prices in those markets; and • reduce the compliance and administrative costs associated with raising GST revenue. 1.3 Key to achieving these objectives is the taxation of the final consumer only − not the inputs and products in between. GST in effect applies only once, through offsetting input credits against taxable outputs. Business-to-business (B2B) supplies are, therefore, in effect, GST-neutral. This avoids taxation cascades, which can result when sales taxes are applied at various stages in the production process. 1.4 Because GST applies to consumption in New Zealand, it taxes both consumption by New Zealanders and non-residents who are consuming goods or services in New Zealand. GST is not, however, intended to apply to non- residents consuming goods and services outside New Zealand. 1.5 The GST system prevents the double taxation of goods and services that are traded between New Zealand and other countries through the “destination principle”, which assigns the rights to tax the consumption of traded goods and services to the country in which those goods and services are destined to be consumed. This means that exports are zero-rated and imports are subject to GST, in the same way as domestically produced goods and services that are consumed in New Zealand. 2 The problem 1.6 An exception to the zero-rating of exports applies in practice to goods purchased in New Zealand by tourists. While there are schemes in place that enable removal of the tax impost in limited circumstances, tourists who take goods outside of New Zealand do not receive GST refunds as a matter of course. This is because the economic costs of doing so (mainly compliance and administration costs) outweigh the economic benefits. Tourists’ purchasing behaviour has been assessed as unlikely to be altered by whether there is a general refund scheme or not. 1.7 While this may be so for tourists, there may be behavioural effects for non- resident businesses that operate in New Zealand. The destination model generally works well in relation to goods, because they physically pass through customs control and are relatively easy to identify. However, cross-border supplies of services are difficult to monitor because of their intangible nature. Countries generally aim to ensure that B2B transactions are untaxed in these circumstances, in line with the destination principle. 1.8 New Zealand zero-rates some cross-border services and has a registration mechanism which refunds GST incurred by non-resident businesses in many instances. Nevertheless, it is essential that our domestic GST laws relating to services received by non-residents are fair and efficient, and do not impose undue economic costs on New Zealand. We refer to this objective as B2B neutrality. 1.9 Such economic costs could arise if non-resident businesses are deterred from undertaking business with New Zealand because of the lack of GST neutrality in certain areas. Alternatively, New Zealand businesses could face additional constraints when undertaking business overseas because overseas jurisdictions perceive our rules in this area to be unfair. Aims of this discussion document 1.10 This discussion document focuses on the desirability of cross-border B2B neutrality in our GST system and related matters. It discusses the current registration process for providing refunds of GST incurred by non-resident businesses and considers various options for enhancing or replacing the current approach – while being mindful of the need to balance neutrality and protect the tax base. 1.11 The current prohibition on refunds of GST input tax in relation to exempt supplies (such as financial services provided to non-businesses) would continue. This prohibition is a general feature of the GST rules and therefore applies to non-resident businesses too. 3 1.12 The following chapters are focussed solely on B2B supplies because of the behavioural effect that excessive taxation may have in that sector. This document does not seek to address issues that have been raised in the public domain regarding cross-border supplies between businesses and consumers, specifically: • the desirability or otherwise of a refund scheme for tourists on goods they take with them when they leave the country; and • the $60 minimum duty threshold on goods imported into New Zealand (meaning that a consignment of goods of up to NZ$400 value can generally be imported without GST being imposed). A review of this minimum level was recently conducted by New Zealand Customs Service. 1 1.13 All legislative provisions in this document and references to “the Act” are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise stated. Summary of proposals • That an enhanced registration system be introduced. This would retain the existing broad ability for non-resident businesses to register for GST, but would couple this with rules allowing non-resident businesses to claim input tax in a broader range of circumstances by removing the requirement for the business to be making taxable supplies. This system is considered preferable to either an expanded zero-rating system or a direct refund model. Both of these alternative approaches are discussed in chapter 3. • That other measures be considered to provide certainty for taxpayers and to protect the revenue base under the enhanced registration system. Some key features include that the non-resident be registered for GST or VAT (or, if not, be a registered business taxpayer) in their home jurisdiction, that there be a minimum refund threshold and that accounting for GST be on a payments or hybrid basis (chapter 4). • That supplies to non-residents of tools used solely in relation to exported products be either subject to GST (which would be deductible under the enhanced registration system) or zero-rated (chapter 5).

However, the method for ensuring that double taxation is avoided differs for income tax and GST purposes. 2.2 Income tax operates on the basis that countries will cast a wide net – taxing on the basis of both source and residence – and then surrendering taxing rights or providing a credit for foreign tax paid through the double tax agreement (DTA) network. 2.3 If GST operated on a similar basis, it would in theory require output tax to be collected on both imports and exports, with the surrender of some export taxing rights and provision for foreign output tax to be claimed as input tax through treaty agreements. However, other than for exchange- of-information purposes in some cases, DTAs do not generally cover GST. The OECD’s guidance on consumption tax thus far has instead focussed on an internationally recognised system for allocating taxing rights across jurisdictions. 2 2.4 As discussed in Chapter 1, GST works on the destination principle of taxation. If this principle were to be applied strictly, it would only look at the location of the relevant contractual parties. This means that goods and services provided by a New Zealand business to an Australian customer would always be zero-rated, irrespective of where the service was actually received. Under such a strict approach, GST would never be a burden on business and B2B neutrality would be achieved. Businesses would only pay GST (or its equivalent) in their own jurisdiction, irrespective of where the goods and services were received or where the supplier was physically located. 2.5 The destination principle works well for imported and exported goods, because items physically pass through Customs’ control and are relatively easy to identify. However, cross-border supplies of services are more difficult to monitor because of their intangible nature; it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly when and where a service is consumed or even when it crosses a border and, therefore, which country has the taxing right. 2 See OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs, Working Party N°9 on Consumption Taxes: OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines, Draft Guidelines on Neutrality, December 2010. 6 2.6 GST laws for both goods and services received by non-residents must ensure that non-residents are treated on an equivalent basis to resident businesses or consumers, taking into account any significant risks to the tax base. For the reasons given, this document assumes that the supplies that cause the most difficulties from a B2B neutrality perspective will be supplies of services. Problems with current system 2.7 A traditionally problematic area in applying GST to cross-border transactions has been when the contractual recipient is a non-resident, but the physical receipt of the services takes place in New Zealand. 2.8 Under the destination principle, the standard method for ensuring that no tax is collected in the originating jurisdiction is to zero-rate the supply. Zero-rating does not impose output tax on the supply, while ensuring that the domestic supplier can claim back the input tax they incurred in making the supply. To do otherwise would be to effectively penalise exporters by either increasing the cost of their exported products or forcing them to absorb a tax cost not imposed on domestic suppliers. 2.9 In determining the location of the recipient, New Zealand has, since the Wilson & Horton decision, looked to the location of the contractual recipient. 3 The Wilson & Horton decision created problems for the New Zealand tax base because in some cases, contractual relationships may not reflect the fact that consumption takes place in New Zealand. In areas such as the tourism and education sectors in particular, the potential arose to create contractual relationships with non-residents before they arrived in New Zealand, so that goods and services consumed in New Zealand could be zero-rated. 2.10 To deal with this situation, section 11A(2) of the GST Act was enacted to ensure that services received in New Zealand attract GST at the standard rate. Section 11A(2) is seen as an essential base maintenance provision. However, it is recognised that its role needs to be further considered in the context of supplies received by non-resident businesses in New Zealand. 2.11 Section 11A(2) results in a broad range of services (other than exempt services) received in New Zealand being standard-rated. If the non- resident business is not making “taxable supplies” in New Zealand, this GST cannot be claimed as input tax. 3 Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1996\] 1 NZLR 26; (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325; (1995) 20 TRNZ 111. 7 2.12 The result is that New Zealand GST forms an irrecoverable cost to the non-resident business. Although an irrecoverable tax cost is not a problem if it is applied universally, it can create distortionary effects when it represents a real economic cost to a non-resident business and a resident business incurring the same cost would be able to claim the amount as an input tax deduction. In these circumstances, the cost of consuming services in New Zealand is higher for a non-resident solely on the basis of the GST treatment. All things being equal, this may have the effect of deterring a non-resident from consuming services in New Zealand altogether or limiting the market share that New Zealand businesses can realistically compete for. 2.13 An example of how section 11A(2) might apply is in the aviation training industry. A non-resident airline may contract with a New Zealand- resident training institute to instruct trainee pilots in certain skills. The pilot is, upon graduation, bonded to the relevant airline for a number of years. The trainee receives the services in New Zealand, so output tax is charged, even though the beneficiary of the training may be the non- resident airline – which acquires a fully qualified pilot for a considerable length of time. If the airline was carrying out a taxable activity in New Zealand, the GST incurred is likely to be available as an input tax credit. 2.14 The disparity between resident and non-resident businesses can to some extent be resolved if the non-resident business registers for New Zealand GST purposes. Currently, New Zealand allows any person that carries on a taxable activity to register for GST. As a “taxable activity” is not geographically confined, this means that any non-resident business can theoretically register for GST. 2.15 However, a person can only claim input tax as a deduction if they use the goods or services acquired for making “taxable supplies”. The concept of “taxable supplies” is geographically limited to supplies of goods or services in New Zealand. In order to claim a deduction for input tax, a non-resident business must therefore use the goods and services acquired for the purpose of making supplies in New Zealand. This limits somewhat the use of registration as a means for non-residents to obtain neutrality. 2.16 Section 20(3C) of the GST Act also ensures that input tax is only available “to the extent” that the relevant goods and services are used for making taxable supplies. This rule restricts the ability of a non-resident to make token supplies in New Zealand and claim all input tax incurred as a deduction, because it is difficult to argue that all goods and services acquired in New Zealand are done so for the purpose of generating a very limited amount of taxable supplies. 2.17 In addition, under sections 52(5), (5A) and (7), the Commissioner has reasonably broad powers to (retrospectively in some instances) deregister a person that is not carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand. These sections may act as a disincentive for non-resident businesses to register in the first place. 8 2.18 In determining what supplies are to final consumers and what supplies are to businesses, there are fine margins at play, even in our aviation training example. Pilot training is broadly “education”, and most international students that come to New Zealand do so for their personal betterment. There is no sound policy reason for services consumed in New Zealand that have a private benefit to be outside the scope of GST, even when the recipient is a non-resident. 2.19 If a change is to be made, the challenge is to strike the right balance between addressing some lack of neutrality between resident and non- resident businesses and ensuring that GST is not easily avoided in New Zealand. This would be achieved by setting an appropriate business and consumer boundary. 2.20 There is a counter argument which says that the cost of GST is not always fully borne by a non-resident business. This would arise when the tax is not recoverable but is nevertheless incurred as a business expense. In these circumstances, the non-resident is likely to receive an income tax deduction for the New Zealand tax cost in their own country. The remainder of the tax burden may also be recovered by the non-resident business through the pricing of its products to its own consumers. We have therefore considered how important an issue GST is for a non- resident business, when these issues and other pricing factors such as exchange rate fluctuations are taken into account. 2.21 While difficult to measure, it is reasonable to assume that businesses would perceive the GST cost to be a significant factor when comparing New Zealand's GST treatment with that of other jurisdictions in which they may alternatively consume services. The following chapters therefore proceed on this assumption. Conclusion 2.22 We consider that, if a solution that is workable for both government and taxpayers can be found, it may increase the attractiveness of New Zealand for non-resident businesses that consume services away from their main place of operation. This may result in a greater number of non-residents choosing to consume services in New Zealand, to the benefit of the New Zealand economy more generally. 9 CHAPTER 3 B2B options for New Zealand This chapter looks at three possible methods for achieving greater neutrality in the cross-border supply of goods and services between businesses: • zero-rating certain supplies; • relaxing the restrictions on non-resident businesses when claiming input tax; and • a refund system for non-resident businesses. The chapter concludes that the second option – relaxing the restrictions on non- resident businesses when claiming input tax deductions – may best achieve the twin aims of promoting B2B neutrality and providing adequate protection for the revenue base. 3.1 Chapters 1 and 2 established that GST is not designed to impose a real fiscal cost on businesses – be they resident or non-resident – other than in certain defined instances when businesses are treated as if they were final consumers. This chapter considers how B2B neutrality might best be achieved in practice. 3.2 Different countries adopt different models to create a neutral outcome for non- resident businesses, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. 3.3 While there are other approaches, the three most common ways of achieving B2B neutrality appear to be: • Zero-rating certain supplies; • extending a non-resident business’s ability to claim input tax credits, while retaining a broad ability to register for GST; and • allowing non-resident businesses to claim refunds for input tax incurred without the need to actively register for GST. 3.4 There is already some flexibility in our GST system to cater for non-resident businesses. For example, if a non-resident business were to incorporate a New Zealand subsidiary and register that subsidiary for GST, it is often possible for the subsidiary to acquire New Zealand goods and services and then export “finished” goods and services to its non-resident parent. This structure allows the subsidiary to claim input tax for the supplies received and to zero-rate the supply to the parent. The net position is that the subsidiary obtains a refund and neutrality across the group is achieved. The following options therefore need to be considered in light of the fact that an existing structure – albeit one that may come at a higher compliance cost – is available in many cases. 10 Zero-rating 3.5 Extending the current zero-rating rules could take two forms: either a broad- based system, under which all supplies to non-resident businesses can be zero- rated, or a more focussed system under which only those services of most concern from a neutrality perspective would be specifically zero-rated. 3.6 If more focussed rules were introduced, they would be likely to target specific industries – an approach that is largely unprecedented in the GST Act. The targeted industries would be those that appear to be “unfairly” required to charge GST on supplies to non-resident businesses. In this respect, the Government could, in zero-rating particular activities, be regarded as “picking winners”. 3.7 A broader approach that minimises these distortions across industries is therefore preferable, even though it is likely to give rise to a greater fiscal cost. 3.8 Strengths of zero-rating • Zero-rating is consistent with the destination model and with how the Act currently deals with goods and services that are exported. Having a system that aligns the treatment of all exports is simpler and more transparent. • Zero-rating is a mechanism that is familiar to New Zealand businesses. The familiarity of the system may arguably also reduce compliance costs to non- resident businesses. • Zero-rating would result in minimal administrative costs for Inland Revenue. The reporting requirements would fall on existing registered persons, so there would be no increase in the number of taxpayers registered for GST or otherwise filing with Inland Revenue. 3.9 Weaknesses of zero-rating • Under a broad-based system, zero-rating rules could fail to create the level of certainty anticipated. Although the policy may be clear, there will always be areas of contention from “borderline” activities. The fact that the scope of section 11A(2) itself has been litigated shows that rules designed to prevent confusion can themselves end up being disputed. • Any rules will also be vulnerable to shifts in behaviour in the types of supplies made. A definition of certain activities would be fixed in time and may not be adequately “future-proofed”. Such rules are more likely to require future amendments than general, principles-based legislation. • Irrespective of how the relevant rules are drafted, they may not alleviate the GST cost altogether. These “gaps” would result in GST being a cost to a non-resident business when the same GST charged to a resident business may be able to be deducted as input tax. 11 • Importantly, an expanded zero-rating system may push potentially large compliance costs onto New Zealand suppliers. The New Zealand-resident supplier may be required to identify each customer and determine the appropriate GST treatment on a transaction-by-transaction basis. For suppliers that do not deal exclusively with non-resident businesses, this could be extremely difficult to administer. A New Zealand service provider would have to establish not only that their client was a non-resident, but also that they were consuming the services purely for business purposes. • When a supply is zero-rated, the output tax that would have been chargeable on that supply is immediately “lost” from the GST system. This makes any mistakenly zero-rated supply difficult for Inland Revenue to identify and recover. The GST Act would make the supplier in such cases liable for output tax not charged on the relevant supply. This would increase costs for New Zealand suppliers, forcing them into rigorous checks to determine whether the supply should be zero-rated and being financially penalised if they get it wrong. Risk-averse suppliers may resort to standard-rating all supplies, thereby defeating the objective of any revised rules. Enhanced registration system 3.10 A variation on the current system that could promote B2B neutrality would be to retain the broad ability to register, but couple it with more generous rules around claiming input tax (“an enhanced registration system”). 3.11 This would be similar to the rules that operate in Australia where, generally speaking, a registered person is entitled to an input tax credit for GST incurred to the extent that the acquisition is made in the carrying on of an enterprise (“enterprise” being a broadly similar concept to “taxable activity”). 4 There is no requirement for the acquisition to relate to supplies made in Australia. Therefore, non-residents that acquire goods or services that attract Australian GST, but make few or no supplies in Australia, may often end their tax period in a net refund position, with the result that the net GST cost of their Australian activities is not an economic burden on the business. 3.12 Strengths of registration • An enhanced registration system has the potential to provide comprehensive B2B neutrality. A non-resident business would be able to claim input tax for expenses incurred in New Zealand to the extent that the supply is used for its worldwide taxable activities. 4 See A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999, Division 11. 12 • Non-residents would be operating under a similar system to residents, thereby enhancing the neutrality objective. If a non-resident business made no taxable supplies in New Zealand, they would be entitled to a refund of the relevant input tax. However, if the non-resident were to make some supplies in New Zealand, as a registered person, they would be required to account for output tax on those supplies. This means that a non-resident would not be able to obtain a competitive advantage by making supplies in New Zealand under the registration threshold (thereby not paying output tax yet still receiving neutral treatment for their inputs). • An enhanced registration system would be complementary to existing Inland Revenue systems, as a non-resident business would be required to complete and file GST returns in the same way as any other registered person. • An enhanced registration system would be similar to the system used in Australia. Having broadly similar rules could make it easier for Australian businesses to expand into New Zealand and for third-country businesses to operate in both jurisdictions. • The GST system already contains most of the registration and input tax deduction provisions necessary to make an enhanced registration system work. Even though introduction of such a system would result in more GST-registered persons, it would not require complex new legislation to be introduced. 3.13 Weaknesses of registration • In order to access input tax deductions, non-resident businesses would need to incur the compliance costs of registering for GST and filing periodic returns. These costs do not necessarily need to be large, particularly given developments in online registration and return filing. However, risk-averse non-residents may be unfamiliar with, and less trusting of the system and may consider it necessary to engage a New Zealand advisor to help with ongoing filing requirements. Asking non-residents to fully engage in the New Zealand GST system could be seen as a deterrent rather than just an administrative step towards eligibility for a refund. For example, businesses could be concerned that GST registration could give rise to New Zealand income tax issues. • Although Inland Revenue has systems for allowing non-residents to register, administration costs would nevertheless increase in line with the increased number of registered persons. • New Zealand’s current legislation has the basic mechanisms in place for non-resident businesses to register for GST, claim input tax and receive refunds. However, additional legislative safeguards to protect the tax base are likely to be necessary. 13 Direct refund system 3.14 A direct refund system would be largely similar to the way refunds are dealt with under the value added tax (VAT) system of the European Union (EU). GST and VAT systems are fundamentally similar. However, VAT has additional complexities. Whereas New Zealand’s GST system must differentiate between supplies made by and to non-residents and those by and to residents, VAT must deal with residents, EU member states and residents of other countries outside the EU. 3.15 An EU VAT directive requires member states to allow “third country” taxable persons a deduction for VAT incurred in connection with their taxable business activities. 5 This deduction generally takes the form of a direct refund if the person does not make taxable supplies within the relevant EU member state. 3.16 The refund system involves third-country taxable persons completing a separate application form seeking refunds for VAT incurred. The refund claim is usually made after the end of a defined period for expenditure incurred during that period. 3.17 Strengths of refund system • Like an enhanced registration system, a refund system has the potential to create full neutrality between resident and non-resident businesses. • A refund system is relatively easy to understand and is likely to be familiar to multi-national businesses, particularly those that incur GST or VAT costs in Europe. • A refund system can be accessed on the basis of the need of the individual business, thereby eliminating the requirement for upfront registration and ongoing compliance costs. • Following a European approach to administering a refund system may allow Inland Revenue to be more rigorous in processing refunds. This could be achieved by taking the refund system outside the requirement that refunds to registered persons be released within 15 days. Having longer for the review of refund applications could help prevent abuse of the system by giving Inland Revenue sufficient time to determine the legitimacy of claims submitted. 3.18 Weaknesses of refunds • A refund system could be more likely to give rise to fraudulent refund claims than a system that requires non-resident businesses to register as a pre- requisite to obtaining a refund. 5 Thirteenth Council Directive (86/560/EEC) of 17 November 1986 on the harmonization of the laws of the member states relating to turnover taxes − Arrangements for the refund of value-added tax to taxable persons not established in community territory. 14 • If a non-resident was making supplies under New Zealand’s current $60,000 registration threshold, the tax base could be eroded by giving refunds without the corresponding collection of output tax. (We note, however, that under the UK system, payment of a refund is contingent on there being no supplies made within the UK other than those subject to reverse-charge rules. This effectively requires businesses that make domestic supplies to register in order to obtain a refund.) • The administration costs of this option are likely to be high for Inland Revenue. New forms would be needed, and staff hired or retrained to ensure applications were processed and monitored appropriately and refunds issued in a timely manner. More significantly, a refund system may require new IT systems to be developed. • Such developments could be seen as being counter to Inland Revenue’s programme of streamlining customer interactions and IT systems. Conclusion 3.19 We consider that an enhanced registration system would provide the best balance between achieving B2B neutrality and protecting the revenue base. Although the refund model appears to have the advantage of accessibility and simplicity, it is also the option that would be likely to impose the highest administration costs on New Zealand and may be the most susceptible to abuse. A full zero-rating approach could give rise to substantial compliance costs for suppliers and would also be prone to greater legislative uncertainty. 3.20 An enhanced registration system is more neutral, in that it would bring non- residents into the New Zealand GST system to file returns and be subject to the same rules as a resident business. Inland Revenue would also have periodic returns from the non-resident, which would provide some assurance that any New Zealand GST obligations were being met on an ongoing basis. We do, however, recognise the importance of minimising business compliance costs under this approach. 15 CHAPTER 4 Enhanced registration system – design features This chapter discusses the mechanics of an enhanced registration system and outlines measures that could help to administer the system while protecting the tax base. Submissions are welcome on whether the measures proposed in this chapter would strike the right balance between keeping compliance costs for businesses at a reasonable level while providing adequate revenue protection. 4.1 Under section 51 of the GST Act, a person is liable to be registered for GST when their supplies in New Zealand from their taxable activity either exceed $60,000 over the last 11 months (plus the month in question), or are anticipated to exceed $60,000 in the following 11 months (plus the month in question). Once liable to be registered, a person must charge output tax on their taxable supplies and will be entitled to deduct input tax to the extent that the goods or services received are used for making taxable supplies. 4.2 A person whose supplies are lower than the $60,000 threshold may voluntarily register if they are carrying on a taxable activity. 6 This voluntary registration provision, in the first instance, allows non-resident businesses to register for GST on the basis that they carry on a taxable activity, although not necessarily in New Zealand. 4.3 However, as mentioned previously, there is little benefit to a non-resident from registering in New Zealand because the ability to claim input tax is linked to supplies the person makes in New Zealand. If a non-resident makes very few or no New Zealand supplies, their ability to claim input tax is either proportionately very low or non-existent. 4.4 A further disincentive for a non-resident to register is the cancellation of registration provisions. 7 If the Commissioner is satisfied that a registered person is not carrying on a taxable activity, the Commissioner may cancel that person’s registration. Crucially, for non-residents only, “taxable activity” for this purpose means a taxable activity carried on in New Zealand. 8 This means that, even if a non-resident registers in New Zealand, they operate under the possibility of their registration being cancelled if they cannot satisfy the Commissioner that they carry on their taxable activity here. 6 Section 51(3). 7 The deregistration provisions are contained in section 52. 8 Sections 52(5) and 52(7). 16 Outline of the proposed system Summary of the proposed system An enhanced registration system would: • retain the existing rights for a non-resident business to register; and • allow input tax to be linked to the person’s total taxable supplies, as if all the person’s supplies were made in New Zealand. Suggested legislative safeguards could include: • requiring the non-resident to be registered for the comparable tax in their “home” jurisdiction (or registered as a business taxpayer when no comparison exists); • the non-resident business falling within the requirements to be registered in New Zealand were its offshore activities conducted in New Zealand (that is, being of sufficient size to be over the registration threshold); • a minimum refund threshold of $500 in the first year of registration to cover administration costs; • the Commissioner having longer to process refunds for non-residents than for residents; • access to refunds and continuing registration being contingent on meeting filing requirements; • non-residents being required to account for GST on a payments or hybrid accounting basis; and • non-resident businesses that on-supply New Zealand services to non-registered persons not being eligible to register in New Zealand. 4.5 The fundamental changes necessary to design an enhanced registration system relate to the ability to claim input tax, the rules around deregistration and the need to reduce the potential for other tax consequences to arise from registration. Input tax 4.6 An enhanced registration system would link a non-resident’s ability to claim input tax to their worldwide supplies. This should result in GST incurred on any genuine business expense incurred in New Zealand being able to be deducted, and refunds being made available when deductions exceed GST payable on taxable supplies. 17 4.7 There are two options for doing this. Either the ability to claim input tax could be linked to a registered person’s “taxable activity”, or a special rule could be created for non-residents to deem “taxable supplies” in the deduction provisions to include all supplies that would be taxable if made in New Zealand. 9 We prefer the second option because it would make it clearer that input tax could not be claimed in respect of exempt supplies, either within New Zealand or offshore. Deregistration 4.8 There would be little point in expanding the ability to claim input tax without also amending the deregistration provisions. To do so would effectively invite non-residents to register, but still allow for their deregistration if they did not conduct their taxable activity in New Zealand. We consider that section 52(7) of the GST Act that allows for the deregistration of non-residents who do not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand would need to be at least amended in order to provide non-resident businesses with some certainty over the long- term viability of their registration. Whether some form of deregistration power specific to non-residents should still exist is discussed later in this chapter. Unintended consequences 4.9 One of the concerns a non-resident business could have in registering for New Zealand GST is that the GST law may have unforeseen consequences for other parts of its business. Experience in Australia suggests that non-residents may be reluctant to register for fear of GST attaching to supplies that would not logically form part of the business’s involvement with Australia. The difficulties in the Australian context appear to stem from the breadth of the “connected with Australia” test (in Australia, supplies are “connected with Australia” if a supply is done in Australia, including supplies performed by a subcontractor). 10 Although New Zealand does not have a comparable test, it is nevertheless important to ensure that similar problems do not arise. 4.10 The intention is that any rules expanding a non-resident’s ability to claim input tax would not further extend New Zealand’s taxing right or give rise to possible double taxation. 4.11 Concerns in this area are most likely to centre on supplies that are deemed to be made on the cessation of registration. 11 Some clarification of the effect of these deemed supply rules would be useful if an enhanced registration system were to be implemented. In particular, we consider that output tax should only apply to supplies made when goods are physically located in New Zealand at the relevant time. In other words, if there are goods in New Zealand, as with any other registered person, there should be an assumption that they are being used for making taxable supplies. If a non-resident is only the recipient of services in New Zealand, it is not anticipated they would have any New Zealand-based goods to which GST could attach. 9 The relevant deduction provision being section 20(3C). 10 See Australian Government: Implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Taxation's review of the GST cross-border transactions, 15 February 2011. (http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1959/PDF/BOT\_cross\_border\_transactions.pdf). 11 See section 5(3). 18 4.12 Goods and services that are due to be supplied to New Zealand customers but (in the case of goods) are located outside New Zealand should logically not be subject to GST at the time because, if they were actually delivered to the customer, they should in any event be subject to GST under section 12. Services should not attract GST unless the non-resident has made a taxable supply to a New Zealand customer. Equally, goods and services that are located offshore for non-resident customers also should have no bearing on a non-resident’s output tax liability on deregistration. Other key changes 4.13 An enhanced registration system fits well within the existing legislative and administrative systems in place for GST. However, given the inherent difficulty in recovering tax from non-resident defaulters, some legislative protection is inevitable. 4.14 This section discusses possible measures to provide more certainty to non- resident businesses, ensure administrative efficiency and protect the revenue base. We consider that all of these options should apply in any enhanced registration system. Home registration 4.15 A non-resident would be able to register in New Zealand if they are registered under a comparable transaction tax to GST, or for sales tax purposes, in the jurisdiction where their main taxable activity is based. Providing a tax registration number from the taxpayer’s home jurisdiction is generally a pre- requisite to obtaining a VAT refund from EU member states. Evidence that the business is carrying on an “enterprise” is required for a non-resident to register for GST in Australia. 4.16 As most of New Zealand’s major trading partners and over 120 countries operate VAT or GST, and others have at least a sales tax system, we consider that requiring a non-resident business to provide certification from their home tax authority that they are registered for the relevant tax is reasonable. The global incidence of taxes of this sort would mean that residents of New Zealand’s major trading partners should not be prejudiced by the requirement. However, to cater for circumstances when there is no direct comparison, the rules should be suitably flexible to allow non-residents from such a jurisdiction to register by providing certification of their tax registration number as a business for income tax. 4.17 In addition, as part of the registration process, the non-resident business should be required to separately certify: • that they are currently carrying on a taxable activity. This would provide confirmation of their status as a business in addition to the certification provided by the relevant tax authority; 19 • that the supplies made in the course of furtherance of that activity are of such a scale that they would, if made in New Zealand, require them to be registered. This requirement would ensure that only businesses that were relatively well-established could register; • that the taxable activity is expected to continue for the course of the relevant tax period. This may allow the Commissioner to refuse registration in the event that a special purpose vehicle was set up temporarily solely for the purpose of obtaining a refund in New Zealand; and • to advise Inland Revenue if the non-resident business ceases to carry on a taxable activity at any time or if their worldwide taxable activity falls below the registration threshold. Minimum refund threshold 4.18 As the name suggests, a minimum refund threshold would only allow refunds to non-residents when the amount of the refund was over a certain amount. This would allow for recovery of the administration costs of providing refunds and the amount would therefore be relatively small. 4.19 Most EU member states have a minimum threshold for refunds. In the UK, a claim for VAT must be made in respect of supplies made during a period of not less than three months and not more than 12 months. However, a claim can be made in respect of a period shorter than three months if that period represents the final part of the prescribed year. If the period to which the claim relates is less than 12 months, the VAT claimed must not be less than £130. When the claim relates to a full 12-month period, the minimum refund drops to £16. 12 Germany operates thresholds of €500 and €250 respectively. 13 A refund threshold in New Zealand could be set somewhere between these – at, say, $500 of GST. 4.20 From an administrative perspective, a refund threshold might be difficult to monitor because the nature of an enhanced registration system means that each return would have to be scrutinised not only in its own right, but also for refund threshold implications. However, there may be a need to ensure that businesses that only have a limited time during which expenses are incurred in New Zealand do not stay in the system indefinitely. 4.21 We consider that a refund threshold should apply for the first year of registration. From that point on, a non-resident should be entitled to remain registered for as long as they are not filing nil, or very low returns. If there is a consistent period of, for example, five years of returns showing no or very little activity in New Zealand, the Commissioner should have the discretion to deregister the business at that time. 12 European Commission, Taxation and Customs Union website: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/traders/vat\_refunds/uk\_en.pdf. 13 See above: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation\_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/traders/vat\_refunds/de\_en.pdf. 20 4.22 Having a threshold on the amount of expenditure potentially creates a distortion between resident and non-resident businesses and, therefore impacts on B2B neutrality. However, this is a recognised trade-off for the additional administration costs that would necessarily be incurred in processing returns. Time for refund processing 4.23 Under section 46, the Commissioner is required to refund an amount owing to a registered person no later than 15 working days after receipt of the relevant return. There are exceptions to this if the Commissioner requests further information or intends to investigate the circumstances of the return. 4.24 Despite the Supreme Court’s recent clarification of the scope of this provision, 14 15 working days would be a relatively short time to process significant refund returns by non-resident businesses. Although Inland Revenue can extend this period by investigating such returns, business confidence could be undermined if non-residents’ returns were investigated as a matter of course in order to verify the contents. Any amendment in this area therefore becomes a balancing act between providing Inland Revenue reasonable time to verify returns − in circumstances where information may be more difficult to acquire − against the need for businesses to have some certainty around when a refund will be confirmed. 4.25 We note that EU member states tend to allow themselves a longer period for processing refund claims from “third country” taxable persons, compared with refund claims from taxable persons in that member state or from within other member states. 15 4.26 Although we do not consider New Zealand would need a six-month window, as operates in some EU member states, a three-month period should allow sufficient time for any preliminary enquiries to be conducted, and a decision made on whether a broader investigation is warranted. A three-month timeframe would reflect the inherent difficulties associated with obtaining information from offshore, where issues such as language barriers may present themselves. Non-compliance with filing requirements 4.27 The effective operation of an enhanced registration system will be dependent on the non-resident business complying with its filing requirements. Generally, if a greater level of compliance is needed, this is generated through the statutory penalty and use-of-money interest provisions. However, a non- resident business that is registered for GST may not be in a “tax payable” position, meaning that penalties and interest are unlikely to apply. Even if they did apply, enforcement against non-residents can be difficult. 14 Contract Pacific Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2010\] NZSC 136. 15 Council Directive 2008/9/EC (applying to refunds with other EC jurisdictions), at Article 19, provides that a member state must accept or refuse a refund application within four months. By contrast the 13th VAT Directive (86/560/EEC), Article 3(1), leaves the time period for processing refunds up to the individual member. Article 3(2) supplements this by providing that “refunds may not be granted under conditions more favourable than those applied to community taxable persons.” 21 4.28 It is therefore proposed that the Commissioner should have one or both of the following powers to help ensure ongoing compliance: • the power to withhold refunds until filing requirements have been met, and any necessary payments made, for all previous periods. A similar measure operates in Canada; 16 and/or • a deregistration power for persistent non-compliance. Payments or hybrid basis 4.29 Ensuring that non-resident businesses must account for GST on a payments basis could be an effective means for further protecting the tax base. This would limit refunds to GST that had actually been paid by the non-resident, rather than GST that had merely been invoiced. 4.30 An invoice system provides greater scope for a non-resident business to access substantial refunds without actually parting with any money. In the event of non-payment, the supplier could reverse the transaction through the bad debt provisions in section 25, but there would be limited means for ensuring that a non-resident repaid any refund provided. 4.31 As with other persons that account for GST on a payments-basis, eligibility for input tax would need to be documented by providing invoices and receipts from the New Zealand supplier. Private consumption in New Zealand 4.32 It is important that in making any changes to the GST rules, the policy outcome of ensuring that private consumption in New Zealand is taxed here is not undermined. 4.33 The UK has a specific exclusion for “VAT charged on a supply to a travel agent \[or tour operator that purchases and resupplies services of the kind enjoyed by travellers\] which is for the direct benefit of a traveller other than the travel agent or his employee”. 17 This rule appears designed to prevent non- residents from gaining refunds on supplies that are ultimately enjoyed by tourists. A similar provision could also be useful in the New Zealand context. However, given that one of the positive aspects of an enhanced registration system is that genuine business expenses such as hotel costs should be able to be claimed, any rule would ideally focus on the nature of the final consumer rather than the nature of the supply itself. 4.34 One approach may be to deny the registration if the taxable activity of the non- resident is predominantly the supply of goods and services that are received in New Zealand by non-residents who would not be eligible to register. In this context, such rules could treat all supplies by the non-resident as if they were made in New Zealand, so the non-resident would not be able to circumvent the rules and register on the basis that New Zealand only accounts for a small proportion of an international operation. 16 OECD Forum on Tax Administration Compliance Sub-Group, Developments in VAT Compliance Management in Selected Countries, August 2009, page 25. 17 The Value Added Tax Regulations 1995, Part XXI, Regulation 190(1)(b). 22 4.35 This would mean that, for example, a non-resident whose business is to on-sell tourism products would not be eligible to register if those tourism products are ultimately enjoyed by non-resident (and non-registered) individuals. The change would ensure the policy intent of section 11A(2), which denies zero- rating for services when the receipt of the performance of those services is in New Zealand, remains effective. Other measures considered 4.36 In looking at possible additional features of an enhanced registration system, the following ideas were also considered. They are not being progressed at the current time, as discussed below. Exchange-of-information agreements 4.37 Another option would be to restrict registration to businesses that are primarily based in jurisdictions with which New Zealand has an exchange-of-information agreement. This would allow Inland Revenue the opportunity to confirm that the registration application was genuine and also periodically to check the continuing registration status in the other jurisdiction. Without an exchange- of-information agreement with the home jurisdiction, these checks are unlikely to be possible. 4.38 Although New Zealand has a wide network of double tax agreements (DTAs) that contain exchange-of-information articles, and numerous independent exchange-of-information agreements, not all cover GST. Historically, these articles in treaties are limited to the taxes covered by the treaty itself – in New Zealand’s case, this is often only income tax. Despite more recently negotiated treaties tending to include GST, the coverage is still not comprehensive. 4.39 Although GST coverage in our DTA and independent exchange-of-information agreement network incorporates some of New Zealand’s major trading partners, it excludes other important trading partners. Having an exchange-of- information agreement in place as a pre-requisite to registration may therefore be too restrictive to be a genuine aid to B2B neutrality on a large scale. 4.40 The OECD has other initiatives that may, in the future, provide fuller coverage in exchange-of-information agreements, including multi-lateral agreements. However, even if New Zealand were to adopt these initiatives, it may not be of immediate assistance if they are not universally accepted. If significant developments in this area are made, they could be considered at a later stage to buttress an enhanced registration system. 23 Reciprocity 4.41 The ability for non-resident businesses to register could be made contingent on the business’s home jurisdiction allowing registration of New Zealand businesses, or providing them with a refund for GST or VAT incurred in that jurisdiction. European VAT officially has a reciprocity requirement for traders from outside the EU although practices among member jurisdictions appear to vary. 18 4.42 If all jurisdictions operating a GST/VAT were to recognise the need for full B2B neutrality, there would be no need to legislate for reciprocity because that recognition would incorporate the removal of any double tax impost in cross- border trade. New Zealand’s GST system should apply best practice principles wherever possible. As a result, we do not consider that reciprocity should be a prerequisite to New Zealand registration. Conditions on registration 4.43 In the UK, if there is insufficient evidence to refuse an application for registration, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs can impose conditions on registration. 19 In practice, these restrictions could include a financial guarantee being provided or a shortened first filing period to enable a relatively quick assessment of the person’s compliance. There may be merit to the “bond”-type arrangement, in that non-residents would need to provide money upfront as a sign of good faith. However, we consider that requiring non-residents to register on a payments or hybrid basis would have a similar economic outcome, without the need to pay initial GST twice in order to access a refund. Only paying refunds to New Zealand bank accounts 4.44 Limiting the payment of refunds to New Zealand dollar-denominated accounts in New Zealand banks would mean that any refund would be held in New Zealand (temporarily at least) in the event that the non-resident was not actually entitled to the refund processed. It would also provide an additional information source for Inland Revenue for audit purposes. 4.45 However, in our view, a wider consideration of the benefits of such a measure is needed as, if implemented, its effect would not be confined to an enhanced registration system for non-residents. 18 Article 2(2) of the 13 th Council Directive 86/560/EEC. 19 See, for example: Value Added Tax Act 1994, Schedule 1; Value Added Tax Act 1994, Schedule 2, section 4; and The Value Added Tax Regulations 1995, Regulation 25(1)(c). 24 CHAPTER 5 Tooling costs This chapter considers another situation when GST may be a genuine impediment to business neutrality. The difference here is that the issue concerns goods – in particular, GST charged by New Zealand manufacturers on “tooling” costs for non- resident clients. The chapter highlights two possible ways of addressing the issue: • relying on the enhanced registration system; or • introducing a special zero-rating rule. Submissions are welcome on which of these options is preferred. 5.1 In the manufacturing sector, we understand that there is a specific pricing model that is used to quote for, and undertake, work of a tailor-made nature. This system involves quoting for the production of a certain quantity of goods (either in bulk or on a per unit basis) and quoting separately for the “tooling costs” associated with completing the order to the specific requirements of the customer. As the name suggests, these tooling costs are designed to cover expenses associated with creating or adapting tools that can only be used in fulfilling the particular order. 5.2 We understand the major reason for this separation of costs is driven by the customer’s desire to be the “owner” of the specific tools, even though they have no intention of ever taking delivery of them. This is important for the customer because it prevents the manufacturer from using the tools in a future product, thereby reducing the possibility of copy products appearing on the market. 5.3 However, this pricing structure creates a problem from a GST perspective when the manufacturer is resident in New Zealand and the customer is non- resident. The actual goods being produced will be exported and therefore generally able to be zero-rated under section 11. By contrast, the tools will be used exclusively in New Zealand and will not be physically exported. Because the tools are not exported, none of the existing zero-rating rules apply and the tooling costs will be subject to GST at the standard rate. 25 5.4 The imposition of GST would not occur if the tooling costs were bundled into the cost of the completed product. For example, instead of charging $100 for the products and $10 for the tooling costs, the New Zealand manufacturer could charge $110 for the products. Because the products would ultimately be exported, the full amount could be zero-rated. However, this alternative, as we understand it, would not be acceptable to international consumers, who operate in a set quoting/invoicing environment and insist on this model being followed to assert their proprietary rights over the tools used. 5.5 This is not a problem unique to New Zealand. Australia recognises this problem specifically in legislation. Section 38−188 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999, provides: A supply of goods is GST-free \[zero-rated\] if: (a) the recipient of the supply is a non-resident, and is not registered or required to be registered; and (b) the goods are jigs, patterns, templates, dies, punches and similar machine tools to be used in Australia solely to manufacture goods that will be for export from Australia. 5.6 The UK has a provision in its Value Added Tax Act 1994 that is very similar in its application. 20 5.7 New Zealand manufacturers are of the view that the lack of a corresponding provision in our GST legislation forces them to charge any tooling costs on a “plus GST” basis. As the non-resident customer is usually unable to reclaim this GST as input tax, New Zealand manufacturers are arguably at a competitive disadvantage to other potential suppliers. Options 5.8 It is arguable that imposing GST on tooling costs is justifiable because the tools are used and consumed entirely within New Zealand. There will always be occasions when businesses are forced to absorb costs in order to win substantial contracts. These costs include the price of premises, plant, labour and raw materials – all of which naturally fluctuate between various jurisdictions. Tax, it can be argued, is a similar variable. For a New Zealand business, absorbing the GST on a small fraction of the overall income derived from a contract (i.e., the tooling costs) could be a price worth paying for the overall revenue stream that a contract would generate. 5.9 Despite this, we consider this issue should be considered further. There are two main options for addressing the concerns of manufacturers in these circumstances: • relying on the enhanced registration system; or • introducing a special zero-rating rule. 20 See Value Added Tax Act 1994, Schedule 8, group 13, section 3. 26 Registration system for tooling 5.10 Under the enhanced registration system we have outlined, a non-resident business incurring GST as a real cost would effectively become optional. If a non-resident business was engaging a New Zealand manufacturer, it would, in most cases, be able to register for GST and claim input tax for any GST imposed on the tooling costs. Assuming it had no other connection with New Zealand, the non-resident business would be eligible to have this input tax refunded. The same economic result as zero-rating would be achieved without the need for a special legislative provision. Special zero-rating rule 5.11 For GST purposes, it is important to focus on who the consumer actually is and where the benefit from the consumption of the goods and services is enjoyed. 5.12 In the case of tooling costs, the customer is the non-resident business and the enjoyment of that contract is also wholly offshore. Unlike, for example, tourists that consume goods and services in New Zealand, the manufacturing customer may not visit New Zealand. The ultimate product of the manufacturing process is exported and the tools, although not physically exported, are owned by the non-resident for the purpose of their offshore business. The fact that the tools remain here can be said to be of little consequence, because they are no longer owned by the New Zealand resident and the value of them is never realised in the domestic market. The customer could, as owner, insist on their exportation at any time. 5.13 If the tooling costs are in effect an export, it is arguable that their supply should be zero-rated in the same manner as other exports. Of relevance to this view is the treatment of services that are performed for a non-resident directly in connection with goods that are then exported. Section 11A(1)(m) allows such services to be zero-rated. It is difficult to argue that the tooling costs are conceptually different to services provided in relation to exported goods. 5.14 Given the similarities between tooling costs and services provided directly in connection with exported goods – both are provided to a non-resident as an inherent part of goods that are ultimately exported – we consider that this could be a situation where a specific zero-rating rule may be justified. 5.15 However, if a zero-rating rule was introduced, it would only apply to tools that are exclusively used on exported goods and where title of those tools passes to a non-resident. If these tools or resulting goods were later on-supplied by the non-resident owner back into the New Zealand domestic market (or allowed by the non-resident to be used for manufacturing for the domestic market), supporting rules may be needed to ensure that the tools would then be treated as imports and GST paid at an appropriate level at that time. 27 5.16 This exclusivity requirement would add some complexity to a zero-rating system, in that it would still require an enhanced registration system to provide the right result in certain instances. For example, if the goods were used both for domestic and foreign markets, or the tools or goods were on-supplied into New Zealand, GST would be payable. The non-resident would have to use the enhanced registration system to claim any available input tax. 5.17 A further disadvantage of zero-rating (as mentioned previously in relation to zero-rating more generally) is the definitional concern. Although both Australia and the UK use very similar wording for their zero-rating provision, it seems likely that there could be some debate around what constitutes a “similar machine tool”, for example. Conclusion 5.18 We can see merit in both options and welcome submissions on which is preferable. We are particularly interested in the definitional issues surrounding a zero-rating rule and the extent to which a zero-rating rule for tooling costs would be necessary if an enhanced registration system were introduced.

Suggestions presented here seek to strike a balance between fairness for all taxpayers and fairness for farmers. 1.2 This officials’ issues paper looks at problems that have arisen with certain livestock valuation elections rules where the flexibility of the rules is being inappropriately used. This practice was not intended and resulted, for example, in an estimated fiscal cost to the Government of over $100 million of lost tax revenue as a result of the 2007–08 year peak in dairy cow values. 1.3 Put simply, it appears that it is too easy for farmers to exit the herd scheme and there is a significant cyclical fiscal cost associated with this. 1.4 No other livestock valuation matters are considered in this paper. 1.5 Of necessity this paper is technical and is therefore targeted at farm accountants and their farmer clients. Further, while this paper focuses on Friesian dairy cows as an example because of the recent volatility in the market values of dairy cows, it is equally relevant to all specified livestock (sheep, cattle (dairy and beef), deer, goats and pigs). 1.6 This paper discusses the two main livestock valuation methods in Chapter 2, and Chapter 3 presents high-level analysis of the problems. The problems and suggested reforms to the election to exit the herd scheme are discussed in detail in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 considers the problems and suggested reforms when there is a cessation of farming. Background and problem 1.7 There are two main livestock valuation methods – the herd scheme and national standard cost. The herd scheme views the farm livestock as a machine held on capital account. It uses annually announced national average market values, and makes annual changes in value tax-free by way of adjusting, on capital account, the value of opening livestock to that of closing livestock for each year. 1.8 National standard cost is a more typical inventory regime where changes in values are on tax account, but it uses national average costs rather than farm- specific costs. Farmers can elect to move between these valuation methods. 1.9 The problem is that some farmers are making elections with the apparent objective of taking tax-free herd-scheme gains when livestock values are increasing and tax deductible write-downs as values decrease. The livestock valuation rules and their associated elections were not intended to allow farmers to shelter their ordinary farming taxable income in this fashion. 2 1.10 The two elections associated with the herd scheme that are causing problems are: • the election by a continuing farmer to exit from the herd scheme to use another livestock valuation method; and • the election when a farming enterprise that uses the herd scheme sells its specified livestock and ceases farming. A similar election is available when a farmer dies. 1.11 The concern is an equity issue in the tax system as no other business taxpayers can value a major asset such as trading stock in one year as if it were a machine on capital account, and in another year value it as trading stock under a cost-based regime. Suggested solutions 1.12 Officials’ suggestions to address the identified problems are: • That, once a farmer has elected to use the herd scheme, the election is irrevocable (as was originally proposed by the consultative document in 1986). 1 • That, when a farmer has ceased farming and disposed of their livestock to a non-associated person before, say, 31 July of a year, it is compulsory for the vendor to use the herd values issued during that calendar year in the tax return that covers the period of sale (i.e. no opening herd scheme adjustment). Otherwise it is compulsory for the vendor to use the next calendar year’s herd values for opening stock (i.e. do the opening herd scheme adjustment). • For all sales to associated persons, the associated person is bound by any herd scheme election and base herd scheme numbers of the vendor. The vendor must use the year-end herd values in the period covering the sale (i.e. do an opening herd scheme adjustment). • Where a farmer has died, the same associated persons rule applies. 1.13 Feedback is welcomed on these or alternative suggestions, as long as the tax base is appropriately protected. The main alternative suggestion canvassed in this paper is to extend the notice period for the election to leave the herd scheme. Buttressing of the suggestions by consideration of the treatment of associated persons’ transactions will be necessary regardless of which option is chosen. 1 The March 1986 Consultative Document on Primary Sector Taxation. 3 Application dates 1.14 Given that these are, at this stage, only officials’ suggestions and are subject to consultation, no consideration has been given to potential application dates. Fiscal implications 1.15 A change to prevent future herd-scheme write-downs is a base maintenance measure by nature. The existing baselines do not include livestock valuation fluctuation forecasts. Hence, for budgetary purposes, no fiscal savings arise from these suggestions to prevent farmers swapping between the schemes. 1.16 This does not imply that it is not fiscally important to do this work, since in the absence of the policy change, the Government would instead be facing a negative variance against forecast when such an event occurs again. Submissions 1.17 Officials invite submissions on the suggested reforms.

The two most common methods of valuing specified livestock are the herd scheme and the national standard cost (NSC) scheme. The herd scheme 2.2 The herd scheme effectively treats qualifying livestock as a capital asset, notwithstanding its similarity to trading stock. Changes in herd values (specifically “national average market values” or “NAMVs”) from year to year are tax-free, but changes in numbers are on tax revenue account. 2.3 The herd scheme’s capital asset treatment is effected by revaluing each year’s opening stock to the closing values for that year (the opening value of trading stock is in all other cases the last year’s closing values). This revaluation amount is a capital (and therefore non-taxable) gain or loss. 2.4 This revaluation is what makes the herd scheme unique. No other trading stock is subject to such an adjustment. The ability to cease making this adjustment is key to the issues discussed in this paper. 2.5 Example 1 is a simplified example that presumes a dairy farmer has 300 MA (mixed age) Friesian cows and replacement livestock on hand all valued in the herd scheme. The period selected is the years from 2006–07 to 2008–09 as in this period a very large price spike occurred in the value of dairy cows. Unless otherwise specified, the examples in this paper use these numbers and presumptions, although a number of examples are simplified further by referring to MA Friesian cows only. 2.6 Example 1 illustrates the significant tax-free “gain” from the 2006–07 income year to the 2007–08 income year of $344,940. Equally, it illustrates the significant non-deductible “loss” from the 2007–08 income year to the 2008–09 income year of $329,340. 2.7 An opening stock revaluation is generally compulsory in respect of opening livestock that was valued in the herd scheme as closing stock in the previous year. However, there are exceptions discussed in the next chapters. 2.8 What is not illustrated in Example 1 is that changes in the number of herd scheme livestock on hand are on tax revenue account. Thus, for example, if cow numbers being valued in the herd scheme increased during the year, the total closing tax value of the livestock would increase over the opening value and taxable income would result. The alternative valuation option (AVO), which is discussed later, can offer some tax relief in this circumstance. 5 Example 1: Simplified herd scheme example No. on Hand NAMV $ Value $ Tax-free $ 2006–07 income year Closing stock MA Cows 3001,245373,500 R 2 Heifers 601,07564,500 R 1 Heifers 60594 35,640 473,640 2007–08 income year Revalued opening stock MA Cows 3002,150645,000 R 2 Heifers 601,856111,360 R 1 Heifers 601,037 62,220 818,580 Closing stock MA Cows 3002,150645,000 R 2 Heifers 601,856111,360 R 1 Heifers 601,037 62,220 818,580 Change in tax value Nil Tax free gain/(non-deductible loss) 344,940 2008–09 income year Revalued opening stock MA Cows 3001,312393,600 R 2 Heifers 601,08364,980 R 1 Heifers 60511 30,660 489,240 Closing stock MA Cows 3001,312393,600 R 2 Heifers 601,08364,980 R 1 Heifers 60511 30,660 489,240 Change in tax value Nil Tax free gain/(non-deductible loss) (329,340) 6 Example 2: Simplified NSC example No. on Hand NSC $ Value $ 2006–07 income year Closing stock – say MA Cows 300755.10226,530 R 2 Heifers 60771.3046,278 R 1 Heifers 60652.00 39,120 311,928 2007–08 income year Opening stock MA Cows 300755.10226,530 R 2 Heifers 60771.3046,278 R 1 Heifers 60652.00 39,120 311,928 Closing stock MA Cows 300758.34 227,502 R 2 Heifers 60756.8045,408 R 1 Heifers 60608.60 36,516 309,426 Change in tax value – income/(loss) (2,502) 2008–09 income year Opening stock MA Cows 300758.34 227,502 R 2 Heifers 60756.8045,408 R 1 Heifers 60608.60 36,516 309,426 Closing stock MA Cows 300758.68227,604 R 2 Heifers 60751.2045,072 R 1 Heifers 60787.60 47,256 319,932 Change in tax value – income/(loss) 10,506 This example presumes that for ease of calculation the cost of each of the 2006–07 MA cows is $755.10. 7 National standard cost 2.9 In contrast to the herd scheme, the NSC scheme is a valuation regime similar to one manufacturers would use to value trading stock, except that as a simplification measure it uses national averages to calculate the on-farm costs of breeding, rearing and growing livestock (BRG). Thus, not only are changes in number on tax revenue account, but also changes in value as well. 2.10 Example 2 is a simplified example that presumes a dairy farmer has 300 Friesian cows and replacement homebred livestock on hand all valued using the NSC scheme. The period selected is again the years from 2006–07 to 2008–09 as in this period a very large market price spike occurred. Because NSC reflects on-farm costs rather than the market value of livestock, this spike is not reflected in the NSC values of homebred livestock. 2.11 The examples in this paper presume that the NSC stock flow method used is first-in, first-out (FIFO) rather than weighted average. Contrast between the methods 2.12 Using the above examples, the differences in year-end values between the herd scheme and NSC are substantial: Year Herd values $ NSC cost $ Difference $ 2007 473,640311,928161,712 2008 818,580309,426509,154 2009 489,240319,931169,309 2.13 Among other things, this shows clearly the effect of the market value spike in 2008 and the resulting volatility in herd values or NAMVs that occurred in this period. Although this volatility was extreme by historical standards, the graph at the start of Chapter 3 shows that there was another price spike for MA Friesian cows in the last decade. The above table also shows the relative stability of the NSC scheme when replacement livestock is homebred. The alternative valuation option (AVO) 2.14 This alternative was introduced at the same time as the NSC scheme in the 1992–93 tax year. It allows farmers who are using the herd scheme and whose livestock numbers are expanding to value some or all of those extra numbers at cost. This allows farmers to avoid paying tax on some or all of the write-up from cost to NAMVs on those extra numbers. In a home breeding situation this could be particularly significant. Although the AVO is part of the solution suggested by officials, no changes to it are suggested. 8 2.15 Example 3 deals with the base herd of 300 MA cows that feature in the above examples and that are valued in the herd scheme. Over time this is increased by home breeding to 340. For simplicity, replacements are ignored. Example 3: AVO example Year Herd numbers opening Total numbers closing Minimum closing herd numbers Maximum numbers in AVO 2007 300 3003000 2008 300 32530025 2009 300 32030020 2010 300 34030040 2.16 Presumably the AVO cows will be valued in the NSC scheme. Thus there is no extra tax cost of increasing these numbers, whereas if the extra 40 were valued in the herd scheme extra tax would have been payable. 2.17 The maximum AVO numbers presume that the minimum of 300 MA cows were valued in the herd scheme at the end of each of the years. Alternatively, if in 2009 the 320 MA cows had been valued in the herd scheme then only the increase of 20 could be valued using the AVO in 2010. 9 CHAPTER 3 High-level analysis of the problem 3.1 The following graph of Friesian cow NAMVs from 1987 (when the herd scheme was introduced) to date shows three significant spikes, two of which have been in the last decade. The 1993 spike was mainly caused by the change of valuation methodology that occurred as part of the 1993 reforms. National Average Market Values – Friesian M/A Cows 0 500 1000 1500 2000 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Year Value M/A cows 3.2 In contrast, as illustrated in paragraph 2.12, the NSC scheme offered, from its introduction in the 1992–93 tax year, substantial stability for a home- breeding operation. 3.3 Theoretically these spikes offered dairy farmers using the herd scheme an incentive to exit it. There is evidence that a number of dairy farmers used these opportunities in relation to either, or perhaps even both, of the spikes in the 2000s with the result that their tax liability has been reduced. 3.4 For example, presuming a farmer with 300 cows successfully exited the herd scheme in the 2008–09 income year, as a number did, they could have obtained about $100,000 of net tax savings over the 2008–09 and subsequent income years. This is because the farmer took a tax-free write-up to the 2007–08 peak, and arranged to obtain a tax deduction for the subsequent write-down. 3.5 It seems a number of farmers also took advantage of the earlier 2001–02 spike. This was described in an article titled “Watch your step when stepping out of the Herd Scheme” in the May 2003 issue of The Chartered Accountants Journal. An extract from page 10 of the Journal follows. 10 “As we worked into the 2002 income year, many of us could see that herd values for sheep and beef cattle were also going to peak, and if there was ever a time to quit the Herd Scheme, this was it. The legislation requires a two-year written notice of election for taxpayers wishing to quit the Herd Scheme. In fact, the timeframe is somewhat less than two years because, provided a written notice of election to quit the scheme was filed before the closing date for filing the 2001 tax return, it was possible to be out of it for the 2003 income year. Large numbers of taxpayers filed the appropriate elections prior to filing their 2001 tax return – many of which were delayed until the last few days of March 2002. By that time, we had a fair idea of what the 2002 herd values would be. Those 2002 herd values were announced in May 2002 and though dairy cattle had gone just over the crest, it appeared that sheep and beef cattle had peaked in that year. It is becoming evident that 2003 herd values will be considerably lower than those ruling for 2002. For those continuing with the Herd Scheme, there will be a very large non-tax- deductible devaluation of stock to be brought to account when preparing the 2003 financial statements for farming clients. Some of that downward market value trend became obvious for dairy cattle by late autumn/early winter of 2002. The downward trend was also beginning to be reflected in sheep and beef cattle prices with the strengthening of the currency in October 2002. Those who had not filed elections to quit the Herd Scheme prior to filing their 2001 tax returns probably realised that they had “missed the bus”. Through the period from the winter of 2002 to the end of January 2003, many decided to use the alternative route for quitting the Herd Scheme. That alternative involves selling the livestock to a separate entity (not a related partnership) and having that separate entity make its own decision about which valuation system to use for its new livestock. The old (selling) entity was able to apply a special provision that flows through under section EL 5(6) of the Income Tax Act 1994. That provision applies where a taxpayer that has previously adopted herd values for livestock has now sold all of the livestock and ceased to derive income from it. In those circumstances, the selling entity is entitled to file an election no later than 1 February in the income year of sale and cessation to use the herd values for the immediately preceding income year. .... The result will be that most of these taxpayers will have generated a significant tax loss on disposal of their livestock.” (Reprinted with permission from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants.) 11 3.6 This extract highlights a number of potential problems including: • It was seen as being common practice to try to exit the herd scheme when NAMVs were high. • “Large numbers” elected out using the election to leave the herd scheme. • “Many” farmers were delaying filing their tax returns to keep their livestock election options open. • “Many” farmers used “the alternative route for quitting the herd scheme” (or what this paper calls the “sale cease farming election”). 3.7 While there may have been some exaggeration over the numbers of farmers involved, this extract clearly indicates that there is a series of tax policy and operational problems, all seemingly to do with securing a tax advantage by exiting the herd scheme at an opportune moment. 3.8 It appears that there was considerably more use of these options to leave the herd scheme as a result of the 2008 peak in dairy cow prices than there was in relation to the earlier peak discussed in the extract. The two elections of concern 3.9 There are a variety of livestock valuation elections that allow farmers to select which livestock valuation regime they wish to use for their specified livestock. In particular, there are two elections that are currently causing concern: • The election by a continuing farmer to exit from the herd scheme to use another livestock valuation method. This has the practical effect that the opening herd scheme adjustment is not made in the year that the election is effective (thus the opening herd livestock is valued at the last year’s herd values) and another valuation method is used at the end of that year. • Where a farming enterprise that uses the herd scheme sells its specified livestock and ceases farming, (or a farmer dies (in which case their livestock is deemed to have been sold)), in qualifying circumstances an election can be made for the tax return that includes the sale, that the opening herd scheme adjustment need not be made (the “sale cease farming election”). 3.10 The practical effects of these elections are illustrated by example in the next two chapters of this paper. 3.11 For continuing farmers, the election to exit has been the most common method for farmers to cease using the herd scheme. However, in relation to the 2008 peak in herd values of dairy cows there is evidence that several hundred farming enterprises used the “sale cease farming election” where the “sale” was to an associated person (that is: there was no real change in economic ownership). 12 Summary 3.12 Of all business taxpayers, it is only farmers of specified livestock that can elect one year to value their stock (typically after land, their biggest asset) as a capital asset (the herd scheme), and in the next year as if it were trading stock held on tax account (the NSC scheme). A number of farmers have used these elections to generate tax savings (from tax-free write-ups and tax- deductible write-downs). 3.13 From a tax policy and fairness perspective, the advantage these farmers are obtaining is inappropriate. A legislative response is required. 13 CHAPTER 4 Elections to exit the herd scheme Background 4.1 The original March 1986 Consultative Document on Primary Sector Taxation discussed whether elections should be irrevocable and proposed at paragraph 2.7.2: “To avoid these problems \[of taxpayers swapping from one valuation method to another to take advantage of movements in values\] an election to use the herd scheme will be irrevocable”. 4.2 The Consultative Committee agreed with submitters that the proposed irrevocable nature of the election “would be an undue restriction on a taxpayer’s flexibility of choice” (at page 20 of the Report of the Consultative Committee on Primary Sector Taxation). It proposed 12 months clear notice. The Government did not accept this, and opted for 24 months before the commencement of the year in which the change was to apply. 4.3 At the Select Committee stages of the resultant tax bill later in 1986, this was then adjusted to the “2 years’ notice” which required the election to be made by 31 March of the tax year that was two years before the election was to apply. In practice this could be a minimum of a year and a day’s notice depending on the farmer’s balance date. 4.4 In the 1992 Report of the Consultative Committee on Livestock Valuation, a further change was proposed and accepted, for “administrative” reasons. This was a reference to the compliance cost savings that would result from the accountant not having to discuss livestock valuation election options with their farmer client other than as part of the annual financial statements and tax return review. This change provided that, instead of the notice being given by 31 March of a year, it could accompany the tax return for that year. This effectively reduced the period of notice by up to a year. 4.5 The current authority for the election is section EC 14(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section EC 11(3) then requires that this notice be given with the tax return for “an income year that is at least two years before the income year in which the election is first to apply”. 4.6 So, for example, an election to exit the herd scheme for the 2008–09 income year could have been given with the 2006–07 tax return, which could have been filed as late as 31 March 2008. (Under the originally enacted “2 years’ notice” rule, for the notice to be effective for the 2008–09 year it would have to have been given by 31 March 2007.) 4.7 The effect of this election is that no opening herd scheme revaluation was completed in the 2008–09 income year and NSC could be used to value the closing livestock. Example 4 sets out what would have happened in the 2008–09 income year if appropriate notice had been given with the 2007 tax return. 14 Example 4: Electing to leave the herd scheme No. on Hand $ Value $ Tax free $ 2007–08 income year Revalued opening stock MA Cows 3002,150645,000 R 2 Heifers 601,856111,360 R 1 Heifers 601,037 62,220 818,580 Closing stock – herd scheme MA Cows 3002,150645,000 R 2 Heifers 601,856111,360 R 1 Heifers 601,037 62,220 818,580 Change in tax value Nil Tax free gain/(non-deductible loss) 344,940 2008–09 income year Opening stock MA Cows 3002,150645,000 R 2 Heifers 601,856111,360 R 1 Heifers 601,037 62,220 818,580 Closing stock - NSC MA Cows 3002,091627,360 R 2 Heifers 601,18070,776 R 1 Heifers 60788 47,256 745,392 Change in tax value – income/(loss) (73,188) Tax free gain/(non-deductible loss) (Nil) 4.8 If the farmer had not elected to leave the herd scheme in the 2008–09 year, they would have had a capital (non-deductible) herd scheme loss of $329,340 (as is illustrated in Example 1) instead of a tax deduction of $73,188. However, as illustrated in Example 5 and the discussion immediately below it, this $73,188 deduction is just the start of further deductions as the NSC system applies over subsequent years. Problem with the election 4.9 Example 4 sets out what would have happened in 2008–09 if the appropriate notice to exit the herd scheme and use NSC had been given with the 2006–07 tax return. This is summarised in Example 5 \[gain/(loss)\]. 15 Example 5: Election to leave the herd scheme and to use NSC Year Valuation election Opening stock Closing stock Tax account Capital account 2008 Herd 473,640818,580Nil344,940 2009 NSC 818,580745,392(73,188)Nil 2010 NSC 745,392647,532(97,860)Nil 4.10 Over the next four years the NSC value of MA cows would continue to decrease until the effect of the herd values (using the FIFO method) has been “aged out” of the livestock and they would then have been valued at their underlying home-bred BRG (breeding, rearing and growing) cost. Over the 2008–09 and subsequent income years this would yield tax deductions in the order of $500,000 (being the difference between the 2007–08 NAMVs and the underlying BRG of homebred livestock. 4.11 If the farmer had elected back into the herd scheme in the 2009–10 income year (which election could be made with the filing of the tax return for that year) they would have derived a much quicker write-down because the NAMVs for the 2009–10 income year were much lower than the 2008–09 income year NSC values for the MA cows. We understand that a number of farmers did make this election. Example 6 illustrates the results \[gain/(loss)\]. Example 6: Election back into herd scheme Year Valuation election Opening stock Closing stock Tax account Capital account 2008 Herd 473,640818,580Nil344,940 2009 NSC 818,580745,392(73,188)Nil 2010 Herd 745,392521,220(224,172)Nil 4.12 Further, the analysis of the extract quoted in the previous chapter indicates a compliance and administration problem – that of some farmers deliberately delaying the filing of their tax returns to keep their election options open. This is undesirable from a tax administration perspective. Potential responses 4.13 The Government’s continued emphasis upon fairness in the tax system requires a response to the problem outlined. There is a range of potential responses, varying from lengthening the notice period for the election to, at the other end of the spectrum, repealing the herd scheme. 4.14 Repealing the herd scheme is not justified. From an economic perspective, for a livestock farming operation based on a relatively stable number of mature livestock being used to produce progeny, milk or wool for sale, the mature livestock have significant capital characteristics. The herd scheme properly recognises these capital characteristics. 16 4.15 This leaves two potential solutions: • lengthen the notice period for the election; or • repeal the option to be able to elect to leave the herd scheme. 4.16 The question of a potential extension to the timeframe of the present notice is difficult. The following table summarises the above discussion on the history of the notice period: 2005–06 year 2006–07 year 2007–08 year 2008–09 year Original Consultative Document No election proposed As introduced in 1986 Tax Bill Notice given by 31 March 2006 Election effective As originally enacted in 1986 Notice given by 31 March 2007 Election effective As amended in 1993 Notice given with 2007 tax return Election effective 4.17 Given the advent of the AVO in the 1992–93 tax year, the need for farmers to be able to elect out of the herd scheme because of changed circumstances seems to have largely, if not totally, fallen away. Any extra livestock can be valued at cost. Therefore the concerns raised in paragraph 4.2 are less valid. 4.18 Further, any period of notice that was long enough to make it a real gamble as to the taxation effects of leaving the herd scheme, would result in too long a period for any election to be effective to allow for a farmer’s change of circumstances. 4.19 Accordingly it is suggested that the original proposal that there be no election to leave the herd scheme be adopted. That is, the herd scheme election will be irrevocable. This is in the belief that the AVO will offer sufficient flexibility to deal with changes in farmers’ circumstances. 4.20 This will have the effect that, once a farmer has elected to treat their livestock as a capital asset, they cannot then change their mind and treat this livestock as if it were trading stock. 4.21 However, both of these options need buttressing to make them work. Presently, as discussed in the extract quoted in the previous chapter, and as is discussed in the next chapter, sales to associated persons can be used to circumvent the effect of repealing the ability to be able to elect out of the herd scheme. 17 CHAPTER 5 Sale of livestock and cessation of farming Background 5.1 Sections EC 20 and EC 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allow an election to not make an opening herd scheme adjustment where a farmer who is using the herd scheme: • sells their livestock before 1 February of an income year and ceases to derive income from specified livestock in that income year and makes the election by 1 February in that income year; or • dies before 1 February of an income year where the tax return to date of death is filed before the NAMVs are announced. 5.2 This is called in this paper the “sale cease farming election”. 5.3 These provisions have not been substantially changed since their introduction from 1 April 1989. 5.4 This sale could be to an associated party. For example, in the 2008–09 income year there were a number of sales to associated persons in situations where a “2 years’ notice” election to exit the herd scheme had not been made with the 2006–07 tax return. 2 If the “sale cease farming election” was properly made in the 2008–09 income year, it had the same economic and tax result as a timely “2 years’ notice” election in that there was no opening herd scheme adjustment in the 2009 income year for the vendor. Problem with the “sale cease farming election” 5.5 If that sale (and this also applies to all deemed sales upon death) was to an associated person in the 2008–09 income year, the tax outcome could be as illustrated in the example below \[gain/(loss)\]. Example 7: Sale to an associated person Year Valuation election Opening stock Closing stock Tax account Capital account 2008 Herd 473,640818,580Nil 344,940 2009 Herd 818,580489,240(329,340)Nil 2010 Herd 489,240521,220Nil 31,980 2 This policy paper makes no observations on whether these transactions comply with all aspects of the Income Tax Act. 18 5.6 The example presumes that the “new” farming entity makes an election to use the herd scheme. If the purchaser elected to use NSC, the purchaser and the vendor would still get very significant tax deductions over the next few years, but the precise timing and location of those deductions would depend on the sale and purchase price. 5.7 Note that this example presents the tax outcome of livestock valuation over both the vendor and the purchaser and ignores the actual sale and purchase of the livestock (which can be ignored using a “one economic entity” policy approach). The only effect of the sale price is to determine where the tax losses will arise – the higher the price the more the purchaser will derive the tax loss. 5.8 A similar outcome is achievable by selling the livestock to an associated person in the 2007–08 income year. The vendor would still get the large tax- free herd-scheme write-up in the 2007–08 income year. The purchaser could use the NSC scheme for the 2007–08 income year and revert to the herd scheme in the 2008–09 income year, thereby obtaining a large tax deduction, perhaps even, depending on the facts, an amount in the order of the $329,340 illustrated in Example 7. 5.9 There is a further more generic problem with this election even with genuine third party sales – it presents a choice that often results in farmers being able to make an election about which NAMVs to use depending on NAMV movements from year to year. Where NAMVs increase over the income year, the incentive is not to make the election to lock-in the opening values. Where NAMVs decrease over the income year, the incentive is to make the election. In seems likely that this situation will systemically advantage the farmer and therefore cost the Government. Therefore, this election seems to be inappropriate. Suggested solutions General cessation 5.10 The fact that ceasing farmers are allowed a choice puts them in a situation to take a tax advantage by making an election that most suits their perception of how NAMVs will move in the income year of the sale. Further, the nearer the disposal of the livestock is to 31 January, the more its market value is likely to be reflected in year-end NAMVs rather than in the previous year’s NAMVs. Similarly, where the sale is early in the income year, the more its market value is likely to be reflected in the previous year’s NAMVs. 5.11 Thus, while there is an argument to remove the “sale cease farming election” completely, if the disposal is early enough in the year, it seems reasonable to suggest that the opening NAMVs be used – that is, for there to be no herd scheme adjustment. This would reduce tax volatility. 5.12 We suggest that, where the disposal is on or before, say, 31 July of a year (and presuming the “vendor” has a balance date for this income year in the calendar year that is before this date), that it be compulsory for the vendor to 19 use the opening NAMVs without adjustment in the year of disposal. Otherwise the opening herd scheme adjustment should be compulsory. 5.13 However, the associated person’s sale rule suggested below overrides this. Sales to associated persons 5.14 As illustrated above, particular problems arise with transfers to associated persons, whether by way of ceasing farming and the sale of all livestock or as a result of the death of a farmer. Further, where there is any arrangement for the vendor to permanently and significantly reduce their livestock numbers by way of a sale, or a series of sales, to an associated person, similar problems can arise depending on the timing of the transaction and how market values actually move. 5.15 In this context “associated persons” means individuals within two degrees of association, spouses (including civil union and de facto) and the family’s trusts, and companies, whether owned by the trusts or by the family directly. 5.16 It is suggested that in respect of herd scheme livestock sold, or deemed to be sold, to associated persons: • the vendor must do the opening herd scheme adjustment (even if they sell all their livestock); and • the purchaser must value those livestock in the herd scheme at year-end if the vendor would have had to use the herd scheme for those livestock. 5.17 The purchaser would be able to use the AVO to the extent they have also acquired livestock that are not herd scheme livestock, or that they already owned livestock not valued in the herd scheme. For this to work properly, the vendor’s base herd scheme numbers for the year would, as necessary, be attributed to the purchaser. 5.18 The practical effect of this is to retain unchanged the herd scheme tax treatment when herd scheme livestock are sold to an associated purchaser. This has the effect of buttressing, for the family farming enterprise in all its potential combinations and entities, either of the two suggested reforms – a longer notice period, or the irrevocable nature of the herd scheme election. This is illustrated in Example 8 \[gain/(loss)\]. Example 8: Complete sale Year Valuation election Opening stock Closing stock Tax account Capital account 2008 Herd 473,640818,580Nil 344,940 2009 Herd 818,580489,240Nil(329,340) 2010 Herd 489,240521,220Nil 31,980 20 5.19 Note that this example presents the tax outcome of livestock valuation over both the vendor and the purchaser and ignores the actual sale and purchase of the livestock (which again can be ignored under a “one economic entity” policy approach). The only consequence of the quantum of the sale price is where any taxable income positive or negative) will arise – the higher the price the more the purchaser will derive a tax loss, but the vendor will derive equivalent taxable income. 5.20 The result contrasts significantly with the outcome illustrated in Example 7. 5.21 If the purchaser already has dairy cattle valued in say, the NSC scheme, so long as at year-end the purchaser uses the vendor’s base herd-scheme numbers, the original cattle can continue to be valued in the NSC scheme under the AVO. This is illustrated in Example 9.

In particular, where there is a complete inter-generational change in the farming organisation as a result of an associated persons’ transaction, is there any need for this associated persons rule? This would potentially be on the basis that the vendor would have to totally cease to derive any income from the farming enterprise (except for interest on any loan to the purchaser) and could not be a current or potential beneficiary of any trust involved directly or indirectly in the farming enterprise. Officials welcome any submissions on this issue.

The issue 1.3 A good example of a mixed-use asset is a holiday home which is used by both the owner and the owner’s family for private use, and also rented out. Other assets such as yachts and aircraft can also be used in this way. 1.4 Under the current income tax rules, if the inward cash flows derived from a mixed-use asset are assessable income, the owner can claim deductions for expenditure that was incurred in deriving that income. However, the owner cannot claim a deduction when the expenditure is private in nature. These statutory rules are general and can be difficult to apply to mixed-use assets, in particular when it is not clear whether the expenditure relates to either income-earning use or private use of the asset. 1.5 Expenditure relating to these kinds of assets falls into three categories: • Expenditure which relates only to the income-earning use of the asset, such as advertising expenditure. This expenditure is clearly deductible. • Expenditure which relates only to the private use of the asset, such as repairs to damage caused by private users. This expenditure is clearly not deductible. • Expenditure which relates to the time when the asset is not used. An example would be storage fees for a yacht when it is out of the water. It is not clear whether this expenditure is attributable to either the income-earning use or the private use of the asset. Some expenditure, such as interest, is incurred throughout the year and will fall into all three categories. 1.6 This paper is concerned with the uncertainty that arises around the deductibility of the last category of expenditure described above. 2 1.7 In 2009 Inland Revenue issued Guidelines on deductibility of expenditure relating to holiday homes. These guidelines are Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the law, but like all guidelines, they have limitations. Guidelines can only offer general advice to owners, and do not have the certainty that specific statutory provisions provide. 1.8 It is not clear whether the correct result is achieved in all circumstances under current law and guidelines. In some instances, owners are claiming deductions which appear to be disproportionate to the income-earning use of assets. An important aspect of our tax system is that it is fair. In this context, owners should only be able to claim deductions when those deductions truly relate to the earning of assessable income. 1.9 This paper outlines two alternative approaches for a set of statutory rules that prescribe and moderate tax deductions for mixed-use assets. Suggestions 1.10 The suggested new rules categorise mixed-use assets into different groups based on the underlying use of the asset, and prescribe the level of deductions that owners in each group can claim. Two possible alternative approaches are suggested: • The first uses a single test to identify whether an owner of an asset has an income-earning focus. If the test is passed, the owner would be able to claim all deductions except for expenditure that is directly attributable to actual private use. If the test is failed, the owner will only be able to claim expenditure attributable to actual income-earning use. • The second approach includes the income-focused outcome described above, and also an outcome where the owner is only able to claim expenditure attributable to actual income-earning use. However, it also recognises a third, “middle” category of mixed-use asset, where the asset is used to earn significant income, but also to provide a reasonable level of private use. Expenditure relating to assets in this category is apportioned between deductible and non-deductible. 1.11 The key difference with the second approach is that deductions for expenditure that cannot be easily identified as relating either to private or income-earning use (because it relates to days when the asset is not used) are apportioned based on the level of income-earning and private use. 3 Summary of suggested changes • The suggested changes moderate deductions which can be claimed in relation to mixed-use assets, primarily those deductions which relate to the time the asset is not being used. Assets will be divided into either two or three categories, depending on how they are used, which will determine the entitlement to claim deductions. (See Chapter 3.) • Various tests will set out whether asset owners will be entitled to deductions for all expenditure which relates to periods the asset is not being used, part of that expenditure, or none of it. The tests will consider matters such as: - whether the asset was used for income-earning purposes for 62 days in the income year; - whether the proportion of private use in relation to the income-earning use was less than a given threshold; and - whether the asset was actively marketed. (See Chapters 3 and 4.) • The suggested changes will apply only to: - assets which are used for both income-earning purposes and privately rented out on a short-term basis and which are unused for at least two months in every 12; - land and other assets with a cost of $50,000 or more; (See Chapter 5.) - assets ultimately controlled by a small number of individuals – that is, assets owned by individuals, partnerships, some trusts, close companies, qualifying companies and look-through companies. (See Chapter 6.) • For GST purposes, similar proposals will apply to assets held by GST-registered persons. (See Chapter 7.) Key points for submissions 1.12 Specific issues for comment are set out at the end of each chapter. 1.13 Submissions are also invited more generally on the changes proposed in this paper, such as: • Would a simple approach, which has an unavoidable degree of arbitrariness be better than a more complex approach where asset owners’ circumstances and their tax treatment are more closely matched? 4 • Would the criteria outlined for the various tests detailed in this paper be the best way to identify categories of asset owners? • Is the proposed tax treatment of asset owners in each category appropriate? • Would the suggested changes create unwarranted compliance costs and to what degree? Next steps 1.14 Once the consultation period has closed, officials will report to Government, with any legislative changes likely to be introduced to parliament in 2012.

The various elements are discussed below. Due to the uncertainty in this area a “case for change” is presented. Statutory provisions 2.2 Apart from subpart DE of the Income Tax Act 2007, which sets out the rules for motor vehicles there are no specific statutory rules governing deductibility of expenditure relating to mixed-use assets. 1 For all other mixed-use assets, the approach used to determine deductions can only be extrapolated from general statutory rules and case-law. 2.3 The following two statutory rules set out the fundamental requirements for expenditure to be deductible: 2 • section DA 1: A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss (including an amount of depreciation) to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is incurred in deriving their income (both assessable and excluded income) or incurred in the course of carrying on a business for deriving such income; and • section DA 2(2): A person is denied a deduction to the extent to which the expenditure is of a private or domestic nature. 2.4 Broadly, a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving assessable income or in the course of carrying on a business. However, that person is unable to claim a deduction for expenditure that is private in nature. In addition, the rules contain the phrase “to the extent”. This phrase contemplates that an item of expenditure may be apportioned between the amount that is attributable to income-earning use and the amount attributable to private use. 2.5 These statutory provisions can be difficult to apply to mixed-use assets, since a mixed-use asset has both income-earning and private use elements. Determining what expenditure is attributable to income-earning use, or carrying on a business (deductible expenditure) as opposed to the private use of the asset (non-deductible expenditure) can be difficult when expenditure relates to periods when the asset is not being used. 1 These rules are briefly discussed in Chapter 5, “Assets subject to the new proposals”. 2 Income Tax Act 2007. 6 Example A holiday home is used by the owners for five weeks per year and is also rented out for five weeks per year. The owner has incurred expenditure that directly relates to the actual private use of the home, the actual rental use of the home, and expenditure that relates to the 42 weeks of the year when the home was not in use. There is no concern about the owner claiming deductions for expenditure which relates to the five weeks per year the home is rented. It is equally clear that no deductions can be claimed for the five weeks per year when the home is used by the owner. The issue is to what extent the owner should be able to claim deductions which relate to the 42 weeks per year the house is empty. Case-law 2.6 The leading case on mixed-use assets is CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236. In this case the taxpayer used a room in his house for income-earning purposes for a certain number of hours per week for a certain number of weeks of the year. The Court of Appeal was asked to consider whether a deduction could be claimed for any proportion of a private home used for income-earning purposes, and held that a deduction could be claimed. However, the Court of Appeal noted that determining an appropriate apportionment calculation was difficult. The Court accepted an apportionment method which provided a deduction for some expenditure relating to periods of non-use. 2.7 In Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271, the taxpayer paid amounts to an employee to obtain the employee’s resignation and for a restrictive covenant. The question for the Court of Appeal was whether the expenditure should properly be treated as deductible or on capital account. The Court made some interesting comments about deductions in relation to mixed-use assets: The circumstances of the particular case will usually determine what is the most apt way of deciding how much of the expenditure is attributable to the deductible item. For example, where an asset, such as a house or car, is used for both business and private purposes, the apportionment of total expenses must be fairly based on the use (and some cases availability for use) for business purposes and private purposes respectively. Even so, it is impossible to prescribe any precise formula applicable to all cases. Each such case depends on its own circumstances. It is the yardstick of factual use, or availability for use for business purposes, that satisfies the requirement that the apportionment must be fair not arbitrary, and must be done as a matter of fact. 2.8 “Factual use” criteria underlie both Inland Revenue’s interpretation and suggestions for a new approach in this area, discussed in subsequent chapters. 7 2.9 The court later made the following more general comment about apportionment: The more difficult class of case is where each advantage is intangible and does not lend itself to measurement against any conventional yardstick. It then becomes a matter of deciding whether there is any, and if so sufficient, evidence to justify a conclusion that some particular part of the total expenditure is actually attributable to a deductible item, or at least a minimum fractional share of the total expenditure can be realised as so attributable. If there is insufficient evidence to arrive at a conclusion, any answer must be mere speculation and the taxpayer will have failed to discharge the onus of proof upon him. 2.10 This statement is clear authority for a restrictive approach to be taken to allowing deductions relating to expenditure incurred during periods when mixed-use assets are not actually being used. Inland Revenue’s guidance 2.11 As noted above, the owners of mixed-use assets other than motor vehicles must apply general law to determine the deductibility of their expenditure. One way to bridge the gap between general provisions and situations which give rise to interpretative difficulty is by way of guidance published by Inland Revenue. While this guidance is not binding on taxpayers or Inland Revenue, it can provide a greater level of certainty than would otherwise exist. Taxpayers typically apply these statements to their situation with a reasonable level of confidence if their circumstances are close to the circumstances described in the guidance. 2.12 In 2009, Inland Revenue released a Questions we’ve been asked (QWBA) entitled “Holiday houses – income tax treatment”. It gives guidance to owners of holiday homes on deductions they could claim, and specifically whether they could claim deductions for non-use periods (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 21, No 3, May 2009). (See also www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/questions/questions-general/qwba- 0902-holiday-houses.html.) 2.13 The QWBA indicated that if the holiday house was advertised as genuinely available for use in the empty periods the owner could, in certain circumstances, claim deductions for expenses incurred in these periods. However, when a holiday home was essentially available only to the owner, and the owner’s family and friends, and available to rent to third parties on a limited basis, no deduction could be claimed for the period the home was not rented. 8 2.14 The QWBA indicated that additional evidence would be required before an owner could claim expenditure for non-use periods: Evidence of a holiday house being available for rent generally needs to be more than a mere statement of its availability, sporadic or limited advertising, or advertising that is of a nature that is unlikely to attract many customers. There must be evidence of active and regular marketing of the holiday house at market rates and of the availability of the holiday house at times and for periods that demonstrate the holiday house is earning rental income or is genuinely available to earn rental income. If a holiday house is available for only limited and/or undesirable periods and/or at non-competitive rates, such factors tend to indicate that the expenditure is not incurred in deriving assessable income. 2.15 Examples were provided to demonstrate the application of the current rules: • A holiday home earns significant rental income and is actively marketed, but used by the owners for two weeks over Christmas and New Year. The owners can claim deductions for the entire year with the exception of the two weeks the property is used. • A holiday home is used privately for most of the year and rented for two weeks per year. The owners can claim deductions only for the period the holiday home is actually rented out. The case for change 2.16 As discussed, the statutory tests apply to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving income or in carrying on a business, and deny a deduction for expenditure which is private in nature. However, the application of these statutory rules to expenditure that relates to the time the asset is unused is uncertain. The fundamental difficulty with this type of expenditure is that it could be argued that both sections DA 1 and DA 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to it. 2.17 CIR v Banks and other cases arguably provide support that a deduction for such expenditure is allowable on an apportionment basis, but do not provide detailed rules on how any apportionment is to be applied. 2.18 While Inland Revenue’s QWBA guidance is a logical approach to resolving the application of legislative uncertainty in this area, there are some limitations: • The guidance applies only to holiday homes, and does not cover other assets which might be both used privately and rented out, such as yachts. • The examples given are necessarily limited and cannot cover all situations. 9 • As with all guidance, only general advice can be provided and taxpayers are free to argue that it does not apply to them. Increasing deductions claimed 2.19 While it has always been possible to rent out these kinds of assets, the practice has increased in recent years for a number of reasons – including: • Dedicated internet sites for holiday homes make it easier to rent out holiday homes by providing renters with detailed information about properties on offer. • A number of yacht charter businesses which market through the internet have been established where private yacht owners can list their yacht. The yacht charter business advertises the boats and arranges for them to be chartered, returning some of the charter fee to the yacht owner. The need for fairness and certainty 2.20 The discussion set out in this chapter illustrates some of the difficulties arising from the current tax deductibility rules for mixed-use assets. 2.21 This situation gives rise to less-than-ideal outcomes in terms of fairness, certainty and economic efficiency, all of which are important elements of a good tax system. 2.22 The remaining chapters of this paper explore options for a new legislative approach to determining the eligibility of owners of mixed-use assets for deductions, with the objective of making the rules fairer, more certain and more economically efficient. 10 CHAPTER 3 Framework for the allocation of expenditure between uses 3.1 The suggested new rules categorise mixed-use assets into different groups based on the underlying use of the asset, and prescribe the level of deductions that owners in each group can claim. This chapter considers two alternative frameworks for the proposed changes, namely, the three-outcome approach and the two-outcome approach. 3.2 The two approaches are explained and evaluated below. The details of the tests which make up each approach are discussed in the next chapter. Three-outcome approach 3.3 The three-outcome approach uses two tests to distinguish between three groups of mixed-use asset. The rules prescribe different levels of deductions that owners in each group are able to claim. 3.4 The following outlines each group and the level of deductions each group is able to claim: • The private-focused group: The combination of effort and success at earning income is low. In this case, the owner is only able to claim expenditure which relates to the actual income-earning use of the asset, and no deduction can be claimed for expenditure that relates to the time the asset is not used. • The genuine mixed-use group: The effort and success in earning income is reasonably high, but there is a greater level of private use than the income-focused group. In this case, the owner is able to claim expenditure which relates to the actual income-earning use of the asset, and a proportion of expenditure that relates to the time the asset is not used can be claimed. • The income-focused group: The effort and success in earning income is reasonably high, and private use is limited. In this case, the owner is able to claim expenditure which relates to the actual income-earning use of the asset, and all the expenditure that relates to the time the asset is not used can be claimed.. 3.5 The genuine mixed-use group is able claim a proportion of expenditure that relates to the time the asset is not used under a general apportionment rule. The apportionment rule would use the following formula: 11 Example Jill uses her holiday home herself for five weeks a year and rents it for five weeks a year. Expenditure relating to the 42 weeks of the year that the holiday home is unused (unused time expenditure) is deductible at a rate of 50% calculated as five weeks income-earning use divided by 10 weeks of total use. Two-outcome approach 3.6 The three-outcome approach can be simplified by removing the genuine mixed-use group under which the apportionment calculation is carried out. This creates the two-outcome approach. This would leave only the private- focused group, under which unused time is not deductible at all, and the income-focused group, under which all expenditure associated with unused time is deductible. 3.7 All mixed-use assets would be categorised as follows: • For those who actively market their asset and have a reasonably low level of private use, deductions would be available for all unused time expenditure. • For all others, no deductions would be available for unused time expenditure as the asset has a private-focused outcome. Comparison between the two approaches 3.8 An important difference between the three-outcome model and the two- outcome model is that the test to qualify for the income-focused group would be easier to pass under the two-outcome model. This difference is necessary because the consequence of not falling into the income-focused group in the two-outcome model is denial of all deductions which relate to the time the asset is unused. This can be compared with the three-outcome model which provides apportionment as an outcome for those who combine significant income-earning activity with some private use. 12 3.9 This difference is explained in the following diagram: 3.10 The number of people for whom the income-focused outcome would apply is deliberately larger under the two-outcome approach than under the three- outcome approach. This means those who have a significant income-earning focus but some private use of their asset are likely to prefer the two-outcome approach. 3.11 The reverse is true for those who have an income-earning focus but a larger amount of private use. They are likely to be able to claim a deduction for a proportion of their unused time under the three-outcome approach (where the genuine mixed-use outcome will apply), but no deduction under the two- outcome approach (where the private-focused outcome will apply). 3.12 What these two differences show is that neither the two-outcome nor the three-outcome approach is, overall, more generous than the other. Those who have either a strong income-earning focus or a strong private use focus will receive the same treatment under either proposal, and those in the middle may prefer one or the other depending on exactly where they fall. 3.13 The three-outcome approach presents a reasonably sophisticated solution that aims to match asset owners’ individual circumstances with some degree of precision. Compared with the two-outcome approach, there are fewer grounds for arguing that its treatment of asset owners is unfair. However, these advantages must be weighed against the disadvantage of the additional complexity. The three-outcome approach has two tests, rather than the single test of the two-outcome approach. It also includes the apportionment formula, which delivers apportionment percentages specific to each asset owner’s circumstances, but which in itself is a reasonably complex tool. 13 3.14 By contrast, the two-outcome approach is relatively simple. Only one test need be applied, and the result is that asset owners fall into one of two categories. However, this simplicity results in some degree of arbitrariness. An asset owner at the margin can easily switch from being entitled to deductions for all unused time expenditure, to being entitled to no deductions for any of it, which is a dramatic difference. Submission point Each of the approaches set out above has advantages and disadvantages, and at this stage officials have no strong preference for one over the other. Accordingly, submissions are invited on whether, at a framework level, the two-outcome or three- outcome approach is preferred. Leaving aside the detail of the tests, do you prefer the three-outcome or the two-outcome framework? Why? 14 CHAPTER 4 Tests 4.1 Two possible alternative approaches have been suggested – the two-outcome approach, or the three-outcome approach. The outcome of the test(s) will determine the amount of deduction owners can claim. A range of outcomes are possible under either approach, ranging from all expenditure being deductible (other than purely private expenditure) to only expenditure that relates to actual income-earning use being deductible. 4.2 This chapter evaluates the possible contents of the test(s) that determine the amount of deductions asset owners may be able to claim. The test(s) could comprise a number of different elements, from an evaluation of the owner’s subjective intentions, to objective requirements based on the actual use of the asset and the behaviour of the owner. Possible test elements 4.3 The test(s) should correctly distinguish between and identify each category of mixed-use asset, and prescribe the correct outcome with a considerable degree of certainty, and without being overly burdensome for owners to comply with. 4.4 The test(s) could contain subjective and/or objective elements. Subjective elements attempt to ascertain the intention of the owner in relation to the asset, and objective elements look at the factual circumstances surrounding the use of the asset. An evaluation of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each element is necessary before a test can be constructed. 4.5 A wide variety of elements are possible, and any combination of these elements can make up the final test or tests. Some suggested elements include: • whether the owner had the dominant purpose of earning income from the asset; • the common-law business test; • whether the asset was actively and regularly marketed as available for use at market rates; • whether actual income-earning use or actual private use falls below or above a given threshold; • whether private use was merely incidental or necessary to the income-earning use; • whether private use of the asset conflicted with the income-earning use of the asset; and • whether the incoming receipts exceeded the expenditure. 15 4.6 The following is an analysis of the possible elements of the proposed tests. Whether the owner had the dominant purpose of earning assessable income from the asset 4.7 This is a subjective element that would require the owner to declare his or her intention in holding the asset. If the owner has this purpose, the owner could be given a higher amount of deductions. 4.8 The advantages of this element are: • It may reveal the owner’s intentions in holding the asset. This is an efficient way of getting to an equitable outcome. • It may deal appropriately with difficult situations when the asset cannot be rented out because of circumstances such as an adverse natural event. Objective tests based on actual use often fail to accommodate such circumstances. • It is likely to be relatively easy for an owner to comply with, as the owner should know his or her own intention. 4.9 However, a purely subjective test relies heavily on the owner’s honesty, and that the owner will not falsify his or her intention in order to qualify for an outcome that allows higher deductions. This makes such rules difficult to administer and creates uncertainty for owners as they can be unsure about whether Inland Revenue will accept their stated intention. 4.10 Another issue that arises with this element is the period it would be measured over. Owners can develop intentions regarding the use of the asset on acquisition, each year, or intentions can change during the course of a year. The common-law business test 4.11 The common-law business test contains both a subjective test and a number of useful objective tests that determine whether an income-earning activity equates to “a business”. If an owner passes the business test he or she is likely to be income-focussed and should qualify for a higher amount of deductions. The common-law business test contains the following elements: • what the nature of the activity was; • whether the asset was actively marketed; • the amount of time, money and effort the person put into the activity; • the income earned from the activity; • whether the person runs the activity in a similar way to most businesses in the same trade; and • whether the dominant purpose of carrying out the activities is to make a profit. 16 4.12 The advantage of the common-law business test is that the test is already developed and available for application to the mixed-use asset rules. Furthermore, use of this test for mixed-use assets would align the treatment of mixed-use assets with other tax areas, so bringing the benefits of consistency. The common-law business test also evolves over time ensuring the test is always relevant. 4.13 However, there are some disadvantages associated with the business test. Firstly, it may be difficult to apply to some mixed-use assets. For instance, the rental activities of a single holiday home may never amount to “a business”. The business test is also a reasonably sophisticated and complex test to apply, requiring a number of different elements to be considered and weighed up. Consequently, the potential application of the business test could be a considerable compliance burden for owners, and is open to challenge by Inland Revenue. This is likely to create uncertainty over the level of deductions owners are able to claim. Genuine efforts to earn income evidenced by active and regular marketing of the asset at market prices 4.14 This element would require the owner of a mixed-use asset to actively and regularly advertise the asset at a market rent, including all periods of non-use for which the asset can reasonably be used. This element attempts to determine whether the asset was genuinely available for income-earning use, and if passed the owner should be entitled to a higher level of deductions.. 4.15 In general, periods during which the asset was not in use, and not actively and regularly marketed, would be a strong indication that the asset was not genuinely available for income-earning use. Furthermore, if the asset were advertised at an unreasonably high price in those non-use periods, thereby making it unlikely that anyone would rent the asset, the asset is also arguably not genuinely available for income-earning use during those periods. 4.16 An advantage of this approach is that it is a reasonably accurate way of identifying whether the asset really was available for income-earning use during periods of non-use. A further advantage is that satisfaction of this element is relatively easy to demonstrate. 4.17 However, this element also gives rise to a number of complexities including: • What constitutes “active and regular marketing”? For example, would advertising a holiday home on a website be enough to satisfy the test? • What constitutes a market rent? • Advertising on its own may not necessarily be a good indication that the asset was genuinely available for use over non-use periods. For example, the owner may choose not to respond to rental enquiries for periods that the owner would like to use the asset privately. 17 • During what periods should the owner be required to advertise the asset? At certain times it may not be practical to use an asset for income-earning purposes, for instance when repairs and maintenance are carried out, or during times of very low demand. At a minimum the asset should be advertised in periods that demonstrate a genuine income-earning purpose. For example, a ski chalet should be advertised as available for use in the ski season. Actual income-earning use or actual private use is below or above a given threshold 4.18 This objective element is known as a “bright-line” test. A bright-line test is a clearly defined rule or standard. In this context the owner of a mixed-use asset is prescribed an outcome depending upon whether the actual use of the asset is above or below a given threshold. Similar bright-line tests are used in the United Kingdom and the United States. Examples include: • when actual income-earning use exceeds a certain number of days; • when actual private use is less than a certain number of days; or • when actual private use is less than a given percentage of actual income-earning use. 4.19 If one or more tests are satisfied, the owner could qualify for a higher amount of deductions. The primary advantages of bright-line tests are that they are reasonably simple to understand and comply with, and give owners some certainty over the level of deductions they are likely to be able to claim. 4.20 On the other hand, a bright-line test has dramatic marginal effects. An owner could face starkly different outcomes depending on whether their asset use was above or below the threshold. For example, if the bright-line test was set at 62 days of income-earning use, an owner who had 63 days of actual income-earning use would pass the test and qualify for a higher level of deductions. An owner who only achieved 61 days of actual income-earning use would fail the test and would receive significantly lower levels of deductions. This may be perceived as unfair, as only two days of income-earning use separate the two owners, yet they would receive completely different tax outcomes. 4.21 A bright-line test based on actual income-earning use also assumes that all mixed-use assets would achieve the income-earning threshold if the owner put in a reasonable amount of effort to rent out the asset. This could be an unreasonable assumption. For example, if the bright-line test were set at 93 days of income-earning use, the owner of a ski chalet used predominantly in the winter ski season may genuinely want to earn income from the ski chalet, but is unable to achieve 93 days rental due to a poor ski season that year. This may be perceived as an unfair outcome. 4.22 In practice, different mixed-use assets have different income-earning potential, and therefore a single bright-line test may not be suitable for every asset. However, the application of different bright-line tests for different assets would be complex and would result in difficult boundary issues. 18 4.23 Lastly, a bright-line test based on private use could be difficult to enforce. Receipts derived from income-earning use could easily be used to provide proof of that income-earning use. However, evidence proving the existence of private use is more difficult to obtain. Consequently, there would be some risk that owners would understate their private use of the asset in order to qualify for a more generous tax outcome. Private use was merely incidental or necessary to the income-earning use 4.24 This element would attempt to limit private use to those days the private use was incidental to or necessary to the income-earning use. An objective test of this nature is similar to a bright-line test, based on private use. In order for an owner to qualify for generous deductions, the private use of the asset is restricted to a minimum. 4.25 An example of private use that is merely incidental or necessary to the income-earning use would be when the owner stays in his or her holiday house for a couple of days carrying out repairs and maintenance to enhance the income-earning potential of the house. 4.26 A private use restriction along these lines would clearly limit private use substantially. Consequently, the same incentives exist as with a bright-line test for owners to understate their private use of the asset, or to treat all private use as incidental or necessary to the income-earning use. Private use of this nature is arguably not private use at all. There are also definitional problems associated with this test, such as the ambiguity surrounding the term “incidental use”. Private use of the asset did not conflict with income-earning use 4.27 This element would limit deductions for those owners whose private use of the asset conflicted with income-earning use. 4.28 This element attempts to discover the intention of the owner in holding the asset. If the private use of the asset conflicted heavily with, or took precedence over, the income-earning use, then this is a strong indication that the owner’s purpose in holding the asset is predominantly private rather than income-earning. 4.29 This element would require an analysis of the times the asset was used for private purposes, and whether that private use is likely to have conflicted with income-earning use. Example John owns a summer holiday home. The most popular and profitable time to rent out the home is over Christmas and New Year and John receives many offers to rent the home over this period. However, John does not accept these offers, as he wishes to reserve this time for his family and friends to enjoy. 19 4.30 This is an example where private use of the house clearly conflicts with the income-earning use. If this element was to form part of the test John would not be able to claim a higher level of deductions 4.31 In practice, determining what periods are the significant income-earning times may be difficult for some assets, as there may be uncertainty over when peak times start and finish. However, some basic generalisations can be made – for example, the ski season is the peak time for a ski chalet and the summer months are the peak time for beach-front holiday homes. 4.32 Furthermore, this element could create some uncertainty over when private use of the asset would conflict with income-earning use. An example would be when a holiday home has not been booked for income-earning use for a week over summer and the owners decide to use the house for their private enjoyment. However, after arriving at the house the owner is contacted requesting a booking for that week. If the owner denies the new booking and carries on with the private use of the house, would this be seen as private use conflicting with income-earning use? To cover this situation, this element may have to contain the concept of “reasonable notice”. Whether the receipts derived from the asset exceed the expenditure 4.33 This element looks at the receipts derived from a mixed-use asset and whether they exceed out-going expenditure. If receipts are larger than the expenditure, this may indicate that the owner had an income-earning focus and therefore the owner could be allowed to claim a higher amount of deductions. 4.34 The advantage of this element is that it is simple to apply because the owner would only need to calculate whether the income raised from the asset exceeded the expenditure associated with it. The owner is already required to gather this information for income tax purposes. 4.35 The main disadvantage of this element is that different results may arise for similar or even identical assets, depending on decisions made by owners about matters such as funding or maintenance costs. For example, an owner who borrowed heavily in order to purchase a holiday house is less likely to have income exceeding expenditure compared with a lower-leveraged holiday house owner, because of the high interest costs. Furthermore, owners may be able to structure their funding between mixed-use assets and other assets they hold to ensure that income exceeds expenditure by the smallest possible amount, to maximise their claim for deductions. 4.36 Finally, this objective element does not accommodate situations when the asset is unable to achieve its full income-earning potential. This might happen if, in a particular year, expenditure on an asset exceeded the incoming receipts because it was taken off the market to undergo repairs and maintenance (which would both reduce the scope for earning income and increase expenditure). 20 The proposed test(s) 4.37 From the various elements above, a test or tests can be constructed that distinguish between the different possible outcomes discussed in Chapter 3, and prescribe an appropriate level of deductions. No one element would fully achieve this objective as the elements have particular advantages and disadvantages. Consequently, a combination of different elements is proposed. Two-outcome approach 4.38 The two-outcome approach uses a single test that identifies whether an owner is income-focused and able to claim all deductions except for expenditure that is attributable to actual private use. An income-focused owner is likely to be an owner whose dominant purpose is to rent out the asset, and private use of the asset is minimal. If the owner fails the test, the owner will only be able to claim expenditure that is attributable to actual income-earning use (this is referred to as a private-focused outcome). 4.39 The proposed test comprises three of the elements discussed previously. The basis for including each element is discussed below. The proposed test, which would apply to each income year, is described in the following diagram: Two-outcome approach Income-earning use bright-line element 4.40 The test contains two bright-line elements. The first of these requires that the asset be used for actual income-earning use for 62 days or more in a year. The 62 days of income-earning use is an attempt to approximate the average income-earning potential of a range of mixed-use assets in New Zealand, for an owner was genuinely serious about earning income from that asset and made genuine efforts to that effect. For example, if an owner of a summer holiday home went to a reasonable amount of effort, and the property was genuinely attractive as a summer holiday home, it is reasonable to assume that the property could be rented for at least 62 days over the summer period. Single test • The asset is used for actual income-earning for 62 days or more in the income year; and • Actual personal use is less than 15% of income-earning use; and • There are genuine efforts to earn income for all non-use periods for which the asset can be reasonably used, evidenced by marketing (at market rates) for those periods and positive responses to enquiries. Private-focused outcome Only expenditure associated with actual income-earning use is deductible. Income-focused outcome All deductions for expenditure are allowed, except expenditure associated with actual private use. Yes No 21 4.41 In the context of satisfying the income-earning threshold, a day of actual income-earning use is any day the asset is used by a third party and market rates are paid. 4.42 Generally, officials consider that prescribing a reasonably significant income-earning threshold is justified given the high level of deductions an asset owner receives if they pass the test. Submissions are welcome on whether 62 days is an appropriate threshold. It should be noted, however, that the various elements in the proposed approaches should be viewed as a package. Therefore, any changes to particular elements may warrant related changes to other elements or the addition of another element. Private use bright-line element 4.43 The second bright-line test requires that personal use is less than 15 percent of income-earning use. This threshold has been set relatively low to appropriately target the income-focused group. That is, if the owner’s dominant purpose is to rent out the asset, it is reasonable to expect that the private use of the asset will represent a low proportion of actual use. Furthermore, given the high level of deductions that owners can receive if they fall within the income-focused outcome, it is reasonable to limit private use to a low proportion of income-earning use. 4.44 In the context of satisfying the private use threshold, a day of actual private use is any day a mixed-use asset is used or is reserved for use by the owner or an associated person of the owner. This is a necessary requirement in order to prevent owners from understating their private use of the asset in order to gain higher deductions. 4.45 An issue that requires further consideration is how the use of the asset by associated persons in return for market rent should be treated. For example, an owner rents her holiday home to her brother at market rates over the summer holidays. A reasonable argument can be made for treating this period of rental as income-earning use and not private use. That is, the owner will be taxed on the rental income in the same way as if she had rented the home to a non-associated third party, and the owner is not obviously receiving a private benefit from renting the home to her brother. On the other hand, there are examples where it would be clearly inappropriate to count the period an asset is rented to an associate as income- earning days. For example, a husband rents his holiday home to his wife for market rent. 4.46 This is a difficult area and submissions are welcome on an approach that reflects these concerns but is still able to be applied with a reasonable degree of certainty. Active and regular marketing 4.47 The final element of the test is that the owner must have gone to genuine efforts to earn income for all non-use periods for which the asset can be reasonably used. This should be evidenced by marketing for those periods and a positive engagement with enquiries. This element is essential 22 as an owner is unlikely to have the dominant purpose of earning income from an asset if the owner did not advertise the asset. 4.48 The term “reasonable” has been used in this element as an acknowledgment that it is unreasonable to require owners to advertise the asset in all non-use periods, as in certain circumstances the asset may not practically be able to be used for income-earning purposes. For example, it would not be reasonable for an owner to seek to rent out a yacht for a period when the yacht has been taken out of the water for de-fouling. Three-outcome approach 4.49 The three-outcome approach requires two tests. The first test identifies assets where the focus is on private use, and the second test distinguishes between assets where the focus is on earning income and those which are genuine mixed-use assets. The proposed two tests are as follows: Three-outcome approach Test 1 • The asset is used for actual income-earning for 62 days or more in a year; and • Genuine efforts to earn income for all non-use periods for which the asset can be reasonably used, evidenced by marketing at market rates for those periods and positive responses to enquiries. Test 2 Actual private use is less than 10% of income-earning use. Mixed-use outcome • Actual income-earning expenditure is deductible. • Actual private expenditure is not deductible. • A deduction for remaining expenditure is given under the apportionment rule. Income-focused outcome All deductions for expenditure are allowed, except for actual private expenditure. Private-focused outcome Only expenditure that relates to actual income-earning use is deductible. Yes Yes No No 23 Test 1 4.50 Test 1 contains two elements. The first is a bright-line element, setting a minimum level of income-earning use at 62 days in a year. The second element requires that the owner make genuine efforts to earn income for all non-use periods for which the asset can be reasonably used, evidenced by marketing for those periods and positive responses to enquiries. If the owner does not satisfy either element, the private-focused outcome will apply. 4.51 These elements are also features of the two-outcome approach and, the same advantages and disadvantages apply. In addition, the definition of an actual income-earning use day would be the same. Test 2 4.52 If the use of the asset successfully meets the first test, the owner is required to apply the second test. The second test determines whether the income-focused or mixed-use outcome should apply. This test contains one bright-line element that limits private use to less than 10 percent of income-earning use. If the asset passes this test (and also passes all the elements in test 1) the asset will be subject to the income-focused outcome. If this test is failed the asset is treated as a genuine mixed-use asset and expenditure for non-use periods is apportioned (the apportionment formula is explained in Chapter 3). 4.53 The second test is intentionally a difficult test to satisfy. This test should capture only those assets used predominantly for income-earning purposes and therefore attracting the highest amount of deductions. However, it is acknowledged that many income-focused assets may still have a small amount of private use – often associated with the income-earning use. Consequently test 2 allows a small amount of private use. Proposed test(s) summary 4.54 The primary objective of the three-outcome approach is similar to the two- outcome approach – namely, simplicity and certainty. However, the three- outcome approach recognises that some assets may be used for genuine mixed-use purposes and therefore their owners should be able to apportion the expenditure incurred that relates to periods the asset is not used. Application of proposals – The Johnston family example 4.55 The Johnston family owns a holiday home in the Coromandel. In the 2013 tax year the family actively marketed the house at market rates in newspapers and on internet sites. The house was rented out for 95 days in that year. The Johnston family also used the holiday home themselves for fourteen days over seven weekends during the year. 24 4.56 The Johnston family incurred a total of $10,000 of expenses in that year. These expenses can be split into three amounts: • $2,500 – directly attributable to the income-earning use of the house. • $500 – directly attributable to the family’s private use of the house. • $7,000 – attributable to the time when the house was empty. 4.57 The total amount of expenses that the Johnston family will be able to claim will depend upon whether the two-outcome or the three-outcome model is applied. Two-outcome approach 4.58 Under the two-outcome approach, the family will satisfy the test, as outlined in the following table: Elements of the test Pass or fail The asset is used for actual income- earning use for more than 62 days in the income year. Pass – the asset was used for actual income-earning for 95 days in the year. Actual personal use is less than 15% of income-earning use. Pass – the asset was used for private purposes for fourteen days in the year (private use was 14.74% of income-earning use). There are genuine efforts to earn income for all non-use periods for which the asset can be reasonably used, evidenced by marketing (at market rates) for those periods and positive responses to enquiries. Pass – the family actively marketed the asset. 4.59 Since the family satisfies all the elements in the test, the family is able to claim both the $2,500 of expenses that was directly attributable to the income-earning use of the house, and the $7,000 of expenses that was attributable to the time when the house was empty – totalling $9,500 of allowable deductions. 4.60 However, if the family had chosen to use the holiday home for another weekend, raising their private use to sixteen days, the family would not satisfy the test (private use would be 16.84% of income-earning use). In this situation, the family would only be able to claim the $2,500 of expenses that was directly attributable to the income-earning use of the house. 25 Three-outcome approach 4.61 Under the three-outcome approach the family will satisfy the first test and fail the second test, as outlined in the table below: Elements of the two tests Pass or fail Test 1 The asset is used for actual income- earning use for more than 62 days in the income year. Pass – the asset was used for actual income-earning for 95 days in a year. There are genuine efforts to earn income for all non-use periods for which the asset can be reasonably used, evidenced by marketing (at market rates) for those periods and positive responses to enquiries. Pass – the family actively marketed the asset. Test 2 Actual private use is less than 10% of income-earning use. Fail – the asset was used for private purpose for fourteen days in a year (private use was 14.74% of income-earning use). 4.62 Since the family satisfies the first test and fails the second test, the family will be able to claim the $2,500 of expenses that was directly attributable to the income-earning use of the house, and apportion the $7,000 of expenses attributable to the time when the house was empty using the apportionment formula: 4.63 Under the formula, the family is able to claim $6,101 of the total expenses attributable to the time when the house was empty. Therefore, the family is able to claim $2,500 of direct expenses plus $6,101 of apportioned expenses equalling total allowable deductions of $8,601. 26 Submission points • Are there any more useful and relevant elements within the tests that should be considered? • Do the suggested tests represent a significant compliance burden? • Do the suggested tests produce equitable outcomes? • Is the 62-day income-earning use threshold achievable for the majority of mixed-use assets? • Is a single bright-line threshold based on the average income-earning potential of a number of different mixed-use asset (62 days), supported by other elements, preferable to a number of different bright-line thresholds for different types of mixed-use asset, without any supporting elements? • Bright-line tests based on income-earning and private use are relatively simple to apply and offer certainty. However, they can lead to arbitrary results. Would a more complex test that accommodates extenuating circumstance be a better approach and, if so, what should the test(s) look like? • How should the use of the asset by an associated person in return for market rent be treated – private use or income-related use? • Overall, which approach is preferred? 27 CHAPTER 5 Assets subject to the suggested new rules 5.1 This chapter evaluates a number of alternative approaches to legislatively prescribing the group of assets to which the proposed new rules should apply. Typical mixed-use assets 5.2 The most common type of asset used for both income-earning and private purposes is the holiday home. 5.3 The expression “holiday home” is used here to mean residential property which is occupied on a short-term basis by people who are on holiday or on a weekend break or for any other reason. Holiday homes are also typically not occupied for a part of the year. The use of many holiday homes will be seasonal. Holiday homes that are near a beach or some other location where the focus is on warm-weather activity will typically be used much more in summer than in winter months, whereas other holiday homes may be located near a ski field and so predominantly used in winter months. Other properties may see year-round use, such as those located in city centres, or near places which provide activities that are less weather-dependent, such as vineyards. City-centre apartments may be rented by people travelling on business, as well as those on holiday. 5.4 The renting out of holiday homes when they are not being used by the owners has been facilitated in recent years by the advent of internet sites where people can list their holiday home. At present, there are around 15,000 privately held holiday homes advertised on the eight leading New Zealand websites. This development has been accompanied by an increase in the number of professional managers who deal with the “on-site” tasks required to facilitate renting holiday homes for absent owners. Other assets 5.5 Holiday homes will represent the majority of assets used both privately and for income-earning purposes. However, there are other assets that are also used in this way. 5.6 A number of businesses advertise management of yacht charters, providing a similar service to private yacht owners to that which property managers provide to owners of holiday homes. These yacht charter businesses advertise and organise charters of yachts which are privately owned, and pay a proportion of the charter fee to the owners of the yachts. 5.7 Some light aircraft will also be used privately and rented out, and there will inevitably be instances of other assets used in this way. 28 Defining what assets the rules will apply to 5.8 While holiday homes represent the majority of mixed-use assets (at least by value), the core provisions of the Income Tax Act deny deductions for private use for all kinds of assets, not just holiday homes. 5.9 Efficiency and fairness issues also arise. To avoid distortion of investment and spending decisions, the tax system should, where it is possible and pragmatic, provide the same treatment for all types of mixed-use assets, rather than different treatments for different kinds of mixed-use assets. 5.10 The question therefore arises as to which assets the proposals in this paper should apply. There are a number of different options, which are discussed below. Option 1 – list of assets 5.11 One possible approach would be a schedule of assets, which would list assets by type, such as holiday homes, boats, aircraft and any other assets that it is appropriate for these rules to apply to. To ensure certainty was achieved, this list would probably need to be in a form with a clear legal status. This could be achieved by including the list in the legislation, a regulation, or perhaps a determination issued by Inland Revenue. 5.12 A list would reduce some compliance costs, as only taxpayers who owned an asset which appeared on the list would need to consider the new rules. It would also allow the new rules to be deployed on a targeted basis – they could readily be made to apply only to those kinds of assets where it is considered that their application was warranted. A targeted approach is appropriate where complex rules are created, because the compliance cost of complex rules should only be incurred when justified by the revenue collected or the need to create an efficient or equitable outcome. 5.13 However, such a list would give rise to several problems: • Inequitable results. People who owned assets that were not on the list would receive a different treatment from assets that were on the list. • Compliance costs and uncertainty arising from boundary issues. For example, if “holiday homes” were on the list, would the rules apply to a houseboat, an empty beachfront section or a caravan in a commercially run campground? • The need to update the list when new assets to which the rules ought to apply are identified. Constantly updating a list adds complexity for Inland Revenue and asset owners, particularly for the latter as updates would inevitably result in different application dates for different assets. • Applying the rules only to selected assets conflicts with the important “broad base, low rate” principle which guides policy decisions throughout the tax system. That principle discourages having different rules for different kinds of assets or activities when the underlying economic substance of the activity is the same. 29 • Owners of all kinds of assets need to apply some kind of apportionment rules to determine their entitlement to deductions under the Income Tax Act’s core provisions. This occurs regardless of whether the asset appears on a list. Consequently, it is not clear that a significant compliance cost saving is achieved by omitting some assets from these proposals. 5.14 Officials do not consider that the proposed rules are so complex that it would be necessary to limit their application to only a restricted group of asset owners. It is acknowledged however, that there is a difference in complexity between the two-outcome and three-outcome model. Option 2 – a minimum-value threshold 5.15 Under a minimum-value threshold approach, all assets would be included in the rules if their value (or perhaps their cost) exceeded the specified amount. 5.16 The advantage of a threshold is that it allows a trade-off to be made between the compliance cost of applying the rules and the correct tax outcome. A threshold would also enable “high value” assets to be targeted without the range of potential inequities and complexity that specifying individual asset types would result in. Low-value assets such as computers, where the deduction at issue might be a few hundred dollars of depreciation, could easily be excluded. 5.17 However, a threshold rule can be complex in application and can give rise to problems. These might include: • The decision to use cost or market value as the base. Market value is the most equitable, but has a compliance cost implication for assets other than real property for which the local authority rating value could be used. Cost is simple, but can lead to inequitable results between two owners of similar assets where one acquired the asset recently and the other has held it for a very long time. • Whether tax depreciation, or some other progressive fall in value over time, should be recognised. • If cost is used, how improvements to the asset should be factored in. Option 3 – no limit to application 5.18 There are strong arguments, around equity and the obligation on all taxpayers to calculate deductions using robust methodology, for applying the new rules to all types of assets regardless of their value. 5.19 However, some compliance cost concerns remain. If the new rules were to apply to assets regardless of value, a person who owned a computer could end up being required to record their days of income-earning and private use for the purposes of apportioning a depreciation deduction of a few hundred dollars. 30 5.20 One way of managing compliance costs in this instance might be to apply the following rules: • allowing expenditure which relates solely to income-earning (such as the installation of software below the value required to be capitalised and used solely for income-earning purposes) to be deductible in full; • continuing to deny a deduction for expenditure which relates solely to private purposes (such as game software); and • allowing the taxpayer to claim the appropriate proportion of mixed-use expenditure (such as annual depreciation) only if he or she applied the new apportionment rules. If the taxpayer chose not to apply the apportionment rules, no deduction for mixed-use expenditure could be claimed. 5.21 While this approach forces people to make the trade-off between incurring compliance costs and losing their tax deduction, it is relatively harsh. Option 4 – conceptual definition of assets 5.22 This approach would provide a conceptual definition of the assets to which the new rules would apply. Assets would be identified that are the most likely to give rise to outcomes under current law which are arguably unfair. The following criteria could be used: • The asset is rented on a short-term basis only. This would target the key assets which give rise to concerns, such as holiday homes, yachts and aircraft. This would leave out assets where the current law in this area is working reasonably well, such as long-term residential rentals. In the case of residential property, the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 does not apply to temporary or transient accommodation such as hotels and motels ordinarily provided for periods of less than 28 days at a time. This concept may be a useful way of excluding some assets from the suggested new rules. • The asset is unused for a specified minimum proportion of the year. As noted in earlier chapters, difficult deduction questions only arise for expenditure which is not readily attributable to (or able to be apportioned between) income earning use and actual private use. If a person owns an asset which is actually used for all (or almost all) of the time, no difficult questions of allocation of expenditure arise, so there is no need for the new rules to apply. • The asset is actually used privately. Analysis and suggested approach 5.23 While a list of assets has some attraction, it may be considered too arbitrary. A threshold has some merits, but if used on its own would invariably be complex. Applying the proposed new rules to all assets is conceptually 31 attractive. However, we think the required record-keeping obligations may not be justifiable for low-value assets. 5.24 Officials’ recommendation is that the conceptual definition of assets be used. It enables the assets where significant deductions are at issue, primarily holiday homes, to be targeted. It will also encompass other mixed-use assets without the need to maintain a list, and so avoid the inequities and compliance costs that would result from not all assets being on the list. 5.25 The first element of the conceptual definition is that the asset is rented on a short-term basis. The Residential Tenancies Act concepts are referred to above in the context of holiday homes. For boats, rental on a daily basis may be the appropriate measure, and for aircraft, perhaps hourly. 5.26 The second element of the conceptual definition is that the asset is unused for a reasonable proportion of the year. Officials suggest that a total of two months non-use in any 12-month period ending in the tax year is a reasonable threshold (although submissions are invited on this point). Where assets’ non-use periods fall below two months, owners could have the option of applying the new rules. 5.27 It is suggested that the conceptual test be bolstered with a minimum-value threshold test for assets other than land, notwithstanding officials’ concerns about such a test. While compliance costs of the new rules are not expected to be significant, a simple threshold test would ensure that the rules were not applied at a level if the revenue at stake or the distortionary effect is insignificant. 5.28 To ensure that the threshold test did not become unduly complex, the rules could be based on the cost of the asset used for tax depreciation. This would provide a mechanism for recognising improvements to the asset because they are required to be added to the cost price for tax depreciation purposes. However, a taxpayer whose asset fell below the threshold would be free to apply the rules. A taxpayer whose asset fell below the threshold and who chose not to apply the rules would not be denied a deduction, but would need to make a case under general law. 5.29 Excluding land from the threshold test would mean that it would not need to be considered by the owners of holiday homes. Excluding land also avoids some of the difficulties which arise mostly with land, such as low acquisition costs being significantly different from market value due to the asset having been acquired some time ago and then appreciating in value. 5.30 Officials propose a threshold of $50,000, comprising the cost of the asset plus any improvements required to be added for tax depreciation purposes. The $50,000 threshold should not be reduced by tax depreciation. Asset owners who fell below the threshold could apply the rules on a “safe harbour” basis. Submissions are invited on these proposals. 32 Exclusions from the proposed rules 5.31 Consistency across the tax system is important, but should not be pursued at all costs. Accordingly, when there are existing rules in place which deal adequately with assets used for both private and income-earning purposes, we propose that these rules should remain in place and the new rules should not apply. The following areas are already dealt with by their own set of rules: • Motor vehicle logbook rules. These apply to the motor-vehicle expenses of a sole trader, the partners of a partnership and the shareholders of a look-through company when a motor vehicle is used both privately and to earn income. 3 • The established practice around the use of part of a home for earning income. Both of these sets of rules and practices set out very similar concepts for apportionment of expenditure. 5.32 The motor-vehicle logbook rules allow a deduction for motor vehicle expenses which is the proportion calculated by dividing business mileage by total mileage. Most motor vehicles will not meet the test set out above of not being used for an aggregate of two months in any year. However, to ensure compliance, it would be necessary to monitor use. Officials do not think such monitoring is warranted, so would suggest that motor vehicles be expressly excluded from the proposed mixed-use asset rules. 5.33 The home-use expenses rule is an Inland Revenue-accepted practice derived from CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236. Accepted forms of calculation include both a calculation which divides the total area of the home by the area of the space used for income-earning purposes, and a calculation apportioning expenditure by the number of days the home is used for income-earning purposes in a year. 5.34 Both the motor-vehicle logbook rules and the home-use expenses rules apply the same methodology proposed for the genuine mixed-use asset outcome discussed in Chapter 4. 5.35 Comparable assets used by shareholders or shareholder/employees that are subject to fringe benefit tax, or treated as giving rise to a taxable distribution, or income, are dealt with in Chapter 6. 3 Subpart DE of the Income Tax Act 2007. 33 Submission points • Is the conceptual method the best way to define the assets to which the new rules should apply? • Do you agree with the proposal to have a non-use threshold as part of the conceptual method? Is two months of non-use in the income year right level? • Do you agree with the proposal to have a threshold as a supplement to the conceptual method? Is $50,000 the right level? Do you agree with the proposal to calculate it using cost plus any improvements required to be capitalised? • Do you agree with the proposal to leave existing rules in place for assets such as motor vehicles and use of part of the home for earning income? Are there any other areas where existing rules deal with private use that the proposals should not apply to? 34 CHAPTER 6 Entities subject to the suggested new rules 6.1 For simplicity, previous sections of this paper have described assets in individual ownership. However, if the new rules were to apply to one kind of entity and not another, some asset owners might be incentivised to move their assets into entities where the new rules do not apply. 6.2 Assets held in entities purely for tax reasons rather than commercial reasons create additional costs in setting up and running those entities, reduce the revenue collected, and create unfair differences between those who use tax- advantaged entities and those who do not. 6.3 Entities used to hold mixed-use assets are likely to be those which are simple and straightforward to set up and operate, and are able to be easily controlled by one individual, or a small group of connected individuals – typically members of the same family. 6.4 The following entities and structures are considered in this chapter: • partnerships • trusts • companies. 6.5 The proposals set out in this chapter rely heavily on the “associated persons” rules to define when an asset is being used for private purposes (as does the core rule when the asset is owned by an individual). 6.6 The associated persons rules provide an efficient and ready-made tool to identify relationships, typically between the owner of an asset and the person who uses the asset, which are very likely to mean that the use of the asset is for private, rather than income-earning reasons. Further information and examples of the associated persons test can be found in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin at www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2009/2009-34/2009-34-taxation- act-2009/2009-34-associated-persons/ Partnerships (including limited partnerships) 6.7 A partnership is simply more than one individual or other entity carrying on a business together with a view to a profit (with different roles allocated to some of the partners in a limited partnership). Partnerships are easy to set up and are controlled by the general partners, so are the kind of structure which might be used to hold a mixed-use asset. 35 Current tax law 6.8 A partnership is not a taxable entity. As a general rule, partners record their share of the partnership’s income and expenditure in their own tax returns. The requirement for the expenditure to relate to income earning or a business (nexus test) and the private limitation will apply to each partner separately. 6.9 When an asset is used by Partner A, the private use limitation is not considered to apply to deny a deduction for Partner B, but the nexus test will not be satisfied so Partner B will not be entitled to a deduction for expenditure relating to that private use anyway. Overall, however, the same fundamental issue arises here as it does for individuals – uncertainty over the ability to claim deductions for assets which remain unused for some portion of the year. Suggested approach 6.10 It is suggested that the new rules apply to assets owned by partnerships. Private use will exist when the asset is used by any partner. Consistent with the treatment of property owned by individuals, the associated persons test in section YB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should apply to extend the concept of private use where the asset is used by someone associated with a partner. 6.11 If a threshold test is to be used to determine which assets are subject to the proposals, the threshold should be applied to the aggregate of all partners’ interests, to avoid creating a situation where the rules can be avoided by holding an asset in a partnership of family members. Trusts 6.12 A trust is a legal relationship where a trustee has ownership of assets, but is subject to legal obligations in favour of others. In a formally constituted trust, these obligations are set out in a trust deed, which typically either names individual beneficiaries (for example, John and Jane Jones) or describes them by class (for example, the children and grandchildren of Arthur Jones). Current tax law 6.13 Under the current rules, the trustee can claim a deduction for amounts incurred in deriving taxable income. 6.14 In the context of a holiday home, deductions are available for expenditure incurred in renting the holiday home to third parties. If the holiday home is made available to beneficiaries, the nexus test applies to deny any deductions unless those beneficiaries were to pay for the use of the holiday home (and the trustee treated those amounts as income of the trust). 36 Suggested approach 6.15 One approach would be to apply the rules to all kinds of trusts. Whether the rules would in fact impact on a trust would then depend on whether the trust had assets which satisfied the asset test (described in Chapter 5). 6.16 Alternatively, the scope of the rules could be limited to entities which are the usual type of “family trusts”, as this is a common ownership structure for holiday homes in particular, and the kind of structure which existing holiday homes can readily be moved into. 6.17 Where the trustees of a trust are a “tax charity” as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007, they will generally not be entitled to claim deductions under the existing law, so the proposals in this paper will not affect them. However, to avoid any confusion it may be worthwhile to expressly state that any new rules do not apply to this kind of trust. 6.18 Other trusts could also be excluded, such as: • trusts for the benefit of a local authority; • funeral trusts; • trust that are widely held, such as some registered superannuation funds; and • trusts where the settlor and the members of the settlor’s family are not entitled to benefit. 6.19 For the remaining trusts, private use should exist if the asset is used by any beneficiary, or settlor (defined in section HC 27), or any person associated with a beneficiary or settlor under section YB 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Companies 6.20 A number of issues need to be considered in the context of companies. 6.21 Unlike the other entities, existing rules already apply to companies to deal with the issue of company assets used by shareholders or shareholder employees. This kind of use is the equivalent of the “private use” concept discussed elsewhere in this paper. Detailed rules govern whether this use by shareholders and others should be treated as an in-kind dividend, a fringe benefit or as income of the recipient of the benefit. Which kinds of companies should the mixed-use asset proposals apply to? 6.22 Not all companies meet the characteristic of a suitable entity to hold a mixed- use asset namely, being easy to set up and control by a single individual or a small group of connected individuals. This criterion will only be satisfied by smaller companies with a small number of shareholders, most of whom are connected. There are three existing types of companies in the Income Tax Act 2007 that are likely to have the characteristics described above. These are: 37 • look-through companies; • close companies; and • qualifying companies. 6.23 Detailed tests define each of these types of companies, but each can be very broadly summarised as requiring ownership or control by no more than five individuals. The detailed tests typically treat people with close family relationships as a single shareholder, so the number of nominal owners may exceed five. 6.24 Officials consider that, to the extent the new proposals are to apply to companies, they should only apply to companies which fall within one of the three definitions outlined above. These are existing, robustly designed and well-understood concepts which are designed to identify companies which, broadly, are controlled by a small number of individuals. Officials consider that using these existing concepts is preferable to creating a new definition of a company that should be subject to the proposed mixed-use asset rules. 6.25 This means that, for companies which fall outside these definitions, the suggested mixed-use asset rules will not apply and existing rules for deductions will continue to apply when assets belonging to the company are used by shareholders or their associates. Look-through companies 6.26 Because look-through companies have entirely different tax characteristics from other companies, the analysis can be simplified by dealing with them separately. 6.27 The look-through company (LTC) rules started applying from 1 April 2011. Broadly, an LTC is a company with five or fewer ultimate natural-person owners who all elect that the company should be subject to the LTC rules. A company which has LTC status is tax-transparent from the point of view of the company’s and the shareholders’ income tax position, so the company’s income, expenses, gains and losses are passed on to its shareholders and the company itself is not a taxable entity. 6.28 This means that the tax consequences of transactions involving an LTC are significantly different from that of other companies. For example: • The company does not pay tax itself, but each shareholder pays a share of the tax which arises on the profits. • The dividend rules do not apply. • Section DA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which allows a deduction only when expenditure is incurred in earning income or in carrying on a business will not allow a deduction for expenditure incurred in providing a benefit to shareholders – such as the use of a mixed-use 38 asset. This is the same approach which is taken to partnerships, and is not reliant on the private limitation. Suggested approach 6.29 Shareholders of an LTC face the same question as partners in a partnership face in relation to mixed-use assets, which is the extent to which expenditure relating to non-use periods is deductible. 6.30 The approach suggested for partnerships earlier is to treat private use as any use of the asset by a partner or an associated person of a partner. In the context of an LTC, the equivalent is to treat private use as use by a shareholder or any person associated with a shareholder. Officials recommend that this approach be taken to LTCs, and note that because of the completely different tax rules that apply to LTCs compared with other companies, this suggestion is independent from the approach to companies discussed below. Exclusion for motor vehicles held by companies from the mixed-use asset rules 6.31 The main type of asset owned by companies which is used for both income- earning and private purposes is motor vehicles. In the company context, the use by a shareholder of a motor vehicle will be subject to either the FBT or the dividend rules. Officials consider this outcome appropriate and do not propose to apply the new rules to motor vehicles owned by companies. 6.32 Exclusion of motor vehicles from the mixed-use asset rules for companies is consistent from an outcome perspective to their exclusion for other entities (where the motor vehicle logbook rules are suggested to remain in place). Reconciliation of mixed-use asset rules with existing rules for taxing shareholder use of company assets 6.33 In the sections above, it has been suggested that if the proposed mixed-use asset rules are to apply to companies, they only apply to the defined smaller companies, not larger companies, and that they not apply to motor vehicles. Specific suggested rules will apply for LTCs. 6.34 The remaining complexity is how the proposed mixed-use asset rules should be reconciled with the existing rules which tax the use of company assets by shareholders and their associates. Dividend rules 6.35 If a company asset is used by a shareholder, the market value of that use is treated as a dividend. The amount of the dividend is reduced by any amount paid by the person receiving it. The purpose of these rules is to ensure that shareholders of companies cannot step around the rules which apply to cash dividends by taking value out of the company in a non-cash form. They recognise that any transfer of value from the company to its shareholders should attract the same tax consequences, regardless of the form that transfer of value takes. 39 6.36 The dividend rules require the shareholder to treat the value received as income, and the gross value of the use of the asset will be taxed at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. The company is obliged to pay withholding tax. The company is denied a deduction for the expenditure incurred in providing the dividend. FBT rules 6.37 If the asset is used by a person who is a shareholder/employee, the company can elect to treat the use of the asset as a fringe benefit. Rather than treating the fringe benefit received by the employee as income, a fringe benefit tax (FBT) liability is imposed on the company. The rate of FBT payable by the company is designed to result in the similar amount of tax being paid as if the company had paid the employee a cash amount of an equivalent value. Income rules 6.38 Under current law, accommodation provided in relation to employment or an “office” such as a directorship is treated as income to the recipient, and is not a fringe benefit. Analysis of existing rules 6.39 While each of these sets of rules acts to create a tax charge for the use of assets by a shareholder or associate, they will give rise to a different tax consequence from the suggested mixed-use asset rules. This is for two reasons: • Expenditure incurred in providing a benefit which is subject to income tax or FBT is generally considered to be deductible. If expenditure is incurred in providing a dividend, a deduction will not ordinarily be available for that expenditure (although it may be available if an amount is paid for use of the asset). Provided the asset is used in the business or to produce income, as well as being used by shareholders, a company is likely to treat expenditure relating to the period the asset is not used as deductible. This contrasts with the suggested mixed-use asset rules where the income-focused or genuine mixed-use outcome will limit deductions for periods of non-use. • Each of the three rules levies a tax liability on the recipient of the benefit, or in the case of FBT, levies a tax liability on the company which is equivalent to the amount of income tax the shareholder would pay on an equivalent amount of cash. This contrasts with the approach under the suggested mixed-use asset rules, as the person who uses the asset is not taxed on the value of the benefit received but is denied a deduction for expenditure relating to the private use. Options for dealing with mixed-use assets in companies 6.40 There are potentially three ways to fit the suggested mixed-use asset rules in with the existing rules which apply to companies. 40 Not applying the suggested mixed-use asset rules to assets held by companies at all 6.41 The rationale for adopting this approach would be that the existing mechanisms already deal with the use of company assets by shareholders and associates, so there is no problem here which needs to be addressed. This approach is the simplest, and the most conservative from the point of view of leaving existing legislative mechanisms as they stand. 6.42 However, the tax consequences under the existing rules will be different from the tax consequences under the mixed-use asset suggestions. This might encourage some asset owners to move their assets into different entities, defeating the fairness objectives of the reforms proposed in this issues paper. Require companies to calculate deductions in accordance with the mixed-use asset rules, but leave the existing dividend, FBT and income rules in place 6.43 Adopting this approach would require companies to apply the proposed new deduction rules to mixed-use assets. These will be situations when the dividend, FBT and income tax rules apply. 6.44 This approach applies the same limitation of deduction rules to companies as those which apply to other entities. Consequently, there is no incentive, from the point of view of maximising deductions, to shift assets from other ownership structures into companies, and at this level the outcome is “fair”. 6.45 However, the key difference is that the standard company rules (dividend, FBT and income tax rules) create a tax liability for the shareholder who receives the benefit of the use of the asset. (In the context of FBT, the liability arises in the company but is a proxy for the income tax liability the recipient of the benefit would otherwise bear.) This seems like a less attractive outcome to asset owners than that available under one of the other entities, where the deduction rules are the same but the benefit of the use of the asset is not taxed. 6.46 However, limiting the deduction and taxing the benefit is consistent with the scheme of shareholder and company taxation generally. If a company pays a cash dividend to a shareholder, it cannot claim a deduction for the cash paid, and the shareholder is liable for tax on the dividend received, although this conceptual double taxation may be relieved by imputation. Applying the mixed-use asset rules to determine deductibility where the benefit is treated as a dividend is entirely consistent with the treatment of other dividends. 6.47 Where the company has imputation credits which it can allocate to the shareholder, the additional tax charge borne by the shareholder will be limited to the difference between the company rate of 28% and (typically) the top individual rate of 33%. However, if the company does not have sufficient imputation credits, or the 5 percent difference is considered material, this approach gives rise to a greater overall tax liability than other types of entities, where the same deduction limitations will apply but no tax liability will arise for the person using the asset. In these instances this 41 difference will encourage people who control companies which hold mixed- use assets in companies to move those assets out of companies and into other forms of ownership. Require companies to calculate deductions in accordance with the mixed-use asset rules, and exempt the receipt of any such benefit by a shareholder or associate from the dividend, FBT and income rules 6.48 If this approach were to be adopted, a modified version of the mixed-use asset rules would apply to companies, potentially limiting the deductions available. However, the use of the asset would no longer be income, a dividend, or a fringe benefit to the shareholder or associate – those rules would be “turned off” in instances where the mixed-use asset rules apply. 6.49 No additional tax liability would arise to the shareholder for receipt of the benefit, just as no tax liability arises (now, or under the proposals in this paper) where a person who owns a mixed-use asset directly uses it for their own benefit. The only tax impact would be the potential limitation of deductions. 6.50 However, “switching off” the key elements in the rules which deal with the distribution of value from companies delivers an outcome which is inconsistent with the taxation of companies generally. While concerns are unlikely to arise with the main category of mixed-use assets of holiday homes, clear boundary rules would be needed to ensure that companies could not use these rules to, for example, avoid paying FBT on assets such as yacht. Analysis and suggested approach 6.51 The first approach, of leaving companies out of the rules altogether, would mean that companies will generally be entitled to greater levels of deduction than other entities. This means the fairness objectives of these rules are not achieved. 6.52 The third approach, of applying the new deduction rules to companies and “switching off” the dividend, FBT and income rules appears to align with other entities under the mixed-use asset rules, but creates an outcome which is at odds with the general treatment of distributions or other transfers of value out of companies. It is an attempt to provide non-company treatment to a company structure. A better approach for those who wish to hold assets in a company, but to be taxed as if they held them personally, is to use the look-through company structure. The look-through company rules are an existing policy framework designed to deliver exactly that hybrid between the corporate rules of a company and the tax treatment of individual (or partnership) ownership. 6.53 Officials prefer the second approach, of leaving the dividend, FBT and income rules in place but applying the new suggested mixed use asset rules to calculate deductions While this would initially appear to give rise to “double taxation” of the benefit on the use of the fixed asset, it is akin to when a cash dividend is paid. As noted above, if the company has 42 imputation credits available, it can distribute those to the shareholder, and if distributed at the 28% tax rate, will mean that the additional tax liability borne by the shareholder is small and the incentive to move assets out of a company structure and into another entity is also small. 6.54 Earlier in this chapter it is noted that the dividend, fringe benefit and income rules can apply to different benefits. Different tax treatments may be preferred by different companies and shareholders, depending on matters like the availability of imputation credits in the company and the value to the company of the increased deductions which are available if an FBT or income tax treatment is applied. 6.55 Officials at this stage do not suggest any change to the rules which currently apply to determine which of these tax treatments is required to be used. Submissions are invited on this issue. Companies – other matters 6.56 Current tax laws allow companies to deduct interest which they incur essentially regardless of the purpose of the borrowing. This provision may need to be overridden by mixed-use asset rules which act to limit deductions. 6.57 A deduction is allowed for the interest cost incurred by those who borrow to purchase shares in a company. If the mixed-use asset rules were to apply to limit deductions within a company for the interest incurred in borrowing to purchase a mixed-use asset, an alternative structure might be for the shareholder to borrow the required funds, and use those funds to purchase the shares in the company. The company would have enough money to purchase the asset without any interest deduction. The shareholder would be entitled to a deduction for the interest incurred in borrowing money to purchase the shares in the company. 6.58 To ensure the mixed-use asset rules were not avoided in this way, a look- through rule would need to be implemented to limit an interest deduction claimed by someone who purchases equity or debt in a company which held a mixed-use asset, or when any company in a group of companies owned a mixed-use asset. This could be in a similar form to the existing rule which limits interest deductions for shareholders of qualifying companies who receive non-cash dividends. 43 Submission points • Do you agree that, in order to ensure equitable outcomes, the proposed mixed-use asset rules need to apply to entities other than individuals? • Are there any issues with the general use of the associated person’s rules to determine when private use occurs? Are there any instances where this might be too wide a net? • Do you agree with the recommended approach to mixed-use assets held by companies, which is to apply the rules which limit deductions but leave the dividend, FBT and income rules in place? • Are there any circumstances when one of the dividend, FBT or income rules are not available for a benefit from use of a mixed-use asset, but should be? • Do you think that there will be some movement of mixed-use assets out of companies and into other entities if these proposals are implemented? 44 CHAPTER 7 GST treatment of “available for use” periods 7.1 Tax cascades arise when a supplier of goods or services cannot recover the GST paid on the acquisition of goods or services. To prevent tax cascades the GST system provides a person with the ability to recover GST paid in respect of a supply when they acquire goods or services for business purposes or, in GST terms, “for making taxable supplies”. This ensures that the economic incidence of the tax is removed on most business purchases, and that GST taxes consumption and not production. 7.2 New GST apportionment rules were introduced on 1 April 2011. Under these rules, when a GST-registered person incurs an expense that was subject to GST, the person is able to deduct input tax on acquisition only to the extent to which goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. 4 In subsequent years, a person may be required to adjust the deduction claimed if the extent to which the asset is actually used for making taxable supplies is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. A number of exemptions are available to relieve a person from the requirement to make an adjustment if the amount of tax involved in the adjustment is minimal. 7.3 GST is imposed at a set rate on the value of a supply. The amount of GST involved in a supply therefore increases proportionally to the value of the supply. For high-value assets such as real property, it is particularly important to ensure that rules that regulate the ability to deduct input tax are clear in respect of the proportion of input tax that may be deducted. 7.4 Although for the most part such clarity exists, closer scrutiny is required when a mixed-use asset remains unused for a particular period. The GST issues for mixed-use assets are similar to those that arise for income tax which are discussed in the preceding chapters. Application of the GST rules 7.5 To register for GST, either voluntarily under the $60,000 registration threshold or compulsorily over the threshold, a person has to carry on a taxable activity. A taxable activity is defined in the GST Act as an activity carried out continuously or regularly and that involves supplying, or intending to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration but not necessarily for profit. Whether a person is carrying on a taxable activity is a question of fact and degree in each case and will involve an examination of all circumstances. 4 Some second-hand goods are not subject to GST on sale, but may still be treated as having GST imbedded in the purchase price. “Second-hand goods deduction” will be available in respect of those goods. 45 7.6 It is generally accepted that the requirement for a taxable activity to exist does not provide a high barrier to GST registration, thus allowing many taxpayers with a fairly small level of taxable activity to register for GST voluntarily. One benefit of this, and the related ability to deduct input tax, is that small businesses are able to grow and become more competitive. On the other hand, in mixed-use asset situations it is important to ensure that the level of input tax deductions is an appropriate reflection of the relative taxable and non-taxable use of the asset. The issues 7.7 The apportionment rules allow a person to claim input tax deductions to the extent that the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. 7.8 In most cases, goods or services are actively used for either a taxable or non- taxable purpose or a combination of those purposes. In those cases, identification of the extent of taxable use of those goods or services can be based on the taxpayer’s records of the asset’s use for making taxable supplies. 7.9 In some cases, the goods or services may be available for use in, rather than being actively used for, making taxable supplies. For example, a commercial property developer may purchase raw materials that they intend to use in construction of a property at some time in the future. Although for a period of time the raw materials are not actively used for making taxable supplies, the property developer is still able to claim the related input tax deductions because the materials are “available for use” in making taxable supplies and will be actively used for that purpose at some time in the future. 7.10 In other situations, however, it may be difficult to determine the extent of taxable use of goods or services. For example, during a year, a holiday house may be used by its owners as a holiday residence for three months, be rented out 5 for five months, and be advertised for rent, but remain vacant, for the remaining four months. If the owner is registered for GST and the rental activity is subject to GST, a question arises over what extent the owner should be able to claim input tax deductions in respect of the house. Although there has clearly been taxable use for the five months when the property was actually rented out, it is uncertain whether the use in the period when the property was vacant should count towards the taxable use for deduction purposes. 7.11 The principal uncertainty stems from the fact that although the holiday house is available for use in making taxable supplies during the vacant period (because it is advertised as being available for rent), it is similarly available for use for private purposes during the same period. 5 Following the narrowing of the definition of “dwelling”, effective from 1 April 2011, a supply of accommodation in a holiday house would normally be treated as subject to GST. 46 7.12 Neither current nor previous GST legislation has provided express guidance regarding the methodology that should be used for apportioning between taxable use and non-taxable use in these situations. One may argue that the availability of assets for use in making taxable supplies should take precedence and that input tax deductions should therefore be allowed in full for vacant periods. This is, however, difficult to justify as a default rule considering that private use can be the dominant reason for buying a holiday house. Instead, officials consider that the decision as to whether non-use of a holiday house should be treated as taxable use should be based on the dominant use of the asset during a relevant adjustment period. 6 7.13 Officials view this methodology would produce a balanced outcome and provide a degree of protection to the revenue base. Certainty in the methodology used is desirable to enable taxpayers to comply with the legislation, to reduce their compliance costs in doing so, and to ensure consistent application of the apportionment rules across taxpayers. Assets subject to clarification 7.14 Chapter 5 discusses, in relation to the income tax rules, the types of assets used for mixed business and private purposes that should be covered by the new methodology. The introduction of a conceptual definition that would target assets where significant income tax deductions are an issue – such as holiday houses, boats and aircraft – has been recommended. To be covered by the proposed methodology, an asset must satisfy the following elements: • the asset is rented on a short-term basis; and • the asset is unused for a reasonable proportion of the year; and • for assets other than land the cost is above a minimum threshold (possibly $50,000). 7.15 It has also been suggested that the current rules in relation to logbooks for motor vehicles and established practice around the use of the part of a home for earning income would continue to apply. 7.16 The GST apportionment rules, as mentioned earlier, allow input tax deductions for goods and services that are not used for, but are available for use in, making taxable supplies. This treatment of non-use periods recognises that most goods or services are purchased by a GST-registered person for business reasons and will, at some point, be used for making taxable supplies. In these circumstances, the presence of an incidental private use may not unduly affect the deduction of input tax for the period of non-use. 6 Under the GST apportionment rules, an “adjustment period” is a period at the end of which a person must evaluate their taxable use of goods or services to ensure that a correct amount of input tax has been deducted. An adjustment period is generally a period of one year. 47 7.17 Some assets, however, have an inherently significant private element for which the application of the ordinary apportionment principles might not provide an appropriate outcome. Three key examples of such assets are holiday houses, private boats and aircraft. These assets are usually purchased by their owners with the intention of using them for private purposes and any commercial rental/hiring activity, at least in some cases, results from a desire to recoup some of the purchase price paid in relation to the asset rather than an intention to run a commercial operation. 7.18 These assets – holiday houses, boats and aircraft – account for the majority of assets that fall under the conceptual definition recommended for income tax purposes. To provide consistency between the taxes, one approach would be to adopt the conceptual definition for the purposes of GST. 7.19 The advantage of the conceptual definition approach is that it ensures that the same methodology is used for all assets that satisfy the relevant tests. The disadvantage of the approach is that it may be difficult to state with certainty which types of assets would be included under the definition. As a result, it may include some assets for which the methodology is not appropriate. 7.20 An alternative approach would be to apply the new methodology to holiday houses, boats and aircrafts only. Although this approach would provide taxpayers with certainty over application of the new rules, it may also exclude assets that are conceptually similar to those listed. 7.21 Officials seek views on which of these two approaches is preferable for GST purposes. Possible approach 7.22 In the context of assets such as holiday houses, boats and aircraft, input tax would either be incurred on the purchase of those assets or be embedded in the purchase price if the assets are second-hand goods. 7 7.23 Taking into consideration the proposed income tax approach, in circumstances when an empirical determination of taxable use is not possible, such as when a mixed-use asset is not used in a particular period, it is reasonable to determine a preferred treatment by examining the total use of the asset during a relevant adjustment period. 7.24 A typical situation is where throughout a considerable part of an adjustment period a holiday house is used for making taxable supplies (that is, rented out), while its private use is minimal. In these situations, it seems fair to deem the time when the asset is not used, but available for use in, making taxable supplies as the time when the asset was actually being used for taxable purposes. The assumption is that the taxpayer would indeed have rented out the asset if they could. 7 If a purchase of land is zero under section 11(1)(nb) of the GST Act, a “nominated GST component” used for apportionment purposes (sec 23(3J)), will be 21D(2)(a)). 48 7.25 In a different scenario, an asset may be rarely used for making taxable supplies and much more often used for private purposes. In this scenario, we can conclude that the taxable use is merely incidental to the private use of the asset, and that the period of non-use should be treated in the same manner as a period of private use. 7.26 Finally, there will be situations when an examination of the overall activity of an asset might not provide a definitive answer on which use – taxable or private – has been predominant. In these circumstances, it may be reasonable to allow an apportionment of periods when the asset is not used. Three-outcome approach 7.27 The above outcome would be achieved by adopting for an adjustment period a similar apportionment methodology to that described as the three-outcome approach in chapter 3 and chapter 4. The proposed approach requires a person to answer a number of questions about the use of their asset which are designed to provide an indication about whether the use of the asset, as a whole, is better classified as taxable, private or a mixture of the two. 7.28 The three-outcome approach would assist a GST-registered person to identify the extent of taxable use of those assets, as follows: • Predominant private use: A person’s taxable use of the asset will be limited to the periods when an asset is actually used for making taxable supplies. This would occur when the asset is not rented/hired out for more than 62 days in an adjustment period, and/or the person does not make a genuine effort to rent/hire out the asset during periods when the asset is not actively used (assuming that the asset can reasonably be used in those periods). Example A holiday is rented out for 30 days during a 12-month adjustment period. The house’s taxable use for the adjustment period is 8 percent (30/365) and the owner may apportion the input tax in respect of the house accordingly. • Predominant business use: A person’s taxable use will include periods when the asset is actually used for making taxable supplies and periods when the asset was not used but available for use in making taxable supplies. This would occur when the asset is rented/hired out for more than 62 days in an adjustment period, and the person makes a genuine effort to rent/hire out the asset during periods when the asset is not actively used (assuming that the asset can reasonably be used in those periods), and the actual private use is less than 10 percent of the active taxable use. 49 Example During a 12-month adjustment period, a holiday house is rented out for 120 days, used by the owners for private purposes for five days and advertised for rent for the remaining 240 days. Since the private use of the house is less than 10 percent of the rental use of the house, the person is able to treat the house as being used for taxable purposes for 360 days (120 + 240 days). The person’s actual taxable use of the house during the adjustment period is, therefore, 98 percent (360/365) and the owner may apportion the input tax in respect of the house accordingly. • Mixed-use: A person’s taxable use will include periods when the asset is actually used for making taxable supplies and a proportion of time when the asset is not used, but available for use in making taxable supplies. This would occur when the asset is rented/hired out for more than 62 days in an adjustment period, and the person makes a genuine effort to rent/hire out the asset during periods when the asset is not actively used (assuming that the asset can reasonably be used in those periods), and the actual private use is 10 percent or more of the active taxable use. The proportion of time that may be attributable to the use of an asset for taxable purposes during the time of non-use will be calculated by reference to the apportionment formula: Example During a 12-month adjustment period a holiday house is rented out for 100 days, used by the owners for private purposes for 60 days and advertised for rent for the remaining 205 days. The owner of the house may treat the 100 days that the house was actually rented out as use for making taxable supplies. The owner may also treat a proportion of the period when the house was vacant as use for making taxable supplies. This proportion is calculated using the formula: 205 x 100/(100+60) = 128 Therefore, the owner may treat 128 of 205 vacant days as attributable to making taxable supplies. In total, the house is being used 228 days (100 + 128 days) for taxable purposes during the adjustment period. As a consequence, taxable use of the house in the relevant adjustment period is 62 percent (228/365 days) and the owner may apportion the input tax in respect of the house accordingly. 50 7.29 Owing to the use of these “bright-line” tests, the three-outcome approach should not be too complicated or give rise to undue compliance or administration costs. At the same time, the three-outcome approach does provide for a variety of outcomes for identifying taxable use, therefore increasing the chance that the final outcome is suited to the individual circumstances of a taxpayer. On the other hand, a bright-line test will at the margins create differing outcomes for not dissimilar situations. This is an inevitable outcome of providing this kind of certainty. Two-outcome approach 7.30 The second potential apportionment methodology suggested in Chapter 3 is the two-outcome approach. Depending on whether certain conditions are satisfied, under this approach a taxpayer may be deemed to either have been using or not have been using the asset for taxable purposes during the time of non-use. No apportionment of periods of non-use would be possible under this approach. 7.31 In the GST context, to be able to treat an asset as being used for taxable purposes during periods of non-use, the following conditions would need to be satisfied during an adjustment period under the two-outcome approach: • The asset must be used for actually making taxable supplies (rent/hire) for more than 62 days in an adjustment period. • Actual personal use must be less than 15 percent of active taxable use. • Genuine efforts must be made to make taxable supplies for all non-use periods for which the asset can reasonably be used, evidenced by marketing for those periods and positive responses to enquiries. 7.32 By allowing only two-outcomes, this approach is simpler than the three- outcome approach. On the other hand, by either fully allowing or disallowing a period of non-use as use of the asset for taxable purposes, the approach may potentially provide an unfair or arbitrary result. 7.33 In the absence of an apportionment mechanism for non-use periods under the two-outcome approach, fewer taxpayers would be able to treat any proportion of non-use as being use for making taxable supplies than under the three-outcome approach. At the same time, some taxpayers would be able to claim the full period of non-use as use for making taxable supplies rather than being required to apportion that period. Conclusion 7.34 Either of the two approaches discussed in this issues paper in respect of deductibility of expenses for income tax purposes may potentially be adopted to resolve the uncertainty with the GST apportionment – at least, for holiday homes, boats and aircraft. Officials therefore seek views on these two approaches for GST purposes or whether there are other approaches that should be considered. 51 Submission points • Do you consider that the methodology for treatment of periods of non-use should be the same for the purposes of both GST and income tax? • How should assets subject to the proposed methodology be defined: conceptually or by list? • Which of the suggested approaches (three- or two-outcome) is preferable for GST purposes? • Are there any other approaches that should be considered? 52 APPENDIX INTERNATIONAL APPROACHES 1. The issue of the deductibility of expenditure in relation to mixed-use assets is not a problem unique to New Zealand. Other countries have considered this problem and have developed rules that prescribe the amount of deductions owners of mixed-use assets can claim. Australia 2. Australia’s method of taxing mixed-use assets is almost identical to the current New Zealand rules – there is no specific regime that deals with mixed-use assets. Instead, the usual rules that regulate income and deductions apply. 3. A tax ruling (No. IT 2167) has been released by the Australian Taxation Office to assist owners of holiday homes in determining the tax status of rental income and their ability to deduct expenses. The ruling states that: • Deductions are disallowed in periods when friends or family rent out the asset, and the owner does not need to declare income from such activities. • Rent received from commercial letting, on the other hand, is assessable income and deductions for expenditure can be claimed in deriving that income. 4. However, deciding the amount of deductions for expenditure in relation to that income-earning use is the difficult question. In most cases the question should be determined in the light of previously decided cases. For example: In Case No. P116, 82 ATC 590 : Case No. 49, 26 CTBR (NS) 372, a property was let for 16 days during the year of income, occupied by the owners for 107 \[days\] and vacant for the balance of the year. Taxation Board of Review No. 1 apportioned the losses and outgoings attributable to the property on a time basis and allowed a deduction for the proportion that the property was let, i.e. 4.4% 8 . 5. In general the approach in the above case should be followed in comparable situations - owners can deduct expenses on a time basis when the assets is being used for actual income-earning purposes and are restricted when the asset is being used for actual private purposes. However, if insufficient information is supplied, deductions will be limited to the rent received. 6. Deduction for periods when the asset is not being let out but is available for letting will depend upon the individual circumstances of each case. Evidence of whether active and bona fide efforts to let the property as a commercial rental were made during the relevant period will be taken into account. 8 Australian Taxation Office, Tax Ruling (No. IT 2167). 53 The United States 7. The United States (US) has a set of rules that apply to certain assets that are used for both private and income-earning purposes. 8. These rules apply specifically to “dwelling units”. A dwelling unit is defined as basic living accommodation, including houses, apartments, condominiums, mobile homes, boats, vacation homes or similar property. However, a dwelling unit does not include a hotel, a motel or similar property that is regularly available for paying customers. Allowable deductions 9. The amount of deductions owners of dwelling units can claim depends upon whether the use of the asset falls above or below certain thresholds. Three- outcomes are possible: • The dwelling unit is regarded as being used purely for personal purposes if the asset is rented out for less than 15 days per year. In this situation, the owner is not required to include any of the rent as income and cannot deduct expenses. • The dwelling unit is regarded as a home if the dwelling unit is rented out for more than 15 days, and the owner uses the asset for personal use for more than the greater of 14 days per year, or for more than 10 percent of the total days the asset is rented to others at a fair rental price. In this situation, the owner is required to declare rental income, and deductions for expenses are divided between the rental use and the personal use based on the number of days used for each purpose. For example, an owner of a dwelling unit rents out the asset for 20 days and also uses the asset for personal enjoyment for 20 days in a given year. The amount of deductions the owner can claim is simply the income- earning use divided by the total use. In this scenario the owner can claim 50 percent of total expenditure (20 days / 40 days = 50%). • The dwelling unit is regarded as a normal rental property if the personal use of the asset falls below either the 14 day or 10 percent personal-use thresholds and business use is greater than 15 days. In this situation, the owner is required to declare rental income, and can deduct expenses even when the property is vacant, provided it is available for rental. 10. Another important element of the US rules is that rental expenses that exceed rental income cannot be used to offset income from other sources. Instead, the loss can be carried forward to offset rental income from the next year. Rental use and personal use days 11. Given the US regime relies heavily on private use and income-earning use days, the definition of private use and income-earning use days is very important. 54 12. Any day that the asset is rented at a fair rental price is a day of rental use even if the asset is used for personal purposes that day. However, any day that the asset is available for rent but not actually rented is not a day of rental use. 13. A day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that the asset is used by any of the following persons: • the owner or any other person who owns an interest in the asset; • a member of the owner’s family or a member of the family of any other person who owns an interest in the asset; • anyone under an arrangement that lets the owner use some other dwelling unit; and • anyone at less than a fair rental price. 14. Any day the owner spends working substantially full-time repairing and maintaining (not improving) the property is not counted as a day of personal use. Canada 15. Generally, income from the rental of a mixed-use asset, such as a holiday home, will be treated as income from property. Canada treats rental income and deductibility of rental expenses in the same manner as Australia and New Zealand. For example, expenditure that relates to actual income-earning use is deductible, and expenditure that relates to actual private use is not deductible. 16. However, if the owner’s rental expenses are consistently more than the rental income, the owner may not be allowed to claim a rental loss because the rental operation is not considered to be a source of income. Consequently, the Canadian approach requires the owner to have a reasonable expectation of making a profit from the rental activities. United Kingdom 17. The United Kingdom (UK) has a special tax regime for properties that are let as furnished holiday accommodation. In essence, owners with properties qualifying as “furnished holiday lettings” (FHL) are treated as carrying on a trade under the FHL rules, and are taxed under the rules applying to trade income rather than property income. 18. A “furnished holiday letting” is a property in the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA) 9 that is: • let out on a commercial basis with a view to a profit; 9 The current legislation only applies to properties situated in the UK; it was extended on a temporary non-statuary basis to EEA properties to ensure compliance with EU law. It will apply to EEA properties on a statuary basis from 6 April 2012 for individuals, and 1 April 2012 for companies. 55 • furnished (to at least the minimum level which an occupier would usually expect); • available for holiday letting on a commercial basis for 140 days or more during the year (increasing to 210 days with effect from 6 April 2012); 10 • actually let commercially as holiday accommodation for 70 days or more during the year, (increasing to 210 days with effect from 6 April 2012); and • not normally in the same occupation for more than 31 consecutive days. 19. Rent received from letting is regarded as taxable income and the owner can claim deductions for expenditure in deriving that income, including times when the holiday home was not in use, provided it was available for commercial use. However, the owner cannot claim a deduction for expenditure when the property is being used for personal purposes. Owners can also claim capital allowances on expenditure such as furniture, fridges, cookers, linen, cutlery and so on. 20. The main advantage of qualifying for “furnished holiday letting” (FHL) status was that, until changes made in Budget 2011 (which come into effect from 6 April 2012) it allowed owners to offset any loss arising from furnished holiday lettings against other taxable income, reducing the owner’s overall tax bill. This was in contrast to the usual treatment of losses arising from property letting under the property income regime, which could only be set against income from the same property-letting business. As a result of the changes announced in Budget 2011, from 6 April 2012, any losses arising from a qualifying UK or EEA furnished holiday-letting business can only be set against income arising from that same UK or EEA-furnished holiday-letting business; however, the rules for calculating profit/loss remain the same as those applying to trades, including the ability to claim capital allowances. 21. In addition, the FHL regime continues to allow certain capital gains relief, including business asset rollover relief, when the property is sold. France 22. The French also have a special tax regime in place for holiday accommodation. Like the UK regime, income from furnished lettings is treated differently from unfurnished lettings. The distinction is that the letting of furnished property is regarded as a business whereas the letting of unfurnished property is regarded as a civil activity. 23. Furnished lettings are treated for calculation purposes as commercial income. When total rental income before deductions is less than €32,000 (€80,000 if the property is let out as a “Gite” – French holiday home that is fully furnished and equipped for self-catering) taxable income can be calculated under a simplified deduction scheme. This scheme allows a deduction of 50 percent of 10 1 April 2012 for companies. 56 gross income to be claimed, instead of the actual deductions. This is the default taxation scheme. 24. The primary purpose of this scheme is to simplify the taxation of furnished lettings. No expenses need be demonstrated, no accounts are required and no separate tax forms need be prepared. However, this regime always assumes a fixed taxable profit and never a lower profit or a loss. 25. If income is above the threshold, the owner is required to calculate actual expenditure related to the letting in order to calculate taxable income. If income falls below the threshold, the owner can still opt to calculate actual expenditure, however the owner is required to calculate actual expenditure for a minimum of two years. This option can be beneficial if a high level of expenses is expected. 26. If the property concerned is unfurnished, and the income from the property is below €15,000, the default scheme declares 70 percent of income is taxable. If income falls above this threshold the owner can opt to work out actual expenditure in order to calculate taxable income. Therefore, if actual expenditure is greater than 30 percent of income it is beneficial to work out actual expenditure.
International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of Hong Kong and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 2 International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of Hong Kong and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends that the House takes note of its report. We have conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of Hong Kong and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. Double tax agreements reduce tax impediments to cross-border services, trade, and investment, and provide more certainty of tax treatment. We are advised that it is anticipated that this agreement would foster growth in economic activity between New Zealand and Hong Kong. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The committee met on 3 and 10 August 2011 to consider the agreement. It heard evidence from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members Amy Adams (Chairperson) David Bennett Brendon Burns Hon David Cunliffe Hon Sir Roger Douglas Aaron Gilmore Hon Shane Jones Rahui Katene Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Stuart Nash Dr Russel Norman Michael Woodhouse DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 4 Appendix B National Interest Analysis Agreement between the Government of Hong Kong and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Executive summary Negotiations have been successfully concluded for a double tax agreement and accompanying protocol with Hong Kong (collectively, the Hong Kong DTA). The Hong Kong DTA was signed on 1 December 2010. Hong Kong is a significant trading partner for New Zealand and an important source of investment. In the year to December 2010, it was New Zealand’s ninth largest export market, and total trade with Hong Kong for the period was worth $1.01 billion. The Hong Kong DTA is expected to enhance New Zealand’s cross-border trade and investment by:  providing greater certainty in the taxation of cross-border investment income;  reducing compliance costs for New Zealand taxpayers and investors into Hong Kong, and Hong Kong investors investing into New Zealand; and  setting limits for withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties (with rates in line with New Zealand’s broader tax treaty strategy). An important feature of the Hong Kong DTA is that it will enable information exchange with the tax authorities in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong DTA will therefore enhance the ability of tax officials to detect and prevent tax avoidance and evasion. The Hong Kong DTA represents a compromise between the starting positions of New Zealand and Hong Kong, with New Zealand’s key negotiating objectives secured. The key area of compromise was the taxation of pensions. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the reduction in withholding rates is expected to be relatively small, at approximately $0.5 million per year. On balance, officials are satisfied that the potential advantages to New Zealand of a DTA with Hong Kong outweigh the potential disadvantages. It is proposed that the Hong Kong DTA be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA would be then brought into force through an exchange of notes. The DTA would enter into force on the date that the latter note is exchanged. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 5 Nature and timing of the proposed binding treaty action The Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 1 for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and its accompanying Protocol (collectively, the Hong Kong DTA) was signed on 1 December 2010 by New Zealand’s Minister of Finance and Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary. In accordance with Parliament’s Standing Order 388(1)(d), it is proposed that the Hong Kong DTA now be presented to the House for treaty examination. Following the successful completion of Parliamentary treaty examination, the Hong Kong DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Once the Order in Council is effective (generally 28 days after the Order is made), all of New Zealand’s domestic processes for entry into force will be complete and New Zealand will be able to advise Hong Kong accordingly by exchange of notes. Hong Kong must similarly complete its domestic processes for entry into force and advise New Zealand by exchange of notes. Article 26 of the Hong Kong DTA provides that the DTA will enter into force on the date of the later of the two notes. It is expected that the Hong Kong DTA will enter into force by the end of 2011. The Hong Kong DTA will not apply to Tokelau, the Cook Islands or Niue. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty Hong Kong is a significant trading partner for New Zealand and an important source of investment. In the year to December 2010, it was New Zealand’s ninth largest export market, and total trade with Hong Kong for the period was worth $1.01 billion. Hong Kong is also an important international finance centre and source of investment capital. In the same period, it was New Zealand’s sixth largest source of foreign direct investment. (Further information about investment and trade flows between New Zealand and Hong Kong is attached as Appendix 1.) The Hong Kong DTA is expected to enhance New Zealand’s cross-border trade and investment by:  providing greater certainty in the taxation of cross-border investment income;  reducing compliance costs for New Zealand taxpayers and investors into Hong Kong, and Hong Kong investors investing into New Zealand; and 1 Hong Kong is a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, and New Zealand already has a double tax agreement with China. However, the agreement with China does not apply to Hong Kong. Hong Kong maintains separate tax laws and concludes its own double tax agreements. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 6  setting limits for withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties (with rates in line with New Zealand’s broader tax treaty strategy). An important feature of the Hong Kong DTA is the inclusion of a standard Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) information exchange article, which will give New Zealand the ability to request and exchange information with the tax authorities in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong DTA will therefore enhance the ability of tax officials to detect and prevent tax avoidance and evasion. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the reduction in withholding rates is expected to be relatively small, at approximately $0.5 million per year. What double tax agreements do Double tax agreements (DTAs) foster growth in economic activity between countries by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. Essentially, DTAs provide bilateral solutions to problems that are difficult to solve unilaterally. They provide greater certainty of tax treatment, provide a basis for sharing the cost of relieving double taxation, provide a bilateral basis for limiting withholding taxes on cross-border investment returns, reduce compliance costs for business, and exempt certain short-term activities from tax in the jurisdiction in which the activities are conducted. New Zealand concluded its first DTA in 1947 with the United Kingdom. Since then, New Zealand has progressively developed a network of DTAs, predominantly with its main trading and investment partners, with 35 DTAs now in force. New Zealand enters into DTAs in large part on the basis of self interest. That is, because DTAs create favourable conditions for increased economic activity between countries, they are expected to be beneficial to New Zealand in economic and fiscal terms at a national level. More generally, however, DTA networks also make an important contribution to the expansion of world trade and to the development of the world economy. These are also key objectives of the OECD. The OECD has assumed a leading role, internationally, in promoting the entering into of DTAs. In particular, the OECD has produced a Model Tax Convention, together with a comprehensive commentary, for member and non-member countries to use as a basis for concluding DTAs. The OECD Council has also issued an express recommendation to all member countries: to pursue their efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions ... with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not yet entered into such conventions ... DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 7 when concluding new bilateral conventions or revising existing bilateral conventions, to conform to the Model Tax Convention, as interpreted by the Commentaries thereon. 2 DTAs provide the following general benefits:  Benefits to taxpayers. A key concern for any taxpayer wanting to enter into commercial activity in another jurisdiction is the requirement to comply with the tax and other legal obligations of two separate jurisdictions. This can be perplexing, and obtaining professional advice or tax rulings can be costly and time consuming. Unique issues also arise from cross-border activities. These range from the complex, such as transfer pricing disputes, to the mundane, such as whether taxes paid in the other jurisdiction are creditable against home jurisdiction tax. DTAs help alleviate many of these problems. For example, they establish a framework for the taxation of cross-border activity, prohibit the application of discriminatory taxes, and establish a mutual agreement procedure for resolving tax disputes. The mutual agreement procedure is a key benefit for taxpayers. It is not a full disputes resolution mechanism as it only obliges the two tax authorities to endeavour to resolve issues. However, it enables tax authorities to have a dialogue about the taxpayer’s issues. It also provides a low compliance-cost alternative to seeking redress through the Courts for taxpayers concerned that they have not been taxed correctly in either or both jurisdictions (including in transfer pricing cases).  Benefits to investors. Investing across an international border often involves risk. Amongst other things, tax laws tend to be very complex and can change suddenly. DTAs assist investors by specifying the maximum rates of withholding taxes that can be applied to dividends, interest and royalties. These “headline” rates reduce compliance costs for investors by making it easier to determine the after-tax returns on potential investments. The fact that the rates are “locked in” by treaty means that investors can make business decisions with more confidence.  Benefits to governments. Low tax rates can lead to increased foreign investment and a reduction in the cost of importing capital. Countries may lower their tax rates unilaterally. However, a benefit of lowering tax rates in a bilateral treaty setting is that it ensures that the rates are also lowered on a reciprocal basis by the treaty partner. This secures benefits for domestic investors. In addition, the reduced foreign tax can flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduced need to provide foreign tax credits. 2 The recommendation was issued by the OECD Council on 23 October 1997, but follows similar recommendations that have been in place since before New Zealand joined the OECD. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 8  Relief of double taxation. Double taxation distorts business decisions and generally hinders cross-border economic activity. In recognition of this, most jurisdictions unilaterally relieve double taxation of their tax residents. This is typically achieved by means of a tax credit mechanism, but some jurisdictions prefer an exemption method. However, in the absence of a DTA, a jurisdiction bears the full cost of relieving double taxation itself. DTAs allow the cost of relieving double taxation to be shared. They do this by allocating taxing rights between the jurisdictions concerned, on the basis of internationally accepted principles as set out in the OECD Model Tax Convention.  Bilateral co-operation. It is an internationally accepted principle that countries do not assist each other in the enforcement of tax laws. 3 However, most countries tax their residents on income earned worldwide. International co-operation between tax authorities is therefore needed to enable tax authorities to verify that offshore income is being correctly reported by their tax residents. DTAs resolve this problem by establishing bilateral treaty arrangements for the exchange of tax-related information such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information. The information that is exchanged assists tax authorities to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. More generally, the mere existence of DTAs can deter evasion and avoidance. This is one of the key benefits of DTAs for governments. The recent global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of bilateral co-operation in the form of exchange of information, and there is now a very strong international imperative (driven by the G-20 and the OECD) for all Governments to enter into comprehensive exchange of tax information networks with relevant partners. Background to the double tax agreement with Hong Kong As noted above, Hong Kong is a significant trading and investment partner. The significance of the economic relationship between New Zealand and Hong Kong was highlighted by the signing of a Closer Economic Partnership (CEP) agreement on 29 March 2010. In addition, negotiations towards an Investment Protocol to that agreement are currently in progress. New Zealand has an established network of DTAs with its main trading and investment partners. The absence of a DTA with Hong Kong is a notable omission in New Zealand’s DTA network. However, despite interest from both sides in concluding a DTA, Hong Kong’s previous stance of refusing to agree to unrestricted exchange of information provisions in its DTAs precluded the commencement of negotiations. Other countries generally shared New Zealand’s view 4 and prior to 2010, Hong Kong had only entered into five DTAs. 3 In New Zealand, this principle is stated in Connor v Connor \[1974\] 1 NZLR 632. 4 Compliance by all countries with global standards for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters has increasingly come under international scrutiny in recent years. As noted above, the importance of unrestricted exchange of information was highlighted during the recent global financial crisis, and prompted the G-20 governments to take measures to ensure full compliance by all jurisdictions. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 9 In 2010, however, Hong Kong changed its stance on information exchange and enacted legislation that would enable it to enter into full information exchange with its treaty partners, removing this obstacle for countries that wish to conclude a DTA with Hong Kong. Further, the Hong Kong Government has followed and is continuing to follow an intensive programme of DTA negotiations to bring in to line with OECD standards. Accordingly, many countries are now concluding DTAs with Hong Kong. Hong Kong has signed 16 DTAs since 2010 (including with New Zealand), of which 12 are with OECD member countries. 5 They include significant OECD economies such as France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. 6 Hong Kong has a territorial-based tax system. Unlike most other jurisdictions which impose tax on the worldwide income of their tax residents, Hong Kong generally only taxes income sourced from Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong law deems certain income streams derived offshore, such as interest income, to be sourced from Hong Kong. Although this means that Hong Kong residents deriving income from New Zealand only face double taxation in limited circumstances, New Zealand residents deriving income from Hong Kong still face double taxation in both jurisdictions. Therefore, OECD countries generally do not see Hong Kong’s territorial tax system as obviating the need for a DTA. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand As a bilateral instrument, the Hong Kong DTA involves a trade-off between advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand. On balance, however, the Hong Kong DTA is expected to be beneficial to New Zealand. Advantages of the treaty entering into force The advantages of the Hong Kong DTA entering into force can be summarised as follows:  It can be expected to foster all forms of bilateral economic activity (such as services, trade and investment). This will benefit New Zealand in terms of employment opportunities and offshore earnings. The $0.5 million revenue cost of the Hong Kong DTA may be offset by increased tax from these activities.  For investors in both jurisdictions, it will reduce compliance costs and provide the certainty of low headline withholding tax rates, locked in by the treaty.  For foreign investors, it will reduce New Zealand withholding tax rates in areas where they have not already been reduced under domestic law (that is, in respect of dividends that are not fully-imputed and royalties).  For New Zealand business it will reduce the cost of importing capital. 5 As at 7 June 2011. 6 Apart from New Zealand, Hong Kong has signed DTAs with the Czech Republic (2011), Portugal (2011), Spain (2011), Austria (2010), Brunei (2010), France (2010), Hungary (2010), Indonesia (2010), Ireland (2010), Japan (2010), Kuwait (2010), Liechtenstein (2010), Netherlands (2010), Switzerland (2010), United Kingdom (2010), Vietnam (2008), Luxembourg (2007), China (2006), Thailand (2005), and Belgium (2003). DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 10  For investors, business and taxpayers from both jurisdictions, it will provide safeguards such as a prohibition against discriminatory taxes and a mutual agreement procedure which will facilitate the resolution of tax disputes (including in complex areas such as transfer pricing).  For taxpayers engaged in certain short-term income-earning activities in the other jurisdiction, it will reduce compliance costs and provide cash flow advantages by eliminating the need to pay tax in that jurisdiction and then claim that tax against the tax liability in their home jurisdiction.  For New Zealand it will provide an equitable framework for sharing the cost of relieving double taxation between the two jurisdictions.  In some circumstances, New Zealand will no longer need to provide credits for foreign tax paid.  For tax authorities, the exchange of information mechanism will assist in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The mechanism will also have a general deterrent effect in respect of evasion and avoidance activity, and will further reduce the opportunities available to residents to escape legitimate New Zealand tax. More generally, the Hong Kong DTA will fill a notable omission from New Zealand’s network of DTAs with its main trading and investment partners. Hong Kong is a significant economic partner, both in terms of trade and investment. Hong Kong is an important international finance centre and an important source of inward investment for New Zealand business. In addition, Hong Kong is seen by business as a key entry point into Asia for New Zealand external investment. (See the National Business Review article of 29 October 2010, attached as Appendix 2.) Because New Zealand is a net importer of foreign capital (that is, New Zealand’s investment needs typically exceed domestic supply, and additional capital must be sought offshore), the possibility of increased inwards investment resulting from the Hong Kong DTA is an important consideration. Accordingly, New Zealand has long viewed Hong Kong as a jurisdiction with which a DTA could be expected to produce national economic benefits. The significance of developing New Zealand’s trade and investment relationship with Hong Kong is underlined by the recently signed CEP and by the current negotiations for an Investment Protocol to the CEP. The Hong Kong DTA will complement these other initiatives. In addition, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes has recently concluded a review of New Zealand’s legal and administrative frameworks for tax information exchange, and has specifically recommended that New Zealand should continue to develop its exchange of information network (in particular, with countries of economic significance to New Zealand). As Hong Kong is one of New Zealand’s key trading partners, entering into the Hong Kong DTA will help New Zealand to meet this recommendation. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 11 A final advantage of the Hong Kong DTA is that New Zealand and Hong Kong share many treaty policy positions. As a result, New Zealand was able to secure virtually all of its key negotiating positions, and the DTA represents a good precedent for New Zealand in future negotiations with other countries. As such, the Hong Kong DTA will strengthen New Zealand’s position on its key negotiating positions. Disadvantages of the treaty entering into force As noted above, DTAs offer bilateral solutions to problems that are difficult to solve unilaterally. However, a potential downside to DTAs is that those solutions are then locked in place by treaty and are difficult and costly to change. This can create difficulties if treaty provisions need to be changed urgently. Practical experience indicates that in genuine cases treaty partners are usually amenable to making necessary changes. However, in extreme cases, if the treaty partner was to refuse to co-operate, termination of the treaty could be required. A second general disadvantage of DTAs is that they give rise to an up-front revenue cost. This is because DTAs lower withholding tax rates on investment income and allocate taxing rights between the two jurisdictions. The allocating of taxing rights means that New Zealand will lose the ability to tax some income streams that it previously could tax (this applies on a reciprocal basis). This means that New Zealand prima facie loses some tax revenue when it enters into a DTA. The revenue cost to New Zealand arising from the reduction in withholding taxes is estimated to be $0.5 million per year. A third general disadvantage of entering into DTAs is that costs will then need to be incurred in administering the exchange of information provisions of the DTA. That is, to the extent that the treaty partner makes requests for information under a New Zealand DTA, New Zealand will incur costs in complying with those requests. However, New Zealand already has exchange of information arrangements in force with 39 other jurisdictions (including 35 DTAs and four Tax Information Exchange Agreements) and has systems in place for administering those arrangements. The costs of providing information to Hong Kong under the Hong Kong DTA will therefore be marginal. As noted above, Hong Kong is a significant international finance centre, and Hong Kong also has a territorial-based tax system. These features tend to make Hong Kong a favoured location for non-residents to establish companies. This, in turn, potentially raises “treaty shopping” concerns. Treaty shopping occurs when a resident of a third jurisdiction obtains the benefits of a DTA, such as lower withholding rates, by interposing a shell company in one of the two jurisdictions party to the DTA. Accordingly, it could be argued that a disadvantage of concluding a DTA with Hong Kong is that New Zealand opens itself up to treaty shopping opportunities. However, treaty shopping is an issue for all DTAs. It is generally addressed by applying general anti-avoidance law. In the Hong Kong DTA, this protection is supplemented by the inclusion of specific anti-abuse rules in the key articles. In a typical DTA, both sides would make reciprocal withholding tax rate reductions. However, Hong Kong generally does not levy withholding taxes. (It does impose a low rate of withholding tax on royalties, but at the same rate specified in the Hong Kong DTA.) Therefore, Hong Kong will not actually forego any withholding tax. While this may be thought of as a disadvantage, officials consider that a better analysis is that it is not a disadvantage. Hong Kong has already effectively reduced its withholding tax rates below DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 12 the normal level of a DTA, to the benefit of New Zealand outward investors. As noted above, in respect of New Zealand’s reduction of withholding tax rates, DTAs provide a better policy setting for lowering withholding rates than domestic law. As is always the case in negotiations, some compromises to the starting positions of the two sides had to be made. In general, Hong Kong shared many of New Zealand’s views and positions as regards taxation of income at source, and the compromises that needed to be made were not as many or as significant as is often the case in negotiations. The key compromise was in relation to pensions. New Zealand generally prefers to allocate a sole taxing right over pensions to the jurisdiction where the recipient resides, as this compensates that jurisdiction for the provision of services such as healthcare to the pensioner. This preference was secured with Hong Kong. However, New Zealand agreed that certain lump sum retirement payments from Hong Kong will be taxable only in Hong Kong. New Zealand also agreed that the taxing right on some periodic government service pensions will be shared by both jurisdictions, although this is limited to specified schemes which are closed to new members. New Zealand has made similar compromises, allowing for source or shared taxation of some types of pensions as part of a treaty package in some of its other DTAs, such as with Australia and Singapore. In addition, New Zealand does not tax many lump sum pensions under domestic law. Conclusion It is an option to not have a DTA with Hong Kong. On balance, however, officials are satisfied that the potential advantages of concluding a DTA with Hong Kong outweigh the potential disadvantages. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms Summary of key legal obligations DTAs do not impose requirements on taxpayers. The Hong Kong DTA will not (and cannot) require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. The obligations that DTAs impose are on the contracting parties. When income is derived from one jurisdiction (the source jurisdiction) by a tax resident of the other jurisdiction (the residence jurisdiction) both countries often impose tax on that income. A key impact of DTAs is to allocate taxing rights. The Hong Kong DTA will require New Zealand to comply with the following allocation of taxing rights: DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 13  Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a resident unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment in the jurisdiction of source. In that case, the profits may be taxed in the source jurisdiction. A permanent establishment generally exists in the jurisdiction in question when there is a fixed place of business where the business of an enterprise is carried on. New Zealand’s preferred approach relating to business profits is to follow the 2007 version of the OECD Model Tax Convention, with certain modifications to the definition of a permanent establishment to retain source taxation in certain circumstances. (Articles 5 and 7 refer.)  Income from services will be taxable only in the jurisdiction where the enterprise or person deriving the income is a resident, unless there is a permanent establishment in the source jurisdiction. An enterprise will be deemed to have a permanent establishment if services are performed in that other jurisdiction for at least 183 days in any 12-month period. The deeming provision for services is a departure from the OECD Model Tax Convention, but is usual treaty practice for New Zealand. (Article 5 refers.)  Income from real property will generally be taxed in the jurisdiction where the property is situated. (Article 6 refers.)  Profits of an enterprise of a jurisdiction from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic will be taxable only in that jurisdiction. However, the Hong Kong DTA ensures that the taxation of domestic carriage will be taxed on the same basis as any other business. (Articles 7 and 8 refer.)  Under New Zealand’s preferred approach, dividends, interest and royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. The residence jurisdiction must reduce its own tax on the payment to compensate for any withholding tax that was imposed in the source jurisdiction. This enables both jurisdictions to tax the payment, whilst ensuring that it is not excessively taxed. (Articles 10, 11 and 12 refer.)  The maximum withholding tax rate that each jurisdiction can impose on dividends at source is: 0% if it is paid to a company that owns (directly or indirectly) 50% or more of the shares in the company paying the dividend and meets certain other requirements. The 50% share ownership threshold is lower than the 80% threshold in some of New Zealand’s other recent treaties; 0% if paid to the other jurisdiction’s government or a specified entity wholly owned by the government in the other jurisdiction. This is a non-OECD provision, although we have agreed to similar provision in respect of portfolio dividends with Australia; 5% if paid to a company in the other jurisdiction that owns (directly or indirectly) 10% or more of the shares in the company paying the dividend; 15% in all other cases. (Article 10 refers.)  The maximum withholding tax rate that each jurisdiction can impose on interest at source is: DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 14 0% if the interest is paid to a lending or finance business, provided that in the case of interest that originates in New Zealand, the 2% approved issuer levy is paid; 0% if paid to the other jurisdiction’s government or a specified entity wholly owned by the government in the other jurisdiction. This is a non-OECD provision, although we have agreed to similar provisions with a number of countries; 10% in all other cases. (Article 11 refers.)  The maximum withholding tax rate that each jurisdiction can impose on royalties received by a resident of the other jurisdiction is 5%. This is lower than New Zealand’s preferred rate of 10%, but is acceptable as part of the treaty package and has been adopted in other treaties such as Australia and the United States. (Article 12 refers.)  Specific rules apply to the taxation of income or gains derived from the sale of property. Income or gains from the sale of immovable property will be taxable in the jurisdiction in which the property is situated. Capital gains from the sale of moveable property may be taxable in the jurisdiction of source. (Article 13 refers.)  Income from employment will be taxable in the jurisdiction where the employment is exercised, unless the employment is short-term and the employer is a non-resident. (Article 14 refers.)  Directors’ fees may be taxed in the jurisdiction where the company paying the fees is resident. (Article 15 refers.)  Income from the activities of entertainers and sportspersons may generally be taxed in the jurisdiction in which those activities are performed. (Article 16 refers.)  Pensions will usually only be taxable in the jurisdiction where the recipient is resident. However, certain lump sum retirement payments from Hong Kong will be taxable only in Hong Kong. The taxation of lump sum payments is a departure from the OECD Model Tax Convention. (Article 17 refers.) Taxing rights on some periodic government service pensions will be shared by both jurisdictions, although this is limited to pensions from specified schemes which are closed to new members. This is a departure from New Zealand’s usual treaty practice and is closer to the OECD Model Tax Convention which provides for sole source taxation of these pensions. (Article 18 refers.)  Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one jurisdiction will generally be exempt from tax in the other jurisdiction. (Article 18 refers.)  Students from one jurisdiction living in the other jurisdiction will not generally be taxed on payments received from outside that other jurisdiction if those payments are for maintenance or education. (Article 19 refers.)  The Hong Kong DTA follows New Zealand’s preferred approach in that income not otherwise dealt with in the DTA may be taxed in the source jurisdiction. (Article 20 refers.) Where the Hong Kong agreement permits both jurisdictions to tax an item of income, the agreement will require New Zealand to relieve double taxation of its residents by allowing a DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 15 credit for source taxes paid in Hong Kong. (Article 21 refers.) This is consistent with the unilateral relief mechanism that already applies under New Zealand domestic law. In addition, New Zealand will be required to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the Hong Kong agreement. These are as follows:  Non-discrimination. The Hong Kong DTA includes an article that prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality, situs of an enterprise, ownership of capital, and, in limited circumstances, residence. The article provides greater certainty for foreign investors that they will not be treated more harshly than other taxpayers and that they will be able to compete on an equal footing in the New Zealand economy with New Zealand investors. New Zealand has traditionally approached the inclusion of non-discrimination articles in its DTAs with caution, because it is sometimes necessary for good tax policy reasons to apply different tax rules to non-residents than to residents (such as thin capitalisation rules.) The non- discrimination article agreed with Hong Kong therefore includes a number of carve- outs that are intended to protect any such existing measures, and which also allow some flexibility for future policy-making and base protection measures. New Zealand has previously agreed to a similar article and carve-outs with Australia. (Article 22 refers.)  Mutual agreement procedure. New Zealand must comply with the procedures for settling disputes set out in the mutual agreement procedure article of the Hong Kong DTA. (Article 23 refers.) This is discussed below under “Dispute resolution”.  Exchange of information. As discussed, the Hong Kong DTA includes an article that provides for the exchange of tax-related information between tax authorities, for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance. New Zealand will be required to respond to requests for information that are received from Hong Kong. If Inland Revenue receives a valid request, and if it does not already hold the requested the information, it must use its information gathering powers to obtain the information. (Article 24 refers.) The arrangement agreed with Hong Kong does not extend to automatic or spontaneous exchanges. 7 This is a departure from New Zealand’s usual treaty practice, but it is consistent with the Tax Information Exchange Agreements that New Zealand has signed with a number of jurisdictions (such as Jersey and the Cayman Islands). Dispute resolution The Hong Kong DTA contains the OECD Model Tax Convention dispute resolution process, or “mutual agreement procedure”. DTAs routinely provide for taxpayer disputes to be resolved through “mutual agreement” by the revenue authorities in both countries. Rather than having to pursue a case through the courts (possibly in both countries) a taxpayer can approach the local tax authority under the mutual agreement procedure set out in article 23. If that authority considers the case to be justified, and cannot resolve it through its own actions, it shall seek to do so through mutual agreement with the tax 7 Automatic exchange of information refers to the systematic transfer of information relating to certain categories of information, such as dividends or interest. Spontaneous exchange of information refers to information about a taxpayer held by a jurisdiction that it thinks may be of interest to the other jurisdiction, even though the other jurisdiction has not requested the information. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 16 authority of the other jurisdiction. This bipartisan approach is particularly appropriate in the tax treaty context because a single issue will generally affect a person’s tax position in both jurisdictions. The mutual agreement procedure also requires the tax authorities of the two jurisdictions to endeavour to resolve together any difficulties or doubts about the correct interpretation or application of the Hong Kong DTA. Reservations The treaty does not allow parties to make a reservation upon ratification. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation Implementation by way of an overriding regulation Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Hong Kong DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. The override is, however, only in relation to tax matters, and only applies in respect of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the core provisions of the Hong Kong DTA, which may provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other jurisdiction do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty. Article 26 provides for the Hong Kong DTA to be brought into force through an exchange of notes between the Contracting States. The Hong Kong DTA will enter into force on the date of the last of these notes. New Zealand will be in a position to notify Hong Kong that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council has entered into force, which is 28 days after its publication in the New Zealand Gazette. Thereafter, the provisions of the Hong Kong DTA will have effect from various dates, according to the terms of the DTA. In New Zealand, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will have effect from 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the DTA enters into force. The provisions relating to other taxes will have effect for income years beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the DTA enters into force. In the case of Hong Kong, the provisions of the DTA will have effect for any year of assessment beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the DTA enters into force. The date of effect for the shipping and aircraft article (article 8), insofar as it relates to aircraft, is the date that the Hong Kong DTA enters into force. This is because New Zealand has an existing Air Services Agreement with Hong Kong that includes a provision preventing double taxation in respect of certain income from aircraft operations. The DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 17 provision in the Air Services Agreement is broadly similar to the provision in the Hong Kong DTA. Under the existing Air Services Agreement, that taxation provision will stop operating if and when a DTA enters into force. The shipping and aircraft article (insofar as it relates to aircraft) therefore needs to take effect from the date of entry into force so as to ensure a seamless transition between the provision in the existing Air Services Agreement and the Hong Kong DTA. The only alternative to an Order in Council for implementing a DTA would be by the enactment of a dedicated statute. This is not preferred as it would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. As noted in this National Interest Analysis, the overall economic effects are expected to be favourable. The Hong Kong DTA will enhance the existing investment and trade relationship. It will also assist Inland Revenue to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. Compliance costs for New Zealand businesses are expected to be reduced as a result of the treaty action. This is because New Zealand businesses will have clear guidance about when they will be liable for tax on activities in Hong Kong, in line with internationally recognised norms. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty New Zealand will forgo some revenue from the limitation of its taxing rights, as outlined above. This will mean that New Zealand will not be able to tax some income that is currently taxed under domestic law, and that the rate of tax that can be imposed on certain other income will be reduced. Therefore, prima facie, DTAs are expected to result in some reduction of New Zealand tax. The revenue cost will include tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of Hong Kong residents in New Zealand, which the Hong Kong DTA will exempt from New Zealand tax. It will also include reduced withholding tax. As noted above, New Zealand already unilaterally reduces withholding taxes on fully imputed dividends and on interest paid between unrelated parties. The Hong Kong DTA will extend those reductions to dividends that are not fully imputed, to interest paid between related parties, and to royalties. Data limitations prevent officials from accurately estimating revenue costs, and also make it impossible to accurately measure the likely cost of the reduction in withholding tax rates. However, officials estimate the reduction of tax revenue as a result of the reduced rates with Hong Kong to be $0.5 million per annum. As discussed, the Hong Kong DTA will be expected to give rise to favourable economic benefits, such as increased trade and investment. Costs may also be offset by other impacts of the DTA. For example, there will be some offsetting effect to the New Zealand tax base from the reduction of tax in Hong Kong, and the reduced need for New Zealand to allow foreign tax credits. There will also be some revenue gains from the expected DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 18 reduction in tax evasion and tax avoidance. Overall, it is expected that the economic benefits will outweigh the costs. It has been noted above that the exchange of information provisions of the Hong Kong DTA will result in some administrative costs for Inland Revenue arising from the need to respond to requests for information from Hong Kong. Again, these costs cannot be quantified precisely, but are expected to be small. Consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were consulted about the terms of the Hong Kong DTA and the content of this extended National Interest Analysis, and agree with its analysis and conclusions. The Ministry of Transport was consulted on the article relating to shipping and aircraft and its application date, and no concerns were raised. Limited private sector consultation took place with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HCSB) prior to the negotiations and their views were taken into account. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects There is no clause in the Hong Kong DTA providing for further amendment of the DTA, and no further amendments are anticipated at this time. New Zealand would consider any future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Any future amendments would be subject to New Zealand’s normal domestic approvals and procedures for DTAs. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty Under article 27, either party may terminate the Hong Kong DTA by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the Hong Kong DTA will cease to have effect for New Zealand for payments made on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the notice of termination is given (in respect of withholding tax), and for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the notice of termination is given (in respect of other New Zealand tax). The Hong Kong DTA will cease to have effect for Hong Kong for any year of assessment beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the notice of termination is given. Agency Disclosure Statement Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing the new Hong Kong DTA and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, it has considered the option of not entering into the treaty. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. The policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation. DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 19 The Hong Kong DTA represents a good outcome for New Zealand. It is broadly consistent with the New Zealand negotiating objectives. The key area where compromise was reached was in respect of pensions. New Zealand generally prefers to allocate a sole taxing right over pensions to the jurisdiction where the recipient resides. This preference was secured with Hong Kong. However, New Zealand agreed that certain lump sum retirement payments from Hong Kong superannuation schemes will be taxable only in Hong Kong. New Zealand also agreed that the taxing right on some periodic government service pensions will be shared by both jurisdictions (although this is limited to specified schemes which are closed to new members). Officials consider this to be acceptable given that New Zealand has made similar compromises in other DTAs. Further, New Zealand does not tax many lump sum pensions under domestic law. An important feature of the Hong Kong DTA is that it provides for the exchange of tax- related information between tax authorities, for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance. This means that New Zealand will be able to request tax- related information from Hong Kong. The arrangement agreed with Hong Kong does not extend to automatic or spontaneous exchanges. This is a departure from New Zealand’s usual treaty practice, but it is consistent with the Tax Information Exchange Agreements that New Zealand has signed with a number of jurisdictions. As noted above, Hong Kong is a significant international finance centre, and Hong Kong also has a territorial-based tax system. These features tend to make Hong Kong a favoured location for non-residents to establish companies. This, in turn, potentially raises “treaty shopping” concerns. Treaty shopping occurs when a resident of a third country obtains the benefits of a DTA, such as lower withholding rates, by interposing a shell company in one of the two jurisdictions party to the DTA. Accordingly, it could be argued that a disadvantage of concluding a DTA with Hong Kong is that New Zealand opens itself up to treaty shopping opportunities. However, treaty shopping is an issue for all DTAs. Treaty shopping is generally addressed by applying general anti-avoidance law under New Zealand’s domestic law. This protection is supplemented by the inclusion of specific anti- abuse rules in the key articles of the Hong Kong DTA (which follows New Zealand’s normal treaty practice). The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted about the terms of the Hong Kong DTA and the content of this extended national interest analysis and no material concerns were raised. The Ministry of Transport was consulted on the article relating to shipping and aircraft and its application date, and no concerns were raised. Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles (as referenced in chapter 3 of the Legislation Advisory Committee Guidelines). An Order in Council will be required to give the Hong Kong DTA effect under New Zealand law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND NEW ZEALAND 20 Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Hong Kong DTA. Appendix 1 New Zealand-Hong Kong cross-border investment and trade Direct investment The stock of direct investment from Hong Kong into New Zealand was worth $1.15 billion as at 31 March 2010, an increase of 61.2% from 2008 ($711 million). Total investment from Hong Kong into New Zealand was worth $3.72 billion in 2010. This figure includes direct and portfolio investment and financial derivatives. Hong Kong is New Zealand’s sixth largest source of foreign investment. Investment flows from Hong Kong into New Zealand were worth $297 million in 2009. Trade In the year to December 2010, total bilateral trade between New Zealand and Hong Kong was worth $1.01 billion. Hong Kong is currently our ninth largest export market. This consisted of $866 million in exports to Hong Kong and $147 million in imports (a combined increase of 42% since 2005). This was 1.2% of New Zealand’s total merchandise trade, and is comparable to New Zealand’s bilateral merchandise trade with Canada (1.2%), France (1.2%) and Saudi Arabia (1.1%). Of the $866 million in exports, $776 million were of processed and unprocessed primary products (namely, food and live animals). Specifically, New Zealand’s main exports were crustaceans ($180 million), mutton and lamb ($60 million), fresh fruit ($46 million), beef ($40 million), and live horses ($29 million). The remainder of the exports largely consisted of manufactures ($215 million). In 2010, this resulted in Hong Kong being New Zealand’s second largest market for exports of fish and shellfish, third largest for raw hides, skins and leather products, fifth largest for paper and paperboard products, sixth largest in textiles and clothing and was one of our top 10 export markets for a range of other products, including frozen beef, sheep meat, fruits and nuts, machinery, wine, and aluminium products. The $147 million in imports from Hong Kong consisted almost entirely of manufactures, with imported primary products worth just $4 million. New Zealand’s principal imports were office machine parts ($11 million) and telephone equipment ($18 million), as well as medical equipment ($9 million).
