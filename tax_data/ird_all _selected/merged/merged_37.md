1 26 November 2007 Consultative paper prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and by the New Zealand Treasury SUGGESTED CHANGES TO THE PETROLEUM MINING EXPENDITURE TAX RULES 1. On behalf of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue, tax policy officials are consulting with the petroleum mining industry and other interested parties on possible changes to the tax treatment of expenditure incurred on petroleum mining. The suggested changes are designed to remove the uncertainty and disincentives that currently exist with the current rules. The New Zealand Energy Strategy 2. In 2004, the government announced a series of measures designed to encourage oil and gas exploration in New Zealand, as a result of concerns over the rate of depletion of the Maui gas reserves and a strong belief that new fields are critical to meeting our future energy supply needs. The announcement was followed by the introduction of changes to the petroleum royalty rules aimed at making them even more internationally competitive, in order to stimulate a high level of exploration activity over the next few years. Underlying the changes was the principle that the tax system should not create barriers or obstacles to an increase in exploration. The government also agreed to consider the industry’s concerns about the petroleum mining rules, which the industry sees as discouraging sensible investment in oil and gas exploration and development. The suggested changes outlined here aim to respond to these concerns as far as is possible. 3. Earlier this year the government released the New Zealand Energy Strategy, which is clearly focused on ways of responding to two long-term energy challenges. The first is responding to climate change and tackling carbon emissions from energy production and use. The second is delivering secure, clean energy at affordable prices to support economic development, while being environmentally responsible. In relation to gas exploration, the government states that it believes that the current rules and incentives are generally appropriate. Summary of the suggested changes 4. The suggested changes are to: • remove the onshore-offshore boundary and allow deductions for development expenditure to occur from the date that the expenditure is incurred; 2 • allow the industry to elect to amortise development expenditure under either the current seven-year straight-line method or apply a new depletion method; • allow a deduction for production well expenditure when that expenditure fails to produce an income earning asset; and • clarify that GST input tax credits are allowed on the costs of restoration associated with a past taxable supply. Removal of the onshore-offshore boundary 5. The current tax rules treat onshore and offshore development expenditure differently. Onshore development costs are deductible from the date that commercial production starts. Offshore development costs are deductible from the date that the expenditure is incurred. The industry has asked officials to consider the definition of onshore and offshore development in light of recent advances in drilling and production technology. 6. The differences in the treatment of onshore and offshore development were based on the longer lead time, more risk and higher cost of offshore developments relative to onshore developments. The industry also argued that offshore development assets begin deteriorating immediately because of the corrosive marine environment. 7. The original policy of distinguishing between onshore and offshore development was not based on ideal tax policy principles. Instead it was based on a mix of the location of the reservoir and the location of the facilities. Developments in horizontal drilling technology now mean that this boundary is no longer sustainable. Horizontal drilling techniques allow wells to be drilled offshore from an onshore location. 8. The policy concern with any boundary is whether it distorts sensible investment decisions. In the absence of horizontal drilling, offshore development is encouraged over onshore development. This was a problem with the original policy. However, with horizontal drilling the current tax rules may encourage facilities to be located on the seaward side of the high-tide mark, when in the absence of tax they may be located onshore (for oil and gas reservoirs close to New Zealand shores). So long as there is a difference between the tax treatment of onshore and offshore development expenditure there is the chance that investment decisions will be influenced by the tax rules. 9. One option to resolve this problem is to abolish the boundary altogether. This seems to be a sensible approach, although it raises the question of when to start amortising development expenditure. 10. On balance, we suggest removing the onshore-offshore boundary and allowing deductions for development expenditure to occur from the date that the expenditure is incurred. This approach appears more consistent with the government’s view that incentives for gas exploration are generally appropriate. It would also remove the uncertainty that exists in the current petroleum mining rules. 3 The seven-year rule 11. The current rules allow development expenditure to be amortised over seven years on a straight-line basis, an approach that can be concessionary for some projects and penal for others. Income from a gas field with a life of more than seven years may be under- taxed, and, similarly, income from a field with a shorter life may be over-taxed. Income from a gas field that produces the bulk of its production in early years may be over- taxed, while late life producers will be under-taxed. 12. Economic theory suggests that deductions for the fall in value of capital good’s should try to approximate an asset’s actual decline in value. In this way tax rules do not interfere with the goods’ value. In the case of development expenditure, the current rules prescribe a single amortisation rate and may affect the value of such investments. 13. Our suggestion is to allow petroleum miners to elect the amortisation method that applies to petroleum development expenditure. The current seven-year straight-line method would be retained. This approach is a relatively simple option to apply and is already widely understood by the industry. Furthermore, it maintains the current level of concession for gas exploration and development when the expected life of the discovery is greater than the amortisation period. It is therefore consistent with statements in the New Zealand Energy Strategy that the current rules and incentives for gas exploration are generally appropriate. 14. We also suggest allowing development expenditure to be amortised on a depletion basis. That would allow the cost of the field to be written off over its life and would deal with the industry’s concerns by improving the matching of deductions with revenue from oil or gas fields. The depletion method relies on estimates of recoverable reserves in the ground. Development expenditure would be written off as oil and gas reserves are depleted. 15. Information on gas and oil reserves, expectations of the likely value of reserves and the likely cost of bringing reserves to market are factors in the decision whether to invest in production. Exploration and production companies therefore build up a lot of knowledge about reserves in an oil and gas field before committing development expenditure. 16. Oil and gas reserves are typically ranked on the basis of confidence levels. Oil reserves are primarily a measure of geological and economic risk – the probability of oil existing and being producible under current economic conditions using current technology. 17. An example of a reserve ranking system is as follows: Reserves Description Proven Reserves which, on the available evidence, are virtually certain to be technically and commercially producible, meaning they have a better than 90 percent chance of being produced. Probable Reserves which are not yet proven, but are estimated to have a better than 50 percent chance of being technically and commercially producible. Possible Reserves which, at present, cannot be regarded as probable, but are estimated to have a significant but less than 50 percent chance of being technically and commercially producible. 4 18. For the purpose of the depletion method, the question is how the reserves should be measured. Using proven reserves may understate the base and result in overly generous amortisation deductions. However, using a combination of proven, probable and possible reserves may overstate the base and result in income being over-taxed. 19. For taxes not to influence investment decisions it is desirable for the reserve base used for amortising development expenditure to be the same as that used to inform the initial investment. For accounting purposes, we understand that accounting standards typically use P90 or proven reserves. However, this may be no more than a reflection of conservative nature of accounting standards and not fully reflect the business investment decision. We also understand that companies tend to base investment decisions on probable reserves (P50, which includes P90 reserves). If this is correct, P50 reserves are likely to be the best reserve base for amortising development expenditure. However, we welcome feedback on this suggestion. 20. Deductions for development expenditure under the depletion method could be computed according to the following basic formula: A x B where – A is the amount of development expenditure, less the expected residual value, reduced by the total depreciation deductions allowed in previous tax years; and B is the proportion that the production of petroleum in that year bears to the estimated total recoverable reserves remaining at the commencement of the year. 21. Although the basic model is simple, it needs to be improved to reflect the dynamic nature of business investment. For this reason, we think that the following matters are worth considering. 22. How should companies account for additional development expenditure over the life of the project? From time to time, over the life of a field, additional development expenditure may be required to keep the oil and gas flowing or bring newly located reserves into production. For the depletion method, we suggest that petroleum miners account for additional development expenditure in the income year directly following the year in which the expenditure was incurred. 23. We suggest a similar approach to increases or decreases in reserves – that is, to lag changes in reserves so that they are counted in the year directly following the year that the reserve’s estimate is adjusted. Estimates of reserves may change over the life of an oil or gas field. This may be for external reasons, like a natural disaster. It may also occur because of matters relating to the specific field, such as having fewer reserves than originally estimated. 5 24. While there is an element of inaccuracy in both these suggested treatments, they have the benefit of being relatively straightforward. It may be possible to design apportionment rules that better reflect the exact timing of additional development expenditure or changes in reserves. However, even a relatively simple apportionment rule may not be justified on the basis of compliance costs. That said, we invite feedback on whether a more complex approach is justified. 25. Based on the preceding considerations, deductions for development expenditure under the depletion method could be computed according to the following formula: A x B where – A is the amount of development expenditure, less estimated residual value, plus any additional development expenditure incurred in the prior year, reduced by the total depreciation deductions allowed in the previous years; and B is the proportion that the production of petroleum in that year bears to the estimated total reserves booked and remaining at the beginning of the year. Adjustments for new reserves or reserve down-grades of P50 reserves will be made at the beginning of the next year. The relevant base is barrel of oil equivalent (to pick up any associated gas reserves). 26. The only remaining question is when the deductions should be allowed. The seven-year amortisation method allows deductions to begin for development expenditure from the date that the expenditure is incurred. However, the depletion method requires production to calculate deductions for development expenditure. 27. In principle, deductions for development expenditure should be amortised as the reserves are depleted. However, this means that deductions for development expenditure would be delayed until production begins. This may or may not be a concern for petroleum miners, depending upon the time taken between incurring development expenditure and first production. 28. An approach to dealing with this concern is to allow petroleum miners to elect to apply the seven-year amortisation method until production begins. The depletion approach could then be applied to the remaining development expenditure at the start of the income year that commercial production begins. The benefit of this approach is that it is more in keeping with the seven-year method and with the government’s stated view that the petroleum mining rules are generally appropriate. We welcome feedback on this point. 29. We have also considered the idea of allowing petroleum miners to elect to apply either the depletion method or the seven-year rule to amortising an item of development expenditure in the same field. While such an approach might increase the accuracy of amortisation deductions, it would also increase complexity. For example, it is likely that special rules will be required to ensure the correct outcome occurs when short-lived and longer-lived petroleum mining assets are used together. The concern is that petroleum miners may seek to gain an advantage by amortising longer-lived assets at rates that are faster than seven years. The suggestion is therefore to require petroleum miners to elect either the seven-year or the depletion method for amortising development expenditure in a field. 6 30. We invite submissions on these options and approaches. Failed production well expenditure 31. Exploration and production companies want to be able to deduct, for example, the costs of failed production wells as and when the situation arises. Industry advice is that, from time to time, production-drilling results in dry, or unsuitable wells. Sometimes production wells just stop producing. 32. In most cases, a tax deduction should be allowed for the fall in value of an asset. Assets that can no longer be used in an income-earning process often only have a residual scrap value. However, in the case of failed petroleum production wells, the expenditure has to be written off over seven years unless the petroleum mining asset is sold or the relevant petroleum licence is relinquished. 33. The industry argues that the current rule is overly restrictive and, as a result, ties up investment capital. It argues that there are strong commercial drivers for not relinquishing the petroleum license. If a company does, it must forgo immediate deductions for failed production wells, thus tying up scarce investment capital in unproductive assets. The industry also notes that other taxpayers can claim an immediate deduction for the remaining value of an asset once they determine that it is no longer of use to the business. 34. Before commenting further, it is important to put the seven-year rule in context. Firstly, it is symmetrical to deny a deduction for wells that have a life of less than seven years if the rules allow wells with economic lives in excess of seven years to be amortised over seven years. Next, allowing a deduction for petroleum mining assets when they are sold for a loss is symmetrical with taxing any gains made from the sale of these assets. Finally, allowing a loss when a petroleum licence is relinquished is a final square-up. 35. We think it is difficult to justify a move away from the current treatment for development expenditure amortised under the seven-year rule if an asset happens to have a life shorter than seven years. The seven-year rule is an on- average approach to amortising development expenditure. It is concessionary if the petroleum mining asset has a life of more than seven years and penal if its life is shorter. Allowing a deduction for petroleum mining assets that are scrapped before seven years is clearly a concession if nothing is done about assets that live longer than seven years. 36. Such an argument, however, does not apply to failed production drilling or wells that are scrapped under the depletion method. 37. We suggest allowing a deduction for expenditure on production wells that fail to produce an income-earning asset. For example, the costs of a dry production well would be deductible in the year that the well is plugged and abandoned. Petroleum miners who use a depletion method of amortising development expenditure would be allowed a deduction if the asset is scrapped or plugged and abandoned, since the depletion method is based on the economic life of the asset. Any remaining tax book value, less recoveries, would be deductible in the year that the asset is scrapped or abandoned. 38. We welcome feedback on these suggestions. 7 GST and site restoration expenditure 39. The original policy intent was to allow start-up and cessation costs to be eligible for GST input tax credits, although the current law may not fully reflect this intention. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has reached a preliminary view that the current GST rules do not allow input tax credits to be claimed if the costs are incurred long after a taxable activity has ceased. This may create problems for taxpayers who are legally required to incur site restoration costs relating to a prior taxable activity many years later. 40. Site restoration costs can be incurred for a number of years after the activity has ceased. Resource consents can impose monitoring obligations for periods of up to 20 years following site restoration. The suggestion is to clarify that GST input tax credits are allowed on the costs of restoration associated with a past taxable supply. This is consistent with the original policy intent and would deal with the industry’s concern. Application date 41. We suggest that the changes apply to petroleum mining expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 2008. How to make a submission 42. The suggested changes are intended to reduce barriers and obstacles to sensible investment in oil and gas exploration and development.

Transactions between associated persons are more likely to lead to tax practices that undermine the intent of our tax laws because of the closeness of the relationships of the persons involved. 1.2 There are four separate definitions of associated persons in the Income Tax Act 2004 which are used extensively in the Act, often in an anti-avoidance capacity. To date, there has been no comprehensive review of the definitions to ensure that the Act has a rational overall approach to defining “associated persons”. 1.3 This paper examines the definitions of associated persons in the Act with an emphasis on identifying their shortcomings, and outlines a number of possible solutions to address these shortcomings. These recommendations have two main themes. 1.4 The first group of changes would address the major weaknesses in the current general definition and the definition which applies for land sales. These weaknesses have significant base maintenance implications in areas such as the taxation of land sales, dividends and fringe benefits. For example, the associated persons definition which applies for land sales contains some major loopholes which allow land dealers, developers and builders to escape tax by operating through closely connected entities. 1.5 The second group of changes recommends replacing the four definitions of associated persons and other provisions employing a similar concept (such as the related persons definition in the dividend rules) with one standardised definition, with limited modifications for certain provisions. This would represent a significant rationalisation and make the associated persons concept in the Act more coherent. 1.6 There is no reason, in principle, why the weaknesses in the current definitions of associated persons should not be remedied. 1.7 The suggested reforms outlined in this paper are timely given increased concerns about the integrity of the income tax system. Inland Revenue’s Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 highlighted how income splitting and tax sheltering are on the increase and are placing pressures on the personal tax rate structure. The company tax base is also at risk. 2 1.8 Tax base maintenance is an essential feature of the government’s tax policy work programme, to counter tax avoidance and ensure a reliable flow of revenue to fund the government’s expenditure commitments. Under a system of self-assessment, it is critical that taxpayers accept that the tax rules are broadly fair and even-handed. Activities such as tax sheltering have a corrosive effect on the tax system and the public’s confidence in it. Taxpayer morale is undermined if there is a perception that others are not paying their share of tax. This perception, in turn, may adversely affect taxpayer behaviour. 1.9 The suggested changes outlined in this paper would close the loopholes in the Act’s definitions of associated persons and are consistent with a key theme of the government’s tax policy work programme – ensuring that the income tax system is robust. 1.10 The main differences between the standardised definition of associated persons outlined in this paper and the current general definition in section OD 7 would be: • The weaknesses in the current general associated persons definition in relation to trusts would be addressed by having tests associating a trustee and beneficiary, trustee and settlor, two trustees with the same settlor, and a settlor and beneficiary. • The new definition would have more robust rules aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests associating two companies and a company and an individual being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among close associates. • The new definition would have a tripartite test associating two persons if they are each associated with the same third person, thereby making the definition of associated persons as a whole more difficult to circumvent. • The associated persons test for relatives in the new definition could extend to two degrees of relationship only instead of four degrees, as section OD 7 does currently; this is an example where the current definition is too wide. 1.11 Once we have received feedback on the suggested changes and made recommendations to government, any resulting legislative changes would be included in a tax bill scheduled for introduction in November 2007. Any legislative changes would apply from the 2008–09 income year. How to make a submission on the suggested changes 1.12 We would appreciate receiving any comments on the recommended changes by 11 May 2007. 3 1.13 Submissions should be sent to: Associated persons project C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand 1.14 Alternatively, submissions can be made in electronic form, in which case “Associated persons project” should appear in the subject line.

Section OD 7 contains the general definition of associated persons, which is the definition that applies in the Act unless a specific definition applies. Three other definitions of associated persons are contained in section OD 8. These apply for the purposes of certain provisions in the Act and are referred to in this paper as specific associated persons definitions. Some of the specific definitions apply to mining companies and land transactions, for example. 2.2 The operative provisions in the Act which use the associated persons definitions recognise that while associated persons are legally separate entities, they may not be economically independent. Because of their relationship to each other, associated persons can often be regarded as single economic entities because of their community of interests. This community of interests may justify these persons not being treated as independent entities for tax purposes. 2.3 In principle, two persons can be regarded as associated for tax purposes if they do not deal with each other at arm’s length. However, the Act does not contain a generic definition of associated persons based explicitly on non- arm’s length considerations. Instead, the Act considers certain persons to be associated if they have particular relationships with one another. Conceptually, this presumptive approach can be regarded as treating persons in certain relationships as not dealing with each other on an arm’s-length basis. 2.4 The connection necessary between two persons to justify treating them as associated can be divided into two main categories: • having certain quantitative ownership thresholds in the case of the two companies (other than the control by any other means limb) and company-individual 1 tests; and • two persons have a defined status or legal relationship in relation to each other – for example, two relatives, a trustee and a beneficiary, or a settlor and a trustee. 1 This is the shorthand term used in this paper for the test associating a company and a person other than a company. 5 2.5 Table 1 explains how persons can be associated in the Act.

The application of these different associated persons definitions is summarised in Table 2.

The section OD 8(1) definition was originally enacted in 1990 as section 214E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 as part of new petroleum mining rules. The section OD 8(3) definition was originally enacted in 1988 as section 245B of the Income Tax Act 1976 as part of the new controlled foreign company rules; and the definition in section OD 8(4) was originally enacted in 1973 as section 88AA(10) and (11) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 as part of new land sale rules. Since their original enactment, the definitions have undergone a number of changes before assuming their present form. 2.9 The specific definitions of associated persons are generally more comprehensive than the general definition in section OD 7. It would seem that the specific definitions were developed in response to perceived shortcomings in the general definition. Current state of associated persons definitions 2.10 Currently, the Act has no coherent overall scheme for defining associated persons. There are a number of shortcomings in the current definitions of associated persons. For example, some definitions do not consider some obviously close relationships as being associated (for example, a trustee and a beneficiary). On the other hand, they treat some remote relationships as being so (for example, fourth-degree relatives). The current multiplicity of definitions and other provisions employing a similar concept (such as the company control definition in section OD 1) creates unnecessary complexity in the Act. 2.11 The associated persons concept in the Act would be significantly improved if these problems were resolved. The following chapters describe the problems and outline a number of possible solutions. 2 By section 5 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1968. 8 CHAPTER 3 CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES 3.1 The general definition of associated persons in section OD 7 and the definition applying to land sales in section OD 8(4) are deficient compared with the other definitions because they do not treat certain categories of persons between whom there is a significant degree of connection as associated persons. Transactions between these categories of persons are more likely to be affected by non-arm’s length considerations than other transactions. As a result, there are specific cases when loopholes in the definitions can give rise to base maintenance concerns. The new standardised definition of associated persons suggested in this paper would address these base maintenance concerns by closing these loopholes. 3.2 In particular, persons in the following relationships are currently not treated as associated under the general associated persons definition and the definition applying to land sales, although they would be associated under other associated persons definitions in the Act: • a trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under that trust; • a trustee of a trust and a settlor of that trust; • a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust if there is a common settlor of both trusts; • any company and any person where the person is associated with another person who is associated with that company. 3.3 This chapter discusses the problems caused by loopholes in the current associated persons definitions and suggests how these loopholes can be closed. 3.4 The paper does not consider the potential application of section BG 1, the general anti-avoidance provision in the Act, to any of the examples discussed. Absence of a trustee-beneficiary test Problem 3.5 The current absence of a trustee-beneficiary test from the general definition of associated persons in section OD 7 would probably constitute that definition’s most significant omission in test coverage. Transactions are often structured to take advantage of this loophole. In particular, many of the operative rules in the Act using the general associated persons definition can be readily circumvented by simply interposing a discretionary trust. The absence of a trustee-beneficiary test in the associated persons definition applying to land sales would also probably be the most significant omission in that definition’s test coverage. 9 3.6 Set out below are examples of arrangements that exploit this absence of a trustee-beneficiary test in the general definition of associated persons and the definition applying to land sales. EXAMPLE 1 TrustBeneficiary Company 100%benefit 3.7 The arrangement in Example 1 involves the company providing a benefit to a beneficiary of its trustee shareholder. The company provides the benefit because the trustee is one of its shareholders. Even though section CD 5(1)(a)(ii) in the dividend rules is directed at payments to associated persons of shareholders, this simple arrangement avoids the dividend rules (the arrangement is also not caught by the trustee rule in section CD 5(1)(a)(iii)). 3.8 The arrangement in Example 2 involves an employer providing a low interest loan to a trust under which an employee is a beneficiary. Even though fringe benefit tax applies to fringe benefits provided to associated persons of employees this simple arrangement avoids this rule. Peculiarly, if the trust’s beneficiaries included the employee’s relatives then the arrangement would be caught. E XAMPLE 2 Employer Trust (beneficiaries include an employee but not relatives) Employee low interest loan distribution 3.9 In Example 3, a property developer arranges for the trust (settled by the developer and under which the developer is a beneficiary) to acquire land. The property developer is not associated with the trust under section OD 8(4) so the trust is not automatically caught by the land sale provisions in subpart CB on the subsequent sale of the land. 3 3 Each of the land sale taxation provisions applying to persons dealing in land, developing or dividing land, or building, contains an associated persons rule to prevent persons who carry on these activities from avoiding the principal provisions by operating through an associate. 10 EXAMPLE 3 Property developer (settlor and beneficiary) Trust (purchases and sells land at profit) distributionsettles Solution 3.10 It is clear from the examples that there is a sufficient connection between the trustees and beneficiaries of a trust to justify treating them as being associated. 3.11 We consider that a “trustee-beneficiary” test should become part of a standardised associated persons definition. This test would associate a trustee of a trust and a person who has benefited or is eligible to benefit under that trust. 3.12 The inclusion of a trustee-beneficiary test in a standardised associated persons definition would address the examples above: • In Example 1, the company would be providing a benefit to an associated person (Beneficiary) of a shareholder (Trust) in the company. Accordingly, the company has provided a dividend to the beneficiary under section CD 5(1)(a)(ii). • In Example 2, the employer would be providing a fringe benefit (the low interest loan) to an associated person (Trust) of the employee and would therefore be subject to fringe benefit tax. • In Example 3, the trust would be an associated person of the property developer and therefore the proceeds from the sale of the land by the trust would be income of the trust under the land sale provisions in subpart CB. Absence of a trustee-settlor test Problem 3.13 The absence of a test associating a trustee and a settlor of a trust is also a significant loophole in the general definition of associated persons and the definition applying for land sales. How the omission of this test constitutes a loophole is illustrated by the following examples. 11 3.14 The dividend rules in sections CD 3 to CD 5 treat a payment made by a company to an associated person of a shareholder of the company as a dividend if that payment would have been a dividend if it had been made to the shareholder. These rules employ the section OD 7 associated persons definition. The ease with which this definition can be circumvented is shown in Example 4. EXAMPLE 4 Family Co. A Family Trust A’s children 100% payment distribution to beneficiaries settles 3.15 The payment in Example 4 from Family Co. to Family Trust is not currently caught as a dividend. Family Trust is not associated with A who is the sole shareholder of Family Co. because of the absence of a settlor-trustee associated persons test in section OD 7. Also, the trust extension rule in section CD 5(1)(a)(iii) does not apply as Family Co. has not made a payment to a trust under which A or A’s spouse is a beneficiary (instead, A’s children are the beneficiaries). EXAMPLE 5 loan Non-resident NZ trust (holding NZ property) interest settles 3.16 In Example 5, a non-resident settles a New Zealand trust (with a New Zealand-incorporated company as trustee) which owns New Zealand land and buildings. The non-resident is also a beneficiary of the trust. This investment by the trustee is funded by a loan from the non-resident settlor. The interest paid on this loan qualifies for the approved issuer levy (AIL) of two percent instead of being subject to the higher NRWT rate if the non- resident settlor is not associated with the New Zealand trustee. Because the section OD 7 definition is used in the AIL rules – and this definition is generally deficient in relation to arrangements involving trusts and, in particular, does not contain a test associating a settlor and a trustee of a trust – the interest qualifies for AIL treatment despite the in-substance association between the two parties. 12 Solution 3.17 As with the “trustee-beneficiary” relationship, a trustee and a settlor of a trust have a sufficient degree of connection to justify treating them as associated persons. The current absence of this test in the general definition of associated persons in section OD 7 and the definition applying for land sales allows for schemes to be developed that exploit this gap. 3.18 The payment from Family Co. to Family Trust in Example 4 would be treated as a dividend under a standardised associated persons definition which would include a trustee-settlor test. Because A is the settlor of Family Trust, A and Family Trust would be associated persons under this test. Therefore, Family Co. would have made a payment to an associated person (Family Trust) of its shareholder (A) in terms of section CD 5(1)(a)(ii). 3.19 In Example 5, the non-resident would be associated with the New Zealand trustee under this arrangement if a test associating a settlor and a trustee of a trust applied. Accordingly, the interest derived by the non-resident from New Zealand would be subject to a higher rate of NRWT instead of AIL at two percent, which is the appropriate treatment. 3.20 A settlor of a trust and a trustee of that trust are currently treated as associated persons under section OD 8(3)(i). This test is unique to the section OD 8(3) definition of associated persons. 3.21 The term “settlor” has a wide meaning under the section OB 1 definition of that term. A settlor is defined to mean broadly any person who provides goods or services to a trust for less than market value or acquires goods or services from a trust for greater than market value. The definition of “settlor” is further extended by the provisions of section HH 1, the most significant of which are: • When a company makes a settlement, any shareholder with an interest of 10 percent or more in that company is treated as a settlor in relation to that settlement as well as the company itself (section HH 1(2)). • When a trustee of a trust (the first trust) settles another trust (the second trust), the settlor of the second trust is treated as including any person who is a settlor of the first trust (section HH 1(3)). • When a person has any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust which enable the person to require the trustee to treat the person (or any other person nominated by that person) as a beneficiary of that trust, the person is treated as a settlor of that trust. 3.22 The wide definition of “settlor” contained in section OB 1 of the Act should apply for the purposes of a standardised associated persons definition. 13 Absence of a two trustees with a common settlor test Problem 3.23 The absence of a test associating trustees of two trusts if they have a common settlor in the general definition of associated persons in section OD 7 and the definition applying for land sales means that the operative provisions employing these definitions can be readily circumvented by the use of certain trust structures. 3.24 As mentioned earlier, the dividend rules in sections CD 3 to CD 5 treat any payment made by a company to an associated person of a shareholder of the company as a dividend if that payment would have been a dividend if it had been made to the shareholder; the section OD 7 general associated persons definition is used for this purpose. The dividend rules also contain a trust extension rule in section CD 5(1)(a)(iii) whereby any payment made by a company to a trust under which a shareholder of the company (or spouse or civil union partner of the shareholder) is a beneficiary is also treated as a dividend. The associated person and trust extensions in the dividend rules can be easily circumvented, in the absence of a two trustees (common settlor) test, by the following structure: EXAMPLE 6 A (settlor) Family Trust No. 1Family Trust No. 2 Family Co.A/A’s children 100%payment distribution to beneficiaries 3.25 A settles Family Trust No. 1, which trust owns all of the shares in Family Co. A also settles Family Trust No. 2 whose discretionary beneficiaries include his children and A himself. Family Co. makes a payment to Family Trust No. 2. 3.26 Family Co. has not made a payment to an associated person of its shareholder, Family Trust No. 1, in terms of section CD 5(1)(a)(ii). The section OD 7 definition of associated persons would not cover this scenario and therefore the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust No. 2 is not treated as a dividend. 14 3.27 The trust extension to section CD 5 also does not apply as the shareholder of Family Co. is Family Trust No. 1 and not A (and Family Trust No. 1 is not a beneficiary of Family Trust No. 2). Solution 3.28 Officials consider that there is a sufficient degree of connection between two trustees with a common settlor to justify treating them as associated. This would allow the current loophole to be closed. 3.29 If a standardised associated persons definition included a two trustees (common settlor) test the payment from Family Co. to Family Trust No. 2 in the example above would be treated as a dividend. The trustees of Family Trust No. 1 and Family Trust No. 2 would be associated because they have a common settlor (A). Section CD 5(1)(a)(ii) would therefore apply as Family Co. has made a payment to an associated person (Family Trust No. 2) of its shareholder (Family Trust No. 1). 3.30 Two associated persons definitions currently contain tests – sections OD 8(1)(f) and OD 8(3)(h) – which treat a trustee of a trust and a trustee of another trust as associated persons if both trusts have at least one settlor in common. Absence of a settlor-beneficiary test 3.31 A settlor of a trust and a beneficiary under that trust should also be treated as associated persons under a standardised associated persons definition. 3.32 Given that there is a sufficient connection between a trustee and a beneficiary, as well as between a trustee and a settlor to justify treating them as associated persons, there should be a sufficient connection between a settlor and a beneficiary to justify treating them as associated persons as well. Such an associated persons test would also be consistent with the settlor focus of the trust taxation rules. 3.33 An overseas precedent for treating a settlor and a beneficiary as associated can be found in the definition of “related taxpayer” in section 1313(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. 3.34 In any event, a settlor will be associated with a beneficiary under the trust if a new standardised definition of associated persons contains the “trustee- beneficiary” test, the “settlor-trustee” test and the modified tripartite test as proposed. By associating settlors with beneficiaries explicitly, the associated persons definition will be made more transparent. 15 Absence of a universal tripartite test Problem 3.35 The absence of a test associating two persons if they are each associated with the same third person – referred to as the universal tripartite test – in a new standardised definition of associated persons could render other reforms suggested in this paper somewhat ineffective. Making changes to the treatment of parties to a trust (such as a trustee-beneficiary test) will catch many simple associated persons arrangements. However, those changes will not catch more elaborate arrangements. 3.36 For example, fringe benefit tax applies to fringe benefits provided to employees or associated persons (as defined in section OD 7) of employees. As illustrated by Example 2, this rule can currently be avoided by simply interposing a trust between the employer and employee. Under such an arrangement, a benefit provided to the trust (which can be later distributed to the employee as a beneficiary of the trust) is not currently provided to an associated person of the employee and therefore not subject to fringe benefit tax. 3.37 Putting in place a “trustee-beneficiary” test could help address these kinds of arrangements. It could, however, be possible to continue to avoid being associated by simply interposing one additional party – a company which acts as a beneficiary under the trust. The arrangement could take the following form: EXAMPLE 7 Employer Trust Beneficiary Co. low interest loan distribution Employee (and relatives) 100% 3.38 Under the arrangement, the benefit is provided to the trust, which is associated with Beneficiary Co. under the “trustee-beneficiary” test, but not with the employee. 16 3.39 A tripartite test would associate the trust with the employee because they are both associated with Beneficiary Co. (the trust is associated with Beneficiary Co. under a trustee-beneficiary test and the employee is associated with Beneficiary Co. under the company-individual test). As a result, the employer would have to account for FBT. 3.40 This tripartite test would also apply if the trust and company in Example 7 were transposed – that is, the employer makes a low interest loan to a company owned by a trust, under which the employee was a beneficiary. Accordingly, the employer would still have to account for FBT. 3.41 Example 8 illustrates how the tripartite test would operate in the context of section CD 5(1)(a)(ii) which treats as a dividend any payment made by a company to an associated person of a shareholder of the company. This operative provision employs the section OD 7 definition of associated persons which does not currently contain a tripartite test. The example shows that without such a test payments made by a company can circumvent the associated persons rule (and the trust extension rule) in section CD 5. EXAMPLE 8 A Co. 1Trust Co. 2 Beneficiaries (including A) 100%payment distribution 100%settles 3.42 The payment from Co. 2 to the trust is not currently caught by the dividend rules but would be if a tripartite trust was employed. The trust is associated with A under the trustee-settlor test (assuming that test was also included in section OD 7). A is also associated with Co. 1 under the company-individual test (existing section OD 7(1)(b)). The trust would therefore be associated with Co. 1 (the shareholder of Co. 2) under the tripartite test because the trust is associated with A who is associated with Co. 1. Accordingly, in terms of section CD 5(1)(a)(ii), a payment has been made to an associated person (Trust) of a shareholder (Co.1) of Co. 2. 3.43 A tripartite test would also catch the land transaction arrangement shown in Example 9 which currently circumvents the section OD 8(4) definition of associated persons. 17 EXAMPLE 9 Trust (purchase land and sells it at profit) Beneficiary Co. Land developer and/or spouse/infant children 100% distribution 3.44 The arrangement in Example 9 is not caught by the existing section OD 8(4)(c), which treats two persons as being associated if one is the trustee of a trust under which the other person’s spouse, civil union partner or infant child is eligible to benefit. This is because Beneficiary Co., rather than the land developer’s spouse or infant children, is the beneficiary under the trust. However, the trust and the land developer would be associated under the universal tripartite test (in conjunction with a trustee-beneficiary test). This is because the trust and Beneficiary Co. are associated under the trustee- beneficiary test, and the land developer and Beneficiary Co. are associated under the company-individual test, resulting in the trust and land developer being associated. Therefore, any gain on the subsequent disposition of the investment property by the trust would be liable to tax under the associated persons rules in the land sale provisions in subpart CB. 3.45 The current company-based tripartite test in section OD 8(3)(c) would not be sufficient to catch the arrangement in Example 9 as neither the land developer nor the trust is a company. EXAMPLE 10 A Family Trust Foreign Co. 100%interestloan settles 3.46 A settles Family Trust with A’s spouse as trustee. The trust carries on business activities in New Zealand. Foreign Co, which is wholly owned by A and resident in a grey list jurisdiction, makes a loan to Family Trust. The interest paid on this loan qualifies for an approved issuer levy (AIL) of two percent instead of being subject to the higher NRWT rate which applies if the lender and borrower are associated. The loan is not caught by the associated persons restriction in the AIL rules because of shortcomings in the general associated persons definition in section OD 7, which is used in these rules. The correct outcome from a policy perspective is that the interest derived 18 from New Zealand by Foreign Co. is subject to NRWT instead of AIL because of the in-substance association between Family Trust and Foreign Co. These two parties would be associated if a tripartite test applied in conjunction with a trustee-settlor test: Family Trust would be associated with A under the trustee-settlor test and A would be associated with Foreign Co. under the company-individual test. Accordingly, Foreign Co. would be associated with Family Trust under the tripartite test. Solution 3.47 Currently, section OD 8(3)(c) treats a company and any person as associated persons if the person is associated (under any of the tests in section OD 8(3)) with another person who is associated (but not under this particular test) with the company. In other words, A is associated with a company if B is associated with both that company and A. This test is unique to the section OD 8(3) definition of associated persons. 3.48 This test is also sometimes referred to as the “tripartite test” because of its triangular principle of operation whereby a company is considered to be associated with a person if that person is associated with another person who in turn is associated with the company. In other words, a company and a person are treated as associated if there is a common person with whom they are associated. 3.49 We consider that the section OD 8(3)(c) tripartite test should not be simply adopted in its current form. There is no reason, in principle, why the tripartite test should apply only in relation to companies; its general concept – that two persons are associated if they are each associated with the same third person – should apply universally. 3.50 Therefore we suggest that a universal tripartite test should be included in a standardised definition of associated persons. This test would associate any two persons if they are each associated with the same third person. 3.51 Having a tripartite test would make a standardised definition of associated persons as a whole much more difficult to circumvent. In particular, it would prevent the other associated persons tests being circumvented by arrangements using the interposition of relatives, companies, and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists. 3.52 Having a universal tripartite test in a new standardised definition of associated persons in the Income Tax Act 2004 would also be consistent with the approach used in the associated persons definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Modification for limited partnerships 3.53 There may be sound policy reasons for modifying the proposed tripartite test relating to the new limited partnership vehicles the government is considering introducing. 19 3.54 Limited partnership vehicles will be an important mechanism through which New Zealand will access foreign venture capital. Limited partnerships could have many unrelated limited partner investors (of varying size) resident in different jurisdictions around the world. Experience abroad indicates that limited partnerships are often widely held vehicles used to pool the investment funds of many different investors. Under the regulatory measures the government is currently considering, limited partners would have no ability to manage the partnership business or make operating decisions, and therefore they would be less able to use the limited partnership vehicle to circumvent the associated persons rules – for example, in relation to land transactions. 3.55 With land transactions, a universal tripartite test may result in the land dealing transactions of one partner tainting the other partners. Given the nature of the proposed limited partnership vehicle, and the inability of a limited partner to exercise control over it, the scope of this test in relation to limited partnerships may be wider than is necessary for base maintenance purposes. Accordingly, any tripartite test should be modified in the case of limited partnerships. 3.56 In some respects, such as in terms of liability, limited partners are more akin to shareholders in a company. It may therefore be appropriate to adopt a test based on the company-individual test in the current section OD 7(1)(b). Under such a test a limited partner would be associated with a limited partnership and other partners in the partnership only if that limited partner had a 25 percent or greater interest in the limited partnership. 3.57 Officials would like feedback on any other situations where it is considered that the scope of a universal tripartite test may be wider than is necessary for the purpose of protecting the tax base. Aggregation of interests of associated persons in two companies and company- individual tests Problem 3.58 If the interests of associated persons are not aggregated the tests associating two companies and companies and individuals could be readily circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons to prevent these interest thresholds being reached. However, in-substance control of a company could be retained because of the relationship between associated persons. This is illustrated by Examples 11 to 13. 20 EXAMPLE 11 A Family Trust No. 1 Family Trust No. 2 A’s spouseA’s child settlessettles Family Co. 20%20% 20% 20%20% 3.59 A settles Family Trusts No. 1 and No. 2 and arranges for each of them to hold 20 percent of the shares in Family Co. A also arranges for his spouse and child to hold 20 percent each in Family Co. A directly holds only 20 percent. Without a rule aggregating the interests held by associated persons A would not be associated with Family Co. EXAMPLE 12 A A’s spouse Trust Family Co. settles 100% 3.60 A’s spouse settles Trust, which in turn owns all the shares in Family Co. The members of A’s family are not identified as discretionary beneficiaries of the trust. The issue is whether A is associated with Family Co. under the company-individual associated persons test. Without a rule aggregating interests held by associated persons A would not be associated with Family Co. even though there is a large community of interest between them. However, A would be associated with Family Co. under the company- individual test if that test was buttressed by such an aggregation rule, in conjunction with tripartite and trustee-settlor tests. In particular, A would be treated for the purposes of the company-individual test as holding all the shares held by Trust in Family Co. This is because Trust is associated with A under the tripartite test: A is associated with her spouse under the relatives test and A’s spouse is associated with Trust under the settlor-trustee test, which means that A is associated with Trust under the tripartite test. 21 EXAMPLE 13 A Family Trust AFamily Trust B Family Co. AFamily Co. B 100% settles 100% settles 3.61 A settles two family trusts which in turn each own all the shares in a family company. The issue is whether the two family companies are associated under the two companies associated persons test. Without a rule aggregating interests held by associated persons for the purposes of that test, the two family companies would not be associated despite the close community of interests between them. However, Family Co. A would be associated with Family Co. B if the two-companies test was buttressed by an aggregation rule in conjunction with the two trustees-common settlor test. Because the two family trusts are associated with each other under the two trustees-common settlor test, they would each be treated as holding each other’s shares for the purposes of the two-companies test and accordingly the two family companies would be associated under that test. Solution 3.62 In determining whether two companies or a company and an individual are associated, a person’s voting or market value interests in a company should be aggregated with the voting or market value interests of associated persons. 3.63 Such an aggregation approach is appropriate in the context of the two companies and company-individual tests which are largely based on certain quantitative voting or market value interest thresholds. 3.64 The existing two companies and company-individual tests in section OD 7 already contain limited interest aggregation rules. However, these aggregation rules are not always complete or consistent. For example, interests held by a trustee of a trust under which a relative of a person is a discretionary beneficiary are aggregated with shares held directly by the person in determining whether two companies or a company and that person are associated. Surprisingly, interests held by a trustee of a trust under which a person (but not his or her relatives) is a discretionary beneficiary are not similarly aggregated with shares held directly by that person. A general aggregation rule in a standardised definition of associated persons would address this and similar anomalies. 22 3.65 We therefore consider there should be more robust rules aggregating the interests of associates to prevent the tests associating two companies and a company and an individual being circumvented by the fragmentation of interests among associated persons. 3.66 The suggested aggregation rule would be consistent with the approach used in the associated persons definition in section 2A(4) of the GST Act. For example, using the structure in Example 12, A (not GST-registered) sells land, which has not previously been in the GST net, to Family Co. in order to generate a second-hand goods input tax credit. This attempt would not succeed because it would be caught by the associated persons restriction applying to such credit: A and Family Co. are associated persons for GST purposes. 3.67 There are several international precedents for the type of aggregation rule proposed. For example, paragraph 4 of Schedule 28AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (United Kingdom) provides that for purposes of determining whether a person has control over a company, there are attributed to that person any rights or powers held by persons connected with that person. This provision applies for purposes of the transfer pricing rules in the same Act. 3.68 Section 160E of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Australia) requires the interests of associated persons to be aggregated in determining whether a company and a person are associated for purposes of the capital gains provisions. 3.69 The definition of “related persons” in section 251(2) of the Income Tax Act 1985 (Canada) provides, inter alia, that an individual and a company are related persons for purposes of that Act if the individual is a member of a related group that controls the company; this has a similar aggregation effect. 23 Chapter 4 RATIONALISATION AND SIMPLIFICATION 4.1 No previous attempt has been made to provide a coherent overall approach to defining associated persons for income tax purposes. In addition to the loopholes discussed in Chapter 3, other shortcomings in the current definitions and related provisions include a lack of simplicity and coherency. The rationalisation of the current multiple associated persons definitions and other provisions which embody an associated persons concept would help to address these shortcomings. Multiplicity of definitions Problem 4.2 The associated persons definitions are spread out among four different provisions: sections OD 7, OD 8(1), OD 8(3) and OD 8(4). As shown in Table 1, each definition contains several associated persons tests which apply depending on the situation. Thus, persons in an arrangement are or are not associated depending on what associated persons definition is used. The current multiplicity of definitions is purely historical: the specific definitions were mainly conceived in response to shortcomings in the general definition. There are no convincing policy reasons for the current multiple definitions. They create unnecessary complexity which increases compliance and administrative costs. Solution – standardised definition 4.3 Officials consider that any substantial improvement in the clarity of the associated persons definitions can only be achieved by reducing the number of definitions of associated persons. The most effective way to approach this task is to develop a single, standard definition of associated persons for the Act. 4.4 A standardised definition would incorporate solutions to various weaknesses, ambiguities, and inconsistencies in the existing associated persons definitions. This would result in a significantly stronger definition applying for the purposes of the Act generally, while at the same time remedying the shortcomings in the existing definitions. 4.5 A new standardised definition of associated persons would more closely resemble the current section OD 8(3) definition than the current general definition in section OD 7. However, this can be regarded as continuing a process already in place whereby the section OD 8(3) definition has been progressively applied to more operative provisions, 4 including standard provisions such as the depreciation rules, since its inception in 1988. Therefore, the standardised definition reform suggested in this paper brings this process to its natural conclusion. 4 Refer Table 2. 24 4.6 The new standardised definition of associated persons in the Income Tax Act 2004 would be similar to that applying in the GST Act. This would standardise the concept of associated persons across the Inland Revenue Acts. Moreover, having a standardised definition in place of the four current definitions would be a significant simplification measure. 4.7 The standard definition would contain limited modifications for the purposes of certain provisions. Those modifications are: • The existing narrow range of relatives (that is, spouses, civil union partners and infant children) applying for purposes of the company- individual and relatives tests in the section OD 8(4) definition should continue to apply in the associated persons rules in the land transaction provisions. • The modification contained in section OD 8(3A) to the two companies test in section OD 8(3)(a) should be retained as a separate subsection in the standardised associated persons definition. This provision specifies that two companies are not associated when one of those companies (but not both) is not resident in New Zealand, and applies for the purposes of the international tax rules (other than sections CD 34 to CD 41 and CZ 10). • The existing modification contained in section EX 4(1), which qualifies the relatives test in section OD 8(3) for the purposes of section EX 3 (relating to the calculation of control interests in foreign companies), should be relocated to a separate subsection in the standardised definition of associated persons. A cross-reference should be inserted in section EX 3 to this modification for ease of comprehension. • The existing modification in section LE 3(5)(a) should be relocated to a separate subsection in the standardised associated persons definition provision and a cross-reference inserted in section LE 3(5) to the relocated modification for ease of comprehension. This modification specifies that, for the purposes of section LE 3(5) (part of the section LE 3 holding company rules), a section LE 3 holding company and a lower-tier company are considered to be associated persons as defined in section OD 8(3), but as if each reference in that provision to “50% or more” instead read “more than 50%”. 4.8 Any modification to the new standardised associated persons definition would be contained in that definition itself, with a cross-reference from the particular operative provision to the modification for ease of comprehension. Definition of “relative” 4.9 Two persons who are relatives are associated persons. Although the relatives test is a common test in all four current definitions of associated persons there are differences in the range of relatives which are taken into account for the purposes of these tests. 25 4.10 Section OB 1 contains two main definitions of a “relative”. Paragraph (c) of the definition of “relative” is used for the relatives tests in sections OD 7(1)(c) and OD 8(1)(c). In short, relatives are defined as meaning persons connected by: • blood relationship (being within the fourth degree of relationship); or • marriage or civil union partnership (being in a marriage or civil union with another, or with a person connected by blood relationship to the other – that is, in-laws or stepchildren); or • adoption (being one who has been adopted as the child of the other or as the child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other). 4.11 This definition of relative is very wide and, for example, would include first cousins and great nephews. To determine the degree of blood relationship (that is, consanguinity) between two persons, the Commissioner follows the procedure of counting the steps back from one of those persons to a common ancestor and then the steps forward to the other person. If there are not more than four steps the two persons are treated as being within the fourth degree of relationship and therefore are relatives under the general definition of that term. This procedure is illustrated in Example 14. EXAMPLE 14 Grandparents (common ancestor) Harry’s parentsSally’s parents HarrySally 1 3 4 2 relatives (first cousins) Harry and Sally are first cousins. They are within the fourth degree of blood relationship because there are not more than four steps between them: 1 – back from Harry to Harry’s parents 2 – back to Harry’s grandparents (the common ancestor) 3 – forward to Sally’s parents 4 – forward to cousin Sally. 4.12 A relative is also defined for the purposes of paragraph (c) of the section OB 1 definition of relative as including “a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit” (through a trustee extension contained in paragraph (d) of the relative definition). 26 4.13 The definition of relative which applies for the purposes of the section OD 8(3)(d) relatives test (paragraph (a) of the definition of “relative” in section OB 1) is significantly narrower than the general definition which applies for the purposes of the associated persons definitions in sections OD 7 and OD 8(1). First, persons are connected by blood relationship if they are within the second (rather than fourth) degree of relationship. Secondly, persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as a child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the first (rather than third) degree of relationship to the other. 4.14 The relatives test in paragraph (c) of the section OD 8(4) definition of associated persons is much narrower than the other relatives tests and only applies to the spouse or infant child (or trustee of a trust under which that spouse or infant child has benefited or is eligible to benefit) of a person. 4.15 Officials consider that the narrower definition of relative in paragraph (a) of the section OB 1 definition is the better definition to adopt for purposes of the associated persons definition. This is because connection between relatives outside the two degrees of relationship used in the paragraph (a) definition of “relative” is not sufficiently strong to justify treating them as associated persons. The definition of relative in paragraph (c) of the section OB 1 definition is probably too wide to make it readily enforceable by the Commissioner (extending as it does to great nephews), and would also be too wide for taxpayers themselves to monitor, making self-assessment difficult. 4.16 The new section OB 1 definition of relative based on the existing paragraph (a) should incorporate the “trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit” extension currently found in paragraph (d). 4.17 We believe that the narrow range of relatives (spouses and infant children only) in the relatives associated persons test (section OD 8(4)(c)) currently applying for the purposes of the land transaction provisions should continue to apply for those provisions. 4.18 It should be noted that the definition of relative has been extended to include de facto spouses as a part of the amendments made by the Income Tax Amendment Act 2005, with application from 1 April 2007. The current non- application of the relatives associated persons test to de facto spouses is somewhat anomalous given that there would typically be a much closer relationship between de facto spouses than there would be between first cousins or great nephews. Replacement of “related person” definition with “associated persons” definition 4.19 Section CD 33(15) to (17) contains a definition of “related person” which mainly relates to determining the amount of the capital gain exclusion from the dividend definition arising from the realisation of a capital asset in the course of a company’s liquidation. 27 4.20 As with the specific associated persons definitions, the definition of “related person” in section CD 33(15) to (17) was probably originally introduced as an ad hoc response to the perceived shortcomings in the general definition of associated persons. The need for a separate related parties definition for dividend exclusion purposes should no longer exist if a standardised, more robust associated persons definition is enacted. For example, the reference in section CD 33(15) to the right to acquire shares in a specified company would be covered by the application of the voting interest concept (employed in the two companies and company-individual tests) to options. 4.21 It would seem possible to replace the “related person” definition in section CD 33(15) to (17) with the standardised definition of associated persons suggested in this paper. The two definitions are conceptually similar and the replacement would constitute a significant simplification measure. Repeal of section OD 1 4.22 Section OD 1 of the Act defines when a company is deemed to be under the control of any persons. This company control definition can be traced back to 1939 in the income tax legislation. 4.23 Although it was used extensively before 1994, section OD 1 now has a relatively limited role and only four sections continue to use its company control definition. Those sections are: • Under section GD 10, a lessor is treated as having derived an amount equal to the market rental of a property that the lessor has leased to related parties for an inadequate consideration. The provision is mainly of an anti-income splitting nature. Section GD 10(4) defines a “related company” as a company that is under the control of the lessor or any relative. • Section NG 14 is an anti-avoidance provision designed to prevent non- resident shareholders of New Zealand-resident companies avoiding NRWT by the technique of dividend stripping. The provision mainly applies when the shares in a New Zealand company under the control of a non-resident are sold to another New Zealand company which the non-resident also controls. If any part of the purchase price for those shares is unpaid, any dividend paid by the first New Zealand company to the second New Zealand company is treated as being derived by the non-resident and therefore subject to NRWT. The provision prevents the retained earnings of a New Zealand-resident company being accessed by a non-resident without incurring NRWT and, together with section GD 10, represents the most important application of section OD 1. • Section DP 8 is a forestry expenditure provision which applies to a company carrying on a forestry business (a “forestry company”) on land acquired partly from the Crown, partly from Māori owners, and partly from a holding company of that company. A “holding company” is defined in section OB 1 for purposes of section DP 8 as a company which has a forestry company under its control. 28 • Under section FZ 1 a company is allowed a deduction for dividends paid on the specified preference shares of that company. The section does not apply to companies under the control of non-residents. Section FZ 1(3) provides that for the purposes of section FZ 1, section OD 1 has effect as if the term “50 percent” were replaced by the term “25 percent”. As section FZ 1 applies only to shares issued between 22 May 1975 and 23 October 1986, it is now of limited relevance. 4.24 It would be a desirable simplification measure if section OD 1 was repealed, with its function in the four operative provisions being performed by the proposed standardised associated persons definition. 4.25 The definition of company control in section OD 1 and the definitions of associated persons in the Act are conceptually similar in that they define related parties for purposes of operative provisions in the Act. The separate use of the section OD 1 company control definition rather than the associated persons definitions is probably a legacy of the company control definition being developed in the Act before the associated persons definitions. As mentioned above, the company control definition in the Act was developed from 1939 whereas the first associated persons definition in the Act was not enacted until 1968. 4.26 We therefore suggest that section OD 1 should be subsumed by the standardised definition of associated persons. It is desirable from a simplification perspective for similar concepts in the Act to be addressed in a single provision. 4.27 Some provisions in other Acts use section OD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The provisions are: • Section 3(4) of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 prevents one of two companies from being appointed manager of a unit trust while the other is appointed the trustee of the unit trust if the two companies are treated under section OD 1 as being controlled by the same person. • Section 74(4) of the Insolvency Act 1967 provides that where, in accordance with section OD 1, a company is treated as being under the control of the bankrupt and certain other persons, the official assignee may be authorised by the Court to examine the records of the company and to examine on oath any shareholder about the affairs of the company. • For the purposes of the Trustee Companies Management Act 1975, a company is considered to be associated with another company if, under section OD 1, the two companies are “deemed to be under the control of substantially the same persons or to consist of substantially the same shareholders”. This reference is out of date because it uses the language in section OD 1 before it was amended in 1994. 29 • For the purposes of the Public Service Investment Society Management Act (No. 2) 1979, a company is considered to be associated with another company if, under section OD 1, the two companies are “deemed to be under the control of substantially the same persons or to consist of substantially the same shareholders”. Again, this reference is out of date because it uses the language in section OD 1 before it was amended in 1994. 4.28 In light of the redundant terminology that many of these provisions use and the suggestion in this paper that section OD 1 be subsumed by a standardised definition of associated persons, it would be sensible for the provisions listed above to also use the standardised associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2004. Clarifying application of section OD 7(1)(b) to corporate trustees 4.29 Section OD 7(1)(b) associates a company and a person other than a company when the person holds 25 percent or more of the voting interests (or market value interests) in the company. It is the policy intention that the corporate look-through rules applying to voting and market value interests in sections OD 3(3)(d) and OD 4(3)(d) do not apply to a corporate trustee (not being a bare trustee). It is therefore not necessary to trace the voting interests (or market value interests) held by a corporate trustee through to the shareholders of that corporate trustee (Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 3, No. 7, April 1992, page 23). Given the non look-through treatment of voting interests held by corporate trustees, it is the practice to treat a corporate trustee as a person other than a company for the purpose of section OD 7(1)(b) (and the equivalent tests in the specific definition of associated persons). The wording of the suggested standardised associated persons definition should make this treatment clear. Omit “income interests” test in section OD 8(3)(a)(ii) 4.30 To facilitate a standardised definition of associated persons, the two- companies test in section OD 8(3)(a)(ii), which is based on income interests, should be omitted as it would appear to be redundant given the two- companies test based on voting interests. The existence of this income interest test can probably be explained by the fact that it preceded the voting interest concept. However, this income interest-based test is no longer necessary as a result of the comprehensive voting interest-based test. Removal of “habitually acting in concert” test 4.31 Two persons are treated as associated persons under section OD 8(3)(j) if they habitually act in concert in relation to the holding or exercise of the items listed in section EX 5(1), which defines direct control interests. 30 4.32 This test would appear to target persons who are not formally associated in the sense of shareholding thresholds (that is, the shareholding threshold- based two companies and company-individual tests) or defined status (for example, trustee-beneficiary or relatives tests), but who nevertheless have a sufficient connection (by virtue of them consciously acting together on a regular basis) to justify treating them as associated. 4.33 Officials consider that the Commissioner would face considerable evidentiary problems in having to show that two parties have acted in concert on a regular basis before the section OD 8(3)(j) test can be applied. In addition, the test creates uncertainty for taxpayers and the Commissioner because what constitutes “habitually acting in concert” is uncertain. 4.34 We therefore consider that the test should be removed from the Act for simplification and rationalisation purposes. Simplifying the second partnership test 4.35 The second partnership test in sections OD 7(1)(d)(ii) and OD 8(3)(f) specifies that a partnership and any person are associated if that person is associated with a partner in the partnership under any of the other provisions in those definitions. The second partnership test in sections OD 8(1)(e) and OD 8(4)(e) does not contain that restriction and can apply when a person is associated with a partner in a partnership under any of the provisions in those definitions. Officials consider that the first approach employed in sections OD 7(1)(d)(ii) and OD 8(3)(f) is unnecessary as it is not possible for the second partnership test to operate in a reiterative manner. Accordingly, the second partnership test in the suggested standardised definition of associated persons does not need an express exclusion. This allows the drafting of the provision to be simplified. Relocation of employee-benefit trust exceptions 4.36 Paragraphs (g), (h) and (i) of section OD 8(3) contain exceptions to the existing trustee-beneficiary, two trustees with a common settlor, and trustee- settlor tests. Thus, the tests do not apply when a trust is settled solely for the benefit of the employees of an employer. The suggested standardised definition of associated persons should retain the employee-benefit exceptions. 4.37 The existing exceptions are wordy and repetitive. Given the employee- benefit trust exceptions’ relatively minor nature in the context of the trust- related associated persons tests, the exceptions would be better located in a separate subsection in the standardised definition so that their extensive detail does not obscure the tests themselves. 31 Omit section OD 8(1)(h) test 4.38 The section OD 8(1)(h) test associating a person and a friendly society, charity, or non-profit body controlled by that person or a relative of that person should be omitted in the suggested standardised associated persons definition. The test is unnecessary given the other extensive associated persons tests applying to companies and trusts. Omit section CD 5(1)(a)(iii) 4.39 Section CD 3 states that a transfer of value from a company to a person is a dividend if the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company, as described in section CD 5. Section CD 5(1)(a)(iii) contains a trust extension rule which treats as a dividend any distribution made by a company to a trust under which a shareholder of the company, or spouse or civil union partner of the shareholder, is a beneficiary. 4.40 The wording of the trust extension rule in section CD 5(1)(a)(iii) catches the situation where a shareholder of the company is also a beneficiary under a trust and the company makes a payment to a trustee of the trust. 4.41 Section CD 5(1)(a)(iii) can be omitted because its function will be subsumed by the suggested standardised associated persons definition 5 – in particular, the trustee-beneficiary test. Section CD 14(9) amendment 4.42 The definition of “fifteen percent interest reduction” in section CD 14(9), which is relevant to the share buy-back exclusion from the dividend definition, refers to “counted associate” which is defined inter alia as “a trustee of a trust under which a spouse, civil union partner or minor child of the shareholder is a beneficiary”. The wording should be amended to be made consistent with other references in associated persons definitions which describe discretionary beneficiaries. Therefore, the relevant part of the definition of “counted associate” in section CD 14(9) should be amended to read as follows: “a spouse, civil union partner or minor child of the shareholder, or a trustee of a trust under which a spouse, civil union partner or minor child of the shareholder has benefited or is eligible to benefit”. 5 In conjunction with section CD 5(1)(a)(ii). 32 Section DB 33(2) amendment 4.43 Section DB 33(1) allows a taxpayer a deduction for any loss arising through misappropriation by an employee. Section DB 33(2) states that this deduction is not available where the taxpayer and the defalcating employee are associated in certain respects. These associated persons situations are where: “(a) the person who misappropriates the property is a relative of the person who carries on the business; or (b) the business is carried on by a company, and— (i) the company and the person who misappropriates the property are associated persons; or (ii) the company and a relative of the person who misappropriates the property are associated persons; or (c) the person who carries on the business is a trustee of a trust, and the person who misappropriates the property either created the trust, settled property on the trust, or is a beneficiary of the trust.” 4.44 Under the suggested standardised definition of associated persons, it would seem that the above references could be simply replaced with a reference to: “Nothing in subsection (1) shall apply to any misappropriation of property of any kind by any person in any case where that person is associated with the person who carries on the business.” 4.45 The standardised definition would be comprehensive enough to cover all the relationships mentioned in the current section DB 33(2).

It will operate alongside other policies and measures to reduce overall domestic emissions. 1.2 The introduction of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme will have taxation consequences. The purpose of this paper is to consider some of the possible income tax and GST implications of the scheme and initiate discussion with stakeholders. It discusses the treatment of income and expenditure under the scheme generally and then deals with the forestry sector, which is proposed to be the first entrant. 1.3 On 20 September 2007 the government released The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme and the companion document, Forestry in a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme. 1 They set out the core design features of an emissions trading scheme as well as details of how the scheme might apply to the forestry sector. 1.4 Public engagement on the detailed design and implementation of the scheme will be a long-term process. The proposal is for all sectors and all greenhouse gases to be covered by the scheme by 2013. The first stage of the engagement process focuses on the core design features of the scheme and detailed design for the forestry sector, for which the proposed entry date is 1 January 2008, and the liquid fossil fuels sector, for which the proposed entry date is 1 January 2009. 1.5 A number of tax issues arise as a result of the proposed scheme. Core tax issues include the treatment of emissions obligations, the consequences of free allocation of emission units, and the timing of recognition of income and expenditure. The forestry issues are more specific to that sector. 1.6 This issues paper has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and from the Treasury and the Emissions Trading Group as part of the consultative process. Feedback on the paper will be taken into account in determining whether a legislative response is required to deal with tax issues arising from the emissions trading scheme for the forestry sector, and other sectors as staged implementation of the scheme proceeds. 1.7 There are various ways we can approach tax issues arising from the scheme. They range from developing a comprehensive code to relying totally on the application of general taxation principles. Somewhere in between is an approach that relies primarily on current law, clarifying it where necessary. 1 These documents are available electronically at www.climatechange.govt.nz. 2 1.8 Our initial preference is to focus on areas where clarification of the law might be required, contemporaneously with the staged implementation of the emissions trading scheme. This recognises that there are principles and models within the current tax system that should be appropriate to this new regulatory instrument, while maintaining the flexibility to clarify legislation where the outcomes are highly uncertain or the treatment under current law could undermine the policy objectives of the scheme. 1.9 This paper is a starting point for discussion. It is based on what we know about the likely design of the emissions trading scheme as at September 2007. Development of an appropriate approach to the taxation of income and expenditure arising from the scheme will be a progressive process. The paper presents some preliminary views on which to start the consultative process with participants in the scheme and the financial and tax accounting community. It is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all the implications of the emissions trading scheme for tax purposes, but rather a consideration of several key areas. SUMMARY OF SUGGESTED TAX TREATMENT Income and expenditure (sectors other than forestry) Expenditure associated with a participant meeting obligations under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme should be a deductible expense and recognised on an accruals or emerging basis over time. Income from the allocation of free emission units (NZUs) should be recognised as taxable income on an emerging basis over time. This means the income is recognised on a systematic basis in the same periods as the expenditures for which the NZUs are intended to compensate the recipient. Market values should be used to determine the value of the accrued income or expenditure at balance dates. The forestry sector – forests planted before 1990 For pre-1990 forests, free emissions units (NZUs) will be allocated to recognise that the scheme will have an impact on land values, since there will be a potential liability if land use changes, for example, from forestry to dairy. Free allocation of units in this case should generally be treated as capital and remain outside the tax base. Equally, liabilities arising if land use does change will generally be an expense associated with preparing the land for a new use, capital in nature and non-deductible. 3 Forestry sector – forests planted after 1989 For post-1989 forests, income in the form of emissions units (NZUs) will be earned when there is a net increase in carbon stocks stored in forests. This will provide a new income stream to forest owners. It should be treated as being of a revenue account nature and therefore taxable. Obligations under the scheme will arise when there is a net decline in carbon stocks stored in a forest, primarily as a result of harvest. The costs of meeting emissions obligations are an expense that should be tax-deductible. There are problems, however, in relation to the timing of recognition of accruing obligations for harvesting post-1989 forests. Several options are suggested to ameliorate this. They include: • recognising income from NZUs as it is received and allowing a deduction for expenditure on an emerging basis provided there is an intention to harvest; • deferring recognition of income from, and deductions for expenditure on, NZUs until an NZU is used to settle an obligation arising from the scheme or is sold. Goods and services tax In relation to GST, we suggest that, in line with the one-rate, minimal exceptions structure of the GST base, NZUs be treated in the same way as any other goods or services supplied by a registered person. 1.10 Submissions on the forestry issues arising from the introduction of the proposed scheme should be made by 28 October 2007. Submissions on the general tax issues should be made by 30 November 2007. Submissions should be addressed to: Emissions Trading Scheme – Tax Issues C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “ETS Tax” in the subject line. 1.11 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to contact those making submissions to discuss their submission, if required. 4 1.12 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those who consider there is any part of their submission that should properly be withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. 5 Chapter 2 THE NEW ZEALAND EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME 2.1 This chapter sets out some of the core policy objectives and features of the proposed New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme. 2.2 The scheme will introduce into the economy a price for greenhouse gas emissions. The desired outcome is a change in investment and consumption behaviours as a result of changes in the relative prices of high-emission and low-emission goods and services. 2.3 Integrating the price of emissions into the economy happens by placing an obligation on some entities that emit greenhouse gases, or supply products that create emissions when used by consumers, to monitor, report and pay (in emissions units) for actual emissions, or emission equivalents. These entities are referred to as “points of obligation”. 2.4 Points of obligation will not always be entities that emit greenhouse gases. 2 That is not necessary because the price signal created by an emissions trading scheme will flow through the market supply chain. The increase in costs associated with the introduction of a scheme of this nature will be reflected in increased prices for high emission goods and services. The cost increases will be passed on to consumers further down the supply chain, influencing production and consumption decisions. 2.5 Conversely, the introduction of a price for emissions will reduce the relative prices of low-emissions goods and services and increase the relative returns of investment in low-emission technologies. 2.6 Implementation of the proposed scheme will be through a transitional pathway that provides for gradual adjustment to emissions pricing across the economy. Transitional assistance will vary by sector and may include delayed entry and free allocation of emissions units. The proposed entry dates for different sectors are: 3 Sectors Monitoring and reporting begin End of initial compliance period Forestry (includes deforestation of pre-1990 forest land and afforestation post-1989) 1 January 2008 31 December 2009 (first compliance period is 2 years) Liquid fossil fuels (mainly transport) 1 January 2009 31 December 2009 Stationary energy (includes coal, gas and geothermal) 1 January 2010 31 December 2010 2 Decisions regarding participants with obligations will be based on other criteria, such as minimising compliance costs and the feasibility of monitoring and verifying emissions. 3 From The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, Ministry for the Environment and the Treasury, September 2007. 6 Sectors Monitoring and reporting begin End of initial compliance period Industrial process (non-energy) emissions 1 January 2010 31 December 2010 Agriculture (includes pastoral and arable farming and horticulture) 1 January 2013 31 December 2013 Waste 1 January 2013 31 December 2013 Core features of the scheme 2.7 The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme will follow a “cap and trade” model that operates within the cap on emissions set by the Kyoto Protocol for the first commitment period (2008 to 2012). 2.8 It will include three main types of participants: those with obligations to surrender emissions units to cover their direct emissions or the emissions associated with their products; those that receive freely allocated emissions units or receive them from afforestation; and those that engage in trading activities to take advantage of market opportunities. 2.9 A New Zealand Unit (NZU) will be the primary domestic unit of trade. Participants will have an obligation to surrender to the government one emissions unit to cover each metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e) 4 emissions. 2.10 The scheme will generally operate for an annual period called the compliance period (1 January to 31 December). Participants will be required to calculate emissions, retain sufficient records to allow verification of emissions calculations, and report emissions on an annual basis at the end of the compliance period. 2.11 At some point during the compliance period, the Crown will allocate NZUs to participants in the scheme, either free of charge or by selling them by auction. The first forestry-related NZUs will most likely be issued in 2009. NZUs can also be purchased on the secondary market. 2.12 Once they obtain NZUs, participants will be able to: • hold them to meet the expected level of future emissions obligations, which will minimise any risk associated with adverse price movements between the date acquired and settlement; or • sell some or all of them in the expectation of later buying NZUs equal to the quantity of emissions in the compliance period or, if not a participant with obligations, sell NZUs to offset increased input costs. 4 The quantity of a given greenhouse gas multiplied by its global warming potential, which equates its global warming impact relative to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). This is the standard unit for comparing the degree of warming that can be caused by emissions of different greenhouse gases. 7 2.13 The emissions trading scheme will be designed for both sales to, and purchases from, international trading markets. 2.14 An active market for emissions units is important as it will establish clear price signals. Market prices will be the source of information for valuing assets and liabilities arising from the scheme for tax and presumably accounting purposes. The market in New Zealand will be small initially but will be expected to grow as other sectors enter the scheme over time. Linking the scheme to international markets should ensure access to a carbon price developed in active, open and deeper markets, with willing buyers and sellers. 2.15 At the end of the compliance period a participant with obligations must surrender NZUs equal to its reported emissions. 2.16 Non-compliance with obligations under the scheme will attract penalties. 2.17 Further details of the two forestry emissions trading scheme mechanisms are discussed in Chapter 4, which also deals with the forestry-specific tax issues. 8 Chapter 3 CORE TAX ISSUES – SECTORS OTHER THAN FORESTRY 3.1 This chapter outlines our preliminary views on the deductibility of expenditure arising from emissions obligations and derivation of income associated with free allocation of emissions units (NZUs) for sectors other than forestry. It also discusses timing issues. 3.2 In many areas, taxation policies are linked to accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles. However, there is currently no authoritative guidance on accounting for emissions trading, and a number of different practices have emerged. 5 3.3 Our approach, therefore, is to look at the underlying nature of the transactions involved and their economic consequences and consider how these outcomes could fit within the structure of current tax law. Recognition of income and expenditure Emissions obligations 3.4 Once the emissions trading scheme is up and running, companies will be affected either directly, through the obligation to account for their own emissions or emissions embedded in products they sell, or indirectly. An indirect consequence arises when a company downstream from a firm with obligations faces higher prices as a result of emissions pricing. For example, businesses will face increased fuel or electricity charges because a large proportion of the cost of emissions obligations imposed on fuel companies or electricity generators is expected to be passed on to consumers in these sectors. 3.5 Under current tax law, persons carrying on a business can claim a deduction against their taxable income for expenditure incurred in carrying on that business. Deductions are not available for expenditure that is of a capital nature. 3.6 When the consequences of the emissions trading scheme are indirect the costs will typically be deductible under standard income tax rules. Deductions will be for items of a revenue account nature, such as increased input costs, incurred in the course of carrying on a business. 5 The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee issued IFRIC 3 Emissions Rights in December 2004. It was subsequently withdrawn in June 2005. A survey of accounting practices conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the International Emissions Trading Association, “Trouble Entry Accounting”, discusses accounting approaches adopted by companies participating in the EU ETS. 9 3.7 When the consequences of the scheme are direct, as they will be for oil companies in the liquid fossil fuels sector, for example, the cost is also an incident or consequence of doing business. The obligation under the scheme will arise because emissions are released in the process of production or because of the embedded emissions content of products is emitted on use by downstream consumers. Frequently, but not always, this cost will be reflected in increased income. It is an annual cost associated with the production process, from which income arises in a particular year. Our view, therefore, is that the costs of meeting emissions obligations are an expense that should be deductible under current tax law. 3.8 Treating the additional costs associated with the scheme on the same basis for both direct and indirect costs (expenses deductible for increased costs and/or emissions obligations) is an equitable approach. It ensures that one firm does not face harsher after-tax consequences than another as a result of emissions pricing, since costs for emissions units are not tax-deductible. Treatment of free NZUs 3.9 New Zealand businesses will face increased costs of production under the proposed scheme as a result of higher energy and fuel prices and/or the requirement to surrender NZUs to cover their emissions. Many businesses will be able to pass a portion of these costs on to consumers, reducing the impact on their profitability. Some, however, will not be able to pass the bulk of their increased costs on, resulting in profit impacts and, potentially, a loss of competitiveness. The government has agreed in principle to smooth the transition for some businesses in sectors that are disproportionately affected by the introduction of the scheme and has established principles to guide the level and duration of allocation. 3.10 The government is proposing free allocation of NZUs to some industrial producers. They would be producers that have direct obligations or who are affected indirectly and who may face declines in profitability from increased electricity costs and/or obligations arising from direct stationary energy and industrial process emissions. 6 3.11 The effect of free allocation is to reduce the impact on these producers of the emissions trading scheme during the transition to full internalisation of emission pricing. 3.12 The number of units given to each business is likely to be determined with regard to its share of the relevant industry’s overall emissions in a recent year. No adjustment is intended over time to reflect changes in emissions or output levels. Allocation will take place on an annual basis, for each compliance year, and will begin in 2010. 6 Owners of forests planted before 1990 will also receive compensation for the negative impacts of the emissions trading scheme on land values. See the discussion on the forestry sector. 10 3.13 The free allocation, or “gift”, of NZUs is, in effect, compensation for revenue account expenses that are associated with emissions obligations or other costs arising from the scheme that will result in a reduction in business profitability. On the face of it, therefore, the allocation of free units should be either taxable income or represent a reduction in deductible expenditure. 3.14 The value of the income received is likely to be clear as NZUs will have a market value. Determining reductions in deductible expenditure is less certain as those facing increased indirect costs might not be able to quantify the proportion of those costs associated with emissions pricing in the context of price movements generally. 3.15 The interaction between the allocation of free units and the possible tax treatment is important, given that the tax system generally provides, through deductions for increased expenses, a means of ameliorating some of the impacts of an emissions trading scheme on business profitability. This is limited to items within the tax base (with capital losses, in many cases, remaining outside the tax base). Inappropriate tax treatment could result in firms receiving less financial assistance from the government than intended or receiving additional compensation. Either way, this could undermine in part the objectives of free allocation of units. Example 1 illustrates the problem. Example 1: Trade-exposed company receiving a free allocation of NZUs Company A creates its own emissions from production processes. It also faces increased costs as a result of purchases of electricity, which have an embedded carbon content. The company exports all its products. Its competitors do not face carbon costs. None of the increased costs can be passed on. Increased costs are estimated to be $100 before tax. They are deductible expenses. 10 NZUs, valued at $10 each, are allocated to ameliorate the impacts of the scheme. The allocation is calculated on a pre-tax basis. No tax on free NZUs Tax on free NZUs Initial value of NZUs to firm +$100 +$100 After-tax value +$100 +$70 Deductible expenditure -$100 -$100 Tax effect deductible expenditure +$30 +$30 Benefit to the firm +130 +100 When free allocation is exempt from tax, over-compensation results. The firm is better off by $30 as a result of the combined effect of the pre-tax calculation of the compensation payment and tax effect of deductible expenditure. When the allocation is taxable, the intended outcome – the firm being compensated by $100 – is achieved. 11 3.16 Given these considerations, we suggest that the best approach, from a policy perspective, is to treat free allocation of NZUs as taxable income. Timing issues Emissions obligations 3.17 Having suggested that obligations arising under the emissions trading scheme are deductible expenditure, we now turn to the question of timing of the deduction. 3.18 Companies will be required to surrender obligations equal to reported emissions annually, after the end of each compliance year (1 January to 31 December). Those with direct obligations will be obliged to calculate their level of emissions using approved methods, retain records to allow verification and report levels of emissions at the end of each compliance period. 3.19 A company’s income year and the end of the compliance year in many instances will not coincide, however. The settlement of obligations will therefore, at least partially, relate to a financial and tax reporting period earlier than the time of surrender of NZUs. 3.20 Presumably, however, given the intention for there to be approved methods for measuring emissions, those with obligations should, at an interim date, be able to calculate the level of emissions resulting from production processes and/or throughput of emission-intensive products. If market values for NZUs or the international equivalent are available the deferred liability can be valued. It will be the balance date market price of the number of NZUs needed to cover measured emissions up until the balance date. A market valuation assumes that there is an active, open and deep market in an instrument with willing buyers and sellers. This may not be the case initially for NZUs, but is likely to develop over time. 3.21 Under standard tax analysis, it would seem that a deduction for an expense of this nature should be available on an accrual basis when incurred. Under current tax law, expenditure or loss is incurred at the point at which the taxpayer is “definitively committed” to the outgoing or when the taxpayer actually becomes liable to pay it. It is not necessary that there should have been an actual disbursement of funds. 3.22 This is what will occur with accruing obligations to surrender NZUs to satisfy an obligation under the emissions trading scheme. Given that the obligation to surrender emissions units is statutory and therefore unavoidable, and that it should be possible to ascertain accrued obligations with a high degree of certainty at an intervening balance date, we suggest that current law provides a suitable basis for deducting emissions costs on an emerging basis. 12 3.23 As noted in the previous section, companies who indirectly bear the costs of emissions but have no obligations under the scheme will seemingly automatically receive tax deductions for increased costs on an emerging basis as they use products and services that have an embedded emissions component. Enabling a deduction for those with obligations as that obligation accrues ensures similar treatment between business taxpayers, whether they face the consequences of the emissions trading scheme directly or indirectly. Free allocation of emissions units 3.24 Participants in the scheme at balance date may hold NZUs issued for no consideration, or purchased at a market price from other participants in the scheme or the government at auction. There is no obligation, however, to hold units. Some participants with obligations may not hold any at a balance date. 3.25 As suggested earlier, the costs for which free NZUs will be issued (obligations under the scheme or increased expenditure as a result of it) should be deductible on an emerging basis. 3.26 At first sight, the free supply of NZUs will be an asset of a company as soon as there is confirmation of the quantity to be issued and, for tax purposes, may well be recognised as income on receipt. However, it would seem sensible, given the proposed approach to expenditure associated with NZUs, to recognise the annual supply of free credits on an emerging basis over the period to which the allocation relates. This means the income associated with free allocations would be recognised on a systematic basis in the same periods as the expenditures for which they are intended to compensate the recipient. 3.27 The recognition of income from free allocations of NZUs should, in theory, relate to the company’s emerging expenditure. The method could be pro rata up to balance date or in proportion to the measured emissions if the recipient is a point of obligation, or can otherwise measure them. This may require an annual estimation of the costs arising from the scheme to enable pro rata allocation of income over the relevant period. 3.28 Valuation of income at balance date would be the market value of NZUs that have been recognised in that period. 3.29 Examples 2 and 3 illustrate the suggested tax treatment of expenditure arising from emissions obligations and income associated with the free allocation of NZUs. 13 Example 2: Company with emissions obligations/no free allocation of NZUs Company A is a participant in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme. The compliance period is from 1 January to 31 December. This example deals with the tax implications that arise in respect of this period. Company A has an annual balance date of 30 June. In the six months to 30 June it has emitted 600 tonnes of CO 2 -e. The market price for NZUs is $11 at 30 June. At the end of the year company A formally measures its emissions for the compliance period. It has emitted 1050 tonnes of CO 2 -e. The market price for NZUs at the end of the year is $12. Company A buys its 1050 NZUs at this price. Amounts to be included in the company’s tax accounts for the six months to 30 June Deduction as at 30 June -$ 6,600 (600 \* $11) Amounts to included in the company’s tax accounts in the following income year (calculated on measured emissions to 31 December) Deduction year to 31 December -$12,600 (1050\*$12) Less deducted at 30 June -$ 6,600 Deduction as at 31 December -$ 6,000 This outcome can also be illustrated as follows: Total cost for emissions period = 1050 \* 12.00 = -$12,600 $11.00$12.00 Year ended 30 June 2010 Deduction to 30 June = 600 \* 11.00 = -$6,600 Year ended 30 June 2011 (in relation to emissions period to 31 December 2010) Total cost year to 31 December = 1050 \* 12-$12,600 Less deducted to date-$6,600 Net tax position-$6,000 Price of emission units 00 00 00 0 00 00105010500 Number of units on hand Deductions n/a Feb Jan 2010Mar 2011 MarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecJanFeb Note that the wash-up deduction at 31 December incorporates the price adjustment from the 30 June balance date value of $11/NZU to the actual value of $12/NZU. We do not believe that any tax law change is necessary to achieve these outcomes. 14 Example 3: Company with emissions obligations and free allocation of NZUs Assume company A has obligations as in Example 2 and on the first day of the compliance period receives free 1000 NZUs for the year equivalent to 1000 tonnes of CO 2 -e emissions. At 30 June it estimates its emissions for the year to 31 December will be 1100 tonnes. Actual emissions for the year are 1050 CO 2 -e. The company would calculate its expenditure for the relevant income years in the same manner as set out in example 1. Treatment of the free allocation of NZUs The free allocation of NZUs is accrued over the period to which the allocation relates – the compliance year to 31 December. This allocation could be pro-rata over time or pro-rata to the annual estimate of emissions. In this example the income is accrued pro-rata to the estimated emissions for the year to 31 December. At 30 June, the end of Company A’s income year, the market price for NZUs is $11. The amount of income is calculated pro rata to estimated emissions for the year – 600/1100\*1000\*$11= $6000. For the period 1 January to 31 December 1000 NZUs are recognised. The market price for NZUs at 31 December is $12. The additional 50 NZUs required to settle are purchased at this price. Amounts to be included in the company’s tax accounts for the six months to 30 June Income from free NZUs $ 6,000 Less deduction as at 30 June -$ 6,600 (600 \* $11) Net gain (loss) -$ 600 Amounts to included in the company’s tax accounts in the following income year (calculated on measured emissions to 31 December) Income from free NZUs $12,000 (1000 \* $12) Less income to 30 June -$ 6,000 $ 6,000 Deduction year to 31 December -$12,600 (1050 \* $12) Less deducted at 30 June -$ 6,600 -$ 6,000 Net tax position for the six months to 31 December $ 0 15 This outcome can also be illustrated as follows: Net cost for emissions period = 50 \* 12.00 = -$600 Year ended 30 June 2011 (in relation to emissions period to 31 December 2010) Total cost year to 31 December = 50 \* 12-$600 Less deducted to date-$600 Net tax position$0 Price of emission units 01000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1050 10500 Number of units on hand Net deductions $12.00$11.00 Year ended 30 June 2010 Deduction to 30 June = 600 \* 11.00-$6,600 Income to 30 June = 600 / 1100 \* 1000 \* 11$6,000 Net tax position-$600 Feb Jan 2010Mar 2011 MarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecJanFeb n/a The net cost of $600 for the year equals the actual cost of purchasing 50 NZUs at $12/NZU. To achieve this result, tax law changes seem to be necessary, to confirm that the free allocation of units is income, and to spread the income over the period to which the allocation relates. Emissions units held at balance date 3.30 Some firms might hold NZUs in excess of the emerging obligation. Consistent with an accrual treatment, these NZUs should also be revalued to the market price. Submission points Deductions Do you consider that the costs associated with meeting emission obligations are deductible expenses under standard tax analysis? Income from free allocation Does it seem reasonable to tax the income from free allocations of NZUs? If so, is a law change necessary to achieve this? 16 Timing Do you think that using an accrual based method of matching income from free allocations and direct expenses to meet obligations on an emerging basis over time is appropriate? How do you envisage these measurement issues might be handled from a financial accounting perspective? Is our analysis of the timing of the deduction under current tax law correct? Should the tax laws be amended to confirm timing of recognition of income from free allocation of NZUs? 17 Chapter 4 CORE TAX ISSUES – FORESTRY SECTOR 4.1 This chapter outlines tax issues for the forestry sector that will arise from the introduction of the proposed emissions trading scheme. 7 It starts by setting out the distinguishing features of this sector and then deals with tax issues. Features of the scheme for forestry 4.2 For purposes of the emissions trading scheme, there are two quite distinct elements of the forestry industry: afforestation and deforestation. Government proposals include both afforestation and deforestation in the scheme. 4.3 From 1 January 2008, the government will allocate NZUs for increases in carbon stored in post-1989 forests. Owners will also be responsible for future liabilities when this carbon is released (for example, when the trees are harvested). Owners of these forests will be given the choice to opt into the scheme and receive their share of the relevant sink credits and assume future emission liabilities. This will provide an incentive for new forest planting and an additional income stream for owners of forests already planted. 4.4 Owners of pre-1990 forests will face obligations under the scheme if they deforest. Deforestation means converting pre-1990 forest land to non-forest land. It does not include forest harvesting and replanting or allowing the forest to regenerate. The policy objective of placing liabilities on pre-1990 forest owners is to limit deforestation by making landowners face the full cost of emissions. Placing obligations on the owners of forest land to surrender an NZU for every tonne of emissions from deforestation is likely to affect land values. A free allocation of units to this group is proposed in recognition of the impact of the scheme. 4.5 The main difference between the forestry sector and other participants in the scheme is that the forestry sector both sequesters carbon (and for post-1989 forests can be rewarded for this with emissions units) and is an emitter of carbon upon harvest or deforestation, at which time a liability may arise. For non-forestry participants the focus is on expenditure associated with meeting an obligation – participants are emitters or dealing in products that release emissions on use by a downstream consumer. 4.6 Further, obligations under the scheme will arise in two different situations. A deforestation liability will arise for pre-1990 forests when land use changes. The liability is associated with the land. A harvest liability for post-1989 forests, on the other hand, arises only when the trees are felled. This is associated with a forestry activity – the growing of trees. 7 It does not cover tax matters that might arise as a result of other initiatives such as the Permanent Forest Sink Initiative or Afforestation Grant Scheme. 18 4.7 This paper is limited to commercial exotic forests. The framework document has suggested indigenous forests could also be included within the emissions trading scheme framework. If that proposal proceeds, the tax implications will need to be considered. Tax issues for forests planted before 1990 Deforestation expenditure 4.8 The core obligation for people deforesting land will be to report annually, to an administering agency, any area that has been deforested; calculate (using formulas provided for the purpose) the emissions associated with this deforestation; and surrender a number of NZUs or other acceptable units equal to the calculated emissions. 4.9 The obligation is associated with a change in land use, from forestry to some other activity. At first sight, change in land use is generally a matter of capital for taxation purposes, although concessions in tax law might make some of that capital expenditure deductible. 4.10 In our view, therefore, expenditure to satisfy any obligation arising from deforestation of pre-1990 forests should generally be a non-deductible expense. Income from receipt of credits 4.11 The government has proposed that all participants in this group receive compensation in the form of free allocations of NZUs using an agreed mechanism (possibly pro rata to hectares of qualifying pre-1990 forest land owned). It is intended that the NZUs be issued for both commitment period 1 (CP1 2008 to 2012) and CP2, most likely as a one-off transfer. CP2 NZUs will not be able to be used to meet obligations under the scheme before the beginning of CP2 in 2013. 4.12 The policy objective behind issue of free emissions units for pre-1990 forests is to recognise that the scheme will have an impact on land values and to meet the government’s commitment to absorb some of the cost of deforestation in CP1. This liability for deforestation, unlike changes in carbon stocks based on forestry growth and felling cycles, is a liability associated with a decision to change the use of the land from forestry. 4.13 Change in land use is typically an affair of capital under current taxation rules. Consistent with our view that the taxation of NZUs should fit, where possible, within the current structure of tax law, the receipt of credits should also generally be treated as a receipt of a capital nature and remain outside the tax base. 4.14 A problem in relation to the time-value of money may arise if post-dated NZUs that relate to CP2 are issued in CP1, as may happen. This will need careful consideration. 19 Tax issues for forests planted after 1989 4.15 Owners of post-1989 forests will have the opportunity to elect to participate in the emissions trading scheme and to receive NZUs for increases in carbon stored in their forests, while also accepting the associated liabilities should the carbon stored in their forests reduce. If a forest owner elects to stay out of the scheme there are no emissions trading consequences. 4.16 At least for the first commitment period, those who join the scheme will have the following core obligations: • Report to the administering agency, at a minimum at the end of each accounting period (five years maximum for CP1), any carbon stock changes in those post-1989 forest areas. • Calculate, using guidelines provided for the purpose, the removals (increased carbon stocks) and/or emissions (reduced carbon stocks) associated with this forest. Reduced carbon stock could arise from harvesting and/or deforestation. • Receive a quantity of units equal to the calculated removals or surrender an amount of NZUs or other acceptable units equal to the calculated emissions (limited to the amount of NZUs allocated previously for carbon sequestration on the same land). 4.17 Carbon stock assessments are required, at a minimum, at the end of each commitment period, although participants could report on an annual basis, if they wished to receive NZUs annually. Carbon stock assessments report a net change in carbon – gains from growth minus losses from, for example, harvest or fire. Owners of post-1989 forests will therefore receive income in the form of credits as their forest grows to maturity (carbon stock increase) and incur expenditure when the forest is progressively harvested (carbon stock decline). 4.18 The net carbon stock profile of a forest over time will vary from forest to forest. For example, converting pasture to forest that is permanently managed by way of rotational harvesting and replanting will result in a lasting increase in net carbon stocks, and therefore a net gain in units to the participant. On the other hand, carbon stocks in an existing forest that enters the scheme could fall below their initial level, at which point the participant would be liable for the net decline in carbon stock. A forest estate of one age class will face a large reduction in carbon stocks on harvest, while an estate with a mix of age classes will face more-moderate changes, with carbon stock decreases balanced by the growth of younger trees. 8 These various profiles complicate the tax analysis. 8 See Forestry in a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, September 2007, pages 35–37, for examples of different profiles. 20 Income from receipt of credits 4.19 There will be no free allocations of NZUs for owners of post-1989 forests. Allocations are in consideration for the sequestration of carbon in forests. 4.20 The receipt of NZUs would appear to be an incident of growing trees. Growing trees for harvest is deemed, for tax purposes, to be a revenue account activity. Given this, the periodic entitlement to credits based on changes in carbon stocks is a revenue account matter. 4.21 In theory, this appears to be a sensible approach – credits are earned as the carbon sequestered in a forest increases. The allocation of NZUs enables a monetary value to be placed on this embedded carbon as it emerges over time. Expenditure from harvesting or deforestation 4.22 A participant with obligations will either hold emissions units received to offset a future liability upon harvest or purchase NZUs in a market to settle the liability. 4.23 As will occur for other sectors, the obligation will arise because of the business activities of the forest owner. A deduction should be available as a revenue account matter. The more difficult question is one of the appropriate timing for tax purposes. Timing issues 4.24 We have noted that the income, received as a forest matures, from carbon sequestration should be recognised on an emerging basis – in other words, when there is a net increase in carbon based on the carbon stock assessment – and could be taxable on receipt. Applying the approach suggested for non- forestry participants in the scheme, the expectation would be that a deduction should be available for an emerging liability in relation to the future obligation to surrender NZUs for declines in carbon stocks on harvest (but only when harvest is planned or intended). A deduction of this nature would offset income arising from the allocation of credits and give an appropriate economic result. 4.25 In the case of a forest, however, the timing of the expense is much more uncertain. This is because the obligation, unlike one based on annual product throughput or actual emissions associated with production processes in a year, is a harvest obligation, and there is generally some flexibility around the harvest decision and its timing. Before harvest, the obligation may be contingent. In effect, to allow a deduction on an emerging basis is closer to allowing a deduction for a provision, rather than a near certainty. 21 4.26 Options for dealing with this include: • recognising income from NZUs as it is received and allowing a deduction for expenditure on an emerging basis provided there is an intention to harvest; or • deferring recognition of income from, and deductions for expenditure on, NZUs until an NZU is used to settle an obligation arising from the NZ ETS or is sold. 4.27 We do not have a strong views on a preferred option, and there may well be others. We are interested in engaging with the industry on this matter and, in particular, discussing how assets resulting from periodic receipt of NZUs and liabilities associated with future obligations will be measured for financial reporting purposes. Submission points Pre-1990 forests Do you consider that income from free allocation of NZUs to owners of pre-1990 forest land is a matter of capital and should be outside the tax base? Conversely, do you consider that liabilities under the scheme arising from deforestation are associated with change of land use and should also be a matter of capital? In your view, does the law need to be amended to clarify this? Post-1989 forests Is characterising the receipt of NZUs for increases in net carbon stocks as income associated with a forestry business reasonable? Do you think obligations under the scheme, on the other hand, are incurred when the trees are harvested? Can this future obligation be estimated with any degree of certainty? How do you think the income and expenditure resulting from the scheme will be accounted for financial reporting purposes? Is an accounting method whereby income from and expenditure on NZUs is recognised on sale or surrender a viable approach? 22 Chapter 5 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 5.1 This chapter summarises our preliminary views on the treatment of NZUs under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 5.2 In New Zealand, GST is applied at a single rate, with minimal exemptions. Our view, from a policy perspective, is that NZUs should also fall within the GST base if supplied by GST-registered persons. 5.3 The following comments regarding the likely GST implications arising from the emissions trading scheme (as with possible income tax consequences) are based on the information currently available. The actual outcome will be a consequence of the legal framework that is eventually established. For the purposes of this paper, we have assumed that NZUs will be issued by a public authority (as lawfully delegated agent of the Crown). Public authorities are registered for GST and have an obligation to charge GST on the supply of goods and services. 5.4 The broad consequences of including NZUs in the GST base are: • NZUs will be treated as a supply of services – being a chose in action – rather than personal or real property and will be subject to GST when traded by a registered person in a secondary market. • NZUs that are gifted by a registered person will be treated as a supply for no consideration. • NZUs that are sold, through auction, by the Crown through a public authority will be subject to GST. • Registered persons that acquire taxable NZUs for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies will be entitled to claim input tax deductions under ordinary principles. • NZUs sold by registered persons to non-residents will generally be zero-rated. From the information available the units do not appear to be directly connected with land or movable property. • NZUs acquired from non-resident businesses and foreign governments by persons in New Zealand will be treated, for GST purposes, as an imported service. Such imports may give rise to a GST liability on the importer under the reverse charge rules. 5.5 Over time, it is anticipated that traders in the NZUs will become active to take advantage of market opportunities. There could potentially be some concerns around the impact of the GST treatment proposed for traders who normally deal in financial services, such as shares or certain futures contracts, which are generally exempt for GST purposes. Submissions on this point are welcome. 23 Submission point Do you envisage any problems with treating NZUs as a supply of services that is subject to GST when supplied by a registered person?

It sought feedback on proposals for a major revamp of our international tax rules, to improve the competitiveness of New Zealand companies operating overseas. The main proposal was to relax the controlled foreign company tax rules by introducing a tax exemption for active income from the offshore operations of New Zealand businesses. Rather than make concrete proposals for the implementation of the exemption, it canvassed the various approaches taken in other countries and indicated the broad direction and approach of the proposed reform. 1.2 Officials then engaged in an extensive consultation process with businesses. Forty-eight written submissions on the ideas set out in the discussion document were received. This consultation and feedback has been invaluable in enabling the government to assemble a balanced package of reforms that is appropriate for New Zealand. 1.3 In May 2007, New Zealand’s International Tax Review: An Update, was released to inform businesses about the government’s in-principle policy decisions to date, setting out how the various components fit together. 1.4 This issues paper builds on the government’s earlier discussion document and update to provide more detailed suggestions for the design of the new international tax rules for controlled foreign companies (CFCs). We are seeking the views of companies that have offshore operations or are contemplating offshore expansion on how these proposals may affect their business. 1.5 The next step will be to analyse submissions on the suggestions presented here and make formal recommendations to the government on how the proposed reform should be developed. The aim is to introduce next year a bill that gives effect to the reform. 1.6 This issues paper does not cover transitional and consequential matters associated with the planned reforms. Those matters, including issues related to the repeal of the conduit rules, the treatment of existing attributed CFC net losses and carried-forward foreign tax credits, and changes to the treatment of foreign dividends, will be covered in a separate issues paper due for release later this year. The treatment of non-portfolio foreign investment funds (FIFs) and branches will be the subject of further discussion and consultation next year. 2 SUMMARY OF SUGGESTED TAX TREATMENT Active business test (chapter 3) • No income will be attributable from controlled foreign companies (CFCs) that have passive income (including base company services income) of less than 5% of their total gross income. This is the active business test. • Taxpayers may elect to calculate the percentage of passive income based on data from any one of the following three alternatives: – information from audited accounts that comply with NZ IFRS; – information from the CFC’s audited accounts that comply with IFRS; or – New Zealand tax concepts of passive and total income. • Taxpayers will be given the choice to apply the active business test to either the sub-consolidated income of wholly owned CFC interests within a particular jurisdiction, or to the income of individual CFC within the jurisdiction. They may choose to sub-consolidate only some of their wholly-owned CFCs in a jurisdiction. Income from shares (chapter 4) • Ordinary dividends 1 from shares held by CFCs in other CFCs or FIFs will be disregarded under the new CFC rules if they are tax-exempt under current law. • Gains on disposals of shares by CFCs will be passive income if they are held on revenue account. • Dividends from shares held by CFCs in New Zealand-resident companies are subject to attribution under current rules. These dividends will be disregarded under the new CFC rules to the extent they are imputed. Interest (chapter 5) • Interest and interest substitutes will be treated as passive income, subject to the rules about related-party payments discussed in chapter 7. • Income brought to tax under the current financial arrangement rules provides a starting point for defining passive interest income. Exceptions will be provided for: – derivative instruments that qualify as hedges under NZ IFRS and are not hedging passive income/transactions; – foreign exchange gains or losses that arise from transactions carried out as part of an active business; and – interest from trade credits, deferred payment sales and hire purchases if the sales are carried out in the ordinary course of the business or the property is produced or used in the business. 1 Ordinary dividends are all those that qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit. Dividends that do not qualify for an underlying tax credit are those whose recipient does not have a sufficient interest in the CFC; or when the share is a fixed rate share; or when the CFC is allowed a deduction for the dividend in calculating its liability for tax. 3 Royalties and rents (chapter 6) • Related-party royalty payments will be passive income, subject to the rules about related-party payments discussed in chapter 7. • Third-party royalty payments may be treated as active income if the CFC created, developed or added substantial value to the intellectual property and is regularly engaged in such activity, provided the intellectual property did not originate in New Zealand. • Rental income earned by the CFC will be treated as active if it relates to property in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. Other rental income will be passive, subject to the rules about related-party payments discussed in chapter 7. Related-party payments (chapter 7) Interest, royalties or rents received by a CFC (CFC A) from a related CFC (CFC B) will be disregarded under the new CFC rules if: • CFC B passes the active business test; and • both CFC A and CFC B are resident in the same jurisdiction. Other passive income (chapter 8) • Insurance premium income of a CFC will be passive income. Investment income derived by a CFC that is carrying on an offshore insurance business will be subject to the rules applying to other CFCs set out in previous chapters. • Income from life insurance policies and net gains from the disposal of life insurance policies that are on revenue account will be passive income. • Personal services income earned by a CFC will be attributed to the controlling New Zealand-shareholder if: – 80% of the CFC’s income from services relates to services personally performed by the New Zealand shareholder; and – substantial business assets are not part of the business structure used to derive the income from services. • Gains from the disposal of revenue account property used in an offshore active business will be treated as active income. Gains from the disposal of other revenue account property will be treated as passive income. Base company rules (chapter 9) • Base company rules will be introduced but they will not apply to income derived from the sale of goods and from the supply of services related to the sale of goods. • They will also not apply to income earned by a CFC from services if the services are performed in the jurisdiction of the CFC. 4 • They will apply only to income from services that are performed outside the jurisdiction in which the CFC is resident and if the employees performing the services are not resident in the CFC’s local jurisdiction. In that case the nominally active income will be treated as passive income. Calculating and attributing CFC income or loss (chapter 10) • As a general rule, non-interest expenditure will be deductible in calculating the branch equivalent profits of a CFC to the extent they are incurred in deriving passive income, or in the course of a business carried on for the purpose of deriving such income, and not incurred in deriving active/disregarded income. Similar rules are suggested for non-interest expenditure incurred by shareholders in deriving an attributed CFC income or loss. • Interest deductions in the calculation of branch equivalent profits will be restricted. The preferred approach is to pro-rate apportionment on the basis of the ratio of passive assets to active/disregarded assets. Interest deductions by shareholders will be subject to the interest allocation rules described in chapter 11. • Special rules may be needed to deal with expenditure that relates to passive income that is not attributable because a CFC satisfies the active business test. The preferred approach is to allow such expenditure only if it is incurred in a year when the CFC is subject to attribution on its passive income. • Technical amendments will be required to ensure that foreign tax credits are available only for tax paid or payable by a CFC in respect of its passive income. Interest allocation rules (chapter 11) • Interest allocation rules will apply to a New Zealand company with controlled foreign companies unless it has: – 90% or more of its assets in New Zealand; or – less than $250,000 of interest deductions. • Companies required to comply with interest allocation rules will apportion their interest deductions if their New Zealand group debt percentage ratio is greater than 75%. The apportionment is based on the 75% safe harbour, or 110% of the worldwide group debt percentage, whichever is higher. • Existing rules will be used to measure debt and assets for the purpose of the interest allocation rules, except that: – fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers will be treated as debt for the purpose of the interest allocation rules; – equity investment in CFCs will not be counted as assets; and – the definition of “worldwide debt” will exclude liabilities that do not provide funds and liabilities that do not give rise to deductions (except fixed rate shares, which will be treated as debt for this purpose). 5 1.7 Submissions should be made by 30 November 2007 and be addressed to: International Tax Review C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Or e-mail: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “International Tax Review” in the subject line. 1.8 Submissions should include a brief summary of their major points and recommendations.

This issues paper builds on earlier analysis and consultation based around the government’s December 2006 discussion document and the May 2007 update. 2.2 Where possible, the paper draws on the examples provided by rules in comparable jurisdictions. We have looked, in particular, to Australia and the United States, which have both adopted a transactional approach in the design of their active income exemption. Australia also exempts dividends paid by CFCs. Background and context 2.3 It is important that New Zealand’s tax system is not out of line with the systems of comparable jurisdictions, particularly that of Australia. Within an increasingly borderless global economy, New Zealand must be able to attract and retain capital, and our businesses must be able to compete effectively in foreign markets. The changes introduced by the review of our international tax rules will align them with the rules of comparable jurisdictions and reduce the barriers faced by New Zealand firms that are contemplating expanding offshore. 2.4 The December discussion document proposed the introduction of an exemption for offshore active income. Under New Zealand’s current system of comprehensive controlled foreign company (CFC) taxation, it can be attractive for innovative, dynamic firms to migrate or establish offshore, or simply stay small and local. Other OECD countries either defer taxing offshore active income or exempt it altogether. Providing an exemption for offshore active income will put New Zealand-based businesses on an equal footing internationally by removing an additional tax cost not faced by firms based in other countries. 2.5 The May update set out three guiding principles informing the proposed reforms: • The new rules should, as much as possible, allow firms to get on with their legitimate business activity. This means the rules should not discourage firms from undertaking expansion of business operations offshore to take advantage of market opportunities or gain production efficiencies. The new rules should also take into account the legitimate business arrangements and methods of operation that New Zealand businesses use in their offshore operations. 7 • The rules should, as much as possible, minimise compliance costs. • The rules should maintain a level of protection for the domestic tax base. 2.6 Bearing those principles in mind, the government has made a series of in- principle policy decisions constituting a balanced package of reforms. Those decisions, also set out in the May update, were as follows: • A tax exemption for the active income of CFCs will be introduced. • Ordinary dividends from CFCs to the New Zealand parent will be exempt from domestic tax. • A simple active business test will be developed to exempt all CFCs with less than 5% passive income, no matter where they do business. The test will replace the current eight-country grey list exemption. • Even if a CFC does not meet the active business test, only its passive income will be taxed in New Zealand. • A relatively limited definition of “passive income” that will include dividends, interest and certain rents and royalties will be developed. • A limited set of base company rules for services will be developed. • Once the exemption is in place, interest allocation rules will limit the extent to which New Zealand businesses can deduct interest costs relating to offshore investments. • The conduit rules will be repealed. 2.7 The changes are represented in figure 1. FIGURE 1: SUMMARY OF THE PACKAGE Overall package Getting on with business Minimise compliance costs Base protection Dividend exemption Active income exemption Active business test Limited base company rules Limited definition of passive income No grey list Interest allocation No conduit rules 8 Overall policy objectives 2.8 The government’s commitment to economic transformation is at the heart of this package. In order to drive economic transformation, New Zealand must clearly distinguish itself in the global economy as a dynamic and competitive place in which to do business, improving incentives for businesses to invest and grow. The new tax exemption for offshore business activity will play an important role in delivering these policy objectives, helping to foster a competitive business environment. 2.9 Balancing this is the objective that New Zealand-sourced income should continue to be taxed here. To ensure that happens in the context of a reformed system, foreign income that is easily substitutable with domestic income must also remain subject to domestic taxation. It is mainly for this reason that offshore passive income will continue to be taxed in New Zealand, as it is under the rules of comparable jurisdictions. Passive assets tend to be highly mobile, having little or no connection with any particular location. Domestic income is therefore easily re-characterised as foreign income. Unless such income continues to be taxed as it is earned offshore, New Zealand’s domestic tax base would be undermined. 2.10 Offshore portfolio investments are likewise readily substitutable for equivalent investments in New Zealand. Exempting offshore portfolio investments would create a tax bias favouring investment abroad over investment in New Zealand. It is therefore appropriate that portfolio interests in foreign investment funds (FIFs) should continue to be taxed in New Zealand. The applicable tax rules have recently been modified and updated with the introduction of the fair dividend rate method. 2.11 Non-portfolio FIF interests may be analogous with an interest in a CFC, particularly if the investor has sufficient information to apply the branch equivalent method for calculating income. The government has already acknowledged that, in principle, non-portfolio FIF interests should be eligible for the active income exemption. Similarly, it would be consistent with the overall policy direction to exempt income earned from offshore business activity conducted through a branch rather than a subsidiary. A number of practical considerations need to be resolved in relation to both non-portfolio FIFs and branches. This will be the subject of further discussion and consultation next year. Policy design and implementation 2.12 This issues paper is concerned with the implementation of the active income exemption in relation to CFCs, and associated base maintenance reforms. 9 Getting on with business and protecting the base: nexus between location and source 2.13 A key aspect of the design of the new system is that the exemption should be available when there is a connection between the jurisdiction in which the CFC is located and the economic source of the income. This represents a practical outcome of allowing firms to get on with legitimate business activity while also providing a level of protection for the domestic tax base. 2.14 The concept of a nexus between location and source is reflected in the shape of the overall policy: as noted, passive assets generally lack any natural connection with a particular location. It also forms a consistent theme running through the detailed rules discussed in this paper, being central to the proposed treatment of different instruments and situations. For example, rents are normally passive, but will be treated as active when the leased property is situated in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. Likewise, royalties may be treated as active if there is a commercial reason for the intellectual property to be held offshore by a CFC. As the corollary to that, income from services not associated with goods will sometimes be treated as passive income under base company rules if the service is performed outside the jurisdiction of the CFC that provides it. 2.15 This approach is intended to ensure that New Zealand’s active businesses are able to benefit from the exemption, while preventing domestic income from being artificially shifted to CFCs. It is also intended to inhibit the use of offshore profit traps. A profit trap can occur when a CFC in a low-tax jurisdiction is used to retain profits arising from a business in a third country – through the use of payments that can be deducted against that country’s tax base, for example. It is sometimes argued that this practice occurs at the expense of the third country and should not, therefore, be of concern to New Zealand. In practice, however, it is often unclear whether all of the profits sheltered from tax represent foreign income rather than New Zealand income. Moreover, the existence of such traps creates opportunities for sheltering domestic income and creates incentives to over-allocate expenses against the domestic base. Finally, the effective double non-taxation of such income provides an unintended incentive to shift operations offshore. Minimising compliance costs: the active business test 2.16 Another key design feature is the introduction of an active business test. A CFC that satisfies the active business test will be exempt from any requirement to attribute its income. The test has been designed to be as straightforward as possible. 2.17 International tax rules tend, by their nature, to be comprehensive and sometimes complex, and this issues paper is necessarily technical as a result. It sets out a series of detailed rules, in particular to ensure that passive income continues to be taxed in New Zealand as it is earned. However, the application of those detailed rules will be the exception. Most New Zealand firms with offshore operations are expected to satisfy the active business test and thereby benefit from a full exemption under the new rules. 10 2.18 Figures 2 and 3 show how the active income exemption and interest allocation rules would apply in practice.

This is the active business test. • Taxpayers may elect to calculate the percentage of passive income based on data from any one of the following three alternatives: – information from audited accounts that comply with NZ IFRS; – information from the CFC’s audited accounts that comply with IFRS; or – New Zealand tax concepts of passive and total income. • Taxpayers will be given the choice to apply the active business test to either the sub-consolidated income of wholly owned CFC interests within a particular jurisdiction, or to the income of individual CFC within the jurisdiction. They may choose to sub-consolidate only some of their wholly-owned CFCs in a jurisdiction. 3.1 A taxpayer with an interest in a CFC that passes the active business test will not have any income to attribute under the proposed CFC rules. A taxpayer with an interest in a CFC that fails the active business test will have to attribute only its passive income. 3.2 In the May update the government announced its intention to develop an exemption for active businesses, to replace the existing exemption for CFCs in eight grey list jurisdictions. This exemption will be available to CFCs in all jurisdictions, not just the grey list. 3.3 The active business test is intended to ensure that taxpayers are not required to attribute income from CFCs that are “primarily active”. A CFC will be treated as primarily active if, in simple terms, its passive income (including base company services income) is less than 5% of its total gross income. This 5% threshold is consistent with that used in the United States and with the existing active income test in Australia. 3.4 The aim is for the active business test to be simple to apply. To this end, taxpayers will be able to elect to calculate the percentage of passive income based on data from any one of the following three alternatives (whichever is the easiest for them): • information from audited accounts that comply with NZ IFRS; 12 • information from the CFC’s audited accounts that comply with IFRS; or • New Zealand tax concepts of passive and total income. 3.5 Compliance costs will be reduced by allowing companies to use their consolidated accounts for CFCs in a jurisdiction, thus reducing the number of tests to be performed, and through the use of data for the test that is readily available from the accounts. In some cases, a CFC may be required, or elect, to make certain adjustments to the data as outlined below. In general, elective adjustments will be necessary only when an active CFC is at the margin of the 5% threshold. The 5% threshold 3.6 As the test is applied on a gross rather than a net basis, primarily active businesses should pass the test. This is because gross returns on active assets (such as manufacturing plants or distribution/sales facilities) are typically higher than those on passive assets (such as investments in securities). Active businesses that have a mixture of active and passive income will have to hold a significant proportion of passive assets to breach the 5% threshold. 3.7 Furthermore, the scope of what is included as passive income will be limited under the new rules. The relatively narrow definition of “passive income”, particularly the absence of base company rules on goods, will simplify the test for most companies. General approaches under the active business test 3.8 The active business test is intended as a gateway test to filter out primarily active businesses from the attribution rules. This is desirable because in most cases the compliance costs of attributing passive income outweigh the risks to the New Zealand tax base of incidental amounts of passive income accumulating in otherwise active offshore operations. 3.9 In designing this test several objectives are important: • Application of the test should have low compliance costs. • There should be a reasonable match between the concept of passive income used in the test and the concept of passive income for tax purposes. • The information to which the test is applied should have a level of consistency across different entities to ensure the overall integrity and fairness of the new rules. 13 3.10 Taxpayers should therefore have an option to perform the test on the basis of: • financial information from audited financial accounts prepared in compliance with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS); 2 or • audited financial accounts of the CFC if the accounts are in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); or • New Zealand tax rules for calculating total income and passive income (including base company services income) as described in the subsequent chapters. 3.11 Taxpayers should be required to use information from audited financial accounts under the first two options. The audit requirement enhances the integrity of the active business test. It provides a level of assurance that the financial information relied upon to test the percentage of passive income is in compliance with NZ IFRS or IFRS – as the case may be. 3.12 Taxpayers that are not required, at present, to have their accounts audited may incur additional compliance costs if they wish to rely on the active business test based on NZ IFRS or IFRS accounts. 3 We believe these additional costs are justified in terms of meeting the objectives identified in paragraph 3.9. Active business test based on NZ IFRS 3.13 New Zealand businesses with foreign subsidiaries that are CFCs could apply the active business test using audited financial information that is in compliance with NZ IFRS. This requirement is not expected to impose additional costs on New Zealand businesses because it is consistent with the usual commercial approach to consolidation. 3.14 The Financial Reporting Act 1993 requires parent companies and non- company issuers to prepare consolidated financial statements for the group, and the applicable financial reporting standard is NZ IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The only exception to the requirement to prepare consolidated financial statements is when the parent is not an issuer and is a wholly owned subsidiary of another ultimate or intermediate parent company or its nominee. This exception should not give rise to any difficulty in terms of the effective operation of the active business test. 2 “NZ IFRS” refers to the New Zealand adaptation of the complete set of standards and interpretations (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Individual standards are referred to as NZ IFRS XX or as NZ IAS XX if originally issued by the IASB’s predecessor body. Any profit-oriented entity that complies with NZ IFRS will simultaneously comply with IFRS. More than 100 countries now require or permit the use of IFRS in the preparation of financial statements, and that number is steadily growing. 3 Only companies and non-company issuers are subject to a legal requirement for audit. Companies that are not issuers or “overseas linked” companies (companies subject to section 196(3) of the Companies Act 1993) need not appoint an auditor if the company passes a unanimous resolution that no auditor be appointed. 14 3.15 Under NZ IAS 27, 4 an entity preparing consolidated financial statements must apply uniform accounting policies. When a member of the group uses a different set of policies – because of differences in accounting treatment in a foreign jurisdiction, for example – appropriate adjustments must be made to its financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Given this requirement, CFCs will be consolidated on the basis of the same accounting policies as applied by the parent – that is, policies that comply with NZ IFRS. We therefore expect that the requirement to apply the active business test based on NZ IFRS-compliant information will produce consistent results and yet have low compliance costs. 3.16 An issue for consideration is whether a parent that avails itself of differential reporting concessions should be able to apply the 5% threshold test on that basis. Our preliminary view is that, in the interests of the integrity of the threshold, the parent should apply the test using full NZ IFRS-based information. 3.17 For some CFCs, financial information that complies with NZ IFRS may not be available. This could happen when the taxpayer is not required to include the CFC in its group accounts because it does not control the CFC for accounting purposes. Also, a lower-tier CFC may be consolidated into another CFC before NZ IFRS adjustments are made. In this case, financial information that complies with NZ IFRS may not be readily available for the lower-tier CFC. In addition, the mandatory application of NZ IFRS has been postponed for some small businesses. 5 3.18 Because reliance on NZ IFRS information will not always be possible, taxpayers will also be given the option to apply the active business test on the basis of a CFC’s audited IFRS-compliant accounts or New Zealand’s tax rules. Active business test based on IFRS 3.19 As an alternative, the active business test could be performed using a CFC’s financial accounts if the accounts have been audited and are in compliance with IFRS. Typically, such accounts would be stated as conforming to both the local accounting standards and IFRS, but it is conformity with IFRS that will be required for information to be used for the active business test. 3.20 We have considered whether it would be appropriate to allow the active business test to be based on the financial statements prepared for the CFC in its foreign jurisdiction that do not comply with IFRS but instead comply with a local adaptation of IFRS or, in the absence of a local IFRS equivalent, other local accounting standards. The difficulty is that the potential for variation in the financial information means this approach falls short of meeting the policy objectives referred to in paragraph 3.9. 4 NZ IAS 27, paragraphs 28 and 29. 5 The option to delay the adoption of NZ IFRS is open to companies that are not issuers, not required to file financial statements with the Registrar of Companies, and not large. A company is large if it meets two of the three criteria: assets exceeding $10 million, turnover exceeding $20 million or 50 or more full-time equivalent employees. 15 Active business test based on tax rules 3.21 Taxpayers can also perform the active business test on the basis of New Zealand tax rules. If the passive income calculated under tax rules is less than 5% of total income (calculated for tax purposes) then the CFC will be exempt from attribution. 3.22 As noted, in some circumstances a New Zealand resident may hold an interest in a CFC yet not have NZ IFRS or IFRS-compliant information. In situations such as these, or when the financial accounts are not audited, taxpayers can use this option to perform the active business test. 3.23 The compliance costs will still be less than full attribution, as under the current rules, because taxpayers will be required only to calculate gross items of income – thus avoiding other steps in a full tax calculation, including the determination of deductible items of expenditure. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on translation of accounts into New Zealand dollars 3.24 In principle, the policy objective is to prevent the active business test being affected by foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from translating income amounts from the functional currency of the CFC into New Zealand dollars. 3.25 This issue does not arise if the active business test is performed using NZ IFRS or IFRS-compliant financial information. Under NZ IFRS, such gains and losses would be recorded in the foreign currency translation account and would not materially affect the ratio of amounts on the income statement, which is the focus of the business active test. If the IFRS-compliant accounts of the CFC are used, then the test can be done on the basis of the amounts reported in these accounts. There is no translation into New Zealand dollars. 3.26 When income is calculated under New Zealand tax rules, however, it could include amounts arising from currency fluctuations between the functional currency of the CFC and the New Zealand dollar. To achieve consistency among the tests, appropriate adjustments should be made to the amounts calculated under the tax rules. For example, in Australia, the test can be calculated using functional currency of the CFC. Use of sub-consolidated financial statements 3.27 We have considered whether the test could be applied on a country-by- country basis, to permit sub-consolidations of the CFCs located in the same jurisdiction. This would go further than the CFC rules in other countries, where comparable tests are applied to each CFC, rather than a group of CFCs on a country-consolidated basis. 16 3.28 Taxpayers should be given the choice to apply the active business test to either the sub-consolidated income of their wholly owned CFC interests within a particular jurisdiction or to the income of each individual CFC within the country. Taxpayers could choose to sub-consolidate only some of their wholly owned CFCs in a jurisdiction. 3.29 The effect of the sub-consolidated approach will be to eliminate intra-group transactions among the CFCs in the same jurisdiction and to aggregate the 5% threshold test across those CFCs. 3.30 For instance, the sub-consolidated approach will benefit taxpayers who have multiple CFCs within a jurisdiction, some of which are slightly above the 5% threshold, but together are below the threshold on a sub-consolidated basis because they have other CFCs in the jurisdiction with less than 5% passive income. Retaining an option to allow individual testing of CFCs will benefit taxpayers that exceed the 5% threshold on a sub-consolidated basis because they have one or more highly passive CFCs (for example, 100% passive) in the same jurisdiction as some of their active CFCs. 3.31 We expect that in situations where sub-consolidated information for a country is routinely prepared, the sub-consolidated option could reduce compliance costs by allowing a taxpayer to perform fewer active business tests and by automatically dealing with all intra-group transactions for CFCs within the same country. Same jurisdiction condition 3.32 The sub-consolidated basis for the active business test would be limited to CFCs in the same jurisdiction. The same-jurisdiction restriction is necessary because it would be undesirable for a passive CFC located in a tax haven to be consolidated with an active CFC in, say, Europe. Wholly owned group 3.33 Our view is that the sub-consolidated basis for the active business test should be permitted only if the set of CFCs is wholly owned. We recognise that part-ownership presents no barrier to preparation of sub-consolidated financial statements and, from a policy perspective, we have no objection to applying the active business test to partly owned sub-consolidated groups. However, the application of the test to partly owned groups could be permitted only if it was possible to determine the nature of income that should be attributed to minority interests in the partly owned subsidiaries. This seems problematic to us, and we invite submissions on how it could be achieved. 3.34 The active business test can, of course, be applied to an individual partly owned CFC. 17 Intra-group transactions 3.35 When the active business test is based on financial information of individual CFCs, intra-group transactions have the potential to inflate the amount of total income used in the active business test relative to that which would result if the test were performed on the results of the sub-consolidated group. This could increase the amount of passive income that a group of CFCs could earn while remaining under the 5% threshold. 3.36 Take an example of a group of two CFCs in the same jurisdiction: CFC A sells an intermediate product to CFC B (for $100) and CFC B adds value to the product and sells it to third parties (for $120). The sales revenue for the entire group is $120, and the 5% tolerance for passive income should be $6 for the entire consolidated group. If the active business test was conducted separately for individual CFCs, the sales revenue for CFC A would be $100, and the sales revenue for CFC B would be $120. The total tolerance for passive income of the entire group would be $11. 3.37 Other types of intra-group transactions, such as interest between a holding company and an active operating company, which would not be considered to be passive income, could also inflate the tolerance for passive income. In general, adjustments would need to be made to the amounts of total income to make it consistent with the amount that would be reported in sub- consolidated accounts. 3.38 In theory, similar problems could arise for transactions between related CFCs in different jurisdictions. A number of CFCs could be involved in a value- added chain before the final products are sold or the services are provided to third parties. Rather than proposing a mechanical rule for such transactions, we are examining a targeted anti-avoidance rule for dealing with transactions between related parties in different jurisdictions that are designed to increase the amount of passive income that could be earned without attribution. Measurement issues in the active business test 3.39 In simple terms, a CFC will pass the active business test if its passive income is less than 5% of its total gross income. The passive income and total gross income of a CFC can be measured using NZ IFRS or IFRS-compliant financial information or New Zealand tax rules. 3.40 Example 1 shows how the active business test will be applied. The concepts used in the example are explained in the remainder of this section. The section describes the relevant standards that should be relied upon if the active business test is performed on the basis of NZ IFRS. We expect equivalent IFRS standards would be used if the test uses IFRS-compliant information. If the active business test relies on New Zealand tax rules, the rules described in the other chapters in this issues paper would be relevant. 18 Example 1: Active business test for CFC A Gross income: Gross revenue reported under NZ IAS 18 200 Plus other NZ IFRS items of passive income 12 (if not already included above) Total gross income for active business test 212 Passive income: NZ IFRS items of passive income 12 Less permitted adjustments for income that is treated as active (5) Plus base company and other passive income 2 Total passive income for active business test 9 Passive income under active business test 4.2% CFC A would pass the active business test and would be completely exempt from the CFC rules. Total gross income of a CFC 3.41 The starting point for measuring a CFC’s total gross income is to use NZ IFRS-based gross revenue reported under NZ IAS 18. This NZ IFRS notion of total revenue includes revenue from the sale of goods and rendering of services, as well as interest, royalties, dividends and rents arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an entity. Adjustments to NZ IFRS “total revenue” quantification 3.42 Those categories of passive income that are not already included under NZ IAS 18 will need to be added to total income. In addition, active income that is not included under NZ IAS 18, such as active hedges, would need to be added to total income. 3.43 If the test is performed on a CFC-by-CFC basis, a number of adjustments would be needed to ensure that there was no effective double counting of revenues within a group of CFCs in the same jurisdiction. These adjustments would generally be to remove intra-group transactions that would be disregarded in the preparation of the sub-consolidated accounts of a group of CFCs in a jurisdiction. They would include: • interest, rent and royalty payments from related active CFCs in the same jurisdiction; and • an adjustment for intra-group sales and services income. 19 3.44 Adjustments would also be made to exclude from total income other types of income that are also excluded from passive income and that would not be taxable if earned in New Zealand. These include: • ordinary dividends received from another CFC/FIF, which would be exempt if received by a New Zealand-resident company; • dividends received from a New Zealand-resident company to the extent that they are imputed; and • capital/unrealised gains and losses on equity investments that would be exempt for New Zealand tax purposes, as discussed below. Passive income of a CFC 3.45 If the active business test is performed on the basis of NZ IFRS, the passive income of a CFC is measured, in the first instance, using NZ IFRS accounting standards. In some cases adjustments to this information may be needed, and these are discussed below. NZ IFRS items of passive income 3.46 The following items will generally be included in passive income under the active business test: • interest, dividend and royalties income and rental income, if any, under NZ IAS 18; • foreign exchange gains and losses on non-derivative financial assets under NZ IAS 21; 6 • gains and losses from fair value movements of non-derivative financial assets and derivatives (including derivatives held for trading purposes, but not including fair value movements on derivatives to the extent that the derivatives qualify for, and the entity has used, hedge accounting) under NZ IAS 39; • gains and losses from derecognition of non-derivative financial assets under NZ IAS 39; • finance lease income and operating lease income under NZ IAS 17; and • premium revenue under NZ IFRS 4. 3.47 We believe these categories of NZ IFRS income broadly match tax concepts of income from financial arrangements, dividends, royalties, insurance and rents. It is not expected that the NZ IFRS amounts for these categories of income would correspond exactly to what would be brought to tax under the attribution rules. For example, the derecognition rules under NZ IAS 39 are based on a substance-over-form approach that is different from the base price adjustments required under the tax rules. 6 Excluding foreign exchange gains and losses discussed earlier in this chapter. 20 3.48 Certain of these categories may contain nominally passive income that is not subject to attribution. CFCs would be permitted to make adjustments to these amounts for purposes of the test, if necessary. Adjustments to NZ IFRS “passive income” quantification 3.49 If a CFC is slightly over the 5% boundary, basing the active business test on the NZ IFRS passive income quantification may result in attribution of small amounts of passive income at a significant compliance cost. To prevent this outcome, adjustments will be permitted to exclude any items that are categorised as passive income under NZ IFRS, but considered active income under tax rules. These adjustments will be elective, so they will impose no compliance costs on taxpayers that already satisfied the active business test. 3.50 Two types of adjustments are envisaged here, in accordance with the tax rules discussed in chapters 4 to 9. The first type of adjustment is for categories of income that are active in substance, although they may be passive in form. These categories of income will be excluded from passive income, but will be included in total income for purposes of the test. They include: • interest (including any foreign exchange gains and losses) that results from trade credits, deferred payment sales and hire purchase, if the sales are part of an active business; • active rents; and • active royalties. 3.51 The second type of adjustment is for certain passive income that will not be attributed and should be disregarded for the purpose of the active business test. It will be removed from both passive income and total income, which will include adjustments to exclude: • ordinary dividends received from another CFC/FIF that would be exempt if received by a New Zealand-resident company; • dividends received from a New Zealand-resident company to the extent that they are imputed; • interest, rent and royalty payments from related active CFCs in the same jurisdiction; and • capital/unrealised gains and losses on equity investments that would be exempt for New Zealand tax purposes, as discussed below. Tax treatment of equity investments 3.52 An area where tax rules differ significantly from NZ IFRS is with respect to equity investments. 21 3.53 First, NZ IFRS does not make a distinction between investments that are on capital account and those on revenue account. As such, relying on the NZ IFRS accounts for the purpose of the active business test could include capital gains or losses that would not ordinarily be taxable. This could work to the benefit of taxpayers (if capital losses reduce the passive income) or against taxpayers (if capital gains increase passive income). 3.54 Second, there may be timing differences between when accrued gains and losses on equity investments are recognised in NZ IFRS accounts and when they are recognised for tax purposes. Equity investments are reported in the NZ IFRS financial statements at their fair values, with changes in fair value recognised either in the income statement or directly in equity, depending on the asset's classification in accordance with NZ IAS 39. In these cases, gains and losses will be recognised in NZ IFRS accounts on an accrual basis, rather than on a realisation basis, which is the case under the tax rules. 3.55 Again, this could work to the benefit of taxpayers (if unrealised losses reduce passive income) or against taxpayers (if unrealised gains increase passive income). Further, including unrealised gains and losses for the purposes of the active business test would create volatility in the results. The composition of active and passive income of a CFC would fluctuate from year to year as the share market fluctuated. 3.56 Overall, the mismatches between NZ IFRS and tax treatment of equity investments appear to be quite significant. Submissions are sought on whether it is preferable to follow NZ IFRS for equity investments or require taxpayers to make the relevant adjustments (which could not be optional). Other passive income and base company services income 3.57 Other passive income and base company services income will need to be included in the amount of passive income for the purposes of applying the active business test. These are tax-specific concepts that have no corresponding rules under NZ IFRS. In addition, the revenue risks would be significant if these income groups are not captured under the active business test. 3.58 The types of income that should be included in the active business test include: • for the holders of life insurance policies, income from life insurance policies and the disposal of life insurance policies that are on revenue account; • income from personal services contracts; • gains and losses from the disposal of passive revenue account property; • gains and losses from hedges that are hedging transactions/assets that would produce passive income; and • base company services income. 22 Chapter 4 INCOME FROM SHARES HELD BY CFCS Summary of suggested treatment Ordinary dividends 7 from shares held by CFCs in other CFCs or FIFs will be disregarded under the new CFC rules if they are tax-exempt under current law. Gains on disposals of shares by CFCs will be passive income if they are held on revenue account. Dividends from shares held by CFCs in New Zealand-resident companies are subject to attribution under current rules. These dividends will be disregarded under the new CFC rules to the extent they are imputed. 4.1 The current approach of directly attributing income from foreign shares owned by CFCs back to the New Zealand shareholder will continue. Accordingly, ordinary dividends from shares held by CFCs in other CFCs or FIFs will be disregarded under the new CFC rules if they are tax-exempt under current law. They will be excluded from passive income and total income for the purposes of the active business test (see chapter 3) and will not be treated as passive income for the purposes of attribution. 4.2 Dividends from shares held by CFCs in New Zealand-resident companies are subject to attribution under current rules. This treatment is to guard against concerns about untaxed profits being shifted out of New Zealand – subject only to non-resident withholding tax. These dividends will also be disregarded under the new CFC rules to the extent they are imputed. Again, this means they will be excluded from passive income and total income for the purposes of the active business test and will not be treated as passive income for the purposes of attribution. 4.3 The following sections outline how the following forms of income will be treated under the proposed active income exemption. Income/dividends from shares held by CFCs in other CFCs or FIFs 4.4 Income from foreign shares owned by CFCs is generally attributed directly back to the New Zealand shareholder. In other words, our current practice is to look through CFCs holding CFC and FIF interests and attribute income from these holdings directly to the New Zealand taxpayer. That will not change under the new rules. 7 Ordinary dividends are all those that qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit. Dividends that do not qualify for an underlying tax credit are those whose recipient does not have a sufficient interest in the CFC; or when the share is a fixed rate share; or when the CFC is allowed a deduction for the dividend in calculating its liability for tax. 23 4.5 Ordinary dividends received by CFCs from other CFCs or FIFs are exempt income under existing tax rules, to prevent double taxation. As noted, these dividends will be disregarded under the new CFC rules. 4.6 If a CFC has an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company 8 (that is, a portfolio FIF) income will be attributed directly to the New Zealand shareholders in the CFC, usually under the fair dividend rate (FDR) method. Any dividends paid by the portfolio FIF to the CFC or the New Zealand resident are exempt under current law and will be disregarded under the new CFC rules. 4.7 When a CFC holds a portfolio interest in a company (such as a listed Australian company) that, for whatever reason, is exempt from the FIF rules, dividends from that company will be treated as passive income. 4.8 If a CFC has an interest of between 10% and 50% in a foreign company 9 (that is, a non-portfolio FIF that is not a grey list company) income will be directly attributed back to the New Zealand shareholders under the FIF rules. Dividends paid by the non-portfolio FIF to the CFC are exempt under current law and will be disregarded under the new CFC rules. 4.9 The non-portfolio FIF rules (including the future application of the grey list to non-portfolio FIFs) are to be reviewed following the reform of the core aspects of the CFC rules. The treatment of dividends received by CFCs from FIFs will be considered as part of that review. 4.10 If a CFC has more than a 50% interest in a foreign company 10 (one that controls a second CFC) this would be equivalent to a situation where the New Zealand-resident shareholder controlled the second CFC directly. Therefore any ordinary dividends paid by the second CFC to the first CFC would be tax-exempt. Treatment of revenue account gains 4.11 Most capital gains are not taxed in New Zealand, and they will also be disregarded under the new CFC rules. Gains on disposal of shares by CFCs that are revenue account property should be treated as passive income under the new rules. Because realisation of revenue gains from shares is an alternative means of extracting profits from companies, these gains should be taxed under the CFC rules. We recognise, however, that this proposal should be limited to gains that are held on revenue account. 4.12 Gains and losses on disposal of revenue account shares will be treated as passive income only at disposal. CFCs will not be required to accrue any unrealised gains on the shares as this is not required under New Zealand domestic tax rules generally. 8 Calculated using income interests as defined in sections EX 8 to EX 13. 9 Calculated using income interests as defined in sections EX 8 to EX 13. 10 Calculated using control interests as defined in sections EX 2 to EX 7. 24 Income/dividends from shares held by CFCs in New Zealand-resident companies 4.13 Under existing tax rules, dividends paid by New Zealand-resident companies to CFCs are taxed on attribution, with a credit for New Zealand non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) unless the CFC operates in a grey list country, in which case there is no attribution generally. 4.14 The current rules were designed to guard against concerns about company profits being shifted out of New Zealand at a tax rate lower than the New Zealand corporate tax rate. Specifically, unimputed dividends could be distributed by a New Zealand company to a CFC and be subject to NRWT of a maximum of 15% for a treaty country. Taxing the dividend on attribution to the CFC (with a credit for the NRWT) preserves the New Zealand company tax on what are New Zealand-sourced dividends received by a New Zealand-owned entity. The existing avoidance concerns could be amplified by the proposed CFC changes, which mean that all dividends paid by CFCs to a New Zealand-resident company will become exempt from domestic tax. 4.15 The challenge is to design a rule that discourages artificial income shifting, but does not lead to double taxation. We suggest allowing dividends received by CFCs from New Zealand-resident companies to be disregarded under the new CFC rules to the extent imputation credits have been attached. An un-imputed dividend paid by a New Zealand company would be treated as passive income and taxed on accrual. 25 Chapter 5 INTEREST Summary of suggested treatment Interest and interest substitutes will be treated as passive income, subject to the rules about related-party payments discussed in chapter 7. Income brought to tax under the current financial arrangement rules provides a starting point for defining passive interest income. Exceptions will be provided for: • derivative instruments that qualify as hedges under NZ IFRS and are not hedging passive income/transactions; • foreign exchange gains or losses that arise from transactions carried out as part of an active business; and • interest from trade credits, deferred payment sales and hire purchases if the sales are carried out in the ordinary course of the business or the property is produced or used in the business. General approach 5.1 Interest income is considered to be passive under the CFC rules of other countries, which generally distinguish between active and passive income. Further, a wide definition of “interest income” is typically used in these rules. Examples of interest income that is considered passive include interest as well as income from a finance lease or other financial arrangements. The May update listed other examples of passive interest income, such as interest that arises from investments or as part of the business of lending money, financial income such as guarantee fees, interest swap payments and the interest portion of sale and repurchase agreements. 5.2 Consistent with international norms, we suggest adopting a broad definition of “interest income” for the purpose of the new rules. All returns on financial arrangements that could be substitutes for interest will be treated as passive income. Doing otherwise would mean a substantial risk that domestic income could be re-characterised as income from mobile financial assets and escape New Zealand tax. Income from financial arrangements 5.3 A wide definition of interest income is used in the existing tax rules for financial arrangements. These rules bring to tax all income from financial arrangements earned by New Zealand residents. 26 5.4 A financial arrangement includes debt and debt substitutes. All derivative contracts such as forward, futures and options are also within the scope of the financial arrangement rules. 5.5 Under the financial arrangement rules, income from a financial arrangement is calculated on an accrual basis and spread over the term of a financial arrangement. At the end of the term, or upon disposal of the financial arrangement, a base price adjustment is performed to “wash up” any untaxed gains (or losses) that should be brought to tax. 5.6 The financial arrangement rules are a good starting point for defining and measuring interest income that should be treated as passive, subject to the rules about related-party payments discussed in chapter 7. This approach is consistent with the definition of passive income under the CFC rules in other countries. Countries such as Australia that do not have comprehensive financial arrangement rules include interest as passive income and list separately the types of assets or income that might be considered passive. This list typically includes income and gains from other financial instruments such as derivative contracts. Special consideration for active interest income 5.7 It is anticipated that most active offshore businesses will not have many passive assets in practice, and will be relieved from attribution under the active income test outlined in chapter 3. However, there may be cases where companies hold financial arrangements, which will generally be treated as passive, as part of their active businesses. Special rules are suggested to deal with income arising from such arrangements. Derivative hedge instruments 5.8 Income from financial arrangements includes income from derivative instruments, such as forwards, futures and options, and these amounts will therefore generally be treated as passive income. 5.9 Active businesses do sometimes use derivative instruments to manage risks, however. This is particularly true of businesses that are exposed to foreign exchange risks, interest rate risks and price risks. For example, a CFC could be carrying out sale and distribution functions for the New Zealand parent. The offshore sales transactions might be denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars. To protect the New Zealand dollar value of these sales, the CFC could enter into a forward contract to fix the sales revenue in New Zealand dollars. 5.10 In principle, income from these active hedges should be treated as active. CFC rules in other countries often contain an exception along these lines. 27 5.11 It is not easy to separate derivative instruments that should be treated as active from those that should be treated as passive. However, it may be possible to rely on the special hedge accounting rules under New Zealand equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS), at least as a starting point. 5.12 Derivative instruments qualify for special accounting treatment under NZ IFRS if they are hedges. These derivative hedge instruments are classified into three categories: • fair value hedge: a derivative instrument that hedges a particular risk associated with an existing asset or liability that could affect the value of that asset or liability and result in a profit or loss; or • cash flow hedge: a derivative instrument that hedges the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) are attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and (ii) could affect profit or loss; or • hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. 5.13 Relying on NZ IFRS to identify derivative instruments that may be active offers a degree of robustness because taxpayers will have to meet certain conditions to qualify for the NZ IFRS hedge treatment. For example, these derivative instruments have to be designated as hedges and will have to be highly effective. 11 5.14 Some of these hedges may give rise to income that should be treated as passive. Therefore, rules will be needed to ensure that income from a hedge of an asset or transaction that produces passive income will likewise be treated as passive. 5.15 For example, a CFC may enter into a forward foreign currency contract to hedge the exchange rate risk on a fixed interest foreign currency bond held for investment purposes. The fixed interest foreign currency bond will generate interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses that will be treated as passive income under the new CFC rules. Gains or losses from the forward foreign currency contract should also be treated as passive. Foreign exchange gains and losses 5.16 Foreign exchange gains and losses associated with a financial arrangement are covered by the financial arrangement rules because they could be seen as substitutes for interest income. For example, foreign exchange gains and losses could arise from financial assets (such as government bonds) denominated in a foreign currency. 11 NZ IAS 39 contains detailed rules on the types of instruments that can qualify as hedging instrument (such as internal hedges cannot be treated as hedges), the requirements to designate a financial derivative as a hedging instrument, the types of items that can be hedged and the effectiveness of a hedging relationship. 28 5.17 These foreign exchange gains and losses are included as income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules and brought to tax on an accrual basis or an expected value basis depending on the calculation methods used. These gains and losses will be treated as passive income. 5.18 Foreign exchange gains and losses could arise for a CFC in the conduct of its active business. For example, a sale transaction could be carried out in USD. Foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from this transaction are part of the active business income of the CFC. These gains and losses are not within the scope of the financial arrangements rules and will be treated as active income. 5.19 The financial arrangement rules also cover foreign exchange gains and losses that could arise from transactions that are carried out as part of the active business. For example, long-term trade credits and deferred property settlements when the property is used in the active business, can be denominated in a foreign currency. As noted directly below, interest on these transactions should not be passive income. Accordingly, any foreign exchange gains and losses on these same transactions should also be excluded from passive income. Interest income from trade credits, deferred payment sales and hire purchase 5.20 Active businesses often generate interest income as part of their operations. For example, sales can be made on credit and interest charged on any overdue accounts. Trade credits, deferred payment sales and hire purchase arrangements that are integral to some businesses can also contain an interest element. 5.21 The interest components arising from some of these active transactions are excluded from the financial arrangement rules and will be treated as active income. For example, any interest related to short-term trade credits or deferred payment sales (that is, for a period less than 93 days) will not give rise to income under the financial arrangement rules. 5.22 The financial arrangement rules do cover trade credits or deferred payment sales that are longer than 93 days. Nevertheless, it would be consistent with the active income exemption to exempt these transactions because they are closely connected with the active business. Accordingly, interest income from trade credits, deferred property settlements and hire purchase agreements will be treated as active if the sales are carried out in the ordinary course of the business or the property is produced or used in the business. Firms in the business of actively deriving interest income 5.23 Income arising from financial assets such as loans and receivables, securities and derivatives are generally treated as passive income. One of the consequences of this approach is that financial institutions that are in the business of generating these types of income are unlikely to qualify for the proposed active income exemption. 29 5.24 Some countries provide specific rules for financial institutions under their CFC rules. However, these rules tend to be complex as they are typically accompanied by a series of anti-avoidance rules to prevent domestic income from being shifted offshore. 5.25 Whether specific rules could be provided to extend the active income exemption to such companies would depend upon the resolution of a number of difficult problems: • Defining the borderline between active and passive. Investments within a CFC could be passive in nature even if the business of the New Zealand parent company were active. • Allocating expenses and income between New Zealand and the CFC. This is particularly difficult for any financial institution owing to the fungibility of money and its simple relocation. • Interest allocation rules. These would need to be developed and extended (for example, to deal with the role of reserves of insurance companies). • Managing the risk to the New Zealand tax base. For example, rules will be required to deal with vehicles such as captive insurance companies. 30 Chapter 6 ROYALTIES AND RENTS Summary of suggested treatment Related-party royalty payments will be passive income, subject to the rules about related-party payments discussed in chapter 7. Third-party royalty payments may be treated as active income if the CFC created, developed or added substantial value to the intellectual property and is regularly engaged in such activity, provided the intellectual property did not originate in New Zealand. Rental income earned by the CFC will be treated as active if it relates to property in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. Other rental income will be passive, subject to the rules about related-party payments discussed in chapter 7. Royalties Background 6.1 The December discussion document outlined the general approach of treating royalty income as passive because intellectual property is geographically mobile and there is a need to protect the domestic tax base. 6.2 The May update confirmed this general approach but raised the possibility of an exception for royalties derived in the active conduct of a business. Other countries make a distinction along these lines. 6.3 The update outlined a number of factors to consider in relation to the development of such an exception: • the ability to transfer intellectual property out of New Zealand without incurring a New Zealand tax liability; • the difficulty of separating royalty income from the value of related goods and services; and • the difficulty of assigning royalty income to a jurisdiction with certainty. 6.4 The rules for the treatment of royalty income in New Zealand will need to balance a number of competing considerations. On the one hand, it is desirable to minimise the impact such rules will have on legitimate commercial activity, to foster the development of intellectual property in New Zealand and to maintain the competitiveness of New Zealand’s tax system with those of comparable jurisdictions. On the other hand, there is a need to protect the domestic tax base and to design rules that take account of 31 the absence of a capital gains tax, a distinctive feature of New Zealand’s tax system. Royalties from a related CFC 6.5 Internationally, royalties received from related CFCs are generally treated as passive income. This is the position in Australia and the United States. 6.6 The concern is that the tax base may be eroded by shifting profits through the payment of deductible royalties. Given the scope for planning associated with related-party transactions and the inherent mobility of intangible property, there is also a material risk of CFCs being interposed to collect royalty income in a low-tax jurisdiction. 6.7 It is recognised that multinationals may concentrate their intellectual property in one CFC for legitimate commercial reasons. Accordingly, related-party royalties will be disregarded under the new CFC rules if paid by a CFC that has passed the active business test and is resident in the same jurisdiction as the recipient CFC. (See chapter 7 for details of the treatment of related-party payments.) Royalties from unrelated parties 6.8 Internationally, royalties may be treated as active income if there are genuine commercial reasons for the intellectual property to be owned by a CFC, such as when the CFC has created, developed, substantially enhanced, or marketed the property. CFC receiving the royalty has created the intellectual property 6.9 The United States treats royalties as active income if the CFC has created the property, is regularly engaged in such creation, and the royalties are received from a non-related party. The following examples from the United States Internal Revenue Service Final and Temporary Regulations (Sec. 1.954-2(d)) illustrate how the rule applies: CFC creates the intellectual property 12 Controlled foreign corporation A, through its own staff of employees, owns and operates a research facility in foreign country X. At the research facility, employees of Corporation A, who are scientists, engineers, and technicians, regularly perform experiments, tests, and other technical activities that ultimately result in the issuance of patents that it sells or licenses. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, royalties received by Corporation A for the privilege of using patented rights that it develops as a result of such research activity are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A), but only so long as the licensor is regularly engaged in the development, creation or production of, or in the acquisition of and addition of substantial value to, property of such kind. 12 The examples cited are numbered respectively 1, 4 and 3 in the United States’ regulations. 32 CFC is not regularly engaged in the activity Controlled foreign corporation C receives royalties for the use of a patent that it developed through its own staff of employees at its facility in country X. Corporation C has developed no other patents. It does not regularly employ a staff of scientists, engineers or technicians to create new products to be patented. Further, it does not purchase and license patents developed by others to which it has added substantial value. The royalties received by Corporation C are not derived from the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A). 6.10 Australia has a similar rule whereby royalties are active income when the “matter or thing” in respect of which the royalties are received originates with the CFC. The royalties must also be derived in the course of a business carried on by the CFC and received from an unrelated party. 13 6.11 A similar rule to those used in the United States and Australia should apply in New Zealand. The United States’ rule has some attraction, because the requirement that the CFC be regularly engaged in the activity goes some way towards achieving the underlying policy objective of ensuring the CFC is located in the jurisdiction for genuine commercial reasons. CFC has developed or added substantial value to the intellectual property 6.12 Both the United States and Australia treat royalties as active income when the CFC has developed or added substantial value to the intellectual property. For instance, in the United States, royalties are active if the CFC has acquired and added substantial value to the property and the CFC is regularly engaged in such activity. 6.13 This further example from the United States’ Regulations demonstrates how this rule works: CFC acquires intellectual property and adds substantial value Controlled foreign corporation B receives royalties for the use of patents that it acquires by purchase. The primary business of Corporation B, operated on a regular basis, consists of licensing patents that it has purchased raw from inventors and, through the efforts of a substantial staff of employees consisting of scientists, engineers, and technicians, made susceptible to commercial application. For example, Corporation B, after purchasing patent rights covering a chemical process, designs specialized production equipment required for the commercial adaptation of the process and, by so doing, substantially increases the value of the patent. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, royalties received by Corporation B from the use of such patent are derived in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 954(c)(2)(A). 13 The Board of Taxation’s review of Australia’s anti-deferral rules does not discuss the treatment of royalty income. 33 6.14 The Australian rule requires the CFC to have substantially developed, altered or improved the matter or thing, substantially enhancing its market value. The royalties must also be derived in the course of the CFC’s business for them to be exempt. 6.15 We see a case for having a similar rule treating royalties as active income in these circumstances, provided there is a substantial pattern of activity. However, this treatment will not apply when the intellectual property originated in New Zealand (see below). Intellectual property originating in New Zealand 6.16 A stricter approach should be taken to the treatment of royalties that are derived by a CFC from an unrelated party for intellectual property originating in New Zealand and then transferred offshore, as illustrated by figure 4. Such royalties will be treated as passive income, even if the CFC has developed the intellectual property or added substantial value to it. F IGURE 4: CFC DERIVES ROYALTIES FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORIGINATING IN NEW ZEALAND 6.17 As mentioned earlier, both Australia and the United States would treat the royalties in this scenario as active income. However, a stricter approach is justified in the New Zealand context given that, unlike Australia and the United States, New Zealand does not tax intellectual property when it exits the domestic tax base. NZ Co CFC Singapore IP developed - costs deducted - R&D incentives - no CGT IP transferred Unrelated party licence royalty United States 100% $$ New Zealand 34 6.18 One possible option would be to impose an exit tax on the intellectual property when it is transferred out of New Zealand. The introduction of such a tax would not be straightforward. There are always difficulties associated with valuing such property and determining the cost basis. What is even more important, however, is that change of this sort would represent significant reform in its own right and is not something we would contemplate merely as a consequence of CFC reform. Rents 6.19 The suggested treatment of rental income was outlined in the May update. 6.20 In most jurisdictions, rental income is considered to be passive in nature. This is also our starting position. 6.21 In certain circumstances, rental income could be considered to have the character of active income. Specifically: • when the CFC is actually in the business of renting; • when the CFC is not in the business of renting, but is an active business earning incidental rental income – for example, by leasing spare capacity; and • when the CFC holds property used by related CFCs for the purposes of carrying on an active business, receiving rental income from those other CFCs. 6.22 In practice, distinguishing between active and passive rental income can be difficult and subjective. However, real property, by its nature, is tied to the jurisdiction in which it is situated, so a nexus between the CFC and the income can be demonstrated. While equipment is obviously more mobile, concerns about profit shifting arise only if the CFC is earning rents from outside its jurisdiction. In the interests of keeping the definition of passive income limited and as straightforward as possible, all rental income derived from the leasing of real property or equipment situated in the same jurisdiction as the CFC will be treated as active income. Other rental income will be passive, subject to the rules about related party payments discussed in chapter 7. 6.23 Finance leases will be treated as loans giving rise to passive income, irrespective of whether the source of the payments is within the same jurisdiction as the CFC. 35 Chapter 7 RELATED-PARTY PAYMENTS Summary of suggested treatment Interest, royalties or rents received by a CFC (CFC A) from a related CFC (CFC B) will be disregarded under the new CFC rules if: • CFC B passes the active business test; and • both CFC A and CFC B are resident in the same jurisdiction. 7.1 Interest, rent and royalty payments received by a CFC from related CFCs will generally be passive income. We have considered whether there should be any exceptions to this general rule. The treatment of dividends, including those from related parties, is discussed in chapter 4. 7.2 Australia currently has no exemptions for related-party payments. 7.3 The United States exempts payments received by a CFC from related parties in two cases. Same jurisdiction exclusion 7.4 In the United States, dividend and interest income received by a CFC from a related foreign company (which does not have to be a CFC) are excluded from passive income if the company is created or organised in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. They are also excluded if the company’s assets (or a substantial part of them) and business are both located in that jurisdiction. 7.5 Rents and royalties received from a related foreign company are excluded from passive income if they were paid for the use or right to use property within the foreign country in which the CFC and related company are incorporated. However, the exclusion is lost if the payments reduce the payer’s income. 36 Look-through exclusion 7.6 The United States’ look-through exclusion is a temporary provision that expires at the end of 31 December 2008. 14 The exclusion provides that dividends, interest, rents and royalties received by a CFC from a related CFC are excluded to the extent that they are attributable or properly allocable to income of the related CFC that is neither passive income nor treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. The rule applies whether or not the related party is in the same jurisdiction. Suggested approach 7.7 We suggest introducing a “same jurisdiction” exception along the lines of the United States’ rule for related-party interest, royalties and rents. The rationale for the exclusion is effectively to avoid taxing active income when operations in a country are split among a number of different CFCs (for example, when operational CFCs are held through a holding company). 7.8 Specifically, interest, royalties or rents received by a CFC (CFC A) from a related party CFC (CFC B) will be disregarded under the new CFC rules if: • CFC B passes the active business test; and • both CFC A and CFC B are resident in the same jurisdiction. This means the payments will be excluded from passive income and total income for the purposes of the active business test (see chapter 3) and will not be treated as passive income for the purposes of attribution. 7.9 We do not support a look-through exclusion that applies to CFCs in different jurisdictions. Such transactions could lead to profit-shifting between jurisdictions, from high-tax to low-tax countries. 14 This provision was inserted into the US Code for three years – expiring in 31 December 2008. It is reported to be very uncertain as to whether the provision will be extended. 37 Chapter 8 OTHER PASSIVE INCOME Summary of suggested treatment Insurance premium income of a CFC will be passive income. Investment income derived by a CFC that is carrying on an offshore insurance business will be subject to the rules applying to other CFCs set out in previous chapters. Income from life insurance policies and net gains from the disposal of life insurance policies that are on revenue account will be passive income. Personal services income earned by a CFC will be attributed to the controlling New Zealand-shareholder if: • 80% of the CFC’s income from services relates to services personally performed by the New Zealand shareholder; and • substantial business assets are not part of the business structure used to derive the income from services. Gains from the disposal of revenue account property used in an offshore active business will be treated as active income. Gains from the disposal of other revenue account property will be treated as passive income. 8.1 This chapter examines amounts not covered in earlier chapters that will be considered passive income under the proposed CFC rules. Offshore insurance business 8.2 A CFC that carries on an offshore insurance business generates two main types of income: premiums and income from investment. Insurance and reinsurance premiums derived by a CFC will be passive income. There will be no special rules for investment income derived by a CFC that is carrying on an insurance business. Such income will be subject to the rules applying to other CFCs, set out in previous chapters, and is therefore likely to be treated as passive. The reasons that special rules are not suggested for offshore insurance businesses are the same as those set out in chapter 5 in relation to financial institutions. Life insurance policies 8.3 Life insurance policies will be treated as passive assets. This means that CFCs holding life insurance policies will derive passive income from these policies. 38 8.4 Net gains from the disposal of life insurance policies are also passive income under the rules in other countries, such as Australia. However, as New Zealand does not have a capital gains tax, passive income will arise on disposal of life insurance policies only if these policies are revenue account property, or if the CFC is in the business of trading in life insurance policies. Personal service contracts 8.5 The May update noted that the active income exemption could undermine taxation of New Zealand residents’ personal services income. This is because a New Zealand resident may provide personal services offshore through a company to avoid paying personal tax in New Zealand on income arising from personal effort. 8.6 Figure 5 illustrates the issue at hand. There is a contract between the CFC (person B) and the client (person A) for engineering services to be provided in South Africa. The service is performed personally in South Africa by a New Zealand resident (person C). In this case, the contract could have been made directly between the client and the engineer instead. F IGURE 5: PERSONAL SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH A CFC Client (person A) CFC (person B) South Africa 100% NZ-resident engineer (person C) Contract for engineering services New Zealand Engineering services performed in South Africa ≥80% of B’s income 39 8.7 Countries differ in their treatment of such personal services income. Canada has a rule that income is passive when derived by a CFC providing services or undertaking to provide services if the services are performed by an individual resident in Canada. The United States has a rule that prevents the use of a shell company to re-characterise income earned by an individual from personal effort. The rule applies only if 25% or more of the CFC is owned by the individual who is to perform the services. Australia also has rules for domestic personal service companies, and they are similar to the New Zealand rules. 8.8 New Zealand has a personal service company rule that applies domestically to ensure that individuals pay the 39% tax rate in respect of annual income exceeding $60,000 that results from their personal effort when they use an intermediary to shelter that income (sections GC 14B to GC 14E of the Income Tax Act 2004). The rule attributes income earned by an interposed entity (person B) to the individual (person C) who provides the personal services when five criteria are met: • Person C and person B are associated persons. • At least 80% of person B’s gross income from services is derived from a single source (person A). • At least 80% of person B’s gross income from services relates to services personally provided by person C (or a relative of C). • Person C has income over $60,000 after application of the attribution rule. • Substantial business assets are not part of the business structure used to derive the income from services. 8.9 The domestic rule should already cover the situation where a New Zealand- resident individual provides personal services offshore through a CFC. However, in our view, these criteria need to be modified to deal with the problems that arise in the cross-border context. Specifically, the personal service company rule, as it applies domestically, is aimed primarily at situations where an entity is interposed into a de facto employer/employee relationship between person A and person C in order to avoid the 39% personal income tax rate. In the context of reformed CFC rules, the concern is that a New Zealand resident uses a CFC to avoid tax on income from personal effort. The threshold for the top rate of personal income tax and the existence of employer/employee relationship are less relevant here. Therefore we suggest that the second and fourth criteria not be used in the international context. 8.10 In figure 5, income earned by the CFC would be attributed to the New Zealand-resident engineer since: • the engineer has an interest in the CFC; • 80% of the CFC’s income from services relates to engineering services personally performed by the individual (or a relative of the individual); and 40 • substantial business assets are not part of the business structure. 8.11 This ensures a broad consistency of treatment of personal services income earned offshore with that earned domestically. Since the rule is narrowly targeted, applying in defined circumstances, the risk of affecting legitimate business structures is considered to be small. Revenue account property 8.12 Revenue account property such as patents and shares has already been dealt with in previous chapters. For other forms of revenue account property, we suggest applying a modified version of the domestic tax treatment to the CFC. 8.13 Under New Zealand domestic tax law, the disposal of revenue account property gives rise to taxable income. In the context of the proposed CFC rules, gains from the disposal of revenue account property used in an offshore active business will be treated as active income. Gains from the disposal of other revenue account property will be treated as passive income. 41 Chapter 9 BASE COMPANY RULES Summary of suggested treatment Base company rules will be introduced but they will not apply to income derived from the sale of goods and from the supply of services related to the sale of goods. They will also not apply to income earned by a CFC from services if the services are performed in the jurisdiction of the CFC. They will apply only to income from services that are performed outside the jurisdiction in which the CFC is resident and if the employees performing the services are not resident in the CFC’s local jurisdiction. In that case the nominally active income will be treated as passive income. 9.1 Base company rules generally target arrangements whereby income is derived by a CFC on behalf of a group of companies in a manner intended to avoid or defer domestic tax. They seek to keep this income within the domestic tax base by deeming what would otherwise be active income to be passive income when the underlying transaction exhibits particular characteristics that indicate risk to that base. General considerations 9.2 Base company rules perform two main functions. For related-party transactions, they can supplement transfer pricing rules. More generally, however, they can prevent erosion of the domestic tax base through the establishment of a CFC to undertake activities without a genuine commercial reason. Transfer pricing rules offer less protection in this regard: even if a transaction is at arm’s length, there may still be a risk that income that would otherwise be taxable in New Zealand has been moved offshore to benefit from the exemption for active income. 9.3 The design of base company rules inevitably involves trade-offs between base protection objectives and the other key objectives of the international tax review – minimising compliance costs and allowing New Zealand firms to get on with business. In principle, base company rules should not apply to commercially driven transactions. In practice, rules that consistently distinguish legitimate transactions from those driven primarily by tax considerations are difficult to formulate. Base company rules that are too broad risk becoming an obstacle to efficient business activity. They may also impose compliance costs on firms applying the active business test and/or attributing offshore income to their New Zealand shareholders, because such rules affect the definition of “passive” income. 42 9.4 The purpose of base company rules should not be to second guess firms’ decisions about where to locate their operations. If a business activity is, in fact, carried on by a CFC in its local jurisdiction, the overall policy objective is to exempt the income derived from New Zealand taxation. As far as possible, base company rules should avoid cutting across that objective. They may, however, have a role to play when a nexus between the location of the CFC and the activity carried on is missing. Sale of goods 9.5 Other countries that exempt the offshore active income of CFCs typically impose base company rules in relation to both the sale of property and the provision of services. The government has already announced that New Zealand’s base company rules will not apply to income derived from the sale of goods and from the supply of services related to the sale of goods. 9.6 Our current transfer pricing rules for the sale of goods provide a level of protection against the sort of re-invoicing arrangement described in the December discussion document. The tangible nature of sale-of-goods transactions should also protect against sham transactions and artificial off- shoring. The absence of base company rules on the sale of goods will benefit CFCs carrying on export and distribution activities. Provision of services 9.7 As noted, we are mainly concerned about transactions that route services through a CFC without there being any nexus between the location of that CFC and the activity carried on. When the service is not performed within the CFC’s local jurisdiction, the question arises as to why the service was not provided by another group company – for example, by the New Zealand parent or by a CFC resident in the jurisdiction where the service was performed. As illustrated in figures 6 and 7, in the absence of any base company rules, domestic income could be shifted offshore, without any material change in a firm’s business. 43 F IGURE 6: SERVICE PERFORMED DOMESTICALLY ROUTED THROUGH OFFSHORE CFC F IGURE 7: SERVICE PERFORMED IN HIGH-TAX JURISDICTION ROUTED THROUGH LOW-TAX JURISDICTION fee High-tax country Parent New Zealand Low-tax country User service performed in high-tax country High-tax country New Zealand Low-tax country service performed in high-tax country User Parent CFC Country A New Zealand CFC service performed in Auckland User Parent fee service performed in Auckland Parent User fee 44 9.8 We therefore suggest that base company rules operate to deem nominally active income derived by a CFC to be passive income if the performance of the service is undertaken outside the jurisdiction in which the CFC is resident. Under these rules, the income derived by the CFC in both figures 6 and 7 will be treated as passive. Base company income will be treated as passive income of a CFC in applying the active business test, and also for the purposes of attribution back to New Zealand shareholders when applicable. This approach was canvassed in the May update. 9.9 Our expectation is that the vast majority of legitimate business arrangements will be unaffected by the base company rules. It is important to note that the relevant question is where the service is performed, not the location of the person receiving the service. Provided the service is performed within the CFC’s jurisdiction, the base company rules will not apply, even if the service is provided to a person in another jurisdiction (including New Zealand). 9.10 For example, a CFC providing call centre services should not be caught by this rule because the service will be performed in the jurisdiction of the CFC, even though it may be provided to users resident in New Zealand or third countries. On the other hand, consultancy services routed through a CFC but performed locally in the client’s jurisdiction would be caught, because there is no connection between the performance of the service and the location of the CFC. 9.11 We are conscious that some legitimate arrangements may be caught by these rules. For example, a New Zealand business may establish a CFC as a regional centre of expertise, providing on-site services to other CFCs in neighbouring jurisdictions. Those services potentially give rise to base company income because the service is not performed in the jurisdiction of the CFC providing the service. (Services performed in the CFC’s own jurisdiction on behalf of other CFCs would not be affected by the base company rules.) 9.12 To mitigate this problem, we suggest introducing a modification to the general base company rules, based on the residence of the employees delivering the service. If they are resident in the CFC’s local jurisdiction, the fact that the service is performed by them outside the CFC’s local jurisdiction will not give rise to base company income. This would be on the basis that the residence of the employees provided a sufficient nexus between the service and the location of the CFC to mitigate any concerns that the interposition of the CFC was artificial. 9.13 As far as we are aware, this exception to base company rules on services has no precedent internationally. It will therefore require monitoring to ensure that it does not give rise to unanticipated base maintenance concerns. It may be necessary to introduce pro rating rules to deal with cases where several individuals are involved in the provision of a service but only some are locally resident in the CFC’s jurisdiction. More generally, the intention is that the exception should apply only if the service itself is performed personally by employees resident in the CFC’s jurisdiction. If the service is performed mechanically, or provided by or through machinery or equipment that is located outside the jurisdiction of the CFC, the base company rules 45 will apply, even if auxiliary functions or services are carried on within the CFC’s local jurisdiction, or elsewhere by employees resident in that jurisdiction. An example of this might be the transmission of information using a communications satellite. Because the transmission service is not provided in any particular location, or performed by individual employees, the base company rules would apply. 9.14 We note that Australia has base company rules that treat income from services as passive whenever the user is resident in Australia (or has a permanent establishment there). We did consider similarly applying New Zealand’s base company rules to service transactions involving domestic users, on the grounds that the risk to our tax base is greatest when services are provided back into New Zealand. In the first place, there is a stronger prima facie argument that these are services that ought to be provided by a domestic entity rather than an offshore CFC. In addition, it is likely that the fee paid by the user will be deductible against New Zealand profits. 9.15 On balance, it seems advisable not to introduce such a rule at this time because of the potential impact on legitimate business structures. We are aware that New Zealand businesses use offshore service centres to provide services back into New Zealand for a variety of commercial reasons, including lower operating costs and the availability of appropriately skilled labour. Again, this is an area that will need monitoring to ensure that the absence of such a rule does not contribute to an erosion of the tax base. 46 Chapter 10 CALCULATING AND ATTRIBUTING CFC INCOME OR LOSS Summary of suggested treatment As a general rule, non-interest expenditure will be deductible in calculating the branch equivalent profits of a CFC to the extent they are incurred in deriving passive income, or in the course of a business carried on for the purpose of deriving such income, and not incurred in deriving active/disregarded income. Similar rules are suggested for non-interest expenditure incurred by shareholders in deriving an attributed CFC income or loss. Interest deductions in the calculation of branch equivalent profits will be restricted. The preferred approach is to pro-rate apportionment on the basis of the ratio of passive assets to active/disregarded assets. Interest deductions by shareholders will be subject to the interest allocation rules described in chapter 11. Special rules may be needed to deal with expenditure that relates to passive income that is not attributable because a CFC satisfies the active business test. The preferred approach is to allow such expenditure only if it is incurred in a year when the CFC is subject to attribution on its passive income. Technical amendments will be required to ensure that foreign tax credits are available only for tax paid or payable by a CFC in respect of its passive income. 10.1 This chapter discusses technical issues relating to the mechanics of calculating and attributing a CFC’s income or loss to its New Zealand- resident shareholders holding non-portfolio income interests. It considers how relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 will apply following the introduction of the active income exemption, and whether any modification of those provisions is required. Categories of income under the new rules 10.2 Existing law provides that a CFC’s branch equivalent income is calculated in broadly the same way as the net income or loss of a New Zealand resident. Section EX 18 sets out the basic formula for calculating a person’s attributed CFC income or loss, namely that person’s income interest in the CFC multiplied by the CFC’s branch equivalent income or loss. Section EX 21 lays down the detailed rules for calculating attributed CFC income or an attributed CFC loss, applying the Act (subject to certain modifications) as though the CFC were a New Zealand resident. 47 10.3 Under the new rules, CFCs will derive three broad categories of income: • Active/disregarded income. All income that is not within the meaning of “passive income” will be disregarded for the purposes of attribution. The distinction between active income and disregarded income is that the latter will be ignored for the purposes of the active business test described in chapter 3. This distinction is not relevant for the purposes of calculating the amount of attributed CFC income or loss. • Attributable passive income. Passive income derived by a CFC that does not satisfy the active business test will be subject to attribution to New Zealand shareholders with non-portfolio income interests. • Non-attributable passive income. Passive income derived by a CFC that satisfies the active business test will not be subject to attribution. 10.4 Amendments to subpart EX will be needed to ensure that only passive income is taken into account for the purposes of calculating the branch equivalent income of a CFC. It is anticipated that the correct treatment of non-attributable passive income will be achieved through the operation of the active business test, the effect of which should be to suspend the attribution requirements in relation to CFCs satisfying that test. General treatment of expenditure 10.5 The treatment of expenditure under the new rules is a key issue. Existing law provides that a CFC’s branch equivalent income is calculated in broadly the same way as the net income or loss of a New Zealand resident. Subparts CQ and DN of the Income Tax Act set out when attributed CFC income or an attributed CFC loss arises and provide that the amount of such income or loss is to be calculated in accordance with subpart EX. Section EX 21 applies the Act (subject to certain modifications) as though the CFC were a New Zealand resident, so the core provisions are in point. In particular, section BC 4 provides that a person’s net income or loss is determined by the difference between annual gross income and annual total deductions, those amounts being, respectively, assessable income and deductions allocated to a particular income year (sections BC 2 and BC 3). Nexus with passive income 10.6 Subpart DA sets out the general rule for deductions. Section DA 1 contains the general permission. It states that a person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent that it is incurred in deriving assessable or excluded income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving such income. The effect is to require a nexus between expenditure and assessable income. 15 Section DA 2 lays down the general limitations. These include the exempt income limitation at subsection (3), which prohibits deductions for expenditure or loss incurred in deriving exempt income. 15 CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236. 48 10.7 Consistent with the principles set out in subpart DA, an amount of expenditure or loss incurred will not be deductible when calculating branch equivalent income or loss except to the extent that it is incurred in deriving passive income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving such income, and is not incurred in deriving active/disregarded income. 10.8 In practice, a CFC’s expenditure will often relate to both passive and active/disregarded income. The general permission incorporates the concept of apportionment by referring to deductions being allowed to the extent that they relate to assessable or excluded income. 16 Section DA 1(1)(b) allows a deduction for all expenses incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable or excluded income. The exempt income limitation at section DA 2(3) ensures that expenditure is not deductible to the extent that it is incurred in deriving exempt income. The apportionment rules will similarly apply to expenditure relating to both passive and active/disregarded income. 10.9 Expenditure relating to non-attributable passive income is discussed separately. Interest payments and related matters 10.10 The treatment of interest payments requires special consideration. Section DB 7 provides that, subject to certain exceptions, a company (other than a qualifying company) is allowed a deduction for interest. This provision supplements the general permission and overrides various of the general limitations, including the exempt income limitation and the capital limitation. As a result, most companies can claim interest expenses regardless of whether there is any nexus between that expenditure and their assessable or excluded income. Background to section DB 7 10.11 The predecessor to section DB 7 was section DD 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 17 Before the latter provision was introduced, in 2001, policy and technical arguments relating to interest deductibility were discussed in a number of official publications, including the 1992 Final report of the consultative committee on the taxation of income from capital (chapter 7) and the 1999 discussion document Interest deductions for companies. The fungibility of money made tracing or apportioning interest costs a largely meaningless exercise, involving significant compliance costs for often arbitrary results. Companies, particularly large companies with a range of assets and liabilities, frequently borrow for general purposes. Even when a company does borrow with a view to financing specific activities, its ability to raise and service the debt will depend on its aggregate position. Debt and equity funding for any particular asset are substitutable, so there is little economic significance in matching assets and loans. Allowing a company to 16 Buckley &Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. 17 Also, section BD 2A and section DD 1(4). These provisions were effective from 24 October 2001 and applied to the 1997-98 and subsequent income years. 49 deduct interest payments only if there was a nexus with assessable or excluded income was considered more likely to distort its financial structure than to limit its deductions and increase revenue. 10.12 The major concern at the time was not interest expenditure relating to exempt income, but rather expenditure relating to capital amounts (which, generally, are not income for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and are not, therefore, expressly exempt). Indeed, section DB 7 does not apply to companies deriving exempt income (other than dividends and certain other amounts). Most companies were not expected to derive such income. The introduction of an active income exemption changes the landscape. Many CFCs will derive significant amounts of income no longer subject to New Zealand tax through the attribution rules. The question is how interest expenditure relating to such income should be treated. Limiting interest deductions for CFCs 10.13 In principle, similar arguments about the fungibility of money apply to interest expenditure incurred by CFCs under the new rules. Nevertheless, our view is that deductions should be limited to interest payments on borrowings related to the derivation of passive income. The continued taxation of passive income on accrual is regarded as essential to protect the New Zealand tax base. Allowing a CFC to deduct all interest expenditure without regard to whether its borrowings are related to the derivation of passive income would frustrate this policy objective. 10.14 Restricting interest deductions is logically consistent with the introduction of interest allocation rules for outbound investment set out in chapter 11. Those rules will protect the domestic tax base by requiring that an appropriate level of group debt is allocated to CFCs. Limiting interest deductions by CFCs will prevent that debt being used to shelter passive income from accrual taxation. 10.15 There are various ways of attempting to limit the deductibility of interest payments. The main approaches were summarised in the 1999 discussion document on interest deductions: 18 • Tracking. This would involve identifying how debt has been applied. Deductions for interest would be allowed if funds are used to produce passive income. Very broadly, this is the approach to interest deductibility authorised by the New Zealand courts when section DB 7 does not apply. 19 • Stacking. This would involve “ordering” income and expenditure and allowing interest deductions only when there is sufficient income to satisfy the test. (Alternatively, the test could be applied by reference to assets.) There are two distinct models: 18 Interest deductions for companies; a government discussion document. Published in September 1999. Available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz . 19 Relevant cases include Public Trustee v CIR (1938) NZLR 436, Pacific Rendezvous v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146, and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184. The Commissioner’s interpretation of principles relating to interest deductibility is set out in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 18, No. 6 (July 2006). 50 – allow deductions up to the amount of passive income (or to the extent that the debt does not exceed the value of passive assets); – allow deductions to the extent that interest expenditure exceeds active/disregarded income (or that the debt outstanding exceeds the value of active/disregarded assets). • Pro rata apportionment. Under this approach, a proportion of total interest expenditure would be deductible, based either on the ratio of passive income to active/disregarded income or on the ratio of passive assets to active/disregarded assets. 10.16 The difficulties associated with tracking, particularly with respect to companies, have already been outlined. Because it disregards the fungibility of money, a tracking approach would be difficult to apply in practice and would allow scope for planning that may prevent the effective taxation of passive income. 10.17 As regards stacking, the first approach – allowing deductions up to the amount of passive income (or assets) – would also frustrate the policy of taxing passive income on accrual. Any CFC with a material level of commercial activity and a reasonable amount of debt would be able to use its interest deductions to shelter all or most of its passive income. The second approach – only allowing deductions to the extent that interest expenditure exceeds active/disregarded income (or assets) – runs into the opposite problem: a CFC with significant active income and only a modest amount of passive income would find itself unable to claim any deductions for interest. 10.18 In our view, pro rata apportionment offers the most appropriate solution for dealing with interest deductibility. As noted, we could look to either income or assets as the basis for apportionment. Looking to the asset structure of the CFC should give the most accurate reflection of how borrowed funds, along with other capital, are invested in the business. An asset-focused approach does have certain drawbacks, however. In particular, it would require all business assets to be valued, and identified as active or passive or both. Assets employed to derive both active/disregarded and passive income would likely create apportionment problems of their own. Countering avoidance 10.19 Restrictions on interest deductibility applied on an individual CFC basis are vulnerable to planning activity. The general interest allocation rules discussed in chapter 11 will require that a certain amount of group debt be located offshore, but they will make no provision about how debt is distributed between CFCs. It would therefore be possible to circumvent the rules on pro rata apportionment by concentrating debt in a CFC with mainly passive income, which in turn provided equity funding to related CFCs with a higher proportion of active/disregarded income. Compare figures 8 and 9. 51 10.20 We are considering options to deal with this sort of structure. One possibility would be to apply rules equivalent to the interest allocation rules to individual CFCs. Thus, interest deductions available after pro rating would be further reduced, for the purposes of calculating branch equivalent income, if a CFC’s debt-to-asset ratio exceeded both the 75% safe harbour and 110% of the worldwide group ratio. 10.21 Alternatively, a look-through rule could perhaps be applied, limiting interest deductions by reference to the amount of equity a CFC holds in other CFCs deriving active/disregarded income. In figure 8, half of CFC A’s debt is used to finance equity investment in CFC B, which has 50% passive income. In the calculation of CFC A’s branch equivalent income, therefore, interest deductions could be restricted to 75% of the total by applying the formula 1 - (0.5 x 0.5). Transaction costs of borrowing money 10.22 Section DB 5 provides that a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in borrowing money used as capital in deriving income, overriding the capital limitation. We consider that, in the calculation of branch equivalent income, such deductions should be subject to the same pro rata limitation as will apply to interest deductions generally. $100 equity $200 loan $100 loan Country A New Zealand Figure 8: 75% of CFCs’ combined interest expenditure deductible Figure 9: 100% of CFCs’ combined interest expenditure deductible Parent Parent CFC A 100% passive CFC B 50% passive CFC B 50% passive CFC A 100% passive $100 loan 52 Money borrowed to acquire shares in group companies 10.23 Section DB 8 allows a company a deduction for money borrowed to acquire shares in other group companies. This provision supplements the general permission and overrides various of the general limitations, including the exempt income limitation and the capital limitation. If a company is not anyway able to claim a deduction for the interest under section DB 7, section DB 8 allows a deduction in relation to shares generating exempt inter- corporate dividends, for which the nexus requirements of subpart DA are not satisfied. 20 10.24 If interest deductions are restricted according to a CFC’s ratio of passive to active/disregarded income, as suggested, this should override section DB 8 in the calculation of branch equivalent income. Shareholder deductions 10.25 The deductibility of expenses incurred directly by New Zealand shareholders in deriving their attributed CFC income or loss also requires consideration. Such expenses could include professional fees associated with share acquisitions and interest on borrowings used to finance offshore investment. Non-interest expenditure 10.26 The nexus test imposed by the general permission (section DA 1(1)(a)) should apply directly to non-interest expenditure incurred by shareholders. Attributable CFC income is income for the purposes of section BD 1 by virtue of section CQ 1. Thus, an amount of expenditure or loss will be prima facie deductible if it satisfies the general permission. 10.27 The exempt income limitation, on the other hand, is unlikely to apply of its own accord. If CFC income is not attributed to New Zealand shareholders under subpart CQ, it will fall outside the meaning of income for the purposes of section BD 1. In substance, however, active/disregarded income derived by a CFC will be exempt. Accordingly, in our view, the exempt income limitation, or an equivalent, ought to apply to expenditure incurred by shareholders in relation to such income. If necessary, express provision to this effect will be made. The intention would be to ensure that shareholders’ expenditure is deductible only to the extent that it is incurred in deriving passive income and is not incurred in deriving active/disregarded income. When such expenditure relates partly to passive and partly to active/disregarded income, apportionment will be required. 20 The policy rationale for section DB 8 was considered by the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital in its 1991 report, Tax accounting issues (chapter 2). The report analysed the equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 1976 (section 106(1)(h)(ii)). The Committee noted that dividends received by companies were exempt and that the requirement for interest expenditure to have a nexus with assessable income could not therefore be satisfied in relation to such interest. However, because the income would normally be taxable in the hands of the underlying shareholders, it was reasonable for this expenditure to be deductible. The inter-corporate dividend exemption has since been restricted to dividends from foreign companies and other companies in the same wholly owned group, and the general provision on interest deductibility (section DB 7) has been introduced. Nevertheless, the 1999 discussion document Interest deductions for companies argued that what is now section DB 8 would continue to be important to taxpayers and remained appropriate in policy terms. 53 10.28 Again, the treatment of expenditure related to non-attributable passive income is considered separately. Interest expenditure 10.29 When a CFC borrows directly, interest deductions should be allowed only to the extent that its total income consists of passive income. No new restrictions on the application of sections DB 5, DB 7 and DB 8 to New Zealand shareholders borrowing to fund equity investment in CFCs are suggested. The interest allocation rules outlined in chapter 11 will require an appropriate amount of group debt to be allocated by the New Zealand parent to its CFCs. 10.30 New Zealand shareholders that are outside the scope of sections DB 7 and DB 8 will remain eligible for interest deductions according to established principles, subject to the interest allocation rules (where applicable). As for non-interest expenditure, the intention would be for the exempt income limitation, or an equivalent, to apply to interest payments incurred by shareholders for the purposes of deriving active/disregarded CFC income. Attributed CFC losses 10.31 Subpart DN deals with attributed losses from foreign equity. Section DN 1 supplements the general permission (and overrides the capital limitation) to allow a deduction for an attributed CFC loss. Section DN 2 specifies when an attributed CFC loss arises. Section DN 3 provides that the amount of that loss is to be calculated in accordance with subpart EX, applying the Act as broadly as though the CFC were New Zealand-resident. General rule 10.32 Under the Act’s core provisions, a net loss arises when total deductions for the year exceed assessable income (section BC 4(3)). Because expenditure will be deductible in the calculation of branch equivalent income or loss only if there is a nexus with passive income, or if interest payments are allowable under the suggested pro rating rules, there should be no need for special rules distinguishing “active net losses” from “passive net losses”. Expenditure relating to active/disregarded income will not be deductible. Therefore any net loss arising to a CFC under section BC 4 will necessarily reflect the fact that deductions relating to passive income exceed such income in a particular year. Losses: ring-fencing, carry-forward, and group offset 10.33 A net loss incurred by a CFC is attributed to its shareholders rather than being quarantined within the CFC itself. The use of such losses by the shareholders to whom they are attributed is subject to jurisdictional ring- fencing rules. Section DN 4 provides that an attributed CFC loss may be offset only against attributed CFC or branch equivalent FIF income from CFCs/FIFs in the same jurisdiction (section DN 4). Any excess becomes an attributed CFC net loss that may be carried forward and used under section IE 1 (by virtue of section IE 3) or section IE 3(5), or used against 54 current or future income of another company in the same group under section IG 4. Both carry-forward and group-offset of attributed CFC losses are also subject to jurisdictional ring-fencing. 10.34 The move to an active income exemption does not appear to require any change in these rules. It is worth noting that New Zealand’s rules for attributed losses are, in practice, already more relaxed than the equivalent rules in Australia. There, CFC losses are quarantined within the CFC that incurred them and prior-year losses may be carried forward only if the CFC was a CFC in the year the loss was incurred and in all intervening years and are generally not available if the CFC switches residence between a listed country and an unlisted country. Current Australian law also quarantines foreign losses by reference to four separate classes of income, although the Australian government has announced its intention to remove that restriction. Non-attributable passive income 10.35 Non-attributable passive income is passive income derived by a CFC that satisfies the active business test and is not, therefore, subject to attribution on any of its income. The treatment of such income requires careful consideration. The principal issue is how a nexus-based approach to expenditure applies when there is a possibility that some or all of the associated income may remain outside the tax base, even though that income is passive and therefore prima facie assessable. This is most likely to create difficulties when expenditure is incurred in one year and the income to which it relates is derived in later years. Calculating branch equivalent income 10.36 The Australian approach is to allow deductions for expenditure relating to non-attributable passive income in calculating CFC income, even though, strictly, the nexus test is not satisfied. The corollary is that passive income earned by a CFC reduces any carried forward passive losses, even if the CFC is not subject to attribution at the time this income is derived. 21 10.37 This approach is not easy to replicate exactly in New Zealand because we treat CFC losses differently. While Australia quarantines losses within the CFC itself, New Zealand allows losses to be attributed to, and utilised by, shareholders (subject to jurisdictional ring-fencing). We have considered various options for dealing with non-attributable passive income, and they are outlined below. Our provisional view is that option 2 provides a workable, straightforward solution, delivering certainty while also minimising compliance costs. 21 Section 382 of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the ITAA 36) provides that attributable income is the amount that would be the CFC’s taxable income under certain assumptions, one of which is (in broad terms) that its only taxable income is its passive/tainted income and all other income is exempt income. The general nexus rule in section 8 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 provides that a loss or outgoing may be deducted to the extent that it is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income. There are various detailed provisions in Part X (Division 7) of the ITAA 36 concerning attribution: sections 425, 426 and 428 are relevant to the treatment of non- attributable passive income (referred to, in Australia, as “exempt passive income”). 55 Option 1: Treat non-attributable passive income in the same way as active/ disregarded income 10.38 Under this approach, expenditure incurred in deriving non-attributable passive income would not be deductible, and no losses in relation to such income would arise. This is attractive inasmuch as it preserves the integrity and conceptual simplicity of the current nexus test by requiring a link between expenditure and income that is actually subject to New Zealand tax. The major drawback is uncertainty about the deductibility of expenditure, which would depend on whether or not the CFC was subject to attribution at the time the corresponding income was derived. For CFCs that routinely satisfy, or fail to satisfy, the active business test, this may present few problems, but practical difficulties may arise for CFCs closer to the 5% threshold. Option 2: Allow expenditure related to passive income only if it is incurred during a year when the CFC is subject to attribution on its passive income 10.39 This option would replace the nexus test for expenditure with a rule that looked to the status of the CFC in the year to which the expenditure is allocated under the core provisions. All deductions relating to passive income would be allowed if they were allocated under section BD 4 to a year for which a CFC did not satisfy the active business test and was therefore subject to attribution; no regard would be had to whether the expenditure related to future passive income which turned out not to be attributable because the CFC satisfied the active business test for the year in which that income was derived. For years in which a CFC did satisfy the active business test, any net passive loss would not be available for attribution to shareholders. This approach should be straightforward and workable. Option 3: Allow all deductions relating to passive income (including non-attributable passive income) and reduce carried-forward losses by passive income derived (including non-attributable passive income) 10.40 This option would give us a system for dealing with non-attributable passive income similar to Australia’s but operating on a per-jurisdiction basis, consistent with the overall approach of New Zealand’s rules. It would mean that expenditure relating to non-attributable passive income was deductible, and that net losses from a CFC not subject to attribution could be used to offset attributable passive income from another CFC (or branch equivalent FIF) operating in the same jurisdiction. By the same token, non-attributable passive income from one CFC could reduce current-year and carried-forward losses relating to other CFCs or branch equivalent FIFs in the same jurisdiction. 10.41 We consider this option to be conceptually robust and most likely to produce accurate results. However, we also note that it would involve compliance costs for CFCs that satisfy the active business test, because of the need to track passive income and losses on an ongoing basis. While the active business test will require some monitoring of this income in any event, the basis of that calculation will be different if the test is based on NZ IFRS and IFRS principles. 56 10.42 In effect, a taxpayer carrying forward attributed passive losses would have to forgo the protection otherwise afforded by the active business test and calculate passive income and losses for all the CFCs in a jurisdiction, even if no attribution of the income was required. It may be possible to give taxpayers some choice about whether or not to engage in that exercise, but if they elected not to, they would be unable to carry forward attributed CFC losses. Shareholder deductions 10.43 Similar considerations arise in relation to expenditure incurred directly by New Zealand shareholders in deriving non-attributable passive income. 10.44 The main expense incurred by shareholders is likely to be interest. It has already been suggested that, in line with sections DB 7 and DB 8, the nexus test should not generally apply to such expenditure. Therefore the question of whether the CFC to which the expenditure relates is subject to attribution is not relevant. Interest deductions would be allowed in accordance with those provisions, subject to the interest allocation rules. 10.45 For interest expenditure incurred by shareholders not covered by sections DB 7 and DB 8, and for other expenditure, it may be appropriate to adopt a similar approach to that suggested for expenditure incurred by CFCs themselves. Under option 2, passive expenditure incurred by a shareholder will be allowed if the CFC to which it relates was subject to attribution in the year to which the expenditure was allocated under the core provisions. Expenditure relating to more than one CFC, some of which is subject to attribution in the year in question and some of which is not, will need to be apportioned. Foreign tax credits under section LC 4 10.46 Section LC 4 provides that a person with an attributed CFC income is allowed a credit for tax paid by or on behalf of the CFC in respect of that income. If a CFC satisfies the active business test for a year, none of its income will be attributed back to its New Zealand shareholders in that year under the CFC rules. Accordingly, credits will not be available under the terms of section LC 4(1) for tax paid by or on behalf of that CFC. If a CFC does not satisfy the active business test, the requirements of section LC 4(1) could be met and credits may be available. Section LC 4(3) will need to be amended to ensure that credits are available only for tax paid or payable by a CFC in respect of its passive income. Transitional issues 10.47 Further consideration needs to be given to transitional matters relating to attributed CFC net losses carried forward under section IE 1 (by virtue of section IE 3) and to foreign tax credits carried forward under section LC 4(6). These matters will be discussed in a subsequent paper. 57 Chapter 11 INTEREST ALLOCATION RULES Summary of suggested treatment Interest allocation rules will apply to a New Zealand company with controlled foreign companies unless it has: • 90% or more of its assets in New Zealand; or • less than $250,000 of interest deductions. Companies required to comply with interest allocation rules will apportion their interest deductions if their New Zealand group debt percentage ratio is greater than 75%. The apportionment is based on the 75% safe harbour, or 110% of the worldwide group debt percentage, whichever is higher. Existing rules will be used to measure debt and assets for the purpose of the interest allocation rules, except that: • fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers will be treated as debt for the purpose of the interest allocation rules; • equity investment in CFCs will not be counted as assets; and • the definition of “worldwide debt” will exclude liabilities that do not provide funds and liabilities that do not give rise to deductions (except fixed rate shares, which will be treated as debt for this purpose). Introduction 11.1 The government announced in the May update that the package of international tax reforms would include interest allocation rules for outbound investment. This chapter outlines technical details of the new rules. While some design features are taken from similar rules used in Australia, we are aware that the New Zealand business environment may be different – for example, New Zealand companies face a smaller domestic market and may expand offshore at an earlier stage of their life cycle. Submissions are invited on the suggested rules. 11.2 Current tax legislation contains interest allocation rules applying to foreign controlled New Zealand companies, referred to as thin capitalisation rules. These rules will be extended and modified to apply to all New Zealand companies with offshore operations. 58 11.3 Accordingly, the new interest allocation rules will apply to: • foreign-controlled New Zealand companies, as under the current thin capitalisation rules – the inbound companies; and • New Zealand companies with controlled foreign companies (CFCs) – the outbound companies. 11.4 The provisions of the new interest allocation rules will, unless indicated otherwise, apply to both inbound and outbound companies. Some technical changes may tighten the operation of the existing rules. 11.5 While the interest allocation rules may have broad potential scope, exemptions within the rules mean that they are expected, in practice, to restrict interest deductions in extreme cases. If the rules discussed in this chapter are implemented, then outbound companies need not apply them when: • more than 90% of the group’s assets are in New Zealand; or • total interest deductions of the company are less than $250,000. Companies not falling within these exemptions will need to apply the interest allocation rules, but there will be no interest denials when: • the New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio is below the 75% safe harbour; or • debt funding is below 110% of the worldwide group debt percentage. In both cases, the on-lending concession will help companies avoid interest denials. Exceptions for outbound companies 11.6 The interest allocation rules will provide exceptions for outbound companies that have a small amount of outbound investment and/or a small amount of interest expense. 11.7 These exceptions, which are based on similar rules in Australia, are expected to benefit outbound companies when the risk of profit shifting is relatively small. Entities with a small amount of outbound investment 11.8 Companies with a small amount of offshore investment do not have a significant scope to over-allocate their global interest costs against New Zealand income. 11.9 In our view, New Zealand companies with 90% or more of their assets in New Zealand should not be required to apply the interest allocation rules. 59 11.10 Companies with minimal offshore assets will be able to do a simple calculation to determine if they qualify for this exemption. This will reduce compliance costs and ensure that the interest allocation rules do not inhibit companies from exploring offshore opportunities. Export companies with distribution and marketing facilities that have minimal offshore assets could also benefit from this exemption. Entities with a small amount of interest deduction 11.11 Submissions on the December discussion document requested that small New Zealand entities should be exempt from the interest allocation rules. However, an exemption based on “size” criteria, such as total income, total assets and number of employees, would not offer sufficient protection for the New Zealand tax base. Entities that are “small” under these criteria could still allocate an excessive proportion of their global interest costs to New Zealand. 11.12 Instead, an exemption based on small amounts of interest deduction, such as $250,000, may be more appropriate. This criterion would exempt many small New Zealand entities from the interest allocation rules while limiting the risk to the New Zealand tax base. 11.13 Companies will be able to determine if they qualify for this exemption by examining the amount of interest deduction they are claiming. However, suitable rules are needed to ensure that they include all interest deductions claimed by related and associated parties. 11.14 We also have some concerns about the application of this exception to a special purpose company that holds interests in CFCs with real estate investments. This company could be fully debt-funded in New Zealand (with interest deductions up to the $250,000 threshold) while holding offshore real estate investments that generate tax-exempt rental income. It would not be appropriate to exempt the special purpose company from the interest allocation rules. General principles of the interest allocation rules 11.15 Companies required to comply with interest allocation rules will, in the first instance, calculate their New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio. Companies with a New Zealand group debt-to-asset ratio that is within the 75% safe harbour will not have to apportion their interest deductions, which is consistent with the existing thin capitalisation rules. 11.16 The 75% safe harbour allows New Zealand businesses significant scope for offshore expansion before they need to consider the impact of the proposed interest allocation rules. This safe harbour is consistent with the government’s desire not to unduly restrict New Zealand businesses from exploring offshore investment opportunities. 60 11.17 The 75% safe harbour provides a level of protection for the New Zealand tax base. Companies that exceed the 75% safe harbour could have their interest deductions apportioned. The apportionment is based on the 75% safe- harbour debt-to-asset ratio or 110% of the worldwide group debt-to-asset ratio, whichever is higher. The excess interest deductions will be denied. Definition and measurement of debt 11.18 Under the current thin capitalisation rules a company includes as debt all financial arrangements that provide funds to the company and give rise to an allowable deduction. This debt is consolidated across all the entities in the company’s New Zealand group. The same approach to debt will be adopted for interest allocation rules for outbound investments. 11.19 In addition, we suggest an adjustment for fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers. This rule, which currently applies for the purposes of the minimum equity rules for banks, will apply for the purpose of the new interest allocation rules. Fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers 11.20 Fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers should be treated as debt for the purpose of the interest allocation rules. For groups with interest denial, an after-tax advantage could be gained by issuing fixed rate shares instead of debt. This would have the effect of avoiding the impact of the interest allocation rules. 11.21 Fixed rate shares are close substitutes for debt as they have commercial characteristics that are very much like conventional debt. They also have tax characteristics that are substitutable with debt because they carry imputation credits that reduce shareholder level taxes in New Zealand. 11.22 As fixed rate shares have tax and commercial characteristics that are similar to debt, they should be treated in the same way as debt under the interest allocation rules. Otherwise, companies could avoid the impact of the rules by issuing fixed rate shares instead of conventional debt. 11.23 Some commentators have pointed out that issuing ordinary shares to New Zealand taxpayers could achieve the same tax outcome. However, ordinary shares have commercial characteristics that are sufficiently different from debt to warrant a different treatment under the interest allocation rules. Definition and measurement of assets 11.24 The definition of “total assets” under the existing thin capitalisation rules, with the adjustments from equity investment in CFCs, will apply for all interest allocation purposes. Under these measurement rules, total assets of a New Zealand group include all consolidated assets of the entities in the group as reported in the group’s financial accounts. 61 Adjustments for equity investment in CFCs 11.25 Equity investments in CFCs would not be counted as assets of the New Zealand group under the interest allocation rules. This adjustment removes offshore assets to the extent they are equity-funded by a New Zealand company from the asset base used to calculate the safe harbour, thereby reducing the amount of debt a New Zealand company can have before it has to apportion its interest deductions. 11.26 This adjustment is consistent with the proposed active income exemption. As profits from equity investments in CFCs would no longer be fully taxable in New Zealand, interest costs associated with these tax-exempt investments should not be allowed as deductions in New Zealand. Removing the equity investments in CFCs from the asset base used in the comparison with the safe harbour achieves this. 11.27 We recognise that, in principle, passive outbound investments should not be removed from the asset base to the extent that they are taxed in New Zealand. However, if we include passive outbound investments in the asset base, adjustments will need to be made to the calculation of the foreign tax credits given against New Zealand tax arising on such income to account for interest deducted in New Zealand on debt funding such investments. Moreover, distinguishing between outbound equity investments that are active and those that are passive for the purpose of the interest allocation rules could be difficult both to design and difficult for companies to comply with. Overall, removing all equity investments in CFCs from the asset base provides a simpler approach. This is the approach adopted by Australia. On-lending concession 11.28 Submissions have pointed out that it is often cheaper, or more practical, for New Zealand multinationals to raise debt in New Zealand to fund their offshore operations. It is common in these circumstances for New Zealand companies then to shift the debt costs offshore through intra-group loans. 11.29 The interest allocation rules should recognise and facilitate this practice as it is consistent with the basic objective of these rules. Therefore an on-lending concession should apply to loans that are provided by a New Zealand company to its CFCs at arm’s length terms. 11.30 No legislative change would be necessary because the existing on-lending concession already covers this scenario. The current on-lending concession applies to any funds lent to borrowers that are non-residents and do not operate a fixed establishment in New Zealand. This is expected to cover the funds lent by a New Zealand company to its CFC. 11.31 When the on-lending concession applies, the total debt and total assets in the group debt percentage ratio are both reduced by the on-lent amount. This adjustment removes the on-lent amount from the safe harbour calculation. 62 Financial institutions 11.32 Submissions have pointed out that the general interest allocation rules may not be appropriate when applied to financial institutions, a matter dealt with at present through the on-lending concession. However, for financial institutions the concession can lead to a different result than it does for foreign-owned banks, which have to comply with the minimum capital requirements. 11.33 Australia has dealt with this problem by introducing specific interest allocation rules for financial intermediaries. We are considering whether special rules should be introduced in New Zealand to deal with this situation. If such rules are to be contemplated, they would be subject to consultation with interested parties at a later date. “Debt” and “asset” defined 11.34 In summary, for the purpose of calculating the safe harbour ratio of a New Zealand company with CFCs: • “Debt” is defined as: (1) all financial arrangements that provide funds to the taxpayer and give rise to an allowable deduction; plus (2) any fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand shareholders; less (3) any debt provided at arm’s length terms to a CFC. • “Assets” is defined as: (1) all assets of the New Zealand group as recorded in the financial accounts; less (2) any equity investment in a CFC; less (3) any debt provided at arm’s length terms to a CFC. Worldwide group debt percentage 11.35 If a New Zealand group’s debt-to-asset ratio exceeds the 75% safe harbour, allowable interest deductions for the group will be limited to a level consistent with the safe harbour or 110% of its worldwide group debt percentage, whichever is the higher. The worldwide group debt percentage ensures that companies operating in a high-leverage business environment are not artificially restricted by the 75% safe harbour. 63 11.36 The worldwide group debt percentage of a New Zealand group is defined currently as the group’s consolidated worldwide debt as a percentage of its consolidated worldwide total assets. Consolidated worldwide debt and worldwide assets are calculated in accordance with New Zealand’s generally accepted accounting principles. 11.37 The existing measurement rules for the worldwide group debt percentage will apply to all New Zealand companies required to comply with the interest allocation rules, with an amendment to the definition of “worldwide debt”. Definition of “worldwide debt” 11.38 At present, “debt” under the safe harbour calculation includes financial arrangements that provide funds and give rise to deductions for taxation purposes. However, the definition of “worldwide debt” includes all liabilities under generally accepted accounting practice. 11.39 A variety of non-interest bearing liabilities and liabilities that do not provide funds are included in the worldwide debt calculation. As a result, the level of worldwide group debt percentage could be greater than it would under the definition of debt used in the safe harbour calculation. This disparity provides an opportunity for companies to over-allocate global interest costs to the New Zealand tax base. 11.40 Ideally, the definition of worldwide debt and the definition used to calculate the safe harbour would be aligned. The definition of worldwide debt would thus exclude liabilities that do not provide funds and liabilities that do not give rise to deductions. 11.41 It is envisaged that, in practice, companies will start with the amount of liabilities reported in their consolidated financial statements. They will remove from this amount those liabilities that do not provide funds and liabilities that do not give rise to deductions (except fixed rate shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers as these would be treated as debt for this purpose). 110% uplift 11.42 The 110% loading allows companies to increase their debt capacity in New Zealand relative to their worldwide group. For example, companies with a worldwide group debt percentage of 80% will be allowed to apportion their interest deductions based on a ratio of 88%. In this case, the 110% loading is concessionary. However, it does offer a degree of protection for companies whose New Zealand operations are in some way atypical of their worldwide operations. 64 11.43 We suggest retaining the 110% uplift under the new interest allocation rules. We note that Australia has a 120% loading, but it is calculated on the basis of debt-to-equity ratio, rather than debt-to-asset ratio. 22 Our calculation suggests that the 110% loading on debt-to-asset ratio is always higher than the 120% loading on the debt-to-equity ratio when the 75% safe harbour ratio is exceeded. Investments in associate entities 11.44 Current thin capitalisation rules focus on the entities that the New Zealand parent controls. Entities that the New Zealand parent does not “control”, it is assumed, could not be used to over-allocate interest deductions to New Zealand. 11.45 However, the approach ignores an intermediate group of entities that a New Zealand company has significant influence over but does not control. A more precise approach to the interest allocation rules would take into account the funding relationships between the New Zealand company and these entities, which are commonly known as associate entities. Australia’s interest allocation rules do this. 11.46 We have not suggested introducing similar rules at this time because of the complexity involved. The potential compliance costs for businesses of such rules are also a concern. The application of the interest allocation rules will, however, have to be monitored, to ascertain the need to buttress the rules in this way. Miscellaneous issues Implications for non-residents and non-resident controlled entities 11.47 It is intended that the amended interest allocation rules would apply to non- resident controlled entities that have to apply the existing thin capitalisation rules. They include any non-resident controlled entities that do not have any outbound investment. 11.48 The main proposals that apply to outbound investments are expected to have little or no effect on these non-resident controlled entities. Nevertheless, they could be affected by some of the technical amendments discussed in this chapter because: • some fixed rate shares would be classified as liabilities; and • a narrower definition of worldwide debt could apply. 22 The 120% uplift on debt-to-equity ratio is equivalent to (120%× worldwide debt)/\[(120%×worldwide debt)+worldwide equity\]. 65 Remedial issue 11.49 The December discussion document also raised a remedial issue that arises in relation to non-residents with New Zealand-sourced income. An example of this is non-residents who own land and buildings and are earning rental income in New Zealand. They are currently subject to New Zealand tax and the existing thin capitalisation rules should apply. 11.50 However, the current rules do not work properly in this case. A technical deficiency in the tax legislation allows non-residents without a permanent establishment who hold New Zealand assets directly to finance their assets entirely by debt. This deficiency should be corrected. How the interest allocation rules will work 11.51 Examples 2A and 2B illustrate how the 75% safe harbour will operate. 66 Example 2 – Scenario A: CFC that is partly debt-funded NZ Group invests $700 in an offshore CFC, $200 in the form of equity and $500 in the form of related party debt at arm’s length terms. The NZ Group is required to consider if it is subject to the interest allocation rules. The first step is to calculate the group’s debt-to-asset ratio to see if it is within the 75% safe harbour limit. For the purpose of determining the group’s debt-to-asset ratio, the total debt and total assets of the NZ Group are as follows: Total debt of NZ Group is Financial arrangements that provide funds $1,500 less fixed rate shares $ 0 less on-lent amount $ 500 $1,000 Total New Zealand assets of NZ Group are Total consolidated assets in financial accounts $2,500 less on-lent amount $ 500 less equity investment in CFCs $ 200 $1,800 Therefore the NZ Group’s debt-to-asset ratio is 1,000/1,800, which is 56%. This is within the 75% safe harbour, and the interest allocation rules will not apply to NZ Group. NZ Group CFC EquityDebt $1,000$1,500 $200 EquityNZ Foreign Country Debt $500 67 Example 2 – Scenario B: CFC that is equity-funded In this example, NZ Group invests $700 in an offshore CFC, all in the form of equity. For the purpose of determining the group’s debt-to-asset ratio, the total debt and total assets of the NZ Group are as follows: Total debt of NZ Group is Financial arrangements that provide funds $1,500 less fixed rate shares $ 0 less on-lent amount $ 0 $1,500 Total New Zealand assets of NZ Group are Total consolidated assets in financial accounts $2,500 less on-lent amount $ 0 less equity investment in a CFC $ 700 $1,800 The NZ Group’s debt-to-asset ratio is 1,500/1,800, which is 83.3%. This ratio exceeds the 75% safe harbour, and apportionment may be required. The worldwide debt-to- assets ratio is 1500/2500, 60%, so 110% of this is 66%. Therefore the NZ Group’s interest deduction will be apportioned on the basis of the 75% safe harbour. Broadly, (83.3%-75%)/83.3%, or approximately 10% of the total interest deduction will be denied under the proposed interest allocation rules. NZ Group CFC EquityDebt $1,000$1,500 $700 EquityNZ Foreign Country 68 11.52 Example 3 shows how the worldwide group debt ratio will operate. Example 3: CFC that has external debt funding In this example, NZ Group invests $1,000 in a CFC, all in the form of equity. The CFC has a bank loan of $500 that falls into the definition of worldwide debt. For the purpose of determining the group’s debt-to-asset ratio, the total debt and total assets of the NZ Group are as follows: Total debt of NZ Group is Financial arrangements that provide funds $4,000 less fixed rate shares $ 0 less on-lent amount $ 0 $4,000 Total New Zealand assets of NZ Group are Total consolidated assets in financial accounts $5,000 less on-lent amount $ 0 less equity investment in CFCs $1,000 $4,000 The NZ Group’s debt-to-asset ratio is 100% in this example. This is in breach of the 75% safe harbour. Therefore the NZ Group’s interest deduction will have to be apportioned on the basis of the 75% safe harbour or 110% of the worldwide group debt percentage ratio, whichever is higher. To calculate the worldwide group debt percentage ratio, NZ Group has to include all its consolidated worldwide debt, which is $4,500. The consolidated worldwide assets of the NZ Group are $5,500. Overall, this amounts to a worldwide debt percentage ratio of $4,500/$5,500 (or 81.8%). As 110% of 81.8% is 90%, and this proportion is higher than 75%, the interest deduction will be apportioned on the basis of 90% under the interest allocation rules. Broadly, this means (100-90)/100, or 10%, of the interest deduction will be denied. NZ Group CFC EquityDebt $1,000 $4,000 $1,000 EquityNZ Foreign Country $500 Debt

The central feature of the proposed reform is the exemption of the active income of our controlled foreign companies from domestic income tax, to free New Zealand investors from a tax cost that equivalent investors from other countries do not face. This issues paper, which represents the third round of consultation on the reform, seeks comment on suggested changes relating to the treatment of foreign dividends under the proposed rules and to transitional matters. 1.2 In December 2006, the government released the discussion document New Zealand’s International Tax Review: a direction for change, for public comment. It sought feedback on proposals to introduce an active income exemption for the offshore operations of New Zealand businesses. Rather than make concrete proposals for the implementation of the exemption, it canvassed the various approaches taken in other countries and indicated the broad direction and approach of the proposed reform. 1.3 Officials then engaged in an extensive consultation process with businesses. This consultation and feedback have been invaluable in enabling the government to assemble a balanced package of reforms that is appropriate for New Zealand. 1.4 In May 2007, New Zealand’s International Tax Review: An Update, was released to inform businesses about the government’s in-principle policy decisions to date, setting out how the various components fit together. Officials have since prepared two issues papers that provide more detailed proposals in support of these in-principle decisions. 1.5 The first issues paper, New Zealand’s International Tax Review: Developing an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies, was released in October 2007. It provides detailed proposals for the design of the new international tax rules for controlled foreign companies (CFCs). 1.6 The main focus of the present issues paper is the exemption of ordinary dividends 1 received by New Zealand companies from CFCs and foreign investment funds (FIFs) 2 and transitional and consequential matters arising from the move to an active income exemption. They include issues related to the repeal of the conduit rules and the treatment of existing attributed CFC net losses and carried-forward foreign tax credits. 1 For the purposes of this paper, ordinary dividends refer to dividends that currently qualify for underlying foreign tax credits (UFTCs). 2 If the New Zealand shareholder uses the accounting profit or branch equivalent methods. 2 1.7 Foreign dividends received by persons other than companies, such as individuals and trustees, will continue to be taxed as they are at present. 1.8 The next step will be to analyse submissions on the suggestions presented in the two issues papers and make formal recommendations to the government on how the proposed reform should be developed. The aim is to introduce next year a bill that gives effect to the reforms, which will apply from the 2009–2010 income year. 1.9 In 2008, officials will be seeking taxpayer input on the design of rules to enable the active income exemption to be extended to interests in non- portfolio FIFs – replacing the remaining grey-list exemption for these interests – and branches. The government intends to introduce legislation for these further reforms in 2009, to apply from the 2010-2011 income year. SUMMARY OF SUGGESTED CHANGES The suggested changes would apply from the start of the 2009–2010 income year. Non-portfolio dividends received by New Zealand companies • Ordinary dividends from CFCs and non-portfolio FIFs received by New Zealand companies will be exempt. • Dividends that would not qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit (UFTC) under the current rules because the CFC or non-portfolio FIF is allowed a deduction for the dividend in calculating its liability for tax will continue to be taxable. • The treatment of dividends when the interest is a fixed-rate share will be dealt with in conjunction with the review of non-portfolio FIFs. In the interim, such dividends will continue to be taxable in keeping with the current treatment for UFTC purposes. • Dividend withholding payment (DWP) will be repealed for most foreign dividends derived by New Zealand-resident companies in the 2009–10 and later income years. Any DWP account balances as at the start of 2009–10 income year can be maintained under current rules for a five-year transitional period, after which they will be converted into imputation credits. • The repeal of DWP makes the UFTC rules redundant, so they can also be repealed. Other foreign dividends • Most foreign dividends from portfolio interests received by companies will be exempt. Dividends derived from entities that are exempt from the FIF rules will continue to be taxed. • The taxation of foreign dividends received by persons other than companies, such as individuals and trustees, will be unchanged. 3 Conduit repeal transitional rule • With the repeal of the conduit rules, conduit tax relief account balances as at start of 2009–10 income year will be cancelled, subject to a transitional anti- avoidance rule. CFC transitional rule • Attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits accrued under the current rules can be carried forward into the new system, but will continue to be reduced by reference to total CFC net income (including non-attributable income). 1.10 Submissions should be made by 15 February 2008 and be addressed to: International Tax Review C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington Or e-mail: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “International Tax Review” in the subject line. 1.11 Submissions should include a brief summary of their major points and recommendations.

In the interim, such dividends will be subject to tax, in keeping with the current treatment for UFTC purposes. • Dividend withholding payment (DWP) will be repealed for most foreign dividends derived by New Zealand-resident companies in the 2009–10 and later income years. Any DWP account balances as at the start of 2009–10 income year can be maintained under current rules for a five-year transitional period, after which they will be converted into imputation credits. • The repeal of DWP makes the underlying foreign tax credit (UFTC) rules redundant, so these rules can also be repealed. 2.1 Current rules for the taxation of foreign dividends are part of a system that has at its heart the comprehensive accrual taxation of offshore income. A complex set of rules for dividend taxation have been established to support this approach. 3 2.2 In some cases, rules have been provided to relieve the impact of this system. For example, there was a concern that attribution of income and taxation of dividends of CFCs deterred non-resident owned companies from using New Zealand as a base for regional operations. Conduit relief was provided to alleviate this impact. There was also concern that attribution and a full UFTC calculation would impose a significant compliance burden for income earned in, and dividends from, countries with tax systems comparable to New Zealand’s – the “grey list” 4 , without raising incremental tax. Therefore, for CFCs in those countries, no income is attributable, and a deemed full UFTC for shareholders with a ten percent or greater interest is allowed that effectively exempts dividends from taxation. 3 For the treatment of dividends received by CFCs see chapter 3 of New Zealand’s International Tax Review: Developing an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies, published in October 2007. 4 The grey list consists of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. 5 2.3 The International Tax Review has resulted in a fundamental reform of the taxation of offshore income. The government has proposed that active offshore income earned in CFCs should be exempt from New Zealand tax. Passive income, on the other hand, would be subject to attribution, no matter where it is earned. 2.4 The exemption of active income effectively obviates the need for the grey list and conduit relief by removing such income from attribution. To ensure that the attribution of passive income does not impose a compliance burden on fundamentally active businesses that have some incidental passive income, CFCs with less than five percent of their revenues from passive sources will be considered to be active. 2.5 In light of these proposed reforms, the rules for dividend taxation have been reviewed to ensure they complement the changes being made to the taxation of the underlying income. 2.6 As with other parts of the international tax system, changes in this area are based on finding a balanced approach reflecting a number of objectives. The new rules should, as much as possible: • allow firms to get on with legitimate business activity by removing tax- based impediments for offshore investment; • minimise compliance costs; and • maintain a level of protection for the domestic tax base. The taxation of ordinary 5 dividends 2.7 A number of countries that exempt active offshore income earned in CFCs from accrual taxation tax the dividends upon repatriation with an underlying foreign tax credit. Such systems are complex, often fail to raise significant revenues, discourage the repatriation of earnings, and reduce the benefits of the exemption. The government has chosen not to follow this approach. 2.8 The May 2007 update announced that dividends derived by a New Zealand company from ordinary shares in a CFC would become exempt from domestic tax from the 2009–2010 income year. This exemption will apply regardless of whether the CFC passes the active business test or the dividends are paid out of active or passive income. 2.9 This simplification is possible because other aspects of the international tax reform (such as the replacement of the grey list with the active business test) ensure that passive income would have already been taxed on accrual. 2.10 It is further suggested to extend this exemption, at the same time, to ordinary dividends received by companies from non-portfolio FIFs. 6 5 For the purposes of this paper, ordinary dividends refer to dividends that currently qualify for UFTC treatment. The policy on other dividends is discussed later in this chapter. 6 The exemption will begin from the start of the 2009–10 income year. 6 Consequential simplification 2.11 We suggest several changes that will greatly simplify the international tax rules for dividends received by companies, such as repealing the DWP, UFTC and BETA rules. Repeal of DWP 2.12 DWP is generally payable on dividends received by New Zealand-resident companies from foreign companies. Tax credits are available for any underlying foreign tax if the New Zealand company has at least a ten percent interest in the foreign company; there is a UFTC if the foreign company is resident in a grey-list country. 2.13 Most foreign dividends will be exempt from New Zealand tax. Accordingly, DWP will be repealed for such foreign dividends derived by New Zealand- resident companies in the 2009–10 and later income years. The treatment of foreign dividends that do not currently qualify for UFTC is discussed later in this chapter. Existing DWP balances 2.14 A DWP credit arises in a company's DWP account for any DWP paid by the company (including by way of loss offset). This credit can be attached to a dividend paid by the New Zealand-resident company to its shareholders in the same way as imputation credits are attached. When the shareholders are non-resident the DWP credits can be used to offset the NRWT liability, with any excess credits being refundable to the non-resident shareholder (in contrast to what occurs with imputation credits, which are not refundable). Having DWP credits that are refundable to non-resident shareholders achieves a similar result to that of the conduit rules, except that DWP credits provide the relief when the income is repatriated, while the conduit rules provide the relief when the income is accrued. 2.15 From 1 April 2009, when DWP is abolished, DWP accounts will be maintained for a period of five years to allow taxpayers to use up their DWP credits. At the end of this period any remaining DWP credits would be converted into imputation credits and the accounts closed. 7 This approach will simplify tax law by enabling the complete repeal of all DWP rules at the end of the five-year period. 2.16 We recognise that a potential disadvantage of this approach for taxpayers is that, unlike DWP credits, imputation credits are non-refundable. However, we consider that five years from 1 April 2009 constitutes a reasonable period for taxpayers to utilise their DWP credits. The deadline could be reviewed before the end of the five-year period if it caused significant difficulties in practice for taxpayers. 7 This is consistent with the current treatment when companies close their DWP accounts voluntarily. 7 Repeal of the UFTC rules 2.17 Dividends that currently qualify for the UFTC rules will no longer be subject to DWP and will be exempt from income tax. Accordingly, the underlying foreign tax credit (UFTC) rules will not be required as they are relevant only to relieving DWP liabilities. The UFTC rules can therefore be repealed completely from the start of the 2009–2010 income year. Future role of BETA rules 2.18 The purpose of branch equivalent tax accounts is to prevent the double taxation in New Zealand of the same income: first, when it is attributed from foreign companies to their New Zealand shareholders under the CFC rules, 8 and then again when the foreign company pays a dividend to its New Zealand shareholders. Under the BETA rules, New Zealand shareholders can use a BETA credit arising from tax paid on attribution to offset a DWP liability (in the case of a company shareholder) or an income tax liability (in the case of an individual shareholder) on a dividend paid to them by a CFC. 9 If a dividend is paid by the CFC before its income is attributed, the New Zealand shareholders can use a BETA debit owing from DWP or income tax paid on the dividend to offset their income tax liability on income attributed to them under the CFC rules. 2.19 The proposed changes to the taxation of foreign dividends will render the BETA mechanism largely redundant for companies. Since foreign dividends will be generally exempt, there should not normally be double New Zealand taxation of foreign income. It should therefore be possible to either abolish the BETA mechansim completely or greatly restrict its application, depending on final decisions about the treatment of dividends other than ordinary dividends (discussed in the following paragraphs). Transitional rules would likely be needed to deal with existing balances in BETA accounts. The taxation of dividends other than ordinary dividends 2.20 Under current rules, certain dividends from a CFC or a portfolio FIF do not qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit. This occurs when: • the dividend, directly or indirectly, results in a deduction in calculating its liability for tax; and • the dividend is paid in respect of a fixed rate share. 2.21 The proposed reforms raise the question of the extent to which the dividend exemption should parallel the current restriction of UFTCs to ordinary dividends. 8 Or under the branch equivalent or accounting profit methods in the FIF rules. 9 Or a FIF for which the New Zealand shareholder uses the branch equivalent or accounting profit methods in the FIF rules. 8 Treatment when the dividend is deductible 2.22 Extending the exemption from New Zealand tax to a dividend that gives rise to a deduction for the CFC would facilitate tax arbitrage and result in double non-taxation of the underlying income. Restricting the exemption prevents this by ensuring that the income is taxed in New Zealand. 2.23 For this reason, it is preferable to maintain the effect of the current treatment of deductible dividends in the UFTC rules. It is therefore recommended that such dividends should continue to be taxed under the new system. 2.24 This tax treatment may be criticised as protecting the tax base of the jurisdiction of the activity, rather than relating to the New Zealand tax base. This is not correct. 2.25 As explained in the next section, the anti-arbitrage rules are mechanisms designed to protect the New Zealand tax base. They also support the policy objective of removing the impediments to outbound active investment inherent in New Zealand’s current international tax system, without providing an outright incentive for such activity. Removing impediments to outbound investment 2.26 It is important to be clear what the economic rationale for the active income exemption is and what it is not. It is intended to remove the impediment for outbound investment that arises if New Zealand imposes an incremental level of tax above that applied by the jurisdiction that is the source of the income. It is not intended to provide an outright incentive for such investment by allowing it to escape tax in the jurisdiction of the CFC through an arbitrage transaction. 2.27 The following example illustrates how exempting a dividend that was deductible in the jurisdiction of the CFC would create a tax incentive to shift economic activity out of New Zealand and into the offshore jurisdiction. 2.28 Assuming that the worldwide after-tax rate of return is 9%, and that other jurisdictions exempt offshore active income, the before-tax rate of return that must be earned in a jurisdiction to yield an after-tax return of 9% is equal to 9 divided by the difference of one minus the tax rate, when the tax rate is expressed as a proportion. 2.29 This means that a business facing a New Zealand tax rate of 30% would need a before-tax rate of return of almost 13% in order to achieve an after-tax return of 9%. 10 2.30 Figure 1 illustrates what happens in the absence of anti-arbitrage rules if the investment in a CFC is made through shares and the dividends from those shares are deductible in the jurisdiction of the CFC. 10 That is to say, 9/(1-0.3) = 12.85714 9 2.31 In the figure, the CFC is in “OECDland”, which has a company tax rate of 30 percent, the same as New Zealand’s. The before-tax rate of return would therefore be 13% in both countries, to yield an after-tax rate of return of 9%. However, NZco could earn 13% after-tax if it could shift its operations from New Zealand to OECDland and finance the investment through fixed rate shares. Put in concrete terms, a New Zealand company that wished to export to OECDland would have an incentive to shift its operations there in order to increase its rate of return. F IGURE 1: D EDUCTIBLE DIVIDEND ARBITRAGE 2.32 The deductible dividend on the share eliminates tax in the CFC, but the dividend is not taxed in New Zealand. In that case NZco earns a 13% after- tax return, which is greater than the 9% after-tax return earned by other companies in OECDland, and is also greater than the 9% after-tax return from investing in New Zealand. It now has a greater incentive to invest in OECDland than its competitors have and, in fact, has an incentive to shift operations from New Zealand, contrary to the policy intent of the reform. 11 Protecting the New Zealand tax base 2.33 Double non-taxation also provides opportunities for transactions that erode the New Zealand tax base through the establishment of profit traps that can shelter domestic as well as foreign income. 11 If not all income in OECDland is sheltered (perhaps because of its thin capitalisation rules) the after-tax rate of return achieved may be less than 13% but still greater than 9%. NZco Tax = 0 CFC Tax = 0 Shares Deductible dividends Untaxed dividends OECDland, 30% tax rate New Zealand, 30% tax rate 10 2.34 Preventing double non-taxation underlies the considerable effort that has been made in the review to ensure that offshore active income is subject to tax in the jurisdiction in which it arises. That is also the reason for seeking to ensure that the income cannot be sheltered from tax by shifting it to a low-tax jurisdiction, or that tax on the income cannot be avoided by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities arising from asymmetries between tax systems. Treatment when the dividend is not deductible 2.35 When the dividend is from a fixed rate share but is not deductible, more complex policy questions are raised. Under current law those dividends do not qualify for UFTCs. Under the reformed system, their treatment will depend upon the nature of the investment and the relationship between the holder of the share and the CFC. 2.36 When the fixed rate share is not held by the ordinary shareholder in the CFC, the nature of the interest conveyed by a fixed rate share is different from than that of ordinary equity. The holder of a fixed rate share does not participate unrestrictedly in the profits of the CFC, and the investment may be more in the nature of debt, the income from which is taxable in New Zealand. 2.37 Domestically, this distinction is not critical for the government, as no after- tax difference arises from a switch from debt to equity. All the switch does is change the entity that pays the tax, which has no impact on the total amount of tax revenue collected. Accordingly, relying on the form of the instrument rather than its substance has no cost. 2.38 The switch does matter, however, in the international context. When the form of the funding is switched from taxable debt to exempt equity, New Zealand loses tax revenue. This situation may be of particular concern if the CFC is in a loss position and so cannot make immediate use of its interest deductions. 2.39 On the other hand, if the fixed-rate share forms part of a controlling interest, there is potential for double New Zealand taxation if the dividend is taxed and underlying income is attributed. This could occur under the new rules, for example, if a CFC has sufficient passive income (five percent or more of total income) for it to be taxed in New Zealand under attribution, or if a non- portfolio FIF has attributable income. Even if the income of the CFC is active, and therefore exempt from attribution in New Zealand, taxing the dividend could effectively tax back part of the exemption. 2.40 The treatment of dividends from fixed-rate shares has further implications in determining whether fixed-rate shareholders should have passive income attributed to them and how fixed rate shares should be treated under the interest allocation rules. 11 2.41 The critical questions in arriving at a judgement of appropriate treatment are: • whether there is a risk of distorting business behaviour if fixed-rate share dividends continue to be taxed; and • whether there is a risk to the tax base if the dividends became untaxed. 2.42 These issues could be particularly problematic in situations involving FIF interests. Accordingly, we suggest that the treatment of fixed-rate share dividends be considered in conjunction with the review of non-portfolio FIFs. In the interim, these dividends would remain subject to tax, in keeping with their current treatment for UFTC purposes and the proposed treatment of deductible dividends discussed earlier. Depending on final decisions about the appropriate treatment of these dividends, it may be necessary to have a mechanism to relieve double New Zealand taxation of the underlying income. 12 Chapter 3 OTHER FOREIGN DIVIDENDS Summary of suggested changes • Most foreign dividends from portfolio interests received by companies will be exempt from tax. Dividends derived from entities that are exempt from the FIF rules will continue to be taxed. • The taxation of foreign dividends received by persons other than companies, such as individuals and trustees, will be unchanged. Portfolio dividends received by companies 3.1 Dividends received by New Zealand-resident companies from portfolio FIFs are already exempt from tax under the fair dividend rate and comparative value FIF calculation methods. A dividend exemption will also be extended to dividends derived from portfolio FIFs for which the accounting profits and branch equivalent FIF calculation methods are used. These dividends are currently taxable, but any New Zealand tax liability can be offset by BETA credits on attribution. 3.2 Portfolio interests 12 in Australian-resident companies listed on the ASX All Ordinaries index and in Guinness Peat Group plc are exempt from the FIF rules. 13 Dividends from these portfolio interests are currently subject to DWP in the hands of New Zealand company shareholders. As DWP is to be repealed, the dividends derived from these interests from the start of the 2009–10 income year will be subject to income tax. Foreign dividends derived by persons other than companies 3.3 No change is suggested to the current rules for taxing foreign dividends received by persons other than companies, such as individuals and trustees. 3.4 While dividends paid by CFCs to New Zealand companies will be exempt, the income will be taxed when it is subsequently distributed by the New Zealand company to individual shareholders. In particular, dividends paid by New Zealand companies out of exempt active income derived from their CFCs will not be covered by imputation credits; this means that tax will be paid on such dividends in the hands of individual shareholders. Similarly, foreign dividends received directly by individual New Zealand shareholders from CFCs will need to be taxed. 12 A portfolio interest is an interest of less than ten percent in a company. 13 Unless, in the case of the FIF exemption for interests in Guinness Peat Group plc, shareholders have elected for that exemption not to apply. 13 3.5 This treatment, if unrelieved, could lead to double New Zealand taxation of the passive income of a CFC if it fails the active business test – first, when the passive income is attributed under the CFC rules, and then when income tax is paid on the dividend. Therefore the current BETA rules relieving such double taxation will be retained for dividends received from CFCs by persons other than companies. 14 Chapter 4 CONDUIT REPEAL TRANSITIONAL RULE Summary of suggested changes • With the repeal of the conduit rules, conduit tax relief account (CTRA) balances as at start of 2009–10 income year will be cancelled, subject to a transitional anti-avoidance rule. 4.1 The conduit rules remove the income tax and DWP liability of a New Zealand- resident company on its foreign income from CFCs (and FIFs that use the branch equivalent or accounting profit methods) to the degree that the New Zealand company is owned by non-residents. 4.2 The government announced in the May 2007 update that the conduit exemption from the CFC and FIF rules will be repealed from the 2009–2010 income year. 4.3 As explained in the update, the conduit rules become unnecessary for active income, since the conduit exemption is, in effect, being replaced by the active income exemption and the exemption for dividends from CFCs and FIFs. The case for continuing to provide conduit relief for passive income only is much weaker. Furthermore maintaining the conduit rules would involve a continuing risk to the tax base. 4.4 The repeal of conduit tax relief raises the transitional issue of what to do with existing conduit tax relief account balances. Operation of the conduit tax relief account 4.5 New Zealand companies with foreign shareholders are entitled to elect conduit relief for income earned in CFCs. Every company that elects to become a “conduit tax relief company” must maintain a conduit tax relief credit account (CTRA). The purpose of the CTRA is to ensure that conduit tax relief is passed through to the non-resident owners of the New Zealand company. It achieves this result by tracking the amount of conduit tax relief provided to the conduit tax relief company. Specifically, CTR credits arise in the account as conduit tax relief is extended to the conduit tax relief company This credit balance is reduced when the conduit relieved income is repatriated (as expected) through to the foreign shareholders by way of a dividend. 15 4.6 Consequently, a positive balance in the CTRA reflects the fact that income has been relieved from income tax but not yet been paid through to the foreign shareholders of the conduit tax relief company. That credit balance can crystallise into a current year tax liability (in whole or in part) if the New Zealand entity significantly increases its level of New Zealand shareholders. 14 That is because it would be contrary to the policy objectives underpinning conduit for the tax relief to be accessible to New Zealand shareholders. 4.7 In this sense, a positive credit balance in the CTRA represents a contingent tax liability that could arise if the New Zealand company experiences a significant increase in the level of New Zealand shareholding. Conduit companies have an incentive to keep conduit balances low by passing through the conduit tax-relieved income to their foreign shareholders, to avoid an unexpected crystallisation of this potential New Zealand tax liability. Existing CTRA balances 4.8 The repeal of the conduit rules raises the question of how the government should deal with existing positive balances in the CTRA. 4.9 Crystallising the contingent tax liability on cancellation of the credits would result in the claw-back of prior conduit relief that was not part of the rules when they were in force. It would be possible to provide firms with a transitional period (say, ten years) for conduit companies to pass through the income before crystallising the tax liability in relation to any outstanding conduit income. However, even that approach could be viewed as more restrictive than the present approach, which sets no specific time constraint on passing through the conduit tax-relieved income to foreign shareholders. 4.10 The government could leave the current rules in place for passing through conduit tax relief credits until all have been distributed to foreign shareholders. Alternatively, the government could simply cancel the credits upon the repeal of the rules. 4.11 Cancelling conduit balances would not remove the withholding tax liability on any conduit-relieved income that was subsequently repatriated. That is because the retained conduit income would give rise to unimputed dividends. Therefore withholding tax would still be payable on any subsequent distributions. The amount of any tax liability that would have crystallised from a breach of shareholder continuity or migration of the New Zealand company is difficult to predict. Also the actual quantum of any revenue forgone mainly relates to the timing of tax receipts. 14 This rule enables the government to recover DWP on any undistributed conduit income in situations where the conduit company becomes substantially New Zealand owned (a 34 percentage point or greater more increase in resident shareholding) or migrates offshore. These rules were intended to discourage companies from using a conduit arrangement to shelter income that was, in fact, being earned on behalf of New Zealand residents. They also provide an incentive (although no obligation) for New Zealand conduit companies to pass relieved income back to their foreign shareholders in order to reduce their potential liabilities. 16 4.12 There is considerable attraction in removing all the conduit legislation from our statute books immediately. Otherwise these rules must remain on our statute books for an indefinite period of time – until the last conduit tax relief credit is extinguished. Moreover, it would require the government to maintain and administer rules that have no substantive application beyond the 2009–2010 income year. 4.13 On balance, it would seem preferable to cancel the conduit tax relief credits upon repeal of the conduit tax rules. Cancelling all conduit tax relief credits may, however create tax-planning opportunities in the interim period between the announcement that credits are to be cancelled and the repeal of the conduit rules. For instance, it would not be acceptable simply to cancel conduit balances in relation to conduit transactions entered into to take advantage of a government proposal to cancel such balances on repeal of the conduit rules. Of particular concern would be a structure created after the release of this paper that had the purpose or effect of passing conduit relief through to New Zealand shareholders following the repeal. 4.14 For this reason, transitional anti-avoidance rules would be considered for arrangements entered into between the release of this paper and the termination of the conduit rules. In particular, if the government decides to cancel credit balances, the terminating legislation would need to include an anti- avoidance rule to the effect that conduit credits arising from transactions entered into in anticipation of the repeal of the conduit rules will give rise to an immediate tax liability upon the cancellation of those credits. 17 Chapter 5 TRANSITIONAL RULES FOR ATTRIBUTED CFC LOSSES AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS Summary of suggested changes • Attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits accrued under the current rules can be carried forward into the new system, but will continue to be reduced by reference to total CFC net income (including non-attributable income). 5.1 The earlier issues paper, New Zealand’s International Tax Review: Developing an active income exemption for controlled foreign companies, released in October this year, signalled that further consideration would be given to the treatment within the new system of attributed CFC net losses and foreign tax credits arising under existing rules. This chapter discusses the need for transitional rules to deal with these amounts, reflecting the fact that only a subset of the income of CFCs will be subject to attribution once the active income exemption is in place. Attributed CFC net losses 5.2 A net loss incurred by a CFC is attributed to its shareholders under subpart DN of the Income Tax Act 2004. Section DN 4 provides that an attributed CFC loss may be offset against attributed CFC or branch equivalent FIF income for CFCs and FIFs in the same jurisdiction. Any excess becomes an attributed CFC net loss that may be carried forward and used under section IE 1 (by virtue of section IE 3), or used against current or future income of another company in the same group under section IG 4. Such losses are subject to the jurisdictional ring-fencing rules, which are not expected to change. 15 5.3 As noted in the October issues paper, once the exemption for offshore active income is in place, any net loss arising to a CFC and attributable to its New Zealand shareholders will necessarily represent an excess of deductions relating to passive income exceeding such income in a particular year. There should be no need for special rules distinguishing active net losses from passive net losses. 15 Jurisdictional ring-fencing ensures that the relief given corresponds to the effective rate of New Zealand tax on attributed income once foreign tax credits are taken into account. 18 5.4 Under the new rules, income earned by the CFCs of wholly active businesses will be fully exempt from New Zealand tax. Such businesses will therefore have no use for attributed CFC net losses arising under the existing rules. New Zealand residents deriving attributable passive income through CFCs, on the other hand, may wish to carry these existing losses forward into the new system. 5.5 Such losses may reflect expenditure relating to the derivation of either active or passive income, or both. Allowing unrestricted relief for these carried- forward historical losses in the context of a reformed system under which only passive income is subject to attribution would be problematic. 5.6 As a basic principle, there should be a nexus between expenditure and assessable income for an amount to be allowed as a deduction and for a net loss to arise. Once offshore active income is effectively exempt, no such nexus will exist for related expenditure. To the extent that losses are a reflection of such expenditure, therefore, they should not be allowed. Looked at another way, full relief from New Zealand tax will already have been given on the income to which these active net losses relate; there is no reason to provide further relief against other income. 5.7 Unrestricted relief for historical losses under the new rules would also impair the proper taxation of offshore passive income during the transitional phase, contrary to the policy intent. As noted in earlier documents, continuing taxation of offshore passive income on accrual is regarded as a necessary and appropriate feature of the new system, not least to protect the domestic tax base. It would be relatively straightforward for a predominately active business to use unrestricted historical losses to shelter passive income earned offshore from New Zealand tax. 5.8 Requiring taxpayers to identify and strip out the active component of historical losses at the point of transition is not recommended. Conceptually, this would involve imposing the methodology of the new system on past transactions. Taxpayers are likely to find it difficult to identify the active element of any historical losses, given that no such distinction is required under existing law. 5.9 Instead, we suggest that historical losses be carried forward without restriction, but that transitional rules require those losses to continue to be offset against broadly the same measure of income as is used for the purposes of attribution under the current system. This would ensure that historical losses continue to be dealt with in a way that is consistent with the rules applying when those losses accrued. 19 5.10 In practical terms, this will mean abating a taxpayer’s historical losses from a given jurisdiction over time, taking account of non-attributable CFC income from that jurisdiction, as well as any actual offset against attributable passive (or branch equivalent FIF) income. 16 5.11 For historical losses to be correctly abated, the amount of non-attributable CFC income derived by a taxpayer will need to be determined. This presents some practical problems because taxpayers will not be required to calculate this income for the purposes of attribution. However, it may be possible to follow the general approach suggested for the active business test in Chapter 3 of the October issues paper, allowing taxpayers to draw on their IFRS- compliant accounts. 5.12 For a given CFC (or a sub-consolidated group of CFCs within the same jurisdiction), the starting point would be the total net income figure drawn from audited financial accounts prepared in compliance with NZ IFRS or IFRS, or calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax rules. 5.13 If the CFC (or sub-consolidated group) satisfies the active business test, it will not be subject to attribution on any of its income. This net income figure will therefore be applied for the purposes of abating the taxpayer’s historical losses from the relevant jurisdiction. 5.14 If the CFC (or sub-consolidated group) does not satisfy the active business test, the amount of the abatement will be the non-attributable component of this net income figure. This can be determined by simply deducting from the CFC’s total net income its passive income (if any) calculated under the tax rules for the purposes of attribution. Once abatement has occurred, any remaining historical losses can be offset against this or any other attributable passive income or branch equivalent FIF income from the same jurisdiction. 5.15 The following example illustrates how all this might work in practice. Example: Reducing historical losses by reference to total net income Aco, a New Zealand-resident company, has attributed CFC net losses from State B of $30,000 to carry forward from the 2008–09 pre-reform income year (“historical losses”). In the 2009–10 income year, Aco has a CFC in State B that does not satisfy the active business test. The net passive income of the CFC calculated under New Zealand tax rules for the purposes of attribution is $7,000. According to its NZ IFRS accounts, the CFC has total net income of $18,000, giving it non-attributable net income of $11,000 ($18,000 less $7,000). Aco’s historical losses from State B are therefore abated from $30,000 to $19,000. Aco then uses $7,000 of the remaining historical losses to offset its attributable passive CFC income from State B, leaving $12,000 to be carried forward. 16 Only attributable passive income will be subject to attribution in the new system. Amounts not within the definition of passive income (“active/disregarded income”) will not be subject to attribution. Passive income derived by a CFC that satisfies the active business test (“non-attributable passive income”) will also escape attribution. See paragraph 10.3 of the October issues paper for a fuller description of these broad categories of income derived by CFCs under the new rules. 20 5.16 Submissions on the suggested approach are invited. Taxpayers would be free to elect not to carry forward historical losses if they preferred not to do so (for example, because they did not anticipate deriving any attributable CFC income under the new system). No restriction of attributed CFC net losses already assimilated to general net losses under section IE 3(5) is proposed. Foreign tax credits 5.17 Section LC 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides, broadly, that a person who has attributed CFC income is allowed a credit for tax paid on that income. Surplus credits may be carried forward under section LC 4(4) to (6), subject to jurisdictional ring-fencing. Section LC 5 allows surplus credits, including credits carried forward from earlier years, to be transferred within the same wholly owned group, subject again to jurisdictional ring- fencing. The October issues paper noted that section LC 4(3) would need to be amended to ensure that, in future, credits are available for foreign tax paid or payable by a CFC only in respect of its passive income. 5.18 Similar transitional concerns arise for foreign tax credits carried forward from the existing system under section LC 4. Allowing credits that may relate to foreign tax on either active or passive income under current rules to be carried forward and applied without restriction to relieve New Zealand tax on a subset of CFC income would not be appropriate. It would be inconsistent with the general principle that credits under subpart LC are available for foreign tax paid on income that is also assessable in New Zealand, up to the amount of the New Zealand tax liability on that income. The consequence would be to allow offshore passive income to be sheltered from domestic taxation. 5.19 We therefore suggest that transitional rules will also be needed to restrict the use of historical foreign tax credits under the new rules. In our view, historical credits should be carried forward in full, but abated over time by reference to a notional New Zealand tax liability on taxpayers’ non- attributable CFC income as well as any actual offset against their actual tax liability on attributable passive (or branch equivalent FIF) income. This is, effectively, an extension of the approach described earlier for dealing with historical losses. We think that notional tax liability for these purposes could be determined using non-attributable CFC income calculated in accordance with the methodology already set out for that option. 5.20 Again, submissions on the suggested approach are invited. 21 Appendix SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO TAX TREATMENT OF FOREIGN DIVIDENDS Current tax treatment Proposed tax treatment from 2009-2010 income year Ordinary dividends received by a NZ company CFC to NZ company Subject to DWP (offset by UFTC / BETA credits) Tax-exempt (No DWP or income tax) Non-portfolio FIF to NZ company Subject to DWP (offset by UFTC / BETA credits) Tax-exempt (No DWP or income tax) Portfolio FIF to NZ company Dividend exempt from DWP under FDR and CV methods; subject to DWP(offset by BETA credits) under AP and BE methods if deductible.

Accordingly, their tax treatment has wide-ranging implications for the New Zealand economy. Officials’ paper No. 1 – Scope of the review (26 September 2006) discussed how the commercial and accounting environment has changed from the time the current life insurance tax rules were enacted and suggested two broad alternatives for a tax structure that is more equitable and commercially robust. Option 1 – Proxy basis is based on updating the current taxing methodology and Option 2 – Integrate with financial accounting rules is based on taxing life insurers on the same principles as general insurers. The purpose of this paper is to set out a possible new structure for life insurance taxation which expands on Option 2 of the earlier paper. In the process, it addresses weaknesses in the current tax rules that can result in under-taxation of some products and over-taxation of others. The aim is also to develop tax rules that suit current life products and reflect the contemporary commercial environment. Feedback is sought so that a proposal along the lines contained in the paper can be developed for consideration by Ministers. The myriad of life insurance tax systems adopted in different foreign jurisdictions is testament to the multi-faceted nature and inherent intricacies of this area. The approach adopted in this review is to try to tax life insurance in a manner that is consistent with similar businesses and in a manner that, as much as is practical, leverages off existing tax, actuarial and accounting principles. Officials favour a general insurance approach to the taxation of life-risk products, similar in concept (though not necessarily in detail) to the present Australian tax rules. We also favour the view that some aspects of life insurance savings should be subject to the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) rules. The taxation of annuities presents unique problems, and the methodology discussed in this paper does not at this stage extend to these products. Any tax changes resulting from consultation on this issues paper are intended to be included in the second tax bill of 2007. They would not come into effect until a date to be determined. Transitional issues are also discussed later in this paper. Some changes to the PIE rules under the existing life insurance rules are being considered for the first tax bill of 2007. 2 Chapter 1, entitled “A model of life insurance taxation”, outlines the model officials seek feedback on. The component parts of the model are developed in the subsequent three chapters. Chapter 2, “Shareholders’ income”, discusses the taxation of pure-risk products and fee income in the hands of the life insurance company, and Chapter 3, “Savings”, deals with assessable income attributed to the policyholders and shareholders. Officials are mindful that any changes to the current law must be introduced in such a way that commercial disruption is minimised. Chapter 4, “Other matters”, discusses the issues involved in changing from the current tax rules to the model discussed in this paper. The “Appendix” provides a simple example using the suggested methodology. Feedback Feedback on the questions specifically raised in the paper or on any other aspect of the life insurance review are invited by 5 April 2007, and can be sent to: Life Insurance Review Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington Attention: Anthony Merritt or via e-mail to: anthony.merritt@ird.govt.nz All submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. Feedback and submissions may be the source of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication.

Those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. In addition to seeking written submissions, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials intend to discuss the issues raised in this paper, including detailed design issues, with key interested parties. 3 CHAPTER 1 A MODEL OF LIFE INSURANCE TAXATION Current life tax rules 1.1 The current life insurance tax rules aim to tax both the investment activity and underwriting activity of life insurers. Since the publication of the first officials’ paper on life insurance tax reform, which included consulting with a number of parties interested in the taxation of life insurance, the current taxation methodology has been analysed according to the “ideal” life tax system outlined in paragraph 2 of that paper. 1.2 The current rules lack a degree of transparency as they are based on complex formulae for determining underwriting income that exist only for tax purposes and do not easily reconcile with actual financial results. There are no obvious ways to remedy this problem except to make the rules even more complex than they are at present. 1.3 They were formulated in part to reduce the potential for manipulation of actuarial reserves by life insurers. 1 International accounting standards now specify rules for the financial accounting of life insurance companies and leverage off codified actuarial standards. All life insurers publish audited accounts, and as most of the large New Zealand life insurers listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange or subsidiaries of overseas-listed parents are subject to strict disclosure rules they now are subject to a greater degree of transparency compared with when the current regime was enacted. 1.4 Furthermore, the rules were designed at a time when nearly all life insurance business was of a conventional participating (whole of life and endowment) type. Today, very few new conventional products are sold and underwriting income from the predominant type of policies (term insurance) is generally under-taxed by the current rules. In addition, participating policyholders are taxed on their savings on unrealised gains and, for 19.5% taxpayers, at a level above their marginal tax rate. The current rules, which combine the two components of a life insurance business – risk and savings – in one methodology therefore over-tax some aspects of the business and under-tax others. 1.5 Finally, the current rules are costly for some life insurers to comply with, as they require separate actuarial calculations, and are complex for Inland Revenue to audit and administer. Officials are not aware of any other country which has adopted the current New Zealand approach. 1 Tax treatment of life insurance and related areas–report of the consultative committee (August 1989) p19-20. 4 1.6 The overall conclusion is that the current tax rules have a number of negative features and modifying them (as suggested in Option 1 in the first paper, Scope of the review) does not provide an optimum solution for both taxpayers and the tax base. In reviewing possible alternatives (and many different models are used by OECD jurisdictions), officials rejected, on grounds of equity and compliance simplicity, changing the taxation of recipients of life insurance benefits. 2 The approach favoured by officials is to tax shareholders 3 on their life insurance risk income in the same way as general insurance (this approach was adopted by Australia in 2000–01). Investment income should, where appropriate and practical, be taxed under the PIE rules, with the policyholders’ share of that income being treated as separate from the shareholders’ portion. Officials’ model 1.7 The officials’ model segregates the various cashflows in a life insurance company between shareholders and policyholders and applies what is considered to be an appropriate taxing basis to each group. The model abandons the present two-tier Life Office Base (LOB)/Policyholder Base (PHB) structure. Instead, the model splits the taxable income calculation into shareholders’ income (reflecting the return on assets owned by the equity owners of the life insurer) and policyholders’ income (reflecting the return on assets that are attributed to policyholders in the life insurer). 1.8 The main principle underlying the model is that all aspects of a life insurers’ business are appropriately taxed. This is obviously important from a fiscal point of view, but it also should enable life insurers to design and market economically efficient products which do not rely on tax benefits for their profitability. Other features which the model aims to reflect are: • consistency with domestic and international precedents; • consistency of taxation with similar types of income, particularly with regards to income recognition and timing; • flexibility for future-proofing; • self-balancing to minimise tax deferral and avoidance opportunities; and • practicality. 1.9 Two distinct tax calculations will be required: 2 Under current law, life insurance benefits paid in a lump sum on the death of the insured are generally free of tax. In some cases, insurance proceeds are subject to tax – for example, insurance payments under a “key person” policy are generally taxable under ordinary principles. However in these cases premiums are tax deductible. 3 This paper will refer to “Shareholders” as a shorthand description of the annual operating profits of the life insurer that belong to shareholders and reflect the return on capital which they have invested and put at risk through their equity stake. Shareholders’ income will be taxed as a corporate entity – that is to say, the shareholders will not be individually taxed. “Policyholders” refers to income from policyholder assets that are ring-fenced from those belonging to shareholders. 5 Shareholders’ income 1.10 Shareholders’ income would consist of: • risk premiums, investment income less claims and expenses adjusted for movements in reserves; plus • conventional participating business profit attributable to shareholders; plus • fees and charges in respect of unit-linked business less expenses attributed to these products; plus • investment income (net of deductible expenses and exclusions from income determined under the PIE rules) relating to shareholder funds (as determined later in this paper); plus • income not covered by other categories. 1.11 Tax would be payable on the taxable income at the tax rate applying to companies, net of imputation and other credits related to the income. All other provisions that apply to corporate taxpayers, including imputation credit rules, loss carry forward and grouping, should apply to the life insurer in respect of income from those sources. Policyholders’ income 1.12 Investment income would be segregated into that generated by policyholder funds (defined as the liabilities assumed by the life insurer in respect of policyholder-supplied funds) and income generated by shareholder funds (defined as the funds contributed by the shareholders plus shareholders’ retained profits from participating policies plus funds arising from the life insurer’s non-participating risk business). Tax on policyholder investment income, net of deductible charges and fees, and calculated under ordinary tax principles (as amended by the PIE rules) would be paid by the life insurer on policyholders’ behalf as a final tax. However, the life insurer would be able to elect for net investment income from unit-linked products to be “attributed” to policyholders and so subject to tax at investors’ marginal tax rates (as modified by the PIE rules). 1.13 Policyholders’ net taxable investment income cannot be offset with losses or credits from either shareholders’ income or any other company in the life insurer’s tax group. 1.14 The suggested model is compared to the current rules in the table on page 6. The detail of the model, including underlying principles and issues, is discussed in the following chapters. 6 COMPARISON OF CURRENT AND SUGGESTED TAX MODELS CURRENT TWO-TIER APPROACH Life office income Policyholders’ income Imputation Features Life base taxes life insurance business – risk and savings – as a whole I + U – E Policyholder base taxes net investment income attributable to policyholders C + (v1 - v0) – (P - U) 1 – t Tax paid by life insurer as proxy for policyholder Tax paid on life base credited to policyholder base No split required between risk and savings component of premiums/claims Underwriting income (relates to risk component) determined by prescribed formulae Key I Income excluding net premiums U Underwriting income E Expenses excluding net claims P Premiums net of reinsurance C Claims net of reinsurance (v1 – v0) Movement in reserves t Tax rate OFFICIALS’ SUGGESTED MODEL Shareholders’ income Policyholders’ income Imputation Features Taxes shareholder items only – from risk and shareholder investments: Is - Es + \[Pr + Ir – Cr - Er -(v1 – v0)r\] + \[FCul – Eul\] + Ws + X Taxes net investment income attributable to policyholders: Iul – FCul+ Ic - Ec Tax is paid by life insurer as proxy for policyholder Tax paid on life insurer income available to shareholders’ income only Tax paid on policyholders’ behalf not available to shareholder Split required of: • Risk and fees (taxable) and deposit (non-taxable) component of premiums and claims • Investment income between shareholder and policyholder • Expenses between shareholder and policyholder Tax rate of policyholder dependant on whether income is attributed.

The premium may pay the life insurer for the insurance of risk, may primarily have a savings component, or may be a combination of both. There may be a substantial period of time between the receipt of the premium and the payment of any claim on the policy, and so funds are invested by the life insurer to earn a return. Life insurers also receive fees for managing policies and share profits from certain groups of policies. 2.2 Taxing life insurers on their risk or underwriting income does not fit easily into orthodox tax theory as the actual profit on a pure non-participating life insurance policy cannot be ultimately determined until its termination. Underwriting income on conventional participating policies is difficult (both in theory and practice) to isolate and categorise. 2.3 Of the alternatives officials have analysed or discussed with stakeholders, we consider that risk income is most appropriately taxed on a basis that is consistent with the taxation of general insurance. Admittedly, there are differences between life and general insurance. For example, unlike life contracts most non-life policies are contracts of indemnity where, in very broad terms, insurance paid compensates for the loss incurred by the policyholder. Also, many general insurance policies are for shorter terms than life policies, though the differences are not so marked with annual renewable term life premiums and with some general insurance products such as certain disability products which are long-term. On balance, however, officials consider the differences are outweighed by the conceptual similarities. 2.4 Australia adopted a general insurance methodology for taxing risk insurance in 2000. The different regulatory environment across the Tasman aside, the similarities in the products offered in the two countries and the similar accounting practice and commercial environment make an appealing case for New Zealand having a similar tax treatment. Calculation of shareholders’ income 2.5 When completing tax calculations for an entity, the normal starting point is the accounting net profit before tax, with tax adjustments then made to arrive at taxable income. However, for the purposes of discussion this paper takes a “top-down” approach to illustrate the following taxable components: • premium (net of reinsurance) net of amount attributed to savings; plus • investment income; plus 8 • profit attributed to shareholder from conventional participating business; plus • other income including fees and charges; less • net outlays; plus/less • movement in risk reserves. 2.6 The information used to perform the tax calculations should, as much as practicable, be contained or used as a component in the life insurer’s financial statements. 2.7 These items are explained below. Net risk premiums 2.8 Life insurance premiums are made up of three components: • an investment or savings component; • a risk component which is the death cover; and • a fee component which the life insurer charges to cover the costs of administering the policy (including the funds invested in respect of the policy). 2.9 The investment component is in the nature of a deposit and therefore should not be subject to tax, although the other two components should be taxable. In other words, the amount of the premium that is taxable should be the total premium less the deposit component. Reinsurance paid is deducted to arrive at the “net” taxable amount. As discussed in paragraph 2.12, premiums relating to conventional participating business are wholly excluded. 2.10 Although the amount relating to each component may not be separately disclosed to the policyholder, this model is based on the components being able to be identified. Determining the risk and any embedded fee components of a premium should not be, we understand, particularly onerous for “pure risk” products such as: • term insurance with either a flat premium (which may increase after a period of several years) or annual renewable premiums (which increase with age) where the only entitlement is a benefit upon death; • non-participating whole of life policies which have flat premiums, no surrender value, and with payment only upon death; and • group life. 2.11 Officials also understand it should not be difficult to determine the deposit element of policies that are substantially savings (that is, having no significant insurance component) and so not included as taxable, such as: • single-premium life insurance bonds; 9 • short-term fixed return bonds (similar to a bank deposit); • capital-guaranteed regular savings with insignificant life cover; • policies where the amount payable upon death is the same as the amount payable on termination or maturity; and • pure endowment (where the death benefit is usually the return of the premiums paid). 2.12 Difficulties arise when trying to identify a split for mixed or bundled products. The most significant of these are premiums for conventional participating whole of life and endowment policies. Australia completely omits premiums for these policies from the taxation of ordinary business. Officials favour this approach, so long as the shareholders’ profit arising from these products, together with the investment component, as discussed later in this paper, is also subject to tax (see paragraph 2.17). 2.13 Some mixed policies have a separately identifiable risk component (for example, some group superannuation policies) or have sufficient information to enable the risk component to be identified (for example, some capital guaranteed products). For mixed products that cannot be easily split (and which officials understand currently constitute a relatively small number of products) the risk proportion of the premium would need to be prescribed by tax legislation. The underlying principle of any rules would need to ensure: • Similar products are taxed on an economically equivalent basis. • The rules are flexible to accommodate future product developments. • The rules reflect the substance of the products so that they are both fair and do not encourage tax deferral by artificial contrivances. • They are simple to implement and keep systems changes to a minimum. 2.14 There are a number of approaches to resolving boundary issues for such products: • Actuarial – A formula could be prescribed either for the categories in general – for example, an amount required to purchase death benefits in excess of the termination value, or be product-specific. The formula would need to include a component for profit and expenses. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it could lead to the same complex and arbitrary type of formulae contained in the current tax rules for life insurance. • Defined percentage – The law could set a percentage of the amount of premium that is taxable – for example, Australian rules prescribe 10% of non-participating endowment policy premiums and 30% for non- participating whole of life premiums. Although this is a simple procedure, there is obviously an arbitrary nature to determining the percentage. 10 • Financial accounting – Tax could follow the accounting treatment of premiums. IFRS 4 requires that premiums are split into certain components, but this is subject to practicality, materiality and reliability. • Compliance cost – The rules could simply consider products as either pure risk (and so the premium is fully included), and other products as wholly savings (with premiums fully excluded). Such lists would tend to be detailed and there may be winners and losers in terms of the amount of risk income taxed or not taxed. 2.15 The approaches need not be mutually exclusive, and could be implemented by way of a hierarchy. This could be achieved by adopting the financial accounting approach and, to the extent that it did not provide a complete answer, then one of the other approaches could be used. Investment income 2.16 Investment income from risk and from shareholders’ funds is discussed in Chapter 3. Shareholders’ profit from conventional participating business 2.17 This term refers to the shareholders’ allocation (through the “gate”) of profits from its participating business. Officials consider that the amount allocated should be that determined by the life insurer’s rules of the particular fund and its normal practice. Other income 2.18 This is a catch-all category to include any income (including fees) that may be separately identified from the financial accounts relating to the life insurance business. Note that “non-life” income would still be taxed as it is now, although it may no longer be necessary to separate it into a different income tax return. Net outlays (expenses and claims) 2.19 A deduction from taxable income would be available for expenses incurred relating to risk products in addition to the risk component of claims. This latter amount would need to be defined in a manner consistent with the taxable component of the premium. For most pure risk products such as term insurance, it would be the whole of the claim. To the extent that particular premiums are excluded, claims from such policies would be excluded in similar proportion. For other “mixed” products it could be the difference between the benefit payable on death and the current termination value, the policy reserve, or simply the amount paid on death where appropriate. Claims relating to conventional participating business would be wholly excluded. 11 Movement in risk reserves 2.20 Officials consider that it would be fair for movements in risk reserves to be included as an adjustment to the shareholders’ income calculation. The timing of profit release for financial reporting purposes in life insurance is affected by movements in reserves. In mature life insurance businesses the movement in the reserves may not be large as new policies are written to replace those discontinued and so produce only minor timing effects. In periods of rapid growth, however, the movement could be more pronounced. 2.21 Officials reviewed a number of reserving methodologies and their suitability for tax. The first approach that officials considered was the policy liabilities movement from the life insurer’s financial accounts. Policy liabilities under IFRS 4 have two components: the best estimate liability (the present value of the expected future payments and receipts under a life policy) and the present value of future margins. Though the accounting approach has the advantage of simplicity, as it considers future years’ experience rather than just the current year, officials are concerned that the assumptions used by various life insurers may not be uniform and there remains the possibility of deferral of income. 2.22 Alternatively, a general insurance reserving approach could be adopted for life insurance. These reserves include the unearned premium reserve (UPR) which is the portion of gross premium that relates to the cover of risks beyond the life insurer’s balance date, and the outstanding claims reserve (OCR) which relates to claims incurred but not paid at the end of the income year and may include claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) if the insured event occurred before the end of that income year. 2.23 Reserves for deferred acquisition costs raise a number of issues. On the one hand, it could be considered that policy acquisition expenses are incurred for tax purposes and so should be wholly deductible when paid. On the other hand, amortisation of expenses for accounting purposes suggests that they should be matched with the period over which the services are provided. 2.24 Officials favour the general insurance reserving approach for risk products, and to ensure appropriate matching between income and expenses, deferred acquisition costs should be spread over the life of the policy. However detailed feedback on this matter is sought. 2.25 Officials consider that the reserving basis should be prescribed in legislation, to avoid any possibility of misunderstanding. Corporate tax treatment of shareholders’ income 2.26 Shareholders’ income should be treated in the same way as that of a corporate taxpayer but solely in respect of the taxable income determined above (to make it clear that the policyholder’s investment income is not part of the corporate income calculation) with tax payable at the corporate rate. Officials suggest (subject to stakeholders’ feedback) that the shareholders’ income would, like any other corporate income, be subject to the provisional tax rules, be able to maintain an imputation credit account, with tax paid on 12 shareholder income only being eligible to be credited. Officials consider that shareholder tax losses, including LOB losses available for carry-forward from the current rules, should generally be able to be carried-forward for offset against future shareholder income, provided ordinary continuity rules are followed. Shareholders’ income should be able to utilise a loss from a company in the same tax group. Questions for feedback 1. How should premiums from mixed products be split between taxable and non-taxable components? 2. What is the most practical approach to the calculation of risk reserves? In particular, what are the conceptual and compliance difficulties with the officials’ favoured approach? How should deferred acquisition costs be treated for tax? How should the reserves be defined? 3. What alternatives are there to taxing profits from conventional participating business from that outlined? 4. What general corporate tax issues are raised by this model that require consideration? 13 CHAPTER 3 SAVINGS Taxing investment income 3.1 In designing a basis for taxing life insurance investment income there should be two guiding principles. The first is the “neutrality” principle underlying the PIE rules, which requires savers to have as close as possible the same tax outcome whether investing via a collective investment vehicle or directly in financial assets. The second principle is that shareholder income should be treated in the same way as income earned by shareholders in similar financial intermediaries. 3.2 These principles have the following implications: • Separate tax calculations for policyholders and shareholders should be performed. • Shareholders invest in New Zealand and Australian equities on revenue account. • Policyholders invest in New Zealand and Australian equities on capital account. • The tax rate for policyholders is theoretically distinct from the corporate tax rate. • To the extent possible, policyholders should have the benefit of the PIE rules. 3.3 The PIE rules attempt to achieve neutrality in investment decision-making in two ways. The first relates to the investment income base, by excluding from tax realised gains from the disposal of New Zealand and certain listed Australian equities and Australian unit trusts (referred to here as “excluded income”).The second relates to the attribution of taxable investment income to the individual investor, so that tax is paid at the investor’s marginal rate (up to 33%). 3.4 The difficult task for attributing income to policyholders is to design rules that will encompass the myriad products and the unique policyholder/shareholder relationship. One alternative would be to tax investment income as it is allocated to policyholders – for example, by taxing increases in surrender value or policyholder claims (sometimes referred to as the “US model”). 3.5 The other alternative would be to tax the life insurer as it derives the income. The life insurer would therefore be taxed as the “proxy” for the policyholder. 3.6 The advantages of the US model are two-fold. The first is that it ensures that policyholders are taxed at their marginal tax rates. The second is that, it 14 simplifies the practical issues of distinguishing between shareholders and policyholder income. However, the US model provides strong incentives to defer the taxation of income. The approach can also be complex – requiring, for example, non-taxable distributions of claims paid out of capital to be distinguished from taxable claims paid out of investment earnings. It would also be difficult to isolate out non-taxable investment earnings such as excluded income. 3.7 The proxy approach is simple and avoids tax deferral, but it does not allow different rates to be applied to policyholders. However, with the exception of income derived from certain unit-linked products, officials are not aware of any practical ways to adopt the US model to New Zealand conditions. 3.8 Taxing investment income from a conventional participating business pool provides unique challenges as shareholders share in the allocation of “profits” from the pool, including those relating to investment, usually by means of a set ratio – traditionally 80% (policyholders): 20% (shareholders). The lack of any direct annual correlation between both the amount and nature of investment income earned by the life insurer, and the bonus credited to the policyholder appears to make attribution conceptually and practically very difficult. 3.9 There are also some theoretical difficulties with excluding capital gains from conventional products from tax. For example, extending the PIE base benefits to the entire pool would mean that shareholders would indirectly benefit from the realised capital gains exclusions. Officials seek detailed feedback on whether capital gains on participating non-unit-linked products should be excluded from tax, consistent as much as possible, with the principles set out in paragraph 3.1. 3.10 Where a pool is “non-participating” (or “without profits”) business, all investment income belongs to shareholders. 3.11 Shareholder investment income from risk businesses and other investment income from shareholders’ funds would form part of the shareholders’ tax return. Officials’ model for taxing life insurance savings 3.12 The starting point for the tax calculation would be to carve investment income (I) from the life insurer’s financial accounts and/or the income attributed to the life insurer under the PIE rules (which would be zero-rated for PIE purposes and hence will be gross to the life insurer). All ongoing administration, management and acquisition expenses (E) related to the investment component of the policy would be allocated against the taxable portion of the income. The net income would then be allocated between: • Policyholders’ funds 1. Participating and other non-unit-linked funds 2. Unit-linked • Shareholders’ funds. 15 Policyholders’ funds Participating policies and other 3.13 Policyholders would be taxed on investment income derived in respect of conventional participating policies and the deposit component of mixed policies, which would be calculated subject to ordinary tax principles. The tax would be paid by the life insurer on behalf of the policyholders as a final tax at a rate linked to the top PIE tax rate (currently 33%). 3.14 Imputation and other credits attached to income would be used as a credit against the tax liability. Policyholders would not maintain an imputation credit account, and officials consider that imputation credits that are not utilised in the annual tax calculation should be grossed up at the tax rate and carried forward as a loss for offset against future tax liability. Other non- refundable tax credits not utilised would be treated under ordinary rules. Unit-linked products 3.15 Income from these products could be taxed at the default rate by the same proxy method as applies to participating policies, described above, and, realised Australasian capital gains could be excluded from tax, However, officials suggest that life insurers should be able to elect, on a product by product basis, to attribute taxable income to policyholders based on their unit holding. 3.16 In a typical unit-linked policy the unit purchased by the policyholder is linked to a specific asset class, or to a specified investment portfolio and the unit price recalculated daily to reflect the investment performance of the assets in the fund. The policyholder has no entitlement to the change in value of the policy until it is surrendered or reaches maturity though the policy could be sold. The risk cover on many such products is sometimes minimal but transparent. 3.17 These products have much in common with unit trusts, and so the attribution process already contained in legislation for those vehicles could, with suitable modifications, be adopted for unit-linked products. Therefore, the investment income, net of expenses and excluded income could be attributed to the individual policyholder. Tax on the income would be paid as a final tax at the policyholder’s PIE marginal rate. Officials seek feedback on whether this is feasible and what legislative and systems mechanics are required. General 3.18 The policyholders’ net income is separate from the shareholders’ income, and so cannot be reduced by losses incurred by the life insurer from its other business or by other group companies. Policyholder losses would not be subject to any continuity rules. Shareholders’ funds 3.19 Other than their share from the participating profits pool (included as part of shareholders’ income, as discussed in paragraph 2.17, shareholders earn 16 income from non-participating (Ir on the table on page 6), and retained shareholder profit pools (Is on the table on page 6). 3.20 The shareholders’ proportion of investment income (net of deductible expenses) from these latter two pools should be included as part of the shareholders’ taxable income calculation. Excluded income attributed from PIEs would, consistent with other taxpayers, not be taxable. However, all investments that form part of the shareholders’ life insurance business would continue to be held on revenue account. Questions for feedback 1. Feedback is sought on all aspects of the officials’ suggested tax treatment of savings, in particular regarding: • practical compliance difficulties (and costs of compliance); • extending a realised capital gains exclusion for Australasian equities to participating non-unit-linked products; • information technology systems capabilities; • particular products that may require specific treatment – for example, annuities: and • issues (if any) relating to income and expense allocation between shareholders and policyholders. 2. Instead of a 33% tax rate on policyholder income there have been suggestions that the life insurer could segment its business into categories and apply an average policyholder proxy tax rate against the net investment income within each. Officials do not favour this as it still over-taxes policyholders on the lowest tax rate, and gives a comparative benefit to middle and higher marginal rate taxpayers. Feedback is invited on this suggestion. 3. Would the elective attribution solution for unit-linked products discussed above, if included in legislation, actually be used by any life insurers? 17 CHAPTER 4 OTHER MATTERS Definition of “life insurance” 4.1 The discussion in this paper is based on the current Income Tax Act 2004 definition of “life insurance”. The definition has existed in largely unchanged form since the current life tax rules were implemented. This paper does not address whether the definition is sufficiently robust to reflect not only the current commercial environment but also future developments in life products. There are also issues as to whether there should be consistency in definition between income tax, GST, financial reporting, and regulatory provisions. 4.2 Feedback is requested on whether the current tax definition requires change. Transitional issues 4.3 The suggested tax structure discussed in this paper does not purport to subject hitherto untaxed components of life insurance to tax. Rather it aims to tax income more appropriately. Officials recognise that any new life insurance tax rules require time to develop new systems to administer policies, develop new accounting systems, and review the structure and pricing of particular product lines. However adverse impacts can be mitigated by clear timing of the application of the new rules and careful legislative transitional measures. 4.4 Any transitional measures must be guided by two general principles. The first is that it is undesirable to have long-term transitional arrangements as this would defer the overall benefits without necessarily deferring all of the costs. Secondly, to avoid cost and complexity there should not be a multiplicity of rules operating during the transition period. Transitional relief, where appropriate, should be afforded in some other pragmatic way. 4.5 Feedback is also sought on the extent to which tax and credit balances arising from the current regime should be able to be carried forward. Questions for feedback 1. Does the current income tax definition of “life insurance” need to be changed, and in what way? 2. Life insurers in New Zealand have a wide variety of balance dates and officials consider that starting any new rules on an income year basis would create competitive advantages and disadvantages. A specific commencement date is preferred. Officials seek feedback on why any new rules should not apply from a specific date. 18 3. What is the nature of existing contracts for products that may be adversely affected (based on the model put forward by this paper) and the transitional rules required to deal with them? 4. If the PHB is discontinued (as a consequence of the segregated approach), should PHB tax losses carried into the new rules be forfeited by the life insurer? 5. Should credit balances in the imputation credit account and/or policyholder credit account arising from payments of tax on the LOB in excess of the PHB liability be fully or partially retained? 19 APPENDIX LIFE INSURANCE TAX CALCULATION UNDER OFFICIALS’ MODEL ABC Life Insurer – year ended 31 March 200X Background: • Two policy types issued o Annual renewable term insurance (YRT) – risk-only product o Investment-linked – savings-only product (insignificant risk).

Because volunteers and charitable organisations have often been uncertain about their tax obligations relating to reimbursements, an inconsistent range of administrative practices has developed, often resulting in high compliance costs. 1.4 Similar problems relating to tax obligations have arisen over payments of honoraria – particularly if a portion of an honorarium is intended to reimburse the recipient for costs incurred. Uncertainties resulting from the tax laws relating to volunteer reimbursements and honoraria were raised in the 2006 discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. In responding to the discussion document, many submissions expressed surprise that there is any tax obligation at all associated with these types of payments. At a time when government is actively encouraging a culture of giving and greater recognition of the contribution to society made by volunteers, failure to remove this tax uncertainty may increasingly be viewed as a disincentive to volunteering. 1.5 This issues paper looks at a number of possible solutions to the long-standing problem of taxing reimbursements and honoraria paid to volunteers. Specifically, it seeks feedback on suggestions for clarifying the law and better defining the concept of “volunteer”, and includes a number of options for the tax treatment of volunteer reimbursements and honoraria, to make it easier for volunteers and the charitable sector to comply with their tax obligations. 1.6 Feedback on the issues explored in this paper will be considered by the government as part of its policy of further building a culture of charitable giving in New Zealand. 1 Based on Census Data, Statistics NZ estimated that there were 436,500 volunteers involved in non-profit organisations as at October 2005. However, the Non-profit Institutions Satellite Account, published by Statistics NZ in August 2007 estimates the number may be as great as 1 million. 2 1.7 This paper has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, in consultation with officials from the Treasury. 1.8 Submissions on this paper will be taken into account in the development of any recommendations to be made to government, with any resulting legislative changes likely to be included in the next available tax bill. 1.9 Submissions should be made by 14 December 2007 and addressed to: Taxation of reimbursement payments and honoraria C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Taxation of reimbursement payments and honoraria” in the subject line. 1.10 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those who consider there is any part of their submission that could be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. SUMMARY OF POSSIBLE APPROACH TO REFORMING THE TAXATION OF VOLUNTEER REIMBURSEMENTS AND HONORARIA Clarifying the law on volunteer reimbursements This would include: • determining the most appropriate tax treatment of reimbursement payments made to volunteers; • ensuring that the law is clear and simple to apply; • minimising, as much as possible, the compliance costs associated with return filing for volunteers and the organisations for which they carry out their voluntary activities; and • proposing a basis on which payments to volunteers characterised as honoraria, which are actually reimbursement for costs incurred, can be removed from the withholding payment tax rules. 3 Determining an appropriate definition of “volunteer” • This would be critical to achieving the objective of clarity and simplicity in reforming the taxation of reimbursements and honoraria. The definition would contain three essential features: no financial gain to the individual, the concept of “free will”, but with sufficient flexibility to encompass mahi aroha (the Māori cultural perspective of giving) and other cultural obligations, and benefits to a third party. Options for the tax treatment of reimbursement payments • Setting a threshold up to which reimbursements would be treated as exempt income. • Including all reimbursement payments to volunteers in the definition of “exempt income”. Options for the tax treatment of honoraria paid to volunteers • All honoraria up to a threshold would be treated as exempt income. • Honoraria and reimbursements would be required to be paid separately. • Withholding tax would be deducted from net honoraria paid to volunteers. 4 Chapter 2 BACKGROUND What are the problems for volunteers and their organisations? 2.1 Volunteers and the organisations they carry out their voluntary activities for are uncertain about how they should manage their tax obligations. 2.2 Volunteers are unsure whether they have an obligation to file tax returns and unaware of the likely consequences if they fail to do so. 2.3 Organisations are often unsure of the record-keeping requirements for reimbursing payments, whether they have an obligation to withhold tax from those payments or of the likely consequences if they fail to do so. 2.4 While the Oxford dictionary defines an honorarium as “a payment for professional services that are rendered nominally without charge”, many organisations combine payments for service with payments that represent a reimbursement of the expenses a volunteer has incurred. There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that some “honoraria” are, in reality, reimbursement payments only. 2.5 Anecdotal evidence also suggests that some organisations may be reluctant to reimburse volunteers for costs incurred because of doubt over the tax consequences. As a result, some volunteers are withdrawing their services. 2.6 There is also evidence that some organisations are attempting to obtain a determination on an exemption from tax for reimbursement payments through provisions in the Withholding Payments Regulations. 2.7 These problems are not unique to New Zealand. Volunteers who responded to Volunteering Australia’s second annual national survey of volunteering issues saw out-of-pocket expenses as a major concern. Twenty-seven percent of those respondents said expenses had had a direct impact on their volunteering in the past 12 months, while more than half said expenses reduced their ability or desire to volunteer. 2 2 This was an on-line survey that reached 2,140 volunteers this year. 5 Chapter 3 FINDING SOLUTIONS Defining the nature of a “volunteer” 3.1 Because of the varied nature of the activities undertaken by volunteers in the non-profit sector, determining what might be an acceptable definition of “volunteer” is a critical factor in approaching any reform of the current tax laws on volunteer reimbursements. 3.2 Any definition of “volunteer” would need to be broad enough to ensure that all genuine volunteers are included in the reforms, while ensuring that some distinct boundaries are in place. In our view, any definition of “volunteer” should not be limited to activities carried out for, or on behalf of, registered charities only because that would exclude a significant section of the voluntary sector. 3.3 However, a distinction could be made between what could be described as “formal” and “informal” volunteering. “Formal” volunteering could be defined as that carried out for, or on behalf of, an organisation whereas “informal” volunteering could be considered as unpaid help of a more casual nature. This might include, for example, work carried out for a neighbour or someone within the volunteer’s own community. 3.4 Limiting the definition of “volunteer” to an individual who is associated with a registered charity could also have the effect of excluding such groups as sports volunteers and volunteers for central government and local authorities, who also make a valuable contribution to New Zealand society. A limitation based on a definition of “formal” volunteering could, however, prevent these groups from being excluded from any potential reform of the tax rules. 3.5 Limiting the scope of the proposed provisions to registered charities may also have the effect of excluding those whose voluntary activities are the fulfilment of cultural obligations. This includes the concept of “mahi aroha” for Māori and other individuals, such as those from Pacific Island groups, who may feel a cultural obligation to provide their services within their communities. 3.6 Taking these factors into account, it is likely that the three essential features that would need to be included in defining a “volunteer” for tax purposes are: • that there is no financial gain to the individual involved; • that the concept of “free will” is recognised, but with sufficient flexibility to encompass mahi aroha and other cultural obligations; and • that the act of volunteering results in benefits to a third party. 6 Treatment of reimbursement payments 3.7 One of government’s commitments in its 2002 document, Policy on volunteering, was “reducing barriers associated with volunteering in legislation, policy and practice”. 3.8 At that time, there was an expectation by government that this commitment would be met through work to be undertaken by Inland Revenue to determine the circumstances when honoraria might be treated as the reimbursement of expenses and therefore treated as tax-free. 3 3.9 Feedback on this issue raised in the 2006 discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations, clearly demonstrates that the taxation of reimbursement payments or honoraria has become an increasingly significant barrier to volunteering as more individuals and organisations become aware of their tax obligations. 3.10 There are several possible options that could be explored to resolve the current uncertainty that organisations and volunteers face in terms of tax compliance and reimbursement payments. Retaining the status quo 3.11 Under this option, if changes to the law were considered unnecessary or inappropriate, as a means of resolving uncertainties surrounding reimbursements government could: • require Inland Revenue to issue administrative guidelines to codify its interpretation of current law; or • require each agency or organisation that makes reimbursement payments to volunteers to obtain a determination from Inland Revenue for the tax treatment of each type of payment made. 3.12 We feel that neither of these options is likely to achieve the objective of eliminating or reducing the compliance costs associated with filing returns for volunteers and the organisations for which they carry out their voluntary activities. Rather, it is more likely that the two options would increase compliance costs for some organisations and volunteers. Set a threshold up to which reimbursements would be treated as exempt income 3.13 Under this option, a threshold would be set that represents a “reasonable” amount for the reimbursement of any actual costs incurred. Reimbursement payments up to that level would be treated as exempt income and volunteers would not be required to include those payments in their income tax returns. 3 CAB Min (02) 31/5B refers. 7 3.14 If payments exceeded the threshold, the full amount would not be treated as exempt income. Instead, it would be included in the volunteer’s income tax return and claimed expenses would have to be supported by documentary evidence of costs incurred before they would be allowed as a deduction. 3.15 The exempt income amount would cover reimbursement payments for actual costs incurred as well as flat-rate payments based on an estimation of costs. 3.16 While we believe that a threshold would achieve the objective of minimising compliance costs for some individuals and organisations, it would not be effective for others. It would also be hard to justify a different tax treatment of payments that have similar features purely on the basis of their cumulative monetary value over a tax year. Include all reimbursement payments to volunteers in the definition of “exempt income” 3.17 Under this option, all reimbursement payments to volunteers (as defined earlier in this paper) would be treated as exempt from tax according to the exempt income provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. 3.18 This exemption could be applied to all reimbursements for actual costs incurred. This approach could, however, become problematic if reimbursement payments are made at a flat rate, based on an estimation of costs. The provision could also be inappropriately used as a mechanism to avoid withholding tax from payments that are similar in quality to income. If this option were to be adopted, it would be necessary to set a cap on flat rate payments that fall within the exemption. 3.19 Under current law, the exempt income limitation would act to prevent the expenses that had been incurred being claimed as a deduction against other income received by the volunteer. It would therefore be unnecessary to make any changes to the exempt income limitation rules. 3.20 We believe that the option of including all reimbursement costs to volunteers in the definition of “exempt income” in the Income Tax Act would achieve the purpose of: • determining the most appropriate tax treatment of reimbursement payments made to volunteers; • ensuring that the law is clear and simple to apply; and • minimising, as much as possible, the compliance costs associated with return filing for volunteers and the organisations for which they carry out their voluntary activities. 8 Treatment of honoraria paid to volunteers 3.21 It is generally accepted that honoraria, when paid as a nominal fee for services provided, are similar in quality to income and should be subject to income tax. However, a difficulty arises when payments also contain an element of reimbursement for actual or reasonable costs incurred by the recipient. This problem is further explored in the context of the following options for possible tax treatment of honoraria paid to volunteers. All honoraria paid to volunteers up to a threshold are treated as exempt income 3.22 The assumption underlying this option would be that all honoraria paid to volunteers contain an element of reimbursement for costs incurred by the volunteer. Only honoraria over the threshold would be subject to withholding tax. 3.23 This treatment would be consistent with determinations that have already been made under the Withholding Payments Regulations, for selected organisations. If this option were to proceed, honoraria recipients would be required to file income tax returns only if the reimbursement portion of their honoraria exceeds the threshold. 3.24 This option would reduce compliance costs for many volunteer recipients and for payers of honoraria that are below the threshold, but not for others. It could also provide an incentive for organisations to characterise their employees as “volunteers” to claim the exemption. Honoraria and reimbursements to be separate payments for volunteers 3.25 Under this option, organisations would be required to pay honoraria and reimbursements to volunteers as separate payments so that the reimbursement element could be treated in a consistent manner with other reimbursement payments to volunteers. The fee for the service element – the true honoraria – would continue to attract withholding tax. 3.26 While this option would eliminate compliance costs for payers and recipients of honoraria that are wholly reimbursement payments, it would marginally increase compliance costs for some payers who are currently making payments that contain elements of both types of payment. This group would be required to separate the payments. Withholding tax deducted from net honoraria paid to volunteers 3.27 Under this option the payer would be required, on an individual basis, to calculate the portion of an honorarium that represents expenses that have been, or will be, incurred. The payer would be required to deduct withholding tax only from the net amount. 3.28 This option would require payers to know in advance what expenses are going to be incurred so they can correctly calculate the taxable portion of the honorarium, and the amount of withholding tax. This would significantly increase up-front compliance costs for payers of honoraria to volunteers. 9 3.29 On the other hand, this option is likely to eliminate compliance costs for many volunteer recipients of honoraria because they would no longer need to file an income tax return solely to claim a deduction for their expenses. SUBMISSION POINTS Defining the nature of a “volunteer” • Are there other groups of volunteers who may be excluded from a definition that has the features described? • Are there distinctive features in cultures other than Māori and Pacific Island groups that would need to be accommodated within a definition of “volunteer”? • Would a limitation based on a definition of “formal” volunteering create a sufficiently distinct boundary? • Is a definition of “voluntary activity” also needed, to create a clear distinction from work or employment? Treatment of reimbursement payments • If reimbursements were to be treated as exempt income up to a threshold, what factors should determine where the threshold is set? • Should the level of a threshold be reviewed at timed intervals, or should other factors prompt a review? • What would be the risks if all reimbursement payments were to be treated as exempt income? • If all reimbursement payments were to be treated as exempt income, what would be a reasonable cap to set for payments based on an estimation of costs to be incurred, rather than actual costs incurred by the volunteer? • What compliance costs, in addition to those already incurred for organisational accounting, would be incurred under each of the options? • Should a tax exemption be available for reimbursements relating to: – volunteering only for registered charities; or – volunteering only for, or on behalf of, recognised organisations (“formal” volunteering); or – for all forms of volunteering? 10 Treatment of honoraria paid to volunteers • Would there be new compliance costs associated with separating reimbursements from true honoraria for organisations that currently make combined payments or would the costs merely replace costs that already exist? • Would those costs differ from the costs to be incurred if payers were required to calculate and withhold tax from the portion of honoraria that represents a fee for service – that is, after the deduction of reimbursements? Other matters • Should an exemption for the reimbursement of transport costs extend to costs incurred by a volunteer in getting from their home to the place where they carry out their voluntary activities? For example, it can be argued that the private benefit arguments that are raised in support of the employment limitation 4 do not flow through to volunteers because they do not derive a private benefit in the same way that a waged or salaried employee does. • Should there be a different form of tax code declaration for volunteers to complete if they are subject to withholding tax so they are not erroneously characterised as “employees”? Volunteers are currently required to complete the tax code declaration IR 330. 5 • What would need to be done to ensure that any changes to the tax law on volunteer reimbursements and honoraria have the desired impact? How could the changes best be communicated to those who would be affected? 4 Under the employment limitation in section DA 2(4) of the ITA, a person who is an employee is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is incurred in deriving income from employment. 5 A “form for employees to complete when starting their job or changing their tax code”.

Changing the law accordingly will also reduce the likelihood of employers having to dispute the matter with Inland Revenue, and possibly ending up in court, thus saving time and money for everyone. 1.3 The government has therefore indicated that it will introduce amendments to the Income Tax Act to ensure that relocation payments and overtime meal allowances are clearly exempt from income tax and, where relevant, fringe benefit tax. The changes will be subject to clear limitations to prevent their use for purposes of salary substitution. To further reduce uncertainty, the changes will apply to payments made over the past four years, as well as to future payments. 1.4 The government also announced that an officials’ issues paper seeking public feedback on the details of the proposed changes would be published within a few weeks. 1.5 Accordingly, this issues paper outlines officials’ suggestions on the detailed application of the exemptions. In particular, it discusses the various requirements that will need to be met for relocation payments and overtime meal allowances to qualify for the exemptions. 1.6 The two employer payments should be non-taxable for the following reasons: • The element of private benefit involved in these payments is considered to be small. • The degree of private benefit is hard to measure. • There is relatively little risk of recharacterisation of taxable salary and wages as non-taxable payments for relocation or as overtime meal allowances. 1.7 The changes will also help employers and employees in making efficient employee relocation decisions by ensuring that tax considerations do not distort their decisions. This is particularly crucial given the mobility of skilled labour. 2 1.8 To further reduce the risk of recharacterising salary as a relocation payment or overtime meal allowance, limitations have been proposed. In the case of relocation payments, this involves having a list that specifies the types of relocation expenses that would be exempt from income tax and fringe benefit tax. The suggested list is quite broad and would cover relocation expenses that commonly arise. Such an approach would be broadly consistent with overseas practice. In developing this approach, we have been mindful to have clear boundaries to minimise compliance costs. 1.9 In the case of overtime meal allowances, the limitation will involve, amongst other things, clearly delineating between “overtime” and other situations when meal allowances might be paid under an employment contract. Specific suggestions Specifically, we suggest with regard to: Relocation payments: 1) The relocation will need to be as a result of the employee: • taking up a new job with a new employer, or • taking up new duties at a new location with the existing employer, or • continuing the current job, but at a new location. 2) The employee’s existing home must not be within reasonable travelling distance of the new work place. 3) The expense will need to be on the list of eligible relocation expenses. 4) The payment must reflect the expenditure incurred. 5) The expenditure must have been incurred within certain time limits. Overtime meal allowances: 1) The employee’s employment contract will need to specify that the employee is eligible for a payment in relation to overtime hours worked. 2) The allowance should reflect expenditure actually incurred by the employee. To reduce compliance costs, verification will be needed only if the allowance exceeds $20. Alternatively, the allowance needs to be a reasonable estimate of the expected costs likely to be incurred. 3) A specific definition of “overtime” in the legislation should distinguish between what is normally considered overtime and other periods of time for which meal allowances may be paid. 3 Retrospective application: The legislative amendments will apply from the 2002-03 income year. (Submissions are invited on whether employers rather than employees should receive the tax credit that arises in relation to past relocation payments that were subject to PAYE deductions). 1.10 These suggestions are discussed in the following chapters, and we are seeking public comment on them as part of the Generic Tax Policy Process. Feedback 1.11 You are invited to make a submission on the points raised in this issues paper. We would appreciate receiving your comments by 14 December 2007, to enable us time to consider submissions and report to ministers. The aim is to include the resulting legislative changes in the taxation bill planned for introduction in May 2008. 1.12 The proposed legislative changes should be sufficient to deal with uncertainty about the tax treatment of relocation payments and overtime meal allowances. However, people who can make a strong case for introducing legislative certainty for similar reimbursements and allowances, for the reasons outlined in paragraph 1.6, are welcome to put their case by making a submission on this issues paper. 1.13 Submissions should be sent to: Relocation and Overtime Meal Allowances Project C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand 1.14 Alternatively, submissions can be made in electronic form, in which case “Relocation and Overtime Meal Allowances Project” should appear in the subject line.

In some cases they merely cover costs that employees have incurred as part of carrying out their employment obligations. In other cases the payments are akin to remuneration and should therefore be taxable in the hands of the employees who receive them. 2.2 Payments may be made in several ways. For example, employers may pay employees’ monthly telephone accounts or other accounts. Alternatively, employees might seek reimbursement of an amount they have already paid, or the employer might provide them with an allowance to cover the estimated costs they are expecting to incur. Section CW 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004 1 sets out the circumstances when these payments are exempt from income tax. 2.3 These situations differ from those covered by the fringe benefit tax rules (subpart CX of the Act), which cover situations when employers incur the liability directly. Ideally, however, the outcomes should be similar. 2.4 This issues paper focuses on two particular payments: • when employers make payments to employees to cover the costs of employees relocating their home base as a result of their employment; and • when employers pay employees an allowance to cover the costs of meals in relation to overtime undertaken by the employee. Legal interpretative developments 2.5 For many years these two types of payment have been generally treated as non-taxable by both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Developments over time have, however, complicated the situation. 2.6 Before 1995 taxpayers required approval from Inland Revenue if a particular payment was to be treated as non-taxable, but since then taxpayers have self- assessed whether a payment is taxable or non-taxable. 2.7 In response to a taxpayer enquiry, Inland Revenue released for public consultation in October 2006 an exposure draft (QB0056) on the tax treatment of payments made to new employees to cover their relocation expenses. The draft suggested that the payments (whether made on account of an employee, or by reimbursement, or by way of an allowance based on an estimation of expected expenses) were taxable income of the recipient employee under current law. 1 The equivalent section in the recently enacted Income Tax Act 2007 is CW17. 5 2.8 Inland Revenue received around 30 submissions on this draft. They focussed not only on the interpretation itself but also raised concerns about the impact that taxing relocation payments would have on labour mobility and international competitiveness. There was also concern that many businesses, that had genuinely believed these payments to be non-taxable, now faced the risk of retrospective audit activity. 2.9 More recently, Inland Revenue has attempted to identify more generally the circumstances under current tax law (including case law) when amounts paid by employers in relation to employee-related expenses would be exempt from income tax. These circumstances are outlined in draft Interpretation Guideline (IG03162), which was released for public comment on 24 October 2007. The Interpretation Guideline specifically focuses on those situations covered by section CW 13. 2.10 Three criteria 2 that the guideline concludes have to all be met are: • The employee was performing an obligation under the contract of service at the time the expenditure was incurred. • The obligation served the purpose of the income-earning process of deriving income from employment. • The expenditure incurred by the employee was necessary as a practical requirement of the performance of the obligation. 2.11 The draft interpretation guideline reaches the same conclusion as QB0056 in relation to relocation payments, although its coverage is wider as it considers relocating existing as well as new employees. 3 2.12 Apart from relocations, application of the criteria in Interpretation Guideline IG03162 also has implications for overtime meal allowances as these would be taxable under the preceding criteria, whereas they have traditionally, in practice, been treated as non-taxable. 4 Policy response 2.13 In response to these various developments, the government has decided that it should, as a simplification initiative and to create greater certainty, amend the Act to specifically exempt relocation payments (for both new and existing employees) and overtime meal allowances from income tax and, where relevant, fringe benefit tax. This was announced in a joint media statement released by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue on 24 October 2007. 2 The criteria would not apply to payments that already have their own rules in legislation; for example the rules relating to reimbursement of additional transport costs are already set out in section CW 14 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (or CW 18 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 3 The one exception when relocation costs of existing employees would not be taxable is when the relocation costs relate to a requirement in the employment contract that the employee transfers at the request of the employer at any time and the employee is relocated to the same job and moves to the new location. 4 The other examples in the draft (meal allowances or reimbursements for meals taken as part of business situations and clothing allowances or reimbursements), appear to coincide with current practice, but it is likely that there will be specific instances outside of those examples where current practice differs from what the draft interpretation guideline proposes. 6 2.14 Furthermore, the government announced that, in principle, it believes these amendments should be backdated so that their coverage includes the past four years. By statute, Inland Revenue is generally unable to re-assess an income tax liability beyond four years. (This point is discussed more fully in chapter 5.) 7 Chapter 3 RELOCATION PAYMENTS – THE DETAILS 3.1 This chapter discusses the detail of the proposed approach to providing an exemption from income tax and fringe benefit tax for relocation payments. Issues discussed include determining what constitutes an employee relocation and what expenses should qualify as “relocation expenses”. In developing the requirements in these areas, we have drawn on the experience of other countries. What legislation needs to be amended? 3.2 Amendments will be needed to subparts CW and CX of the Act. A new section in subpart CW will be added to cover the exemption. Also, subpart CX will need to make it clear that if an employer chooses to directly incur the qualifying costs of relocating an employee, it will not give rise to a fringe benefit. What will qualify? 3.3 A chain of requirements will need to be met for a payment to be exempt. Step 1: When does an employee relocation occur? 3.4 The first step would be to determine whether a qualifying work-related relocation has actually occurred. 3.5 In this regard, the relocation will need to be as a result of an employee: • taking up a new job with a new employer; or • taking up new duties at a new location with the existing employer; or • continuing the current job, but at a new location. 3.6 Furthermore, the relocation of the employee’s home base (the sole or main residence) must be necessary to carry out the job. If the employee could have commuted to the new job from an existing home base there would appear to be a clear monetary private benefit involved when the employer pays for the relocation costs, and, in principle, this should be taxable. 8 3.7 This suggests the need for some form of distance requirement before a move could be considered a qualifying relocation. For example, in the United Kingdom the employee’s existing home must not be within reasonable daily travelling distance of the new workplace. An alternative would be to have a specific minimum distance test, such as that used in the United States. 5 Either of these requirements does, however, involve some compliance costs. The United Kingdom’s approach requires assumptions to be made about what is “reasonable”, although reasonableness is a common concept within accounting. The United States’ approach is more certain in this regard but is less flexible in handling genuine local relocations, such as within a major city where traffic congestion and transport difficulties may make shorter distance relocations more justifiable. 3.8 A third option would be to leave it to employers to decide whether there has been a home base relocation that they wish to pay for, on the basis that employers will be reluctant to pay for relocations that are not related to work. While this would generally be the case, there could be some instances, particularly for senior appointments, when a salary recharacterisation could be achieved by relocating locally to coincide with taking up a new appointment. 3.9 On balance, our preference, backed by preliminary consultation, is to adopt the United Kingdom’s approach. In terms of the reasonableness aspect, we note that the reasonable daily travelling distance is not defined in the United Kingdom’s legislation. Instead taxpayers are expected to apply common sense and take account of local conditions. The usual time taken to travel a given distance is an indication of whether that distance is reasonable. For example, in the United Kingdom employees living within larger cities commonly travel much greater distances or take longer to travel the same distance to work than do employees elsewhere. In the New Zealand context, transport difficulties in the major cities may make long distance commuting less likely. 3.10 We consider that the small additional compliance costs associated with this requirement are warranted in light of the reduced opportunity for salary recharacterisation. 5 The United States requires the new main job location to be at least 50 miles (approximately 80 kilometres) further from the employee’s former home than from the old main job location. The shortest distance of the most commonly travelled routes must be used. To determine this, employees are required to determine the distance between their former residence and their new job location and then subtract the distance between their former residence and their old job location. If the result is more than 50 miles, the distance test has been met. For example, if the distance from the employee’s former residence to the new job is 70 miles, and the distance from the former residence to the old job was five miles, the distance test would be met. 9 Question for submissions Would it be workable in New Zealand to have a requirement that the employee’s existing home must not be within reasonable daily travelling distance of the new workplace? Do we need a minimum distance requirement instead? If so, what should the minimum distance be? Would 80 kilometres be appropriate? What other options would you suggest? Step 2: What relocation expenses should be eligible? 3.11 Employers can largely be relied upon to confine their reimbursements to reasonable relocation expenses because their natural inclination is to minimise the costs that they incur. Nevertheless, the existence of an exemption for one form of expenditure will naturally create an incentive to recharacterise other forms of expenditure to take advantage of that exemption. Our view is that any payment that, absent an exemption, would have been paid as salary should be taxed as if it was salary. 3.12 Perhaps the most likely form of recharacterisation would be in relation to “additional” expenses, such as temporary accommodation, or an allowance for miscellaneous items. For example, if an employee required two months’ temporary accommodation to find a home to buy in the new area, but is offered four months’ accommodation, then the value of the additional two months’ accommodation should be taxable. The need to minimise recharacterisation provides a justification for limiting the scope of the exemption. 3.13 Allowing only actual expenses to be exempt is an obvious first step in preventing recharacterisation. This is discussed more fully later. Beyond this, two practical ways to limit the scope for recharacterisation are to restrict the eligibility of those types of expenses more likely to be recharacterised or to limit the total amount of the exemption available. In practice, the cost of relocating people will differ depending on their family size, where they are coming from, and so forth. The amount and extent of relocation expenses that an employer is willing to pay will also vary. For highly skilled, mobile workers, for example, a firm is likely to have to pay whatever relocation expenses are required by the employee. Placing limits on the amount of eligible relocation expenses would not adequately recognise these variations and is not therefore an approach we favour. 10 Having a list of eligible expenses 3.14 Accordingly, the limit we envisage is by way of having a list of eligible expenses. A suggested list is outlined below. The items are generally one- off costs. 3.15 The list would not be included in the Act but, rather, would be included in a determination issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, with the legislation providing for that power. The Commissioner would also be able to issue further determinations extending the list. 3.16 In relation to employees and their immediate families 6 involved in relocation, the list of eligible expenditure should consist of: • the costs of engaging a relocation consultant or the cost of house hunting trips to the new location; • the costs of obtaining immigration assistance; • the costs of obtaining advice on the taxation implications of relocating; • the costs of health checks and special documentation required as a result of the relocation; • the costs of selling an existing home and acquiring a new dwelling, including real estate commissions, legal fees and penalty interest charges for breaking a fixed term loan; • the costs of finding rental accommodation in the new location; • the costs of removal, transport and storage of household effects; • the costs to move personal items such as cars, boats or trailers; • disconnection and connection fees for, respectively, the old and new residences in relation to telephone, power, gas and internet/television; • transport costs (such as air fares) using a direct route to get to the new location, and any meals and accommodation costs en route; • costs of replacing or converting (minor) electrical appliances because of voltage differences; • the costs associated with relocating the employee’s pets, including boarding fees; • the costs of accommodation or value of employer-provided accommodation for up to two months; 6 “Immediate family” includes the employee’s partner, dependent children and any dependent adults that are part of the employee’s household. A dependent adult might be a dependent parent of the employee or partner or a disabled relative for whom the employee or the employee’s partner is the caregiver. 11 • utility and maintenance costs for the old residence up to one year if, despite reasonable efforts, it cannot be sold, and provided the property is not rented; • when new school uniforms are required, the cost of such uniforms up to $500 per child; and • private school application fees if an employee’s children were enrolled in private schools in the previous location. Question for submissions Are there other items that should be on an inclusive list? Are there items that should be removed from the list? Step 3: Requirement that expenditure has to be incurred 3.17 The exemption will apply only to actual expenditure incurred. Hence, paying an employee a relocation allowance would not generally qualify unless it could be shown that the allowance covers costs that were actually incurred. Similarly, any amount paid by the employer in excess of the actual amount incurred will be taxable, even though a particular expense is on the list. Otherwise, general allowances bearing no semblance to actual expenditure could be paid as salary substitutes. Step 4: Time limit for incurring expenditure 3.18 We envisage that the expenditure for a particular relocation must be incurred, or the benefit provided, before the end of the income year following the one in which the employee starts the new job or moves to the new location. The purpose of this requirement is to avoid expenditure some years later being attributed to the relocation when that expenditure would have no bearing on the employee’s decision to relocate. In practice, most relocation costs will be incurred close to the time of relocation. 3.19 The one proviso would be when an employee has temporarily moved to a new location for, say, a couple of years and then decides to relocate permanently but continues to do the same job. Provided no earlier claim has been made in relation to the relocation, it would be treated as having been made at the later date. The earlier, temporary move would not be considered to have been a relocation, as such, in those circumstances. 3.20 These steps are summarised in figure 1. 12 FIGURE 1: ESTABLISHING WHETHER A RELOCATION PAYMENT IS TAX-EXEMPT Has there been a relocation? Is it an eligible relocation expense? Is the payment for expenditure that has been actually incurred? Does it meet the time limit? Tax exemption Taxable Has an earlier claim been made in relation to the relocation? Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No No No Yes 3.21 Consequently, provided these various tests are met, the relocation payment will be exempt from income tax and fringe benefit tax, irrespective of how the employer makes the payment. Other options 3.22 As mentioned earlier, we also considered the merits of having a cap and/or a list of ineligible expenditure but concluded against these for various reasons. 3.23 The United States’ test, for example, focuses on what are the reasonable expenses of moving the employee’s household goods and personal effects and of travelling from the old to the new home. It includes a list of non- deductible expenses, which has the effect of significantly limiting what qualifies. The United Kingdom also has a list of ineligible items. 3.24 Obvious items for an ineligible list would be any capital gains provided to employees, such as compensation for having to pay more for a house in the new location than in the old location. Also, “expenditures” that were in effect lump-sum allowances unrelated to actual expenditure would also be ineligible. 13 3.25 A list of eligible expenses provides greater control over the expenses that would be tax-exempt than the converse approach of allowing any expenses other than those on an ineligible list. 3.26 A concern with placing a cap on the amount of exempt expenses is that it could preclude some socially optimal relocations because it would not recognise variations in employees’ costs, which can be significant depending on factors such as an employee’s family size. Questions for submissions Should there be a cap? Would having an exclusive list be a better approach than having an inclusive list of expenses? 14 Chapter 4 OVERTIME MEAL ALLOWANCES – THE DETAILS 4.1 Meal costs are generally considered to be of a private or domestic nature. They are a normal part of living, irrespective of whether someone is in paid work or not. For example, if an employer pays employees a meal allowance for them to buy their lunch, in the course of their normal working day, the allowance is generally considered taxable to the employees. In this case there is a clear private benefit. If the employer had not paid for the meal, the employees would have had to. The payment of a meal allowance in these circumstances is equivalent to the employees being paid salary or wages and purchasing the meal out of those wages. 4.2 There are, however, a number of situations when meals are considered to be necessarily incurred in deriving income, and are consequently non-taxable. For example, when an employer pays for meals taken as part of business or work meetings, as part of the entertainment of business clients, or in relation to a business trip to attend a meeting or conference that involves accommodation overnight, the payments are not taxable. Inland Revenue’s draft Interpretation Guideline will generally not affect these situations. 4.3 As an alternative to an allowance, employees may instead be provided with meals through a cafeteria on the employer’s premises. In such cases, fringe benefit tax does not apply because of the exemption for benefits provided on the employer’s premises. 4.4 Meal allowances are often paid to employees who work overtime. These payments have not been generally considered taxable, either by taxpayers or by Inland Revenue. However, the draft Interpretation Guideline concludes that these payments are, in fact, taxable under current law, and if that guideline is finalised in its current form, will result in Inland Revenue treating them accordingly. 4.5 With an overtime meal allowance, however, it is arguable whether the entire payment provides a private benefit. If the employees concerned had not worked overtime they could have eaten at home at a comparatively cheaper cost than they incurred by purchasing a meal while working overtime. An apportionment exercise could be entered into to estimate the likely cost of a meal at home, but this is likely to be difficult and would create significant compliance costs relative to the revenue likely to be generated. As with relocation payments, the private benefit involved is likely to be very small. 7 As such, rather than attempting to apportion private and business elements, the proposed approach, as announced in the media statement by ministers, is to exempt overtime meal allowances, subject to the limitations set out in the following sections. This will create more certainty. 7 For example, if an employee were to receive fifty overtime payments of $10 in a year and those payments were taxed, the maximum tax involved would be $195. 15 What legislation needs to be amended? 4.6 Amendments to subparts CW of the Act will be needed. As with relocation payments, overtime meal allowances will need to be separated out of section CW 13, and the specific rules relating to the overtime meal allowances exemption included in a new section. No changes are envisaged for the fringe benefit tax rules because fringe benefits arising outside of on-premises meals seem unlikely. If they do arise, however, they may get the benefit of section CX 5(3). That section states that to the extent to which a benefit that an employer provides to employees in connection with their employment would have been exempt income if it had been paid in cash, the benefit is not a fringe benefit. Limitations 4.7 The possibility of recharacterisation is again an issue. To minimise this likelihood, we are suggesting an exemption for meal allowances paid during overtime work when it is specified in the employee’s contract that the employee is eligible for a payment in relation to overtime hours worked. This would be irrespective of whether the employee can be required to work overtime. Eligibility for payment would be sufficient. 4.8 This exemption would not extend to amounts paid for overtime meals that have been incorporated into an employee’s normal salary and wages. 4.9 Ideally, the allowance should also reflect the expenditure incurred, although this raises some compliance concerns, such as the cost of verification. One option in these circumstances would be to require receipt verification only if the allowance is above a certain amount, as is done in Australia. An appropriate amount could be $20. (The Australian threshold is around this amount. 8 ) Even though verification would not be required in these circumstances, the allowance would still need to be fully expended on purchasing a meal. Alternatively, the allowance should be a reasonable estimate of the expected costs likely to be incurred by the employee or a group of employees for which reimbursement is payable (that is, the equivalent of the section CW13(3) requirement). The estimated amount would then be treated as if it were the amount incurred. 4.10 Combined, these features would substantially reduce any possibility of recharacterisation occurring. 8 Currently $21.90. See appendix for more detail. 16 Defining “overtime” 4.11 Furthermore, we suggest that the definition of “overtime” that is used in the legislation distinguish what is normally considered overtime from other periods of time for which meal allowances may be paid. “Overtime” is not commonly defined in statute, either in New Zealand or overseas, but there is a common understanding in everyday English usage. The Concise Oxford Dictionary, for example, defines “overtime” as “the time during which a person works at a job in addition to the regular hours”. The concept is therefore of something beyond normal hours. 4.12 This implies that if someone agreed to work four ten-hour days each week, for example, the last two hours of each day would not be considered overtime because they are part of the employee’s normal working hours. There would appear to be no difference between receiving a meal allowance during the last two hours in this example and receiving a lunchtime meal allowance. 4.13 The definition should encompass genuine overtime arrangements without providing opportunities to restructure contracts to provide for multiple overtime meal allowances by extending the number of overtime hours through significantly limiting the hours covered by basic pay. Possible definition 4.14 In these circumstances, a definition of overtime (and overtime payment) could be: Overtime, for a person, means time worked for an employer — (a) beyond the person’s normal hours of work as set out in the employment agreement; and (b) on a day, — (i) beyond a minimum requirement of eight hours; or (ii) for which the person is eligible to be paid under the employment agreement at a rate that is at least 1.5 times their rate of pay for normal hours. Overtime payment means an amount paid by an employer to a person for working overtime, and includes an overtime meal allowance paid or reimbursed under the person’s employment agreement. 17 Questions for submissions Would it be a useful option to have a $20 threshold below which verification of actual expenditure would not be required? Does the definition of “overtime” suggested in this chapter encapsulate the concept of overtime as you understand it? Should the definition also require that overtime does not include time worked outside someone’s normal hours when the minimum requirements for the employee for the week as set out in the employment agreement have not been met? Under such a requirement, an employee who worked an additional four hours on one day of the week but who worked only 36 of the required 40 normal hours for the week would not be considered to have worked any overtime. Is there a need, in practice, also to amend the fringe benefit tax rules to accommodate tax-free employer payments for overtime meals? 18 Chapter 5 RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION 5.1 The government has signalled its intention that the two legislative changes will have retrospective effect, so their coverage includes the past four years. Consequently, changes will need to be made not only to the Income Tax Act 2007 but also to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 1994. 5.2 Making retrospective amendments to tax legislation is generally not desirable as it can create uncertainty for taxpayers. In this instance, however, it will remove taxpayer uncertainty about what to do about past payments for relocation and overtime meal allowances in light of the conclusions reached in Inland Revenue’s draft Interpretation Guideline. 5.3 Specifically, the four-year period was intended to close off the possibility that past positions taken by taxpayers who had genuinely considered the amounts to be tax-free might be subsequently revised by Inland Revenue. By statute, Inland Revenue is generally 9 unable to re-assess a tax position beyond four years from the time of the end of the year in which the notice of original assessment was issued. (See section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.) Similarly, for taxpayers who have not filed a tax return, Inland Revenue is generally unable to issue an income statement beyond four years from the time of the end of the year in which the notice of original assessment was issued. 5.4 Because the four-year period begins from the assessment notice rather than from when the income was earned, the proposed exemption will likely apply retrospectively for five years. For example, an assessment made in August 2003 in relation to income earned in the 2002-03 income year could be amended up until 31 March 2008. In these circumstances, we suggest that the amendments apply from the 2002-03 income year. Credit for over-paid tax 5.5 Assuming that the legislation is passed, taxpayers who have been treating the payments as taxable will be eligible to receive a credit for any over-paid tax. 10 At that point, they can request that their relevant assessments be amended, which the Commissioner can do under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and receive an adjustment for the overpaid tax and any associated penalties. 5.6 The past payments would still need to meet the proposed criteria set out earlier in this issues paper, such as being an eligible relocation expense, to qualify for the exemption and any tax adjustment. 9 There is an exception when the return in question is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, fraudulent or wilfully misleading or omits all mention of income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source. 10 If no other tax is owed, this would result in a refund. 19 Who should get the credit? 5.7 Normally, the employee would receive the credit if the original payment is considered to have been part of the employee’s income. However, when in relation to a relocation payment an employer has deducted PAYE and has grossed up the payment to reflect the tax liability, there are strong grounds for giving the tax credit to the employer rather than the employee. 11 In such cases, the employee has been fully reimbursed for the relocation costs and the tax has, in effect, been borne by the employer. Consequently, we are interested in receiving feedback on whether it would be more appropriate for the employer to receive the tax credit adjustment. A special legislative mechanism may be required to achieve this in all cases. Employers would then be required to include the credits in their income because they would have treated the PAYE deduction as a cost of business. 5.8 This approach could also be administratively simpler as it would avoid having to adjust, where relevant, an employee’s liabilities for student loans and child support and entitlement to family tax credits. Questions for submissions Should the employer rather than the employee receive the tax credit that will arise in relation to the deduction of PAYE from past relocation payments? 11 This is not a problem if the employer has paid fringe benefit tax on the payment because the employer will automatically receive the credit. 20 Appendix TREATMENT OF RELOCATION AND MEAL ALLOWANCES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS Table 1 shows the key features of the tax treatments of relocation and overtime meal allowances in four “similar” jurisdictions. Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia all provide a tax exemption for certain relocation expenses. This is achieved through lists of what is eligible, and in the United States the test is also what is “reasonable” in the circumstances. Common features of the lists are the cost of travelling to the new home and transporting belongings, with the countries other than the United States also including the costs of selling an existing home and acquiring a new home. The United States and United Kingdom also have lists of ineligible expenditure. The United Kingdom is the only country to place a cap on the level of the concession, set at ₤8,000. Meal allowances are generally taxable in all four countries, with an exemption for meals during business travel in all four, and an exemption for overtime meals in all but the United Kingdom. 12 In Canada, if the employee works three or more hours of overtime right after his or her scheduled hours of work and the overtime is infrequent and occasional in nature (less than three times a week), then it is not taxable. If more frequent, the allowance is seen as taking on the characteristics of additional remuneration. The United States takes a similar approach for an overtime meal allowance provided on an occasional basis. In Australia, an overtime meal allowance may be tax-free if paid under an industrial law, award or agreement. If the allowance is no more than $21.90, there is an exemption from the need for verifying documentation but the amount must still be fully expended.

International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Czech Republic and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Czech Republic and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the Agreement is appended to this report. Charles Chauvel MP Chairperson NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 2 Appendix A National interest analysis— Agreement between the Czech Republic and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Executive summary 1 The purpose of the Agreement between the Czech Republic and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (“the Czech DTA”) is to eliminate double taxation of income flows between the Czech Republic and New Zealand. The Czech DTA will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The Czech DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a dispute resolution procedure. It will also assist in the prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 2 The Agreement between the Czech Republic and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (“the Czech DTA”) was signed in Prague on 26 October 2007. Subsequent to signature and satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, it is proposed that the Czech DTA be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, and brought into force, in accordance with Article 26, through an exchange of notes through the diplomatic channel, confirming completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force. The Czech DTA will enter into force on the date of the later note. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 3 New Zealand currently has 33 Double Tax Agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion. 4 New Zealand taxes its residents on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed on their New Zealand-sourced income. The Czech Republic taxes its residents and non-residents on a similar basis. This gives rise to the possibility that income flows between New Zealand and the Czech Republic will be subject to double taxation. The Czech DTA provides for the elimination of such double taxation, by means of an allocation of taxing rights between the two countries and through supporting mechanisms such as the requirement to provide tax credits. The Czech DTA also provides greater certainty of tax treatment for residents of the two countries engaging in trade and investment with the other country. Overall, the Czech DTA can be expected to foster trade and investment between New Zealand and the Czech Republic. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 3 5 Tax administrations are privy to sensitive financial and personal information. This information is generally held subject to strict confidentiality requirements. DTAs override these confidentiality rules and ensure that tax administrations can request from each other information that will assist in the prevention of tax avoidance and tax evasion. Information obtained under DTAs, however, can only be disclosed to specified persons, and may only be used for authorised purposes. 6 New Zealand’s current levels of trade and investment with the Czech Republic are modest. In the year to December 2004 New Zealand exported goods worth NZ$3.08 million to the Czech Republic, primarily wool, while the Czech Republic exported goods worth $26.52 million to New Zealand, principally motor cars. However potential exists for growth as evidenced by the fact that the Czech Republic was traditionally one of New Zealand’s larger export markets in Central Europe before Czechoslovakia split into two republics in 1993. The Czech Republic is a recent EU accession state. Like other recent EU accession states, the Czech Republic favours source taxation (as opposed to residence taxation), which is also preferred by New Zealand. Therefore, the two countries share a common interest in preserving source taxation. The Czech Republic is also a member of the OECD and New Zealand’s position is to give priority to OECD member countries who request DTAs. 7 The Czech DTA follows the New Zealand negotiation model very closely. This negotiation model sets out New Zealand’s preferred DTA provisions, which differ from the OECD Model Tax Convention in many places. The wording of some provisions varies slightly from that in the New Zealand model but these differences do not result in any substantive departures from New Zealand’s general treaty policy of protecting source income taxation. The Czech DTA will be a valuable precedent for future DTA negotiations. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force 8 The advantages to New Zealand of the Czech DTA entering into force are: ∑ it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and the Czech Republic—in particular, it will share the cost of relieving the double taxation of income. The Czech DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once ∑ it will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country ∑ when both New Zealand and the Czech Republic are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source ∑ the Czech DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputed issues that may arise in relation to the Czech DTA NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 4 ∑ the Czech DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both New Zealand and the Czech Republic by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes for the prevention of avoidance and evasion. 9 One disadvantage of the Czech DTA is that it will require New Zealand to forgo some revenue because of the reduction in levels of New Zealand tax and the allocation of some taxing rights to the Czech Republic. Although, as explained in the discussion further below, these revenue costs should be offset by corresponding increases in revenue (arising from reciprocal allocation of taxing rights to New Zealand and reductions of Czech Republic tax; a reduction in avoidance and evasion of New Zealand tax, and an increase in trade and investment). 10 The requirement for New Zealand to provide the Czech Republic with requested information on tax matters under the Czech DTA’s exchange of information provisions (Article 23 of the Czech DTA) may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 33 other DTAs is predominantly positive; the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsets the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to its requests. 11 Not signing or otherwise progressing the Czech DTA to entry into force is an option. However, in that case the potential benefits to New Zealand in terms of increased trade and investment, and reduced tax avoidance and evasion, will be forgone. The point of a DTA is to make concessions on a reciprocal basis with the other country. Such concessions can only be secured through the negotiation of a DTA. 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude the Czech DTA. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position for reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 13 The Czech DTA will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it imposes are on the Contracting States, restricting their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis and requiring the provision of assistance in the exchange of information in relation to tax matters. The Czech DTA does not require the imposition of a tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. 14 Under the Czech DTA, New Zealand and the Czech Republic will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country: ∑ income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated (Article 6 refers) ∑ business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit attributable to a “permanent establishment” situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A “permanent establishment” generally exists in the country in question when there is a fixed place of business where the business of an enterprise is carried on (Article 7 refers) NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 5 ∑ profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will generally be taxable only in that country, although profits from the carriage of passengers and cargo between New Zealand ports will remain subject to New Zealand tax (Article 8 refers) ∑ dividends may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country from which the dividends are paid may not impose tax in excess of 15 percent if the dividends are paid to a resident of the other country (Article 10 refers) ∑ interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises may not impose tax in excess of 10 percent if the interest is paid to a resident of the other country (Article 11 refers) ∑ royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise may not impose tax in excess of 10 percent of the royalties if they are paid to a resident of the other country (Article 12 refers) ∑ specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the sale of property. In the case of immovable property the profits remain taxable in the country in which the property is situated (Article 13 refers) ∑ income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In that case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, but only if the employee is present for at least 183 days and various conditions are met (Article 14 refers) ∑ directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident (Article 15 refers) ∑ entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which their activities take place (Article 16 refers) ∑ pensions and other similar remuneration are only taxable in the country where the recipient is resident (Article 17 refers) ∑ salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country (Article 18 refers) ∑ students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student (Article 19 refers) ∑ New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the Czech DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by exempting or giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the Czech DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures (Articles 21, 22 and 23 refer) ∑ reservations are not provided for under the Czech DTA NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 6 ∑ Article 22 of the Czech DTA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the treaty are to be resolved by mutual agreement between the Competent Authorities. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 15 The Czech DTA will need to be implemented domestically by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that DTAs will override the Income Tax Act 2004, the Tax Administration Act 1994, any other Inland Revenue Act, the Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993 in relation to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of a DTA, since they allocate taxing rights. This means that New Zealand foregoes some taxing rights available under the Inland Revenue Acts in certain circumstances. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during DTA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the exchange of information provision (Article 23 of the Czech DTA). 16 Subject to satisfactory completion of Parliamentary treaty examination, the Order in Council would be promulgated and would come into effect twenty-eight days after being published in the Gazette. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 17 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 18 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and the Czech Republic that we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of residents of the Czech Republic in New Zealand, which the Czech DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of the Czech Republic in respect of which the Czech DTA will lower withholding rates. 19 The Czech Republic will also be similarly constrained from taxing certain income flows between the two countries and this reduced tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. Further, Inland Revenue’s ability to obtain information from the Czech tax authorities under the Czech DTA and thus reduce tax evasion and avoidance may also assist in offsetting the foregone revenue. 20 To the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by a reduction in creditable Czech Republic tax or a reduction in levels of tax avoidance and evasion, it is expected that the economic benefits of the Czech DTA will outweigh these costs. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 7 Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 21 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted on and agree with the proposed treaty action. Consultation was undertaken by providing drafts of this document and the accompanying Cabinet Paper for comment. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 22 No future amendments are anticipated and the Czech DTA makes no provision for amendments. However, if the need to amend the Czech DTA arises, this can be achieved by means of a Protocol. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 23 Article 27 of the Czech DTA provides that either New Zealand or the Czech Republic may terminate the Czech DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force.

International treaty examination of the Protocol between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of New Zealand to Amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Protocol between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of New Zealand to Amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the Protocol is appended to this report. Charles Chauvel MP Chairperson NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 2 Appendix A National interest analysis—Amendment to the Protocol between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Government of New Zealand to Amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains Executive summary 1 The purpose of the Protocol between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of New Zealand to Amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains (“the Protocol”) is to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains (“the UK DTA”). The UK DTA addresses the double taxation of income flows between the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It enables the tax administrations of the two countries to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. 2 The Protocol amends the UK DTA in relation to this second purpose. It updates the Exchange of Information Article of the UK DTA to follow the new OECD standard on exchange of information, and to encompass taxes other than income tax. It also inserts an Article on Assistance in the Collection of Taxes into the UK DTA that will enable the two tax administrations to request assistance from each other in the recovery of tax debt. Date and nature of proposed binding treaty action 3 The Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains (“the UK DTA”) was signed at London on 4 August 1983 and entered into force on 16 March 1984. 4 The Protocol between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of New Zealand to Amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains (“the Protocol”) amends the UK DTA. 5 The Protocol was signed in London on 7 November 2007. Subject to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, and incorporation of the Protocol into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, it is also proposed that the Protocol be brought into force, in accordance with Article III, through an exchange of notes through diplomatic channels confirming completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force. The Protocol would enter into force on the date of the later note. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 3 Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty 6 The need for the amendments to the UK DTA, contained in the Protocol, arose because of the introduction of the new OECD standard on exchange of information. 7 The text of the Protocol was finalised by officials on 8 June 2007 and signed in London on 7 November 2007. 8 The Protocol enhances the provisions of the UK DTA that enable the tax administrations of the two countries to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. It replaces the Article on Exchange of Information of the UK DTA with a new Article that more closely follows the new OECD standard on exchange of information and that will also apply to taxes other than income tax (Article I of the Protocol; Article 25 of the UK DTA). It also introduces a new Article 25A on Assistance in the Collection of Taxes into the UK DTA that will enable the two tax administrations to request assistance from each other in the recovery of tax debt (Article II of the Protocol; Article 25A of the UK DTA). These changes can be expected to benefit New Zealand through a reduction in tax avoidance and evasion and an improvement in revenue collection (particularly given the large numbers of New Zealanders who live in the United Kingdom). Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force 9 The amendments contained in the Protocol are expected to reduce tax avoidance and evasion and improve revenue collection in light of the large numbers of New Zealanders present in the United Kingdom. 10 The requirement for New Zealand to provide the United Kingdom with information on a wider range of tax matters under the exchange of information provision is a potential disadvantage. However, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its DTAs generally is predominantly positive. The benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsets the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to its requests. 11 The Assistance in the Collection of Taxes Article is, likewise, reciprocal in nature. It will require New Zealand to collect unpaid tax on behalf of the United Kingdom, but will enable New Zealand to recover unpaid tax from absconding taxpayers who now live in the United Kingdom. The ability of New Zealand to collect otherwise uncollectible unpaid tax is expected to outweigh the administrative costs. 12 Amendments to a DTA are made by way of a protocol. The Protocol will help to achieve government objectives in relation to DTAs by improving the prevention of fiscal evasion and facilitating the exchange of information between New Zealand and the United Kingdom and assisting in the recovery of unpaid taxes. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 4 Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position for reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 13 The Protocol will impose obligations on New Zealand to provide information to the United Kingdom (Article I refers) and to assist the United Kingdom in the collection of revenue claims (Article II refers) in response to any valid request made under the Exchange of Information or Assistance in the Collection of Taxes Article. Both of these obligations are reciprocal. 14 Reservations are not provided for under the Protocol or the UK DTA. The Protocol itself does not contain any dispute settlement mechanism, but the UK DTA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to interpretation or application are to be resolved by mutual agreement between the Competent Authorities (Article 24 of the UK DTA refers). Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 15 The Protocol will need to be implemented domestically by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004. 16 The Protocol will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 provides that DTAs will have overriding effect in relation to the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993 in relation to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. The override of the Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the terms of a DTA, for example because DTAs prevent New Zealand from applying its domestic law taxing rights in some circumstances. The Official Information Act is overridden to ensure that communications with other states during DTA negotiations are not disclosed. The Privacy Act is overridden to ensure that information can be exchanged regarding natural persons under the Exchange of Information Article. 17 Subject to satisfactory completion of Parliamentary treaty examination, the Order in Council would be promulgated and would come into effect twenty-eight days after being published in the Gazette. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 18 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 19 There may be administrative costs arising from New Zealand’s obligations to exchange information and assist in the collection of taxes. However, the ability to obtain information and request assistance from the United Kingdom tax authorities and thus reduce tax avoidance and evasion and increase revenue collection is expected to provide compensating economic benefits to New Zealand. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 5 Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 20 The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted on and agree with the proposed treaty action. Consultation was undertaken by providing drafts of the NIA and the accompanying Cabinet Paper for comment. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 21 No future amendments to the UK DTA are anticipated and the Protocol makes no provision for amendments. However, if the need to amend the UK DTA arises again, this could be achieved by means of another protocol. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 22 Article IV of the Protocol provides that it shall remain in force as long as the UK DTA remains in force. Article 28 of the UK DTA provides that the DTA can be terminated by either party through the diplomatic channel by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force.

portfolio investment entity rules 3 OVERVIEW New tax rules for collective investment vehicles that meet the definition of a “portfolio investment entity” were enacted by the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in December last year. These optional rules were designed to alleviate a number of long-standing problems with the taxation of collective investment vehicles. The rules will treat investment through portfolio investment entities in the same way as direct investment by individuals, thus removing long-standing disadvantages of saving through intermediaries like managed funds. The changes were particularly important given the implementation of KiwiSaver this year. Portfolio investment entities will not be taxable on realised share gains made on New Zealand and Australian companies. Portfolio investment entities will pay tax on investment income based on the tax rates of their investors (capped at 33%, and at 30% from 1 April 2008). Income earned via a portfolio investment entity will not affect investors’ entitlements to family assistance, or their student loan repayments or child support obligations. The portfolio investment entity rules apply from 1 October 2007. A number of submissions were received on technical aspects of these rules. The changes that have been recommended are of a remedial nature, and include ensuring that the rules for portfolio investment entities that derive income from land – such as listed property trusts that own commercial property – achieve their intended policy effect. 4 INVESTOR REQUIREMENTS Issue: Breach of investor requirements Submission (55 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) When a portfolio investment entity breaches the investor requirements, it has until the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the breach occurs to rectify it, before losing its portfolio investment entity status. This safe harbour period should be changed because it is still possible for the portfolio investment entity to be unaware that the requirements have been breached after the time limit for correction. The qualifying unit trust safe harbour in section HL 6(3) should therefore be available to an entity that is or has been offered to the public under the Securities Act 1978. Alternatively, the portfolio investment entity should have until the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the breach is discovered to rectify the breach, providing the portfolio investment entity has proper procedures in place to identify any breaches. Comment The main reason that a fund that offers its units to the public under the Securities Act 1978 would not be able to meet the definition of “qualifying unit trust” (and therefore gain the benefit of a safe harbour) is that they would have fewer than 100 investors. A fund with this number of investors should be able to monitor whether any of its investors have more than 20 percent of the fund, and whether there are more than 20 investors. The current rules only require them to monitor this on a quarterly basis. If there is a breach, the entity has up to two quarters to rectify that breach. Officials consider that this provides reasonable opportunity for a fund to comply with the investor requirements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 Issue: Investor requirements for superannuation schemes that are declining in size Submission (55 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) Existing superannuation schemes, approved KiwiSaver schemes or complying superannuation funds should be able to retain their portfolio investment entity status if they breach the investor requirements as a result of a decline in the size of the scheme. Alternatively, existing superannuation schemes, approved KiwiSaver schemes or complying superannuation funds should be able to retain their portfolio investment entity status if no member (with their associates) holds more than 40 percent of the scheme. Comment Officials agree that problems can arise when superannuation funds that were established before introduction of the portfolio investment entity rules decline in size. The problems can arise because the number of fund investors can fall, which can result in the fund falling below the investor requirements. This is a particular problem for existing superannuation funds because their trust deeds may not have sufficient flexibility to reorganise the membership of their funds so that this does not occur. Superannuation funds that were in existence before the introduction of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 on 17 May 2006 should therefore not be required to meet the investor test, provided that no investor (other than the fund’s manager or trustee) can control the investment decisions relating to any of the entity’s funds. This would apply only to superannuation funds that, if they were unit trusts, meet or would have once met paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the definition of “qualifying unit trust”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Qualifying unit trust safe harbour should apply to portfolio investor class Submission (Matter raised by officials) The portfolio investment entity rules should be amended so that the exemptions from the investor membership and investor interest size requirements only apply if each “portfolio investor class” of the entity would, if it were a unit trust, meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the “qualifying unit trust” definition. 6 Comment To qualify as a portfolio investment entity, an entity must generally meet the investor membership requirement and the investor interest size requirement. There are exemptions to these requirements if the entity, if it were a unit trust, would meet the requirements of one or more of paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the “qualifying unit trust” definition. These exemptions are designed to provide widely held savings vehicles with more certainty that they will meet the portfolio investment entity eligibility requirements. These exemptions currently apply if the entity can satisfy the qualifying unit trust definition. The problem is that this could result in a portfolio investor class of a qualifying entity gaining portfolio investment entity status even though that particular class is not widely held. This is inconsistent with the policy intent of the rules. Therefore, it is recommended that these exemptions are amended so that each “portfolio investor class”, rather than the entity itself, is required to meet paragraphs (a) and (c) to (e) of the definition of “qualifying unit trust” (if the entity were a unit trust). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “portfolio investor class” to clarify that investors can benefit differently from proceeds of a portfolio investment if difference only due to different tax rates Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “portfolio investor class” should be clarified so that investors can benefit differently from the proceeds of a portfolio investment if that difference results only from the application of different portfolio investor rates over the term of the investment. Comment For a group of investors to constitute a single “portfolio investor class” each investor must participate equally (in proportion to their percentage holding in the fund) in the underlying investments of the fund. An issue arises in relation to financial arrangements held by the portfolio investment entity that provide investors with capital guarantees. Typically, under these arrangements if investors suffer a capital loss over the investment term the portfolio investment entity exercises the capital guarantee and receives a taxable amount that, after application of investors’ portfolio investor rates, is sufficient to compensate each investor for their capital loss. 7 As investors can have different portfolio investor rates there is an argument that this results in investors having different interests in a portfolio entity investment, (the capital guarantee being the portfolio entity investment). In many cases, the financial arrangement that provides the capital guarantee would not be a portfolio entity investment as the arrangement would not generally be entered into with the prospect of deriving a positive return. However, it should be put beyond doubt that people who invest in a portfolio investment entity that holds such a capital guarantee will not be prevented from being part of the same portfolio investor class merely because they have different portfolio investor rates. The definition of “portfolio investor class” should therefore be clarified so that investors can benefit differently from the proceeds of a portfolio entity investment if that difference results only from the application of different portfolio investor rates over the term of the investment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 INVESTMENT TYPE REQUIREMENTS Issue: Investment type requirements should include land not currently in use Submission (61 – KPMG, 59 – Property Council of New Zealand) Currently, section HL 10(1)(a) requires that an entity must use or have available to use 90 percent or more by value of the entity’s assets in deriving income from owning an interest in land. The section should be amended to ensure that it covers land that is not currently in use, but will be in the future. An example of this is when land is vacant or when property is under construction. Comment Officials consider that the concern raised in the submission can be resolved by amending section HL 10(1) to remove the current income derivation wording. Therefore, the investment type requirement would be that 90 percent or more by value of the entity’s assets must be qualifying assets. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Operating expenses for land Submission (61 – KPMG, 59 – Property Council of New Zealand) In the income type requirement in section HL 10(2), the word “rent” should be replaced by a reference to payments received in relation to an interest in land. This is so that it includes operating expenses in relation to the land. Comment Officials agree that payments from lessees that relate to their interest in land, such as operating expenses, should be covered by section HL 10(2)(b)(iii). Officials do not agree that the word “rent” should be removed, as this provides helpful clarification that payments for licences are not qualifying income for the purposes of section HL 10(2)(b)(iii). Officials also consider that section HL 10(2)(iv) should be clarified by referring to proceeds from the disposal of property referred to in section HL 10(1). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 9 Issue: Investments in other portfolio investment entities should be taken into account for the entity shareholding investment requirement Submission (61 – KPMG) The reference in section HL 10(4) to investments in subsection (3) should be clarified to ensure that investments in other portfolio investment entities are taken into account in working out whether the entity shareholding investment requirement (in relation to investments of over 20 percent) is satisfied. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 FOREIGN INVESTMENT VEHICLES Issue: Application of foreign investment vehicle definition to trusts Submission (59 – Property Council of New Zealand) The test for whether an entity is a foreign investment vehicle should be applied to the level of the trust rather than the trustee. Comment Some types of trusts in a chain of foreign entities investing into New Zealand do not technically come within the “unit trust” definition, and therefore the foreign investment vehicle definition does not apply. This problem would be resolved if the settlor of the trust that does not meet the “unit trust” definition is treated as the investor. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Controlled foreign company rules and foreign investment vehicles Submissions (55 – NZ Funds) Currently, section EX 1(1B) applies only where one of the tests in section EX 1(1) is met. Therefore it could be argued that on a strict application of the provision, it does not apply where more than one of the section EX 1(1) requirements are satisfied. Section EX 1(1B) should be amended to ensure that it applies where one or more of the tests in subsection EX 1(1) are met. The rules providing for the re-application of the controlled foreign company rules when a foreign company ceases to be a foreign investment vehicle should be clarified. Comment Officials agree with the first submission that the application of section EX 1(1B) be clarified. 11 Officials do not consider the rules providing what happens when a foreign company ceases to be a foreign investment vehicle need to be clarified. If the foreign company meets any of the controlled foreign company tests in section EX 1(1) at any time in the foreign company’s accounting period and the foreign company is not a foreign investment vehicle at that time, then the company is treated as a controlled foreign company for the whole of the accounting period. Recommendation That the submission ensuring that section EX 1(1B) applies when one or more of the tests in section EX 1(1) are met be accepted. That the submission requesting clarification of the rules on what happens when a foreign company ceases to be a foreign investment vehicle be declined. 12 PORTFOLIO LISTED COMPANIES Issue: The qualifying unit trust requirement should be removed for portfolio listed companies Submission (74D – Deloitte) Currently, under section HL 11B, an unlisted company must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of the definition of “qualifying unit trust” in order to be treated as a portfolio listed company. This requirement should be replaced with a requirement that the company has at least 100 shareholders. Comment Officials agree with the submission, as the replacement requirement would ensure that the unlisted company is widely held. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Taxation of trustee income Submission (59 – Property Council of New Zealand) Trustees in portfolio listed companies should be taxed at 30%. Comment The policy underlying the portfolio investment entity rules is that the maximum tax rate on any investor in a portfolio investment entity should be 30% from 1 April 2008. Currently, section CX 44D(3)(b) can result in a trustee investor in a portfolio listed company being taxed at 33% on their imputed income from the portfolio listed company. Officials agree that this treatment is not consistent with the policy intent, and therefore recommend that New Zealand-resident trustee investors in portfolio listed companies should be treated the same as individual New Zealand-resident investors in respect of imputed income from portfolio listed companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 13 PORTFOLIO LAND COMPANY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE INCOME TYPE REQUIREMENT Submission (Matter raised by officials) The income type requirement in section HL 10(2) should apply to a portfolio land company. Comment Portfolio investment entities can own and lease land and buildings to active businesses as long as they are not themselves active businesses. Examples of non- active businesses are listed property trusts that own commercial property. The income type requirement in section HL 10(2) provides that the majority of the entity’s income must be passive income, such as dividends, interest and rent. Currently, this requirement does not apply to a portfolio land company, which is a subsidiary of a portfolio investment entity. This is contrary to the policy intent of the rules. Officials recommend that this should be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 14 SUPERANNUATION FUNDS Issue: Transfer of unvested contributions if vesting schedule is longer than five years Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 54 – ASB) If a member transfers to a master scheme or new provider, the new superannuation fund should be able to apply the member’s prescribed investor rate to unvested employer contributions regardless of the length of the vesting period. Comment Officials consider that transfers from a superannuation scheme that existed before 17 May 2006 to a new superannuation scheme, and where there is no change in substance to the benefits a member will receive from unvested contributions, should continue to be treated as if the transfer had not occurred. This means that income relating to the unvested contributions will continue to be taxed at the portfolio investor’s rate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Fund withdrawal tax for non-KiwiSaver superannuation funds becoming portfolio investment entities Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) The timing of the fund withdrawal tax (FWT) when employer-contributed funds are withdrawn from a superannuation fund that is a portfolio investment entity is misaligned. Fund withdrawal tax is imposed in the tax year after the year of withdrawal. However, if a superannuation fund is a portfolio investment entity, tax is payable within one month of the end of the month in which the portfolio investor exit-period occurs. To remedy this misalignment, FWT should be abolished, or the superannuation fund should be able to pay FWT at the same time as tax on partial or full withdrawals by portfolio investors. 15 Comment Officials consider that FWT obligations are quite separate from portfolio investment entity tax obligations. Therefore it would be incorrect to abolish FWT as a consequence of the portfolio investment entity tax rules. Aligning the payment of FWT with the payment of tax on full or partial withdrawals by investors would be legislatively complicated to achieve. Also, the systems of some portfolio investment entities may not be sufficiently developed to cater for this. Officials therefore do not support such alignment of payment dates. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 TAX CALCULATION Issue: Unit pricing for material timing differences Submission (24 – AMP Financial Services and AMP Capital Investors) Unlisted property trusts that are portfolio tax rate entities often include certain material timing differences in their unit pricing. These material timing differences include depreciation of property held on capital account and revaluations of property held on revenue account. Section EG 3, as currently drafted, suggests that these items be taxed at the time they are factored into unit pricing. However, these should not be taxed until they are realised. Comment Officials and AMP have discussed the problem and agree that it is largely an accounting concern, for which a legislative solution is inappropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Zero-rated investor deduction in section DB 43B should refer to the portfolio tax rate entity’s tax year Submission (61 – KPMG) Section DB 43B(2)(a) currently states that a zero-rated portfolio investor has a deduction for an amount of portfolio investor allocated loss from a quarterly tax paying portfolio tax rate entity if “the investor’s income year includes the end of the portfolio calculation period”. This should refer to the portfolio tax rate entity’s tax year, rather than portfolio calculation period. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Section DB 43B(2) would therefore provide that an investor has a deduction for the amount of portfolio investor allocated loss in the investor’s income year that includes the end of the portfolio tax rate entity’s income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 Issue: Definition of “portfolio investor rate” Submissions (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 61 – KPMG) The definition of “portfolio investor rate” in section OB 1 should ensure that portfolio investment entities are not required to retrospectively apply changes of tax rates advised to them by portfolio investment entity members. To achieve this, the word “period” in para (b)(iii) of the definition of “portfolio investor rate” should be replaced with a reference to “portfolio allocation period”. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The legislation should be amended to clarify that if an investor changes their portfolio investor rate at any time during the year, the new portfolio investor rate will apply to any amount for which the tax liability has not already been calculated. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) The definition of “portfolio investor rate” should make it clear what the term “calculated” in subparagraph (iii) means for the purposes of the definition. (KPMG) Comment The intention of the legislation is that the reference to “period” should be a reference to “portfolio allocation period”. This amendment would resolve the concerns of Mercer Human Resource Consulting and the Investment Savings and Insurance Association. Officials do not consider it is necessary to clarify what “calculated” means in the section OB 1 definition of “portfolio investor rate”. It is clear from the context that “calculated” refers to calculation events such as year-end calculations, portfolio exit period calculations and calculations under section HL 23B. Therefore, if there has been no calculation event, a portfolio investment entity can apply the most recently notified rate for each day in the calculation period. Recommendation That the Mercer Human Resource Consulting and the Investment Savings and Insurance Association submissions be accepted. That the KPMG submission be noted. 18 Issue: Charities investing in portfolio investment entities should be taxed at their marginal rates Submission (58 – Trustee Corporations Association) Charities should get a rebate of imputation credits to ensure that they are taxed at their correct marginal rate. Comment The portfolio investment entity rules maintain the current position that imputation credits are not refundable to charitable investors. The question of whether imputation credits should be refunded is being considered in a separate review. Whether the benefit of imputation credits should be provided to charitable investors under the portfolio investment entity rules should be considered as part of this review. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Option to not use excess foreign tax credits from one portfolio investor class to offset tax from other portfolio investor classes Submission (Matter raised by officials) The rules should be amended so that it is clear that portfolio investment entities and portfolio investor proxies have the option of not using excess foreign tax credits from one portfolio investor class to offset tax from other portfolio investor classes. Comment The intention of the rules is that portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies should be allowed, but not required, to use excess foreign tax credits received for an investor from one portfolio investor class against the tax liability of that investor from other portfolio investor classes. This flexible approach is appropriate as the sophistication of systems will vary across providers. Currently it is not clear whether section HL 27 provides portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies with the option of not using excess foreign tax credits from one portfolio investor class to offset tax from other portfolio investor classes. Section HL 27 should therefore be clarified to provide this flexibility. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 19 Issue: Foreign tax credits Submissions (74C – Deloitte, 61 – KPMG, 58 – Trustee Corporations Association, 54 – ASB) A portfolio investor proxy’s foreign tax credits are restricted to the lesser of the allocated credits or the maximum tax liability on the allocated income. The foreign tax credits available to a portfolio investor proxy should not be restricted. (Deloitte, Trustee Corporations Association) It is unclear whether there is a restriction on portfolio investor proxies transferring foreign tax credits. Section HL 27 should be amended accordingly. (KPMG) The legislation should clarify that a custodian investing into several different portfolio investment entities on behalf of an investor can group income, losses and tax credits in relation to those investments. (ASB) Comment It is fairly common for people to hold a portfolio of investments via a custodian. These are often referred to as “wrap accounts” and provide investors with the same benefits of direct ownership of the underlying investments. In addition, the custodian will often provide a range of investment services including, in some cases, the deduction of resident withholding tax (RWT) on dividends and interest. The portfolio of investments that the custodian holds for the investor is likely to include interests in managed funds. The portfolio investment entity rules have been designed so that a custodian (referred to in the legislation as a “portfolio investor proxy”) can calculate tax on behalf of its investors when someone invests through a custodian into an underlying portfolio investment entity. This makes sense because the custodian is likely to be deducting RWT for the investor on the investor’s non- portfolio investment entity investments. The rules achieve this treatment by the portfolio investment entity applying a zero percent tax rate to the PIE income earned on behalf of the portfolio investor proxy, with the PIE income flowing through to the portfolio investor proxy. The portfolio investor proxy is then required to calculate and deduct tax on that income as if the portfolio investor proxy were a portfolio investment entity. Broadly, this means that the portfolio investor proxy can treat the person’s separate investments in underlying PIEs as if they were a single investment in an underlying PIE. The person’s separate investments in underlying PIEs, from the perspective of the portfolio investor proxy, are treated as separate portfolio investor classes in the same PIE. This approach allows the rules relating to investor exit, use of tax credits and losses to work appropriately. However, as the submissions point out, the tax credit rules in section HL 27 should be amended so that portfolio investor proxies can use the full amount of foreign tax credits received from portfolio investment entity investments to offset tax on PIE income. This would align the foreign tax credit rules that apply to portfolio investor proxies investing in portfolio investment entities with those applying to portfolio tax rate entity PIEs that invest in other PIEs. 20 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Portfolio investor proxies should be able to satisfy PIE tax on behalf of investors by directly accessing cash accounts Submission (Matter raised by officials) A portfolio investor proxy should be allowed to satisfy portfolio investment entity tax on behalf of its investors by directly accessing cash accounts that the investor holds with the portfolio investor proxy. Comment Under the rules, portfolio tax rate entities will generally pay tax on behalf of investors by reducing investors’ interests in the portfolio investment entity. In contrast, some portfolio investor proxies have been structured to pay portfolio investment entity tax on behalf of investors by directly accessing the cash accounts that investors hold with the portfolio investor proxy. There is no policy reason why a portfolio investor proxy should not be able to satisfy portfolio investment entity tax on behalf of their investors in this way and the PIE rules should be amended to explicitly provide for this option. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Portfolio investor rate that is lower than the prescribed investor rate Submission (Matter raised by officials) Portfolio investor allocated income should continue to be excluded income to the investor if the investor provides to the portfolio investment entity a portfolio investor rate that is lower than their prescribed investor rate and the portfolio investment entity has not subjected that income to a final tax calculation. Comment Currently section CX 44D can be interpreted so that the portfolio investor allocated income of an investor for the year is not excluded income if the investor has provided the portfolio investment entity at the start of the year with a portfolio investor rate that is lower than their prescribed investor rate. This could result in portfolio investor 21 allocated income being taxed to investors even if the investor provides their correct rate before the portfolio investment entity performs a final tax calculation for the investor. Therefore, section CX 44D should be amended so that portfolio investor allocated income remains excluded income for a year and the PIE applies the investor's correct rate when performing a final tax calculation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Administration and management fees Submission (54 – ASB) Investors should be able to elect to either deduct administration and management fees charged by a portfolio investor proxy for managing an investor’s investment portfolio against the portfolio investor proxy income in the portfolio investor proxy tax computations, or deduct the administration and management fees charged by a portfolio investor proxy in their individual tax returns. Comment Officials consider that the current legislation provides that administration and management fees that investors incur for investments through a custodian are allocated to: • the investor directly when the investment through the custodian is not portfolio investment entity-related; and • the portfolio investor proxy (which is treated as a portfolio investment entity) when the investment is portfolio investment entity-related. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 22 Issue: Timing of receipt of tax credits Submission (61 – KPMG) The same timing rules should apply to receipt of credits for both zero-rated investors and exiting investors. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The credits should be treated as being received in the investor’s income year that includes the end of the portfolio investment entity’s income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Allocation of credits by portfolio tax rate entities Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that section EG 3 allocates tax credits to the same period as the income to which the credits relate. (Section EG 3 allows PIEs to recognise amounts for tax purposes at the same time they recognise those amounts for unit pricing and financial reporting purposes.) Comment This amendment is consistent with the current section EG 3. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 23 PRESCRIBED INVESTOR RATE FOR TRUSTEES Submission (61 – KPMG, 58 – Trustee Corporations Association) Trustees should be able to elect a prescribed investor tax rate of 19.5% in addition to the current options of 0% and 33%. Under this approach the income would be taxable (that is, not excluded income) to the trustee with a credit available for the 19.5% tax that was deducted at the portfolio investment entity level. This would allow trustees to manage their fiduciary obligations and minimise compliance costs because it would reduce the risk of beneficiaries becoming subject to the provisional tax rules. Comment It has not been possible in the time available to develop this proposal sufficiently to allow it to be incorporated in this bill. The proposal could be considered for a future tax bill if the writers of the submission wish to discuss this further with officials. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 24 INVESTOR EXPENDITURE Submissions (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Expenses transferred under subpart DV are currently treated as expenditure at the portfolio investment entity level in section HL 20. It should be clarified that a deduction for expenditure transferred from an investor under subpart DV is deductible as investor expenditure under section HL 20. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) An amendment should be made so that a non-portfolio investment entity super fund that invests in a portfolio tax rate entity can treat expenditure as a deductible investor fee. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) Comment Officials agree with the submissions. The relevant expenditure should be treated as investor-specific “fees” for the purposes of section HL 20(4). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 25 FORMATION LOSSES Issue: Formation losses should be tested on a net basis Submission (61 – KPMG, 58 – Trustee Corporations Association) A portfolio investment entity’s formation losses are restricted to 5 percent of the market value of a portfolio investment entity’s portfolio entity investment. Currently, the amount of formation loss is tested on a gross basis. However, losses in the portfolio investment entity’s balance sheet would be expressed as a net amount. Similarly, formation losses should be tested on a net basis. Comment The proposal would, in effect, significantly increase the amount of formation losses available immediately. This would be inconsistent with the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Formation losses should be able to be used against refundable credits Submission (61 – KPMG, 58 – Trustee Corporations Association) When a fund has formation losses, the investor cannot rebate refundable credits. This restriction should be removed. Comment Officials are of the view that formation losses should not be used against credited income, regardless of whether the credit is an imputation credit or a refundable credit. If formation losses were able to be used in this way, it would mean that formation losses could effectively be cashed out, which is contrary to the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 EXITING INVESTORS Issue: Accommodation of partial withdrawals and switches within the same portfolio investment entity Submission (61 – KPMG) Section HL 23B should accommodate partial withdrawals and switches between investor classes within the same portfolio investment entity. Comment The current wording of section HL 23B can be interpreted as only applying when an investor reduces their total interest in the portfolio investment entity. The provision should be amended so that it is clear that it applies when an investor switches their investment from one class in the portfolio investment entity to another class in the same portfolio investment entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Optional payments of tax by a portfolio tax rate entity Submission (55 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) Section HL 23B should be clarified to make it clear that the optional tax payment made under the section is for a “tax year” for annual portfolio investment entities, and for the “quarter of exit” for a section HL 21 quarterly portfolio investment entity. Comment Officials consider that the current wording of section HL 23B already caters for section HL 21 quarterly portfolio investment entities. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 27 Issue: Exiting investors should not have to return excess tax credits Submission (61 – KPMG) Under section HL 27(9), investors in portfolio tax rate entities must return any excess New Zealand tax credits in their tax return if it exceeds the investor’s share of the portfolio entity tax liability for the portfolio investor exit period. This is contrary to the policy intention that investors in portfolio tax rate entities should have no further tax obligations if they fully exit a fund, and any excess tax credits should be rebated to the entity. Comment Officials agree with the submission and consider that section HL 27(9) should be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Portfolio investment entity income should not affect family tax credits for exiting investors Submission (55 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) Portfolio investment entity income should not affect family support entitlements for exiting investors who are required to file tax returns for their portfolio investment entity income. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 GROUPING RULES Issue: Grouping of unlisted property portfolio investment entities Submission (24 – AMP Financial Services and AMP Capital Investors) An unlisted property portfolio tax rate entity should be allowed to offset losses against the income of its subsidiaries. Comment Officials consider that the submission is inconsistent with the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules in relation to losses and portfolio tax rate entities, which is that the tax benefit of losses should be flowed through to investors. This policy explains why portfolio tax rate entities cannot carry forward or group losses with other entities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Portfolio investment entities should be able to be part of a group Submission (59 – Property Council of New Zealand) The grouping provisions in section IG 1 should continue to apply to a group of companies if the only entities in the group include a portfolio tax rate entity which only holds shares in portfolio land companies. Comment Officials agree with the suggested approach. In particular, the grouping provision should apply if the only entities in the group are a single portfolio tax rate entity parent which only holds shares in portfolio land companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 29 Issue: Portfolio investment entities should be able to be part of a group for GST purposes Submission (61 – KPMG, 59 – Property Council of New Zealand) Section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act should be amended to allow portfolio investment entities to be part of a group for GST purposes. Comment Officials agree with the submission. This could be achieved by amending section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act to allow portfolio investment entities to be part of a group for GST purposes if they would have been eligible to be a group for income tax purposes (in the absence of the prohibition on portfolio tax rate entities being part of a group under section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 30 CANCELLATION OF SHARES Issue: Power to cancel units on same-day basis Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) Section HL 7 should clarify that the fund can cancel units at any time up to the end of the relevant period. Comment Officials agree with the submission. In particular, the current references to “period” in section HL 7(3)(a) should be made consistent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Companies Act should be amended to allow a company to cancel shares Submissions (61 – KPMG, 55 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) A legislative override to section 69 of the Companies Act 1993 is required so that a company can cancel shares to comply with section HL 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004. (KPMG) The legislation should give the portfolio investment entity authority to reduce an investor’s holding in the portfolio investment entity in circumstances where, in the manager’s opinion, the reduction in holding is necessary to maintain portfolio investment entity status. (New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) Comment Officials note that a company can currently comply with section HL 7 by paying investors on different tax rates different dividends. It is therefore unnecessary to amend the Companies Act. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 31 LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDED THROUGH A SUPERANNUATION SCHEME Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Superannuation schemes that provide life insurance to their members should be able to qualify as portfolio investment entities. In particular, there is a concern that the “income interest requirement” in section HL 3(9) will be an obstacle to this. Comment Officials consider that the current law does allow superannuation schemes that provide life insurance to their member investors to qualify as portfolio investment entities. The “income interest requirement” in section HL 3(9) is based on the definition of “portfolio entity investment”. The provision of life insurance to investors is not generally in the nature of a portfolio entity investment, as the ordinary meaning of “investment” requires the prospect of a positive return on the amount invested, and not merely protection, against potential future loss. Therefore, the “income interest requirement” in section HL 3(9) does not prevent superannuation schemes that provide life insurance to their members qualifying as portfolio investment entities. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 32 PORTFOLIO LAND CLASS LOSSES Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section HL 30 requires that the measurement test be carried out at the end of a portfolio investment entity’s calculation period, and not when a partial or full redemption of an investor’s units occurs during the portfolio investment entity’s calculation period. This should be changed to ensure that a portfolio class land loss can only be offset against portfolio land class income and cannot be rebated or offset against other classes of income. Comment Officials consider that the concerns raised will not generally arise in practice as the calculation period for most portfolio investment entities is a day and not a year. Therefore, the fact that an investor leaves part-way through a year does not preclude the measurement test for a portfolio class land loss applying on a daily basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 33 EXCLUSION OF AUSTRALASIAN SHARE GAINS Issue: Australasian share options Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Portfolio investment entities should not be taxed on income arising from the disposal of Australasian share options. An individual holding these options directly would generally hold the options on capital account, and would therefore not be taxed on any realised gains. Comment The policy objective of the Australasian share trading exclusion for portfolio investment entities was to remove the principal distortion between investing directly in Australasian shares and investing in the same shares indirectly through a managed fund. This objective has been achieved by the share trading exclusion in section CX 44C. It is not clear that extending this exclusion to options over shares would, in practice, provide any further significant neutrality of treatment in this area. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Portfolio investment entity rules should apply to other instruments with the same economic effect as investment in shares Submission (52 – Tower) The portfolio investment entity rules should apply to other instruments that have the same economic effect as investment in shares. Comment The exclusion from share gains for portfolio investment entities was introduced to remove the distortion between a person investing in shares through a managed fund and a person making the same investment directly. This distortion does not arise in the case of derivatives, which are taxed under the same rules regardless of whether they are held directly or indirectly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 34 Issue: Anti-avoidance rule Submission (Matter raised by officials) The anti-avoidance rule contained in proposed section CX 44C(d) in clause 12 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, as introduced in May 2006, should be reinstated. Comment Proposed section CX 44C(d) provided that the Australasian share gains exclusion would not apply when the gain on the share was guaranteed. This provision was inadvertently omitted at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage of the bill. It was only intended that this provision be amended to focus on the time of acquisition of the relevant share. Accordingly, the provision should be reinstated with this amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disposal of certain shares by a portfolio investment entity after declaration of a dividend Submission (55 – NZ Funds) Section CB 4B provides that where a share is sold between the date a dividend is declared and the date it is paid, an amount representing the unimputed dividend must be included in the portfolio investment entity income calculation. This should apply on a net basis. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 35 Issue: Reflecting changes made to section EX 33C Submission (55 – NZ Funds) That the Australasian share gains exclusion in section CX 44C be amended to reflect the changes proposed to the foreign investment fund exemption for Australian shares in section EX 33C. Comment The grounds for allowing portfolio investment entities to rely on the listing status of Australian shares on the first day of their income year for the purposes of section EX 33C do not apply to the Australasian share gains exclusion in section CX 44C. The relevant date in the Australasian share gains exclusion is the date the share is disposed of. The exclusion should apply to an Australian share that is listed on the date of disposal but it should not if the share is not listed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New Zealand Superannuation Fund should be subject to dividend stripping rule Submission (Matter raised by officials) The New Zealand Superannuation Fund should be subject to the dividend stripping rule in section CB 4B. Comment Under section CX 44C, the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF) has been provided with the exclusion from tax on gains from the disposal of New Zealand and certain Australian shares. This is the same exclusion that portfolio investment entities benefit from. Therefore the NZSF should, like portfolio investment entities, be subject to the dividend stripping rule in section CB 4B. Section CB 4B should be amended so that it applies to the NZSF. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 36 FILING AND INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Issue: Treatment of unvested employer contributions in reserve accounts Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) Investor certificates should be able to be filed under the employer plans or reserve accounts’ name, rather than the portfolio investment entity’s name. Comment Officials note that this concern has been dealt with at an operational level, consistent with the current legislation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Portfolio investment entity processing errors Submissions (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A portfolio investment entity should be able to correct an error if the tax effect of the error is less than $500 in the next period in an income year without having to file a NOPA or a section 113 notice. Errors in excess of $500 should be subject to the normal rules for underpayment of tax in a period. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The error threshold should be 1 percent of the net tangible assets of the fund. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) Comment Officials note that tolerances for administrative errors are dealt with at an operational level. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 37 Issue: Resident investors should be required to advise the portfolio tax rate entity of a tax file number Submission (55 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) Section 28B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to require that all resident investors investing in a portfolio tax rate entity provide their tax file number to the entity. Comment Officials agree with the submission. As a consequential amendment, paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “portfolio investor rate” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act should be repealed. These amendments should apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Timeframe for providing information to zero-rated portfolio investors Submission (61 – KPMG) The timeframe for providing information to zero-rated portfolio investors should be specified in section 31B of the Tax Administration Act. Comment Section 31B does not fix a timeframe by which statements must be given to zero-rated investors. Officials agree with the submission that such a timeframe should be set. This could be achieved by removing the subsection (1) reference from section 31B(3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 38 Issue: Information relating to associates of investors Submission (55 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) Section 32D of the Tax Administration Act should be amended to allow portfolio investment entities to request information from investors about their associates, and to rely on the answers provided to them. Comment Officials note that section HL 9(6) already provides tolerance for associated persons who invest in portfolio investment entities, when the associated person has a portfolio investor interest fraction of less than 5 percent. Officials do not consider that further amendments are necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Provision of information by section HL 22 portfolio investment entities with non-standard balance dates Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 31B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to cater for section HL 22 portfolio tax rate entities with non-standard balance dates. Comment Section 31B of the Tax Administration Act deals with the provision of information by portfolio tax rate entities to their investors. Section 31B(3) sets a timeframe for the provision of this information. This provision does not currently cater for section HL 22 portfolio tax rate entities with non-standard balance dates. A provision similar to new section 57B(6)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (enacted by section 55 of the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007 should be inserted in section 31B(3) to cater for these taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 39 Issue: Returns by portfolio tax rate entities and section HL 23B payments Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to ensure that optional payments of tax made by portfolio tax rate entities under section HL 23B of the Income Tax Act 2004 are made with a return. Comment Section 57B of the Tax Administration Act deals with the provision of returns by portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies. Section 57B(3) should be amended to ensure that section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entities that make optional payments of tax under section HL 23B are also required to make a return with these payments. This could be achieved by inserting in section 57B(3)(a) a reference to the reduction of an investor’s interest referred to in section HL 23B(3)(b). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Changing December due date to 15 January Submission (Matter raised by officials) For a section HL 21 or section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entity, any due date for a return or payment which falls on 31 December should be changed to the following 15 January. Comment A number of provisions in the Inland Revenue Acts provide that if the due date for a return or payment falls on 31 December, that due date is changed to the following 15 January. To be consistent, if the due date for making a return or payment by a section HL 21 or section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entity falls on 31 December, that date should be changed to the following 15 January. The amendments would include inserting a reference to “by the following 15 January, if the month following the end of the portfolio calculation period is December” in sections HL 21(3)(b) and HL 23(2)(b). Similar amendments for return due dates should be made to sections 57B(1)(b) and (3)(a)(ii). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 40 Issue: Assessments for section HL 21 and section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entities Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to provide an assessment for section HL 21 and section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entities which have provided the tax returns required under section 57B. Comment An “assessment” is defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as “including an assessment of tax made under a tax law by a taxpayer or by the Commissioner”. The definition is a core one because it links with a number of important tax administration provisions such as the definition of “disputable decision”, section 108 (time-bar for amending assessments), section 109 (assessments deemed correct except in proceedings), section 113 (Commissioner’s power to amend assessments) and the disputes and challenge provisions in Parts IVA and VIIIA. The legislation does not currently provide for an assessment for a section HL 21 or section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entity. This gap in the law should be remedied. This could be achieved by inserting a provision in Part VI of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide that a section HL 21 or HL 23 portfolio tax rate entity that is required to furnish a tax return under section 57B must make an assessment in respect of those returns. Section 57B should be amended to provide that a return made under that section by a section HL 21 or section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entity must contain a notice of the assessment required under the corresponding provision in Part VI of the Tax Administration Act; this provision would be analogous to section 33(2). The references to “return” in section 57B should also be changed to “tax return”, consistent with the definition of “tax return” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 Issue: Section HL 22 portfolio tax rate entities should file tax returns Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to portfolio tax rate entities in section 33(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should not include section HL 22 portfolio tax rate entities. Comment Currently, all portfolio tax rate entities are excluded from the requirement to file income tax returns under section 33(1) of the Tax Administration Act. This exclusion should apply only to section HL 21 and section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entities, and not section HL 22 portfolio tax rate entities. This is a drafting error and should be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disclosure of portfolio investment entity status to portfolio investor proxies Submission (54 – ASB) Entities should be required to disclose their portfolio investment entity status when requested by a portfolio investor proxy. Comment Officials do not agree with the submission. The arguments for requiring a portfolio investor proxy to disclose its status to a portfolio investment entity do not apply the other way. In particular, there are already significant disclosure requirements applying to portfolio investment entities. Therefore it is not necessary to apply additional disclosure requirements on portfolio investment entities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Issue: Transitional tax payment by portfolio investment entity Submissions (54 – ASB, 61 – KPMG, 58 – Trustee Corporations Association) When an entity becomes a portfolio investment entity, its unrealised gains or losses are taxable, and any resulting tax liability must be paid over the next three years. The current legislation is unclear about when the tax must be paid each year. Rather than requiring the tax to be paid by the end of the relevant income year, the tax should be payable on or before the terminal tax date of that entity. (ASB) The legislation should state a due date (March 31) for these payments. (KPMG, Trustee Corporations Association) Comment Officials consider that the legislation already achieves a due date of 31 March for these payments. Officials note that the transitional rule for the tax liability resulting from an entity becoming a portfolio investment entity is already concessionary because the payment is spread over three tax years. The submission could result in a further deferral which is not justified. Recommendation That the submissions by KPMG and the Trustee Corporations Association be noted, and that ASB’s submission be declined. Issue: Imputation credits earned before entity was a portfolio investment entity Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 24 – AMP Financial Services and AMP Capital Investors, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A portfolio investment entity should be able to distribute the benefit of imputation credits to its investors, when those imputation credits arise from the entity’s tax obligations before it became a portfolio investment entity. 43 Comment Officials consider that the concern raised can be resolved by an amendment switching off imputation penalty tax resulting from the transition of entities into the portfolio investment entity rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application of FDR rules to funds with non-standard balance dates Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) A fund with a non-standard balance date that elects to become a portfolio investment entity on 1 October 2007 must apply the fair dividend rate (FDR) rules from 1 October 2007. The fund should be able to apply the FDR rules from 1 July 2007. Comment Officials consider that the current legislation would allow the fund referred to in the submission to apply the FDR rules from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Removal of penalties and interest when provisional tax increased as a result of becoming a portfolio investment entity Submission (Matter raised by officials) Portfolio investment entities with investments in other portfolio investment entities that are zero-rated and exempt from resident withholding tax may incur an increased provisional tax liability. Entities with a standard balance date that elect to become portfolio investment entities on 1 October 2007 would have had their first provisional tax payment due on 7 July 2007 so could not have prevented an underpayment. Portfolio investment entities may also have difficulty establishing the tax result for all investments to re-estimate the provisional tax liability in time for the second provisional tax instalment. 44 Penalties and interest should not be imposed in these circumstances. Section HL 13 should cater for circumstances where there is an increase in provisional tax for any income due directly to an entity becoming a portfolio investment entity in the income year. Comment Portfolio investment entities should not have penalties or interest imposed as a result of increases in provisional tax liability that arise from becoming a portfolio investment entity in the income year that the transition occurs. This relief should apply for provisional tax payments that have already been made for the income year in which the transition occurs, and any provisional payments falling due within two months of becoming a portfolio investment entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Share lending rules and deemed sale and reacquisition of Australian shares Submission (Matter raised by officials) The new share lending rules should be switched off for the purposes for the deemed sale and reacquisition of Australian equities rule in section HL 12(3) for entities transitioning into the portfolio investment entity rules. Comment Under section HL 12(3) there is a deemed sale and reacquisition of Australian shares held at the time an entity becomes a portfolio investment entity. This provision ensures that any gain or loss on Australian shares that are held on revenue account by entities becoming portfolio investment entities is realised at the time of entry into the PIE rules. Section HL 12(3) refers to “shares held by the entity”. This wording may not capture shares subject to share lending transactions whereby shares are lent shortly before an entity enters into the portfolio investment entity rules (the earliest date being 1 October 2007) and reacquired after that date. The share lending rules could prevent a tax liability arising for the intending portfolio investment entity. This is because the shares are not held by the intending portfolio investment entity on the transition date and therefore would not be caught by section HL 12(3). The share lending rules themselves would prevent there being a taxable event on the date the shares are lent and the Australasian share trading exclusion for portfolio investment entities in section CX 44C would still seem to apply when the relevant shares are eventually sold. 45 It is therefore necessary to amend section HL 12(3) to ensure that for the purposes of that provision any original share subject to a returning share transfer is treated as being held by the share supplier (that is, the intending portfolio investment entity) and not by the share user. The treatment of any dividend paid on the lent shares should continue unchanged – that is, the dividend would be taxable to the share user under ordinary rules with the replacement payment for dividends being deductible to the share user and taxable to the share supplier. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 46 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Definition of “investor” should refer to trust not trustee Submission (59 – Property Council of New Zealand) When shares in a company are held by a trust, it should be clear that it is the trust rather than the trustee that is the investor. Comment Officials consider that it is clear that the current definition of “investor” caters adequately for the situation when the shareholder in a company is a trustee. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Definition of “portfolio land company” Submission (61 – KPMG) The definition of “portfolio land company” requires that 90 percent of the company’s assets must be land assets and that this must be the case for 80 percent of the year. This requirement should have to be met for “at least” 80 percent of the year. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 47 Issue: Heading of section HL 27(8) Submission (61 – KPMG) In the heading to section HL 27(8), the reference to “portfolio investment entities” should be replaced by “portfolio tax rate entities”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cross-referencing error in section HL 27(10B) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to section HL 22 in section HL 27(10B) should be removed. Comment The reference to section HL 22 in section HL 27(10B) is a drafting error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Investor in a section HL 21 portfolio investment entity should recognise losses in their income year that includes the end of the PIE’s income year Submissions (Matter raised by officials) Section DB 43B should be amended to provide that an investor in an HL 21 portfolio investment entity recognises losses in the investor’s income year that includes the end of the PIE’s income year. 48 The reference to section HL 22 in section DB 43B(2) is an error and should be deleted. Comment Section DB 43B(2) provides that zero-rated and certain exiting investors in portfolio investment entities are generally allowed a tax deduction for losses that flow through to them from those PIEs. Currently, the provision requires investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 to recognise such losses in the investor’s income year that includes the end of the portfolio investment entity’s portfolio calculation period (usually a quarter). To maintain consistency with other similar provisions in the rules, section DB 43B should be amended to provide that the investor recognises these losses in the investor’s income year that includes the end of the portfolio investment entity’s income year. In addition, the reference to section HL 22 in section DB 43B(2) is an error and should be removed. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Drafting consistency with core provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) The following drafting amendments should be made to ensure that the portfolio investment entity rules interact correctly with the Income Tax Act’s core provisions and are consistent with the rewrite of that Act: • A provision should be inserted in subpart HL to ensure that the income tax liability of portfolio tax rate entities calculated under section HL 20 is schedular income for the purposes of the core provisions. • Subpart HL should be amended to ensure that the payment of tax by section HL 21 and section HL 23 portfolio tax rate entities satisfies the PIE’s income tax liability for the purposes of core provisions. • It should be clarified that portfolio class land losses should not be rebated, but should be carried forward to offset income in future periods. • Portfolio investment entity rebates for excess credits and losses should be excluded from the section OB 1 definition of allowable rebates. • For rebates payable to portfolio tax rate entities it should be clarified that the rebate is due to be paid by the Commissioner at the same time as tax would have been payable by the portfolio investment entity in the absence of a rebate. 49 • It should be clarified that credits refundable under the portfolio investment entity rules are not separately refundable under the core provisions. This could be achieved by an amendment to section HL 27(1), ensuring that section HL 27 overrides section BC 10. • It should be clarified that the timing rule in section HL 25 that allocates a portfolio investor allocated loss should be the same as the rule in section DB 43B. Comment These technical amendments are necessary to ensure that the portfolio investment entity rules interact with the core provisions correctly, and are consistent with the rewritten Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cross-referencing in section HL 27(11) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The references in section HL 27(11) to subsection (10B) should be replaced with subsection (10C) references. Comment This amendment corrects a cross-referencing error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 Issue: Tax year references Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to the entity’s “tax year” in section HL 7(3)(a)(ii) – relating to the investor return adjustment requirement – should be replaced with a reference to the entity’s “income year”. The reference to “in a tax year” in the opening wording of section 57B(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – requiring returns to be made by portfolio tax rate entities – should be replaced with “for a tax year”. Comment These amendments cater for non-standard balance date section HL 22 portfolio tax rate entities. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 51 Offshore portfolio share investment rules 53 OVERVIEW Clauses 13, 31, 60 to 65, 67 to 76, 93(2) and 165 New tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares were enacted by the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 on 18 December 2006. The new rules apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007. The new rules generally apply to an investment by a New Zealand resident in a foreign company when the investor owns less than 10 percent of the company. Under the new rules, offshore portfolio investment in shares is taxed consistently, regardless of the country where the investment is located and whether the investment is made by an individual directly or through a collective investment vehicle. The new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares mainly involve changes to the foreign investment fund rules in the Income Tax Act 2004. The main changes are that the “grey list” exemption in the foreign investment fund rules has been removed and a new fair dividend rate method – which broadly taxes 5 percent of a person’s offshore share portfolio’s opening value each year – has been introduced. The bill makes a number of remedial amendments to the new rules, consistent with their policy intent. A number of submissions were received on the remedial amendments and some other technical aspects of the new offshore portfolio share investment tax rules. The changes recommended are of a remedial nature and ensure that the new rules achieve their intended policy effect. 54 MINIMUM THRESHOLD Issue: $50,000 minimum threshold and exemption changes Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA supports the clarifying amendments which will ensure that the deemed disposition and reacquisition that occurs when there is a change in application of exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules are ignored for the purposes of the $50,000 minimum threshold rules in sections CQ 5 and DN 6. The amendments ensure that the original cost basis applies. However, NZICA considers that similar clarifying amendments are required to the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment Officials agree that a similar clarifying amendment should be made for the purposes of the $50,000 minimum threshold rule in section CG 15(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994. However, because the time-bar will prevent assessments made under the Income Tax Act 1976 being reopened, it is not necessary to amend that earlier Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Election out of the $50,000 minimum threshold Submission (54 – ASB) Natural persons should be able to elect not to apply the $50,000 minimum threshold in section CQ 5 therefore subjecting all their overseas equity investments to the foreign investment fund rules. This will allow investors who hold overseas investments of around $50,000 and who flip into and out of the foreign investment fund rules to reduce the complexity of their tax affairs by being able to apply a foreign investment fund method consistently to all their offshore investments each income year. Comment If the original cost of an individual’s offshore shares totals NZ$50,000 or less at all times in an income year, the foreign investment fund rules do not apply for that year. The individual investor will continue to pay tax only on dividends if they hold the shares on capital account. This $50,000 minimum threshold is a general rule and is not elective. 55 To make the $50,000 minimum threshold elective would considerably increase the complexity of the foreign investment fund rules. It is desirable to keep the foreign investment fund rules as straightforward as possible. Any election mechanism such as that proposed is also difficult to track by both investors and Inland Revenue for elections that were made many years previously. The foreign investment fund rules should be as certain in their application as possible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Minimum threshold amount Submission (54 – ASB) The submission notes that the current minimum threshold amount of $50,000 has remained unchanged for a number of years. Increasing this threshold to $100,000 at which the more complex foreign investment fund rules begin to apply to investments would reduce the compliance costs for natural persons. Comment The submission to increase the amount of minimum threshold for the application of the foreign investment fund rules from the current $50,000 to $100,000 is outside the scope of the bill. Officials note that the submission’s proposed increase of the threshold to $100,000 is significant and would undermine a core objective of the recent tax reforms for offshore portfolio investment in shares, which was to remove the previous distortion between investing directly in offshore shares and investing through New Zealand resident managed funds (managed funds are not entitled to the minimum threshold for application of the foreign investment fund rules). A modest minimum threshold, such as the current $50,000 threshold, can be justified on compliance cost grounds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 AUSTRALIAN SHARES EXEMPTION Issue: Listing requirement in Australian shares exemption Submissions (23 – ISI, 55 – NZ Funds, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74 – Deloitte) All the tests in proposed section EX 33C(2) for determining whether a company falls within the Australian shares exemption should be applied at the first unit valuation period in an income year for a unit valuer that is a portfolio tax rate entity. Alternatively, any breaches of the requirements should be applied to only future periods for unit valuers that are portfolio tax rate entities. (ISI) The test for whether an Australian share is listed on an approved index should apply in either of the following ways: • the test for applying the exemption is on the first day of the income year for all taxpayers; or • taxpayers who do not apply a daily valuation are not liable to use-of-money interest or late payment penalties if the status of the Australian company changes. If a share is not listed on an approved index on the first day of the income year, the taxpayer will assume the foreign investment fund exclusion does not apply and will pay tax under the fair dividend rate method. If, at any time during the income year that share moves onto the exempt list, then the taxpayer would be required to treat the investment outside of the foreign investment fund rules. Accordingly, they will be required to file and pay tax (or DWP) based on the dividends received. At its extreme, a share could become exempt towards the end of the income year. In this case, the taxpayer may have paid incorrect provisional tax or failed to meet its DWP liability during the year. (Deloitte) The listing requirement in proposed section EX 33C(2)(b) should be expanded to cater for the circumstance where the investment is acquired for the first time in an income year. The listing requirement should then be tested at the date of acquisition for unit valuers and any other persons applying the fair dividend rate method on a daily basis. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section EX 33C(2)(b)(ii) should be amended to provide that the time referred to in the provision should be the “first day of the first unit valuation period”. (NZ Funds) 57 Comment Investments in Australian-resident companies listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), such as the All Ordinaries index, are exempt from the foreign investment fund rules. To assist compliance with this exemption, in section EX 33C the current requirement that Australian-resident companies must be included in an approved ASX index at all times during the income year is amended by the bill so that the listing requirement is tested at the start of the income year for managed funds such as portfolio tax rate entities. It is the listing requirement in the Australian exemption that in practice is more likely to change in relation to a specific company than in any of the other requirements. Officials do not consider it is worthwhile increasing the complexity of the Australian shares exemption rules in the case of the non-listing requirements which are much less subject to change than the listing requirement for a particular company. The bill provides that for persons who do not do daily valuations, the Australian shares exemption will apply for the whole of the income year if that share was exempt under section EX 33C at any time in the income year. This proposed change was designed to ensure that the Australian shares exemption would apply for an income year if a company that was listed on the ASX All Ordinaries index at the beginning of the year is omitted from the index during the year. However, the Deloitte submission raises a valid concern in relation to the situation when a company is added to the approved index during the year. Officials therefore support the proposal that the test for determining whether shares are listed on an approved index is on the first day of the income year for all taxpayers. However, as the PricewaterhouseCoopers submission contends, there should be an additional criterion applying for the situation when a person acquires shares in a company during the income year and did not previously hold any shares in that company in that year. In this case, the test should be whether the company’s shares were listed on an approved index on the day of acquisition. This is because the person would probably have based their decision on the status of the company at the date they acquired shares in it and they should not be expected to ascertain the listing status of the company at the beginning of their income year when they did not hold any shares in the company. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 58 Issue: Election to use the foreign investment fund rules for all Australian shares Submission (54 – ASB) Investors should be able to elect that their Australian shares – which are currently covered by the exemption for investments in certain Australian-resident listed companies in section EX 33C – are instead subject to the foreign investment fund rules. This election would require investors to apply the foreign investment fund rules to all their Australian shares in every income year. The submission considers that the current exemption may complicate some investors’ tax affairs as they will need to review their Australian investments on a regular basis to determine whether the foreign investment fund rules will apply to those investments as there will be regular amendments to the securities which are included on an approved ASX index. Comment The current exemption for investments in certain Australian-resident listed companies is currently not elective. Making this exemption elective would increase the complexity of the foreign investment fund rules. Officials consider it desirable that the Australian exemption be kept as straightforward and certain as possible. Another reason for not introducing an election mechanism is that it can become difficult for both investors and Inland Revenue to track elections that were made many years ago. To assist compliance with the Australian-resident company exemption, the bill contains an amendment that will make it easier to satisfy the requirement that the company must be listed on an approved ASX index. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of Australian shares exemption Submission (58 – Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand) The changes to the foreign investment fund exemption for shares in certain listed Australian companies in section EX 33C should be effective from the date of enactment rather than from 1 April 2007. In the role of corporate trustees, members may not have authority to approve systems changes for which there is no legislative authority, albeit in the knowledge of pending legislation which would have retrospective effect. 59 Comment Officials consider it is preferable for all the amendments to the new foreign investment fund rules to have the same application date – that is, 1 April 2007. We understand that a number of unit valuers would prefer that the new rules for the listing requirements for unit valuers (the first valuation period for the income year) apply from the beginning of the new foreign investment fund rules – that is, 1 April 2007. In any event, it is unlikely that the result for unit valuers would be different whether the new listing requirement rule is effective from 1 April 2007 or from the enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Publishing an approved Australian share list Submission (54 – ASB) The Commissioner should be required to publish a quarterly list of approved Australian equities that are exempted from the foreign investment fund rules. Publication should be required by the 20 th of the month immediately following the end of a quarter. The list would reduce the compliance burden on investors and minimise the risk that investors will incorrectly classify their Australian equity investments. Comment Officials do not support the proposal that Inland Revenue be required to publish a binding list of companies on a quarterly basis that qualify for the exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for investments in certain Australian-resident listed companies. Under the previous grey list exemption in the offshore tax rules, investors were required to ascertain whether a foreign company was resident in one of the eight grey list countries and Inland Revenue never published a list of companies qualifying for this exemption. This self-assessment approach should continue with the Australian-listed company exemption. Officials consider that there is a reasonable level of awareness in the marketplace about the current scope of the Australian-listed company exemption. In particular, a number of stock broking firms and financial advisors have compiled lists of specific companies whose shares qualify for the current Australian exemption. 60 Generally a New Zealand investor who receives a franked dividend from a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) All Ordinaries index will be entitled to the Australian-listed company exemption. The list of companies on the ASX All Ordinaries index can be easily accessed online. Inland Revenue publications contain a link to the relevant website. When investors who hold an interest in a company that is listed on the ASX All Ordinaries index receive their dividend statement, it will say whether or not the dividend is franked. It should therefore be relatively easy to self- assess this exemption. A foreign company listed on the ASX All Ordinaries index, such as James Hardie Industries, is not permitted to maintain an Australian franking account. A New Zealand investor will not receive a franked dividend from such a company and therefore will know that the exemption does not apply to that investment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 61 VENTURE CAPITAL EXEMPTION Submissions (41 – New Zealand Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The venture capital exemption in the new foreign investment fund rules should be expanded to cover all venture capital investments. After consultation with officials, it is alternatively submitted that the existing exemption should be extended in the following ways: • The “business”, rather than the “company”, must have been in operation in New Zealand for at least 12 months pre-migration. Additional criteria to allow a venture capital investment to qualify for the exemption should be added. These include: • that 25 percent of a migrated company’s expenditure is incurred, or 25 percent of its employees engaged, through the currently required fixed establishment in New Zealand; • that the fixed establishment in New Zealand incurs no less expenditure, or engages no fewer employees than in the year immediately before the company’s migration; • if the company has received seed or venture capital equity investment through New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Limited. Comment Officials support an exemption in the offshore portfolio share tax rules for investments in New Zealand start-up companies that migrate offshore to gain access to finance. This covers situations where an investor has invested in a New Zealand firm, and although the firm has had to migrate to access more capital, is still essentially a firm based in New Zealand. The exemption is justified on the basis that venture capital investments do not compete with investment via New Zealand managed funds. Importantly, it also fits within the wider principle underlying the FIF rules, which is to treat all domestic portfolio investments alike, and to treat all offshore portfolio investments alike, thus minimising tax distortions on investment decisions. The criteria that need to be met to qualify for and keep the exemption were designed accordingly, in consultation with members of the venture capital industry. Officials consider that generally, the criteria currently in place are consistent with the policy intent of the exemption. However, we also agree with some of the submission proposals. These are discussed below. 62 Officials recognise that expansion of one criterion, and the addition of two new criteria would make the exemption more accessible to venture capital in some circumstances, in accordance with the policy intent of the exemption. The following proposed changes have been developed in consultation with the venture capital industry, and officials note that although NZVCA agrees with these proposals, its overall view is that venture capital investments should be exempt from the FIF rules because of the merits of venture capital, and that it should be enough that a firm started in New Zealand, and falls within a venture capital definition. “Business” versus “company” One of the criteria that must be satisfied for a firm to qualify for the exemption is that it must be a company, or own a company, that for 12 months or more was resident in New Zealand with more than 50 percent of its assets in New Zealand. This does not currently accommodate situations where start-ups have been operating for 12 months or more, but have not been incorporated for that long, or that have restructured pre- migration. Officials therefore propose legislative changes to sections EX 33(3)(d) and EX 33(4)(d) that will put the focus on the business carried on by the migrated firm in the 12 months before migration. As well as being a more robust test than the current “company resident” test, the changes will ensure that the policy intent of the exemption operates effectively. 25 percent of expenditure or employees in New Zealand One of the criteria that must be satisfied for the exemption to apply is that the migrated company must have a fixed establishment in New Zealand. Currently, the company must, through the fixed establishment, either incur expenditure of at least $1 million or engage no fewer than 10 full-time employees or contractors at all times in the year. Officials agree that there should be an additional criterion added to the “fixed establishment” requirements. It will allow the exemption to apply if the company, through the fixed establishment, incurs at least 25 percent of its expenditure or has at least 25 percent of its employees in New Zealand. This change would be of particular benefit to smaller start-ups that may have trouble satisfying the $1 million or 10 employee requirements. Expenditure/number of employees must be no less than in year before migration The submission proposes an additional criterion to the “fixed establishment” requirements. This would be that the exemption would apply as long as the fixed establishment’s expenditure and/or number of employees were no less than in the year before migration. Officials believe that there is significant risk that this test could be easily manipulated simply for a tax advantage, and therefore do not recommend this proposal be accepted. 63 NZVIF-specific exemption Officials agree with the proposal for a specific exemption for New Zealand residents that co-invest with the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund. Extending an exemption to New Zealand residents that co-invest with the VIF (and not prescribing a level of New Zealand connection) poses less revenue risk than extending a similar exemption to all New Zealand-resident venture capital investors, and the vetting of investments by the NZVIF provides a degree of assurance that the company will keep its connection with New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 64 OTHER EXEMPTIONS Issue: Australian unit trusts exemption Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Statutory protection should be available for investors that use the exemption for investments in unit trusts in section EX 33D. The tax outcome for investors relying on a statement from the unit trust manager that an investment in the trust is entitled to the section EX 33D exemptions could be: • No reassessment of past years’ returns, or no additional tax liability on any foreign investment fund income that would otherwise have arisen if the trust does not ultimately qualify. • The assessment of any foreign investment fund income tax arrears (plus use-of- money interest and any penalties, if applicable) be made to the unit trust manager/RWT proxy responsible. • At the very least, there should be no use-of-money interest or penalty implications if there is an increase in tax liability. Comment Officials consider that if an investment in an Australian unit trust does not qualify for the specific exemption for such investments in section EX 33D, then the same treatment should apply when the requirements in other exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules are not satisfied. Namely, the offshore investment would be subject to the foreign investment fund rules with the new fair dividend rate method probably being applicable. There is no policy basis for treating this exemption differently from other exemptions from the foreign investment fund rules, such as shares in Australian-listed companies. It would not be practical or appropriate to make the Australian unit trust manager responsible for any use-of-money interest or penalties if the investment does not in fact qualify for the exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 Issue: Employee share purchase scheme exemption Submission: (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to the value of the shares in an employee share purchase scheme being affected by a restriction on the disposal of the shares should be removed so that new section EX 33(5)(f) simply refers to a restriction on the disposal of the shares. Even though the amendment removes the current reference to section CE 3, which imposes an eight-year restriction on the disposal of shares, it is arguable that reference is still required back to that section in valuing the benefit to the person under a share purchase agreement. Comment Officials agree with the submission’s proposal to remove the reference to the value of the shares in an employee share purchase scheme being affected by a restriction on the disposal of the shares. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 66 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE METHOD Issue: Restrictions on using the fair dividend rate method Submissions (55 – NZ Funds, 61 – KPMG, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section EX 40(9)(d) is unworkable in its current form. For example, what is a “debt instrument” in this context? What type of “arrangement” is envisaged and what is meant by “economic effect”? Proposed section EX 40(9)(d) should be redrafted to better target the mischief at which it is aimed. In particular: • The requirement to consider the economic effect of an arrangement should be removed, or the arrangement limited to transactions undertaken by the offshore fund, or an associate of offshore fund, to which the investor would apply the fair dividend rate method. • A safe harbour should be introduced to require taxpayers to consider an indirect investment only if they invest more than 50 percent of their assets in, and hold more than 50 percent of, the investment vehicle through which that indirect investment is held. • Section EX 40(9) should be amended to replace “debt instrument” with “a financial arrangement that provides funds to the issuer” to align the text with the definition of debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. • Clause 64(4) is too wide in its scope. In particular, what is meant by assets “directly or indirectly” – how wide is that intended to be? What is the mischief intended to be covered by these words? What is meant by being “part of an arrangement having an economic effect” as if the instrument were denominated in New Zealand dollars? What investments of the foreign entity (which has a New Zealand investor) should be taken into account? When is the provision meant to be tested by the New Zealand investor? Given the scope of the proposed provision and its uncertainties, there will be an upturn in applications for determinations from the Commissioner. With the current costs and significant time delays in the taxpayer rulings unit in the office of the Chief Tax Counsel (which is where we assume such determinations will be managed), and the logistical difficulties that unit faces on its current workload, we wonder about that unit’s capacity to deal with this issue. This provision in its current form – section EX 40(8)(a)(iii) – should be repealed and any amendments not be proceeded with because the express purpose of this provision is covered by other provisions, in particular, current section EX 40(9). 67 Proposed section EX 40(9)(d) should be amended from an operative provision to an anti-avoidance provision to more accurately reflect its nature and purpose. Comment Officials do not agree that the wording of proposed section EX 40(9)(d) – which prevents the fair dividend rate method being used for certain investments – is generally too wide and uncertain. Proposed section EX 40(9(d) is part of, and consistent with, the general policy that the fair dividend rate method cannot be used for guaranteed return-type investments. The policy intent is that the fair dividend rate method should not be used for investments which are, in substance, debt investments designed to achieve a return higher than the fair dividend rate of 5 percent. These guaranteed return-type investments should be subject to full taxation under the comparative value method. Officials agree with submissions that the reference to “debt instruments” in proposed section EX 40(9)(d) should be replaced with a reference to “financial arrangements that provide funds to the issuer”. This is because “financial arrangements”, being a defined term, has greater certainty of meaning than “debt instrument”, which is not defined. Officials consider that proposed section EX 40(9)(d) is generally sufficiently targeted at the mischief at which it is directed. However, officials agree with the part of the submission that notes that the current wording may not be effective in situations where an investment in financial arrangements denominated in foreign currency is hedged back to New Zealand dollars and that hedging is 80 percent or more effective. As currently drafted, the provision would require 80 percent of the fund’s assets to be fully hedged to give the same effect as if the instrument were in New Zealand currency. Officials would therefore support an amendment to ensure that the provision prevents the fair dividend rate method being applied to an investment where foreign financial arrangements are hedged back to New Zealand dollars and that hedging is at least 80 percent effective. Officials also consider that the assets of the non-resident that are taken into account under proposed section EX 40(9)(d) should include fixed rate shares as well as financial arrangements because such instruments are equivalent to debt. It is appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account the whole arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements, in ascertaining whether the investment in a foreign entity provides investors with a return similar to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt, which is the basic policy objective underlying access to the fair dividend rate method. If the test looking at the proportion of the foreign entity’s assets that comprise debt considered only the first tier foreign entity, it would be quite easy to circumvent this test by interposing another foreign company between the New Zealand investors and the foreign company holding the financial arrangements. 68 The proposal to require taxpayers to consider an indirect investment only if they invest more than 50 percent of their assets in, and hold more than 50 percent of, the investment vehicle through which that indirect investment is held would mean that the provision would not be effective in many cases where it should be. The reference to “an arrangement having an economic effect” as if the instrument were denominated in New Zealand dollars is designed to take into account situations where derivatives such as swaps and forward currency contracts are used so that even though the underlying financial arrangements may not be denominated in New Zealand dollars, they are hedged to achieve the effect of New Zealand dollars. Some submissions considered that the wording of the current provision would be difficult to apply in practice and, in particular, that the reference to “arrangement” is very broad and could apply to hedging undertaken outside of the offshore fund. Officials consider that it is necessary to take into account hedging arranged outside of the offshore fund itself because the provision could be too readily circumvented if it only considered hedging undertaken by the offshore entity in which the New Zealand taxpayer has invested. A submission also suggested that hedging undertaken at the New Zealand investor level should not be within the ambit of the arrangement contemplated by the proposed section EX 40(9)(d). Officials do not agree with this view because even though the hedging arrangement would be within the New Zealand tax base, it is still appropriate to subject the offshore investment to the comparative value method as that would produce a similar result if the investor had invested directly in a New Zealand dollar denominated financial arrangement. The test in proposed section EX 40(9)(d) would have to be satisfied for each income year, and not just at the commencement of the arrangement. The Commissioner’s power to make determinations that the fair dividend rate method may or may not be used for a particular type of investment has been delegated to the Deputy Commissioner, Policy. Applications for these determinations will therefore be managed by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue rather than the office of the Chief Tax Counsel. It is not correct that the function of current section EX 40(8)(a)(iii) or proposed section EX 40(9)(d) is already covered by current section EX 40(9). The latter provision targets investments which involve an effectively non-contingent obligation to return an amount to the investor that exceeds the issue price of the investment. However, a limitation on this provision is that it may not apply to the standard bond fund situation where a New Zealander makes a portfolio investment in a foreign company that invests in high-yield debt. The obligation to return an amount to the investor that exceeds the issue price of the investment is in fact owed by the debt issuer to the foreign company rather than by the debt issuer to the New Zealand investor. It is therefore necessary to have a provision like the current section EX 40(8)(a)(iii) to ensure that such investments are in fact excluded from the fair dividend rate method. 69 Officials are not in favour of replacing substantive provisions such as proposed section EX 40(9)(d) with “anti-avoidance provisions” because in this circumstance it would result in more uncertainty than the current objective rule. Recommendation That proposed section EX 40(9)(d) be amended so the assets of the non-resident taken into account are financial arrangements providing funds to the issuer and fixed rate shares. The provision should also be amended to ensure that it applies to an investment where financial arrangements or fixed rate shares denominated in foreign currency are hedged back to New Zealand currency and that hedging is at least 80 percent effective. The other submissions should be declined. Issue: Drafting of the restrictions on the use of the fair dividend rate method Submission (85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Clause 64(3) is unnecessary and should not be proceeded with. The clause does not amend anything in the current provisions, and simply reinserts the same language into a new provision. We are concerned with endless tinkering to this important regime which has only just recently been passed and the added confusion that arises for taxpayers. This is particularly the case where no amendments are being made at all; just a reordering of existing matters. As an alternative, the opening words to clause 64(3) should be more clearly drafted. Comment Officials consider that the new provisions in the bill concerning restrictions on the use of the fair dividend rate method – proposed section EX 40(8)(a) and (9) – are clearer than the current provisions. In particular, the types of interests for which the fair dividend rate method cannot be used are now listed in a single subsection – proposed section EX 40(9) – instead of being spread over two provisions as they are currently. The opening wording of proposed section EX 40(9) will be amended to make it more helpful for readers. The provisions referring to the making of positive and negative determinations that the fair dividend rate method may be or may not be used for a type of investment are now more clearly separated into separate subsections: proposed section EX 40(8)(a) and EX 40(9)(a). Currently, the power to make positive and negative determinations is contained in the same subsection – existing section EX 40(8). Officials therefore consider that the reordering of the provisions governing the use of the fair dividend rate method is a worthwhile improvement on the current provisions. 70 It is also not correct that the new provisions do not amend anything in current sections EX 40(8)(a) and EX 40(9). The Commissioner’s power to make a positive determination that the fair dividend rate method may be used for a type of interest (even though the specific restrictions in the legislation in proposed section EX 40(9) may not otherwise allow it to be used) is considerably widened under the bill. Currently, the Commissioner can only make such a positive determination in relation to non-contingent obligation-type interests that would otherwise not qualify for the fair dividend rate method (existing section EX 40(8)(a)(iv)). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Commissioner’s power to make a determination on the use of the fair dividend rate method Submissions (20 – Bell Gully, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 54 – ASB, 55 – NZ Funds, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74 – Deloitte, 85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The amendment widening the Commissioner’s power to make determinations on who can use the fair dividend rate method by removing the determination-making criteria in section 91AAO(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is strongly opposed. The amendment offends the principles of fairness and certainty. Essentially the Commissioner could determine at any time whether the fair dividend rate method can be used without regard to any statutory or other objectively prescribed criteria. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal to repeal section 91AAO(2) should be reconsidered, or at a minimum a requirement be imposed upon the Commissioner to publish formal guidance on the factors Inland Revenue will consider when issuing determinations. This guidance could be in the form of standard practice statements or regulations. (ASB) Some restrictions should be placed on the Commissioner’s determination-making power and that taxpayers be provided with some guidance on the type of determinations being applied. (Bell Gully) The Society disagrees with the proposed repeal of section 91AAO(2), though it accepts that an alternative might be to amend it. In particular, the amendment should require the Commissioner to focus on whether or not a foreign investment fund interest is economically equivalent to a New Zealand dollar denominated debt instrument in making a determination on whether taxpayers can use the fair dividend rate method. (New Zealand Law Society) 71 Section EX 40(9) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to provide that determinations made by the Commissioner are product-specific instead of the “interest-type” approach used in the current legislation. (NZ Funds) Comment Clause 165 of the bill would remove the determination-making criteria for use of the fair dividend rate method in section 91AAO(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amendment would effectively widen the Commissioner’s power to determine when the fair dividend rate method can or cannot be used for a type of investment. For example, if the Commissioner considers that the compliance costs of applying the fair dividend rate method to an investment would be higher than is appropriate and that not applying the method would not pose a revenue risk, the Commissioner can make a determination that the fair dividend rate method may not be used for that investment. A problem with the current determination-making criteria in section 91AAO(2) is that it is not clear that the current criteria are inclusive only and are not intended to preclude other relevant factors being taken into account by the Commissioner. The determination-making process for the fair dividend rate method is intended to provide sufficient flexibility to deal with cases close to the boundary. The current criteria – that attempt to define what is an in-substance equity investment – seem to provide little useful guidance. Officials agree that it would be preferable to have some statutory criteria that more accurately reflect the factors that should be taken into account when a determination is made if it is clear that these criteria are inclusive only and do not restrict the flexibility of the determination-making process to deal with cases close to the boundary. It is therefore proposed that the determination-making criteria in section 91AAO(2) be replaced with a rule that says that the criteria that the Commissioner may take into account in making a determination include: • The fair dividend rate method should not be used for investments which are economically equivalent to New Zealand dollar denominated debt, taking into account the whole arrangement, including any interposed entities or financial arrangements. • Whether substantial equity and foreign exchange risk has been removed under the relevant arrangement. • The proportion of the foreign entity’s assets that comprise debt or other fixed return instruments (such as fixed rate shares). • The extent to which the entity’s investments are denominated in New Zealand currency or the extent to which the exchange rate risk has been removed by the use of financial derivatives. • Compliance costs. 72 The legislation currently provides that the Commissioner may determine that the fair dividend rate method can or cannot be used for a type of investment. Officials would not be in favour of changing this “interest-type” approach to a product-specific approach as this could significantly increase compliance and administration costs of the fair dividend rate method determination process for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. A product-specific approach would seem to require taxpayers, if they wanted certainty, to seek new determinations when there were only inconsequential changes to a particular product for which a determination has been made or a current product is simply reissued on the same terms. Officials therefore consider that the current interest-type approach to fair dividend rate method determinations should be retained. Recommendation That the submissions supporting the replacement of current section 91AAO(2) be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Commissioner’s power to make positive determinations that the fair dividend rate method can be used Submission (61 – KPMG) Section 91AAO(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be clarified to allow Inland Revenue to issue a positive determination confirming that an investment in a fund is subject to the fair dividend rate method, without first establishing that section EX 40(9) applies. Comment Officials consider that the provisions in the bill – in particular, proposed section EX 40(8)(a)(i) would already allow the Commissioner to make a positive determination that the fair dividend rate method can be used for a type of investment. For such a positive determination to be made it is not necessary that the investment would otherwise fail to qualify for the fair dividend rate method under section EX 40(9). Recommendation That the submission be noted. 73 Issue: Application date of Commissioner’s power to make a determination on the use of the fair dividend rate method Submissions (14 – Liontamer, 15 – Macquarie, 20 – Bell Gully, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 83 – Public Trust) The bill’s extension of the Commissioner’s determination-making powers over when the fair dividend rate method can or cannot be used for a type of investment is supported. However, a further amendment is required to section 91AAO(2) of the Tax Administration Act to allow a determination to be effective from the beginning of the income year in which the determination is made, when this is chosen by the taxpayer, by completing their income tax return for that period. Alternatively, this retrospective application should apply automatically when the applicant (normally the foreign investment fund) so requests. If the taxpayer does not elect to use the method from the beginning of the income year in which the determination is made, the determination should apply by default from the beginning of the following income year. Comment Section 91AAO(2) provides that a determination made by the Commissioner – that the fair dividend rate method can or cannot be used for a type of investment – applies generally on a prospective basis only. Officials agree with the submission that a determination should apply from the beginning of the income year in which the determination is made if the taxpayer elects this by completing their income tax return for that period. This amendment will allow for the more efficient application of the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. In particular, it takes into account that the new determination- making powers are not likely to be enacted until part-way through the 2007–08 income year. The proposed amendment will allow any determination made after the enactment of these provisions and before the end of the 2007–08 income year to apply from the beginning of that year at the discretion of the taxpayer. Officials do not consider it is necessary for the application date provision in section 91AAO(2) to provide that if the taxpayer does not elect to apply the determination from the beginning of the income year in which the determination is made, the determination will apply by default from the beginning of the following income year. Section 91AAO(2) already provides that a determination may be made for tax years that are specified in the determination but may not apply to a taxpayer for a date before the date of the determination. The Commissioner has stated in the Tax Information Bulletin of April 2007 that the general application-date policy for determinations is that they will apply from the start of the tax year beginning after the making of the determination. It is only when investments have been designed to circumvent the restrictions on the use of the fair dividend rate method that they may apply from the date they are made. Officials therefore consider that the current provision already contains the necessary flexibility. We also consider that the part of section 91AAO(2) providing an exception to the general prospective date rule (when the taxpayer would be subject to a shortfall penalty in respect of the investment that is 74 affected by the determination) should be omitted in order to streamline and simplify the application-date provision for determinations. Officials consider that the current wording of section EX 40(8)(b) would not prevent a taxpayer who does not elect to apply a determination from the beginning of the income year in which it is made, from using the fair dividend rate method for other offshore portfolio share investments. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Quick sales formula Submission (54 – ASB) The quick sale formula should be clarified to allow the amount of dividend income received included in the quick sale compilation to be calculated on a pro rata basis using the following formula: Total dividends received Total shares purchased/sold Quick sales dividend = during the income year x Peak holding of shares The above formula should be an additional option to the current method permitted by the legislation, which requires the amount of dividends received on the shares bought and sold during the period to be included. Comment Officials consider that the pro rata approach under the suggested formula is already permitted in working out the quick sale gains under section EX 44C. An example of this approach is contained in the Tax Information Bulletin (April 2007) article on the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 75 Issue: Allowing non-unit valuers to calculate for each interest on a daily basis Submissions (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 36 – Infratil) Non-unit valuers should have the option to calculate their fair dividend rate income for each attributing interest on a daily basis. This calculation would be based on opening value, or in the year of acquisition, the cost of the investment. If a person elected to use this daily method for any foreign portfolio investment, they would have to use this method for all their foreign portfolio investments, including in subsequent years. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Infratil) At a minimum, the daily market value method allowed for non-unit valuers in the bill should only be applied to interests in foreign companies which are sold and purchased during the year and not to other investments. In years when there has been no sale or acquisition of the foreign company, the taxpayer should be able to simply use the opening value to determine their fair dividend rate income. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials note that the fair dividend rate method was developed in part to address the concerns that people had with the complexity of other foreign investment fund calculation methods. It is an accepted feature of the standard fair dividend rate method that in years of acquisition or sale of an interest in a foreign company the method does not produce a result that is as accurate as a method that calculates foreign investment fund income for each day of the income year. The standard fair dividend rate method involves a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. The aspect of the method that focuses on the opening market value only for non-unit valuers is an example of simplicity being chosen over accuracy. Officials acknowledge that for larger, more sophisticated taxpayers that are not unit valuers, it may be desirable to have a fair dividend rate method option that produces a more accurate result in years of acquisition and sale. However, more work needs to be done in developing such a daily apportionment method before it could be considered for adoption. For example, rules would need to be developed to deal with shares in a foreign company that are bought and sold during the same year (referred to in the legislation as “quick sales”). In particular, it would seem to be necessary to trace such shares including their particular cost and acquisition date, and apply an accounting rule to subsequent sales if there were earlier multiple acquisitions of the same stock. Rules would also need to be developed for requiring consistency of use of particular fair dividend rate calculation methods both within a year and over subsequent years. For example, it would not be appropriate for persons to use the standard fair dividend rate method for acquisitions (resulting in no tax in the year of acquisition) while using the daily apportionment method for sales (resulting in less tax than under the standard method). It would also be necessary to have rules and systems for tracking elections over a large number of years. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 76 Issue: Returning share transfers and the fair dividend rate method Submission (85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The references to “returning share transfer” in proposed section EX 44B(4) should be replaced by references to “share lending arrangements” and the bill clarified that the share user will not be subject to income tax under the foreign investment fund rules in respect of an original share that is acquired under a share-lending arrangement. Comment The proposed amendment treating a share supplier in a returning share transfer as holding the original shares for all fair dividend rate purposes is considered necessary to protect the tax base against arrangements whereby shares could be lent by residents to non-residents shortly before 1 April each year and reacquired after 1 April to avoid the foreign investment fund rules. It is necessary for the proposed amendment to refer to a “returning share transfer” instead of “share-lending arrangements” because the latter term is more narrow and effectively applies only on a self-selection basis. Because this would mean that the amendment would no longer achieve its base protection objective, officials do not support the submission’s proposed change. Officials consider that the effect of the current wording of the proposed amendment is that the share user will not be subject to the fair dividend rate method in respect of an original share that is acquired under a returning share transfer. However, officials agree it should be clarified that this is the case and that the foreign investment fund rules generally do not apply to a share user in respect of an original share. Although the share supplier should be treated as holding the original share for all foreign investment fund rule purposes, the share user should still derive any dividend paid on the original share. Therefore proposed section EX 44B(5)(b) should be omitted. Recommendation That the submission concerning the treatment of the share user be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 77 COST METHOD Issue: Transitional rule Submissions (32 – New Zealand Superannuation Fund, 74 – Deloitte) The cost method in section EX 45B should be amended to permit a taxpayer to use their actual cost (and not be required to seek an independent valuation) if the person acquired their interests within 24 months of the transition into the cost method before the start of the 2007–08 income year. The requirement to obtain independent valuation for all attributing interests in a foreign investment fund that fall within the cost method is unduly costly for affected taxpayers. It is accepted that it may not be appropriate to allow what could be a very old historical cost to be used as the opening value. However, this should not be extended to interests acquired in a period immediately before the introduction of these new provisions. Comment Officials agree that it would be appropriate on compliance-cost grounds to allow taxpayers to use their actual cost for their opening value, instead of acquiring an independent valuation, for interests acquired in the 24-month period before the start of the 2007–08 income year, which is the first income year for the application of the cost method in the foreign investment fund rules. This rule could be included in the definition of “opening value” in section EX 45B(4) (before current paragraph (b) concerning independent valuations). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 78 Issue: Definition of “opening value” Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission supports the amendment in the bill expanding the definition of “opening value” in section EX 45B(4) but seeks a further expansion to allow investors to use the actual cost price of interests for measuring opening value for the purposes of calculating foreign investment fund income in the second year of holding the interest, if those interests were acquired in the previous income year. Comment Officials note that the definition of “opening value” – in particular, section EX 45B(4)(d) – already allows the tax treatment that the submission is seeking. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 79 GENERAL FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND ISSUES Issue: Interest in grey list company falling below 10 percent during an income year Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If a 10 percent or more holding in a grey list company falls below 10 percent during the year, there should be no foreign investment fund income in that year. In particular, the definition of “opening” in sections EX 44C(4) and EX 44D(4) should be amended to deem opening market value to be zero in the case of an interest in a grey list company that falls below 10 percent during the period. Comment Officials agree that in the case of a 10 percent or more interest in a grey list company that falls below 10 percent after the start of an income year, and the fair dividend rate method can be applied to that interest in that year, that there should be no foreign investment fund income in that year. This would be consistent with the general fair dividend rate treatment which ignores purchases of shares during a year (other than quick sales). For example, for a person with a 30 percent interest in a grey list company at the start of an income year that scales down their interest to 8 percent during the year, they should be treated as having acquired an 8 percent interest during the year, the opening value for which would be zero. Officials also agree that this policy would be best achieved by treating the opening market value under the fair dividend rate method to be zero for a 10 percent or more interest in a grey list company that falls below 10 percent during the period (the grey list exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for 10 percent or more interests in grey list companies applies only if the interest remains at 10 percent or more at all times during the relevant income year). However, if a person’s interest in a grey list company falls below 10 percent during an income year, and the fair dividend rate method can be applied to the interest (resulting in nil foreign investment fund income for that year), the interest holder should remain liable to tax on any dividends received in that year. This is consistent with the general treatment of 10 percent or more interests in grey list companies where even though the interest is not subject to the foreign investment fund rules, dividends from those interests remain taxable. This treatment could be achieved by inserting a specific exception in sections EX 47 and CD 26 which will apply in the year that a 10 percent or more interest in a grey list company falls below 10 percent during the year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 80 Issue: Meaning of income interest of 10 percent or more Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to ensure that the provisions which depend on the application of the 10 percent or greater income interest threshold are consistent with those applying under the Income Tax Act 1994. An amendment is necessary to clarify whether the interests of associated persons are required to be included by the investor when measuring their income interest for the purposes of the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules. Comment The concern raised in the submission has been considered by the Rewrite Advisory Panel which has recommended a retrospective remedial amendment to the Income Tax Act 2004 to deal with this issue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Family trusts and the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As currently worded, sections EX 40(6) and EX 50(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 will prevent a large number of family trusts from using the comparative value method in years in which foreign investment fund income would be lower under that method than under the fair dividend rate method. A number of remedial amendments are required to ensure that this safety net option is available to family trusts as intended. These suggested changes are that: • The ordinary definition of the term “settlor” in paragraph (a)(i) of the section OB 1 definition – which is limited to dispositions of property at less than market value – should be adopted. The term “settlor” should also include deceased persons. • Section HH 1(1) should apply to nominal settlements for the purposes of sections EX 40(6) and EX 50(8). • Resettlements of family trusts should not prevent the application of sections EX 40(6) and EX 50(8) if the trust and the settlors of the trust from which the resettlement is made satisfy the requirements of those provisions. 81 • Sections EX 40(6) and EX 50(8) should be amended to recognise that there can be a series of settlements when property is transferred to a trust after its establishment. • The natural love and affection requirement in sections EX 40(6) and EX 50(8) should be focussed on each income year rather than the time of a trust’s establishment. • The qualifying trust criterion in sections EX 40(6) and EX 50(8) should be defined with reference to a particular distribution because the term “qualifying trust” is defined in section OB 1 in relation to a particular distribution. Comment Officials agree that these remedial amendments would help to ensure that family trusts can use the comparative value method in years in which foreign investment fund income would be lower under that method than under the fair dividend rate method, which is the policy intention. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Trans-Tasman imputation Submission (54 – ASB) No market value adjustment should be required in respect of a fixed rate share where the share is either listed on the Australian Stock Exchange or the New Zealand Stock Exchange and the company has a policy of distributing at least 90 percent of its profits each year. Where the company distributes the majority of its profit each year, double taxation will occur. First, when the taxpayer is subject to tax on any change in the market value (which will reflect any undistributed earnings), and second, when it receives the dividend distribution. Comment Officials do not agree that there is double taxation where a fixed-rate share investment in an Australian-resident company – that does not qualify for the Australian-listed company exemption from the foreign investment fund rules – is subject to the comparative value method. Dividends are taken into account in working out foreign investment fund income under the comparative value method. There is no double New Zealand taxation of the same income. To the extent there are distributions made on the share this would reduce the closing value. The dividend itself is not separately taxed on receipt, thereby preventing actual double taxation – this exclusion is provided under section EX 47. 82 An amendment in the bill to section LB 2 will ensure that a New Zealand investor is entitled to an imputation credit under the trans-Tasman imputation rules when they receive a dividend from an investment in an Australian company that is subject to the distribution exclusion in section EX 47, which is the situation in the example given in the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Imputation credit under the trans-Tasman imputation rules Submissions (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 44(4) is circular as you need to complete the full taxable income calculation and then work out the allowable credit before you can actually determine the amount of the credit to be included in the item’s “gains”. New section LB 2(8) only needs to refer to an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund – not an interest in an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund. Comment Officials do not agree that section EX 44(4), containing the definition of “gains” in the comparative value method, is circular. The definition of “gains” requires that any amount that a person derives from holding or disposing of an interest in a foreign investment fund is grossed-up by the amount of foreign withholding tax or other tax that the person is allowed as a credit under section LC 1 or, under the amendment in the bill, any imputation credit allowed under section LB 2. This grossing-up requirement will be satisfied if a person satisfies the requirements in section LB 2 and section LC 1 for an imputation credit or foreign tax credit respectively. Although the equivalent provision in the Income Tax Act 1994 (section CG 18) referred to credits being “allowable” under section LC 1, no change of meaning was intended by using the word “allowed” in the current section EX 44(4); this wording change was made as part of the general rewrite of the Income Tax Act. However, officials consider that the relevant part of section EX 44(4) would be clearer if it was worded: “the amounts include any foreign withholding tax or other amount that the person is allowed as a credit under sections LB 2 or LC 1”. Officials also agree that new section LB 2(8) would be clearer if the relevant part referred to “assessable income of the taxpayer in respect of an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund”. This wording would be consistent with the approach used in the equivalent provision in the foreign tax credit rules (section LC 1(4)). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 83 Issue: Consequences of changes in method Submissions (55 – NZ Funds) Proposed section EX 51(5) has an unintended consequence of potentially triggering the quick sale rules in the fair dividend rate method. This should be prevented by extending the application of proposed section EX 44C(13) to proposed section EX 51(5) so that when a person changes from the fair dividend rate method to the comparative value method, the deemed sale and purchase does not trigger a quick sale. The proposed section CQ 5(1B) should also be extended to section EX 51(5) so that the determination of the $50,000 minimum threshold is not affected by the deemed sale and purchase under section EX 51(5). Comment Proposed section EX 51(5) deals with the consequences of changing between the fair dividend rate and the comparative value methods. Officials agree with the submission that the deemed disposal and reacquisition under this provision should not trigger the quick sale rules in section EX 44C and should be ignored for the purposes of the $50,000 minimum threshold rules in sections CQ 5 and DN 6. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Changes in application of foreign investment fund exemptions Submission (74 – Deloitte) Section EX 53 should be amended to ensure there are not multiple deemed realisations in a period. With the interaction of sections EX 33C and EX 54B there are situations where this could produce more than one deemed acquisition and disposal in a period. For example, if a person who values their interest daily holds a share that satisfies the section EX 33C exemption then they will be subject to tax on gains and dividends throughout the income year. However, if during the year that share ceases to satisfy the exemption there is a deemed sale and reacquisition at that date under section EX 53(2), but that person will continue to pay tax on dividends and gains until the next income year because of section EX 33C(2). At the end of the income year, because that interest is an attributing interest for which the person does not have foreign investment fund income, there is a second deemed disposal and acquisition. 84 Comment Officials do not consider that there would be multiple deemed disposals and reacquisitions as a result of the section EX 33C amendments. If a company is listed on an approved index of the Australian Stock Exchange on the first day of a person’s income year and the company is omitted from the index during the person’s income year, that requirement for the Australian shares exemption will still be satisfied for the whole of that year – there is no deemed sale and reacquisition under section EX 53 at the time the company is removed from the index. The person’s investment only becomes an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund from the beginning of the next income year and there is only a single deemed disposal and reacquisition at that time under section EX 53. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date provisions for new foreign investment fund rules Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date provisions that allow the application date of the amended foreign investment fund rules to be extended to 1 October 2007 are too inflexible. The rules should allow entities that are brought into existence between 1 April 2007 and 1 October 2007 to elect to defer the start date of the new foreign investment fund rules within one month, or within such further period as the Commissioner allows. Comment The new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares generally apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2007. A special application date rule applies for entities that intend to become portfolio investment entities – these entities may choose to delay the application of the new offshore tax rules until 1 October 2007 when the new tax rules for portfolio investment entities come into force. This deferral is achieved by the entity giving a notice to the Commissioner before 1 April 2007 (if the entity exists before that date) or within one month of the day on which the entity comes into existence (if the entity comes into existence between 1 April 2007 and 1 October 2007). 85 Officials consider that the part of the application date provisions allowing certain entities to defer the start date of the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares are sufficiently flexible to deal with taxpayers’ circumstances. Also, given the short period until the start date of the new portfolio investment entity tax rules on 1 October 2007 and the large number of application date provisions for the new offshore tax rules, it would not be desirable to make further amendments to these application date provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 86 DRAFTING ISSUES Submissions (Matters raised by officials) In section CQ 5(1)(db), replace “the person holds attributing interests” with “the person holds at any time during the income year attributing interests” to be consistent with the companion provision in section CQ 5(1)(d). In section CQ 5(1)(f), the previous cross-references to sections EX 48 and EX 49 should be reinstated. In section DN 6(1)(db), replace “the person holds attributing interests” with “the person holds at any time during the income year attributing interests” to be consistent with the companion provision in section DN 6(1)(d). In clause 64, replace the reference to “fair dividend method” in new section EX 40(8)(a)(i) and EX 40(9)(a) with “fair dividend rate method”. In section EX 40(6)(b), replace “subsection (8)(a)(i) to (v)” with “subsection (9)(a) to (e)”. In section EX 44(6B), replace “section EX 40(8)(a)(i) to (v)” with “section EX 40(9)(a) to (e)”. Section EX 41(2)(b)(ii) and (iii), concerning the default calculation method in the foreign investment fund rules, should be amended to cater for the situation where the accounting profits method is allowed but it is not practical to use it. This situation was covered in the previous section EX 41(2)(b) and was inadvertently omitted when the current section EX 41(2) was enacted in 2006. In section EX 45B(11)(b), replace “section EX 44C” with “section EX 44E”. In section EX 51, replace “subsections (2) to (7)” with “subsections (2) to (8)”. Comment The minor remedial amendments outlined above are consistent with the policy intent of the new foreign investment fund rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 87 Life insurance and portfolio investment entity rules 89 OVERVIEW Clauses 77, 78, 81 to 83 and 135 The bill introduces a number of changes to ensure greater consistency between the tax treatment of life insurance savings products and those of other savings vehicles. The changes deal with two particular problems. The first is an unexpected consequence of the fair dividend rate rules that arises because of the complexities of the interplay between a life insurer’s life office base and its policyholder base tax calculations. The second problem deals with applying the Australasian capital gains exclusion contained in the portfolio investment entity rules to unit-linked life products. Eight submissions were received. Some submissions expressed support for the amendments on unit-linked products, but all submitters wanted the Australasian capital gains exclusion to be extended to non-unit-linked life savings products. Some submissions questioned the percentages of income exclusion from the policyholder base income calculations and suggested alternative approaches. The status of attributed income derived by a life insurer, and technical issues on actuarial concepts and definitions were also raised. Some submissions touched on matters that are part of the current review of the taxation of life insurance. One submission directly raised the treatment of prepaid policyholder base tax balances that is not related to this bill, but is a transitional issue being considered by the review. 90 EXTEND AUSTRALASIAN EQUITY CAPITAL GAINS EXCLUSION Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association, 24 – AMP, 54 – ASB Bank, 61 – KPMG, 52 – Tower Limited, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The life office base and policyholder base relief should not be restricted to unit-linked products as currently contained in the bill. The bill should expressly exclude gains on all Australasian equities from the life office base, including gains derived from assets backing conventional participating policies (such as whole of life and endowment business) and also gains derived by the shareholder. Comment The complexity of life insurance savings products presents challenges with excluding realised gains from Australasian equities. There are two broad categories of products. The first are conventional participating policies which can be likened to a pool of money into which policyholder premiums and investment income go in and claims, expenses, tax, and provisions for future liabilities go out. The remaining “profit” is allocated between the policyholders and the owners of the life insurer (usually referred to as the shareholders) according to a ratio determined by the rules of the life fund. There is no practical way to separate excluded income between the shareholders and policyholders. The policyholders’ share is available for crediting as bonuses to policyholders and represents investment income on the policy, though if the policy is terminated by the policyholder before time, the surrender value is less than the aggregate of the bonuses and premiums. The shareholder’s share, however, is available for use (for example, to be paid out as dividends) in its entirety. The current comprehensive review of the taxation of life insurance requested submissions from the industry on the Australasian capital gains exclusion for participating policies. Officials consider that this particular issue is more appropriately addressed in the context of that review. The second broad category is unit-linked products. Policyholders’ investment income in unit-linked products is determined by the rise or fall in their investment units, reflecting the performance of the underlying investment assets. The nature of most of these products means that the difference between market and surrender values would usually not be as much as that for conventional products. Therefore, tax not paid on realised Australasian equity gains leads to a commensurate increase in the value of units, so the calculation of income is very similar to that of unit trusts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 PROVISION FOR LIFE OFFICE BASE Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association) The bill should include a provision to exclude gains on all Australasian equities from the life office base and not just assets held under unit-linked policies. Comment Extending the Australasian realised capital gains exclusion on direct investments for assets held for the life insurance business (other than just unit-linked products) is being considered as part of the life insurance tax review. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 DEFINITION OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITY ADJUSTMENT Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association, 54 – ASB Bank, 52 – Tower Limited, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of the portfolio investment entity adjustment should also include gains on Australasian equities income and FDR income attributed to the portfolio investment-linked fund from investment in a portfolio investment entity. Comment The definition of the portfolio investment-linked adjustment (renamed by officials from “portfolio investment entity” adjustment to remove confusion) refers only to holdings of shares as described in section CX 44C of the Income Tax Act 2004. In proposed section EY 42C (2) there is a reference to “excluded shares” in the portfolio investment-linked fund adjustment formula. “Excluded shares” are defined in subsection (6) but only include shares owned directly and not shares held indirectly through a portfolio investment entity. Excluded Australasian gains should also be excluded from the policyholder base calculation, and the definition of “excluded shares” in proposed section EY 42C (6) (a) amended accordingly. Similarly, the definition of FDR income includes only FDR income from directly held investments. FDR income attributed from portfolio investment entity investments by the portfolio investment-linked life fund should also be excluded. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 93 RATE OF TAX APPLIED TO LINKED PRODUCTS Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association, 54 – ASB Bank) Unit-linked products are subject to tax at the corporate rate of 33% (though this rate will reduce to 30% in the 2009–10 income year). This rate is excessive as industry data shows that the typical investor is either in or approaching retirement, and these products are not being sold to new customers in any significant volume. Therefore linked products should be taxed in the life office base at 19.5% as a proxy rate, and the income removed from the policyholder base by way of an exemption. Grandfathering provisions could apply to prevent new products exploiting the lower tax rate. Comment Using a proxy rate is inconsistent with portfolio investment entity tax policy principles. While some investors are taxed at their correct rate, other investors will not be taxed at their correct rate. The problem of determining the tax rate to apply to portfolio investment entity income that is not allocated to a particular investor was considered in the context of defined benefit funds and it was decided it was appropriate to tax the income at the corporate rate in that case. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 DEFINITION OF FIF RESULT Submissions (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association, 24 – AMP, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In clause 78 of the bill, the “FIF result” which is excluded from the policyholder base (as the income will be taxed under the FDR method) is defined as the gains and losses for the income year: (a) calculated using accepted accounting practice; and (b) not differing materially from the amounts of FIF income or FIF loss that would have arisen for the property in the absence of the law enacting the fair dividend rate. Two approaches were suggested by submissions in amending the definition of the “FIF result”. The first was that the adjustment to the policyholder base should be the amount arising under the comparative method for calculating FIF income or loss. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Deloitte) The second was that any adjustment to policyholder base taxation should be based only on gains and losses in the financial statements as determined by accepted accounting practice. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association, AMP) Comment The intention of the provision is to ensure that the correct amount of income from the policyholder base is taxed. The reference to a material difference between amounts calculated under accepted accounting practice and under FIF methods (which was stated in the Commentary to the bill to be the comparative method) should, in most cases, arrive at a similar answer. This is because a life insurer is required to record assets held for its investment activities at fair value for financial reporting purposes, and this is likely to be the same as using the comparative value method. Life insurers, however, may incur compliance costs if the value of some assets cannot be determined. Officials consider in the circumstances that there is no overall benefit in taxpayers incurring these costs as the gains and losses calculated under accepted accounting practice should provide the correct information in the vast majority of circumstances. Recommendation That the submission confining the adjustment to the policyholder base only to gains and losses calculated using accepted accounting practice be accepted. That the submission that the adjustment to the policyholder base should be the amount arising under the comparative method for calculating FIF income or loss be declined. 95 DEFINITION OF A PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT-LINKED FUND Submission (74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of a portfolio investment-linked fund should be amended by replacing the word “fund” with “pool of investments”. Comment The definition of a portfolio investment-linked fund states that it means a fund in which certain criteria are satisfied. A “fund” is not defined. A unit-linked fund is made up of a number of assets held to support the policyholder liabilities of the insurer, but these will not necessarily be held in a separate entity. Accordingly, it would be more technically correct to define a portfolio investment-linked fund as a fund or a pool of investments, held to support policyholder liabilities. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS OF A PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT- LINKED FUND Submission (74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of a portfolio investment-linked fund should be amended by relaxing the membership requirements under section HL 6, as unit-linked life policies have no concept of membership. Comment To elect to be a portfolio investment-linked fund, section HL 6 currently requires the policyholders in the unit-linked product (being a “portfolio investor class of an entity which is not a company”) to satisfy an “investor membership requirement” prescribed in that section. While life insurance products in New Zealand now generally do not have a concept of membership, the important definition is that of “investor”. The bill amends the definition of “investor” in a portfolio investment-linked fund to be “a person whose benefits under the relevant life insurance policy are directly linked to the value of investments held in a portfolio investment-linked fund”. The membership requirement is therefore met and so officials consider that no change is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 97 PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT-LINKED FUND AND FDR ADJUSTMENTS Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association, 24 – AMP, 54 – ASB Bank, 61 – KPMG, 52 – Tower Limited, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74 – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submissions all considered that the bill’s exclusion of income not taxed under the FDR method from the policyholder base (90% for unit-linked policies under the portfolio investment-linked fund adjustment, and 40% for participating policies) was too low. There were four broad approaches contained in the submissions: • There should be further consultation to determine more appropriate figures. (KPMG) • The limitations should be removed and replaced with actuarially determined rates which reflect investment income attributable to policyholders. (Tower Limited, ASB Bank, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Investment Savings and Insurance Association) • The policyholder base exclusion factors contained in the bill should be an option only when the insurer is unable to calculate the amount actually credited to policyholders. (AMP) • The scaling factors should be increased to 100% for index-linked products and 80% for participating policies. FDR income for participating policies should be the actual allocation of income, but if this cannot be determined, the 80% factor would constitute a “safe harbour”. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The proposed FDR and portfolio investment-linked fund adjustments seek to make a specific and well-defined adjustment to actuarial reserves. Actuarial reserves are not narrowly defined for tax purposes and are calculated in a variety of ways depending on the specific circumstances of each life insurer. Investment income is ultimately fully attributed to unit-linked policyholders, and we are advised by the industry, up to about 80% to non-unit-linked policyholders. However, timing of the actual income allocation to policyholders differs between income years (according to the circumstances of the policy and investment conditions) and between life insurers. If the policyholder base exclusion factors are too low (as submissions are arguing), more tax than is appropriate will be paid on the policyholder base. If the exclusion factors are too high, a life insurer’s policyholder base tax will be understated. Officials have analysed the exclusion factors in light of submissions, and while not proposing a change in the portfolio investment-linked fund adjustment factor, consider that a 60% factor for participating policies is more appropriate. 98 We are advised that actuaries can, in the majority of circumstances, reasonably accurately calculate the income subject to the portfolio investment-linked fund and FDR adjustments allocated to policyholders on an annual basis. Officials have subsequently discussed the issue with members of the Investment Savings and Insurance Association, and agree that when actuaries are able to make accurate actual allocations the percentage used should be the actual percentage. Alternatively, life insurers could choose the exclusion factors in the bill, though officials acknowledge that life insurers would only adopt this alternative if the actual allocation cannot be accurately calculated, or if the compliance costs to do so would be material. The allocation method adopted has to be used consistently between income years to prevent artificially maximising the policyholder base exclusion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that life insurers can choose whether to exclude from policyholder base income the percentages for portfolio investment-linked fund and FDR contained in the bill or, exclude actual amounts credited to actuarial reserves. The method chosen must be used by the life insurer in subsequent income years. The adjustment factor for the FDR adjustment for participating policies will be increased to 60%. 99 DEFINITION OF PROPERTY Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association) In proposed sections EY 42B and EY 42C, the portfolio investment-linked fund and FDR adjustments to policyholder base income are made “to the extent to which property that the life insurer holds to support actuarial reserves...” This phrase is not defined, and could be difficult to interpret in cases where insurance contracts prescribe participation in pools of assets by both shareholder and policyholder. No specific submission was made, though the preferred solution was that the portfolio investment entity and FDR adjustments should be made by determining the actual amount of accounting income credited to policyholder reserves. Comment The adjustments contained in the bill are limited to life insurance products. These products have actuarial reserves which alter the timing of income recognition. Officials consider that the phrase “actuarial reserves” is generally understood and does not need a specific definition. The reference to actuarial reserves in proposed sections EY 42B and 42C are used to describe the type of property subject to the rules. In any case, officials have dealt with the portfolio investment entity and FDR adjustments being the actual amounts in response to an earlier submission. Accordingly, no further change to the language of the section is considered necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 100 REALISED AUSTRALASIAN EQUITY GAINS EXCLUSION FROM LIFE OFFICE BASE Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exclusion from the life office base for realised Australasian equity gains in respect of unit-linked product investments should be made explicit. Comment Realised Australasian equity gains are excluded from the life office base for portfolio investment-linked funds by the operation of section CX 44C. A practitioner suggested to officials that the exclusion should directly refer to the exclusion for portfolio investment-linked funds. While officials consider that the current wording is technically sufficient, a clarification to section CX 44C regarding its intent for portfolio investment-linked funds will remove any doubt. Recommendation That section CX 44C be amended to remove any doubt that it applies to portfolio investment-linked funds. 101 Other policy matters 103 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL – RETROSPECTIVE AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Issue: Unintended consequences Submissions (95 – New Zealand Law Society, Matters raised by officials) Amendments are required to remedy unintended changes in legislative outcomes in the Income Tax Act 2004 with effect from the commencement date of the Act. The provisions affected are section CB 5 (Disposal of land acquired for purposes or intention of disposal) and EX 15 (Associated persons and income interest thresholds for CFC rules). Section CB 5 (Disposal of land acquired for purposes or intention of disposal) Clauses 5B, 25B and 57B In rewriting section CD 1(10) of the Income Tax Act 1994, the placement of this rule in paragraph (a)(i) of the “land” definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has the effect of unintentionally widening the ambit of amounts that are included as income under the land sale rules in sections CB 5 to CB 21. Section CB 5 should be amended retrospectively to ensure that the effect of section CD 1(10) of the income Tax Act 1994 be restored to apply to the land sales provisions in section CB 5 to CB 21. (Matter raised by officials) The “land” definition in the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to correct an identified unintended legislative change, with retrospective effect for taxpayers who have taken a tax position consistent with the policy of the amendment. (New Zealand Law Society) Section EX 15 (Associates and 10% threshold) Clauses 9B, 58B, 58C, 59C and 78C The drafting of the 2004 Act should be reviewed to ensure that the provisions which depend on the application of the “10% of greater income interest” threshold are consistent with those applying under the 1994 Act. Comment When the Income Tax Act 2004 was enacted, the Finance and Expenditure Committee noted that there was concern that the new legislation could contain adverse unintended policy changes. To alleviate that concern, the Committee recommended that a panel of tax specialists be appointed to review submissions which stated that a provision of the 2004 Act contained an unintended policy change. In this context, an unintended policy change is one that gives rise to a different outcome from the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 1994. The Rewrite Advisory Panel accepted this review role. 104 The government also announced that it would consider promoting retrospective legislation to correct unintended changes in the legislative outcome of a provision in the 2004 Act. The Panel considers that the rewrite of section CD 1(10) as paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of land in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has led to an uncertain result as the operative words of section CD 1(10) of the ITA 1994 are now incorporated into the definition of “land”. Officials agree with the submission. The Panel considers that the drafting of section EX 15 of the Income Tax Act 2004 has limited the application of that section compared with the corresponding provision (section CG 6(92)) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Officials agree that the rewrite of section EX 15 has given rise to potential differences in treatment between the 1994 and 2004 Acts in applying the 10% income interest threshold for the international tax rules. A retrospective amendment is recommended to restore the effect of the Income Tax Act 1994 in relation to the 10% income interest threshold contained in section EX 15 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, with the amendments applying from the beginning of the 2005–06 tax year, which is the commencement date for the 2004 Act. Issue: Recoveries by employers from superannuation schemes Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section CG 5 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to ensure that where an employer recovers or receives an amount from a superannuation scheme the amounts received should be tax-free in the hands of the employer, to the extent that specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) has already been paid. Comment Officials consider that this submission should be referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel for consideration as to whether the 2004 Act contains an unintended change in law relating to section DF 3(3) of the 1994 Act. However, it is clear that the adjustment to deductions under section DF 3(3) was intended to give rise to an adjustment to the employer’s net income (and income tax liability). Therefore, the section DF 3(3) adjustment was not a tax-free outcome. In addition, in the event of a refund of employer superannuation contributions, the policy intention is that the Commissioner would normally issue an assessment under section 98 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to action any applicable refund of SSCWT. 105 Officials consider that these policies remain intact as a result of the rewrite of section DF. However, officials agree there are intended changes in law in section CG 5, and this is clearly set out in Schedule 22A of the 2004 Act. There are two intended changes to the section: • The adjustment to net income is now timed to the year of the receipt of the benefit rather than leading to a re-assessment of an earlier tax year. • The 12-month restriction is omitted. Recommendations That the submission be declined and be referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel for consideration as a potential unintended change in law in the 2004 Act. Issue: Duplication of effect Clause 28 Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Matter raised by officials) Clause DC 9(3)(b) is not required. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The effect of DC 9(3)(b) replicates the effect of the opening words of section DC 9(2) so the subparagraph is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 106 TAX INCENTIVES FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS Issue: Support for amendments Submissions (5 – Philanthropy New Zealand, 27 – Presbyterian Support New Zealand, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 63 – Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation, 74R – Deloitte) Some submissions supported all of the amendments, while others identified specific amendments that they supported. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Concerns with the amendments Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA is concerned that the amendments may not increase charitable giving for the betterment of New Zealand and that there may be better, more optimal policy solutions that deserve further consideration. The submission notes that the economic literature is not conclusive about whether increasing or removing a cap on charitable donations actually increases charitable giving. Furthermore, because there is no control over where the taxpayer subsidy goes, there is no means of ensuring taxpayer subsidised gifts go to the wider benefit of all New Zealanders, rather than to sectors of the community that benefit only their members. Comment The October 2006 government discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations, noted that there is no clear consensus about the impact of tax incentives in encouraging philanthropy. While there are some who believe that a lack of tax incentives contributes to low levels of charitable giving in many countries, many others believe there is little relationship between the two. 1 1 Johnson P D, Johnson S P and Kingman A, “Promoting philanthropy global challenges and approaches”, International Network on Strategic Philanthropy, December 2004. 107 Some empirical evidence suggests that tax incentives to donors can and do lead to larger donations being made, and that high-income people tend to be more responsive to tax incentives. For example, the Asia Pacific Centre for Philanthropy and Social Investment has undertaken research on the strategies that have been applied in different countries to encourage giving, especially by the wealthy in the United States, Britain and Australia. 2 The general view is that tax incentives introduced in isolation are unlikely to change philanthropic behaviour or attitudes significantly. Rather, a range of initiatives is likely to be required, including better education aimed at promoting awareness of the activities of the charitable and non-profit sector, as well as other promotional strategies. This would have the potential to change philanthropic behaviours and, in the longer-term, have a positive effect on giving to charities and other non-profit organisations. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Tax relief in the 2007–08 tax year Submissions (63 – Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The amendments relating to removing the rebate threshold and the company deduction limit should apply from the 2007–08 tax year, rather than the 2008–09 tax year. Delayed introduction of the amendments would have adverse effects on charities and similar organisations that rely principally on donations as a source of funding. There is a serious risk of individuals “storing up” donations until 1 April 2008, with a consequential impact on the funding of charities and similar organisations. There would be no operational difficulties in permitting the removal of the cap to apply from the current tax year, as rebates are processed by Inland Revenue after the end of the tax year. (New Zealand Law Society) Section KC 5(2)(b) should be amended to provide greater relief in the current tax year to encourage individuals to continue donating between now and 31 March 2008. In particular, the rebate threshold should be increased to $5,000 for the tax year ending 31 March 2008. (Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation) 2 Asia Pacific Centre for Philanthropy and Social Investment, “How the wealthy give” (October 2004) and “Encouraging wealthy Australians to be more philanthropic” (February 2005). 108 Comment Officials do not support the submissions for the following reasons: • The suggested changes would require changes to Inland Revenue’s system for processing rebate claims and updating the rebate claim form. These changes would not have been taken into account in Inland Revenue’s planning and design processes for new legislation. • The suggested changes would have a fiscal cost, which has not been taken into account in Budget 2007. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Other tax incentives to encourage charitable giving Submission (27 – Presbyterian Support New Zealand) Other tax incentives for encouraging giving of time and property to charities and other non-profit organisations should be considered by the government. In particular: • honoraria payments for substantiated expenses should be exempt from income; and • goods and services provided to charitable causes should qualify for tax relief, provided they can be independently valued. Comment The government is currently reviewing the tax treatment of reimbursement payments to volunteers and honoraria recipients. One of the options being considered is an exemption for honoraria payments for reasonable expenses incurred. Any legislative changes arising from this review are likely to be included in the next available taxation bill. As part of Budget 2007, the government announced that it would undertake further policy work on a range of other tax incentives for charitable donations, including a gift aid scheme where the tax benefit of donations goes directly to the charitable organisation rather than the donor, and making it possible to claim tax relief for non- monetary donations. The results of this review will be reported to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue by 31 March 2008. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 109 Issue: Non-tax measures for encouraging giving Submissions (5 – Philanthropy New Zealand, 27 – Presbyterian Support New Zealand) Submissions strongly recommended that the government should take a leadership role in promoting philanthropy and a culture of generosity in New Zealand. Comment As previously noted, the government recognises that tax incentives alone will not change giving behaviours and that a more pluralistic approach to encouraging giving is required. For example, public awareness campaigns, donor education and donor leadership. The government is currently examining a wide range of non-tax measures for reinforcing and encouraging a culture of giving and philanthropy in New Zealand. This work is being led by the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: The company deduction should be extended to sole traders Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The limitation on the amount a company can deduct for charitable donations should be the same for an individual who conducts a business as a sole trader. This would ensure that sole traders and companies are treated the same. Comment Under the proposed change to the company deduction for charitable donations, the deduction would be limited by the amount of the company’s net income before taking into account the donation, while under the proposed change to the rebate for individuals, charitable donations would be limited to an individual’s taxable income. The difference between net income and taxable income for an income year is any tax losses that a taxpayer is allowed to carry forward from an earlier income year and offset against the current year’s net income. As a result of this difference, if losses are brought forward from an earlier income year, an individual would obtain a smaller tax advantage than a company in identical circumstances. It is because of this difference that the submission argues that the charitable donations rules are inequitable according to the legal form through which a business is undertaken. 110 We note that this difference is present in the current law, although the tax consequences are markedly accentuated by the amendments. Officials consider that the submission raises a valid concern which should be considered further. It is recommended that the issue be considered in the ongoing review of tax incentives for charitable giving. Recommendation That the submission be considered in the ongoing review of tax incentives for charitable giving. Issue: Limit the rebate to individuals who are not required to file a tax return Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the company deduction is extended to individuals (such as sole traders), then the rebate claim process should only apply to those individuals who are subject to section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – that is, individuals who are not required to file income tax returns. Individuals who file a return should be able to claim the deduction automatically through the tax return. Comment As this issue is closely related to the issue of extending the company deduction to apply to other individuals including sole traders, officials recommend that it too should be considered in the ongoing review of tax incentives for charitable giving. Recommendation That the submission be considered in the ongoing review of tax incentives for charitable giving. 111 Issue: Ability of charities to use imputation credits Submissions (5 – Philanthropy New Zealand, 27 – Presbyterian Support New Zealand, 58 – Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand) Charities should be able to use the imputation credits they receive on dividends from their equity investments in the same way as other investors. (Philanthropy New Zealand, Presbyterian Support New Zealand) Comment Charities are unable to make use of their imputation credits because of their tax- exempt status. The inability of charities to use their imputation credits is a significant concern for the charitable sector. There have been many calls from the charitable sector for the government to deal with this problem. It was noted in the October 2006 government discussion document, Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations, that the issue would be examined in the context of a wider review of who should be entitled to use imputation credits. The government is in the process of putting together its tax policy work programme for the coming year and the priority of the wider imputation credit review will be determined in that context. Recommendation That the submissions are noted. Issue: Donations in excess of an individual’s “net income” Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill should be amended so that individuals who make donations in excess of the level of their net income can claim tax relief on any excess donations. Comment Officials recommend that this submission be considered in the ongoing review of tax incentives for charitable giving. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 112 RETIREMENT SCHEME CONTRIBUTIONS WITHHOLDING TAX (RSCWT) Issue: The retirement scheme withdrawal rules are too restrictive Clause 133 Submission (68 – Te Rūnunga o Ngāi Tahu and Whai Rawa) For the retirement scheme contributions withholding tax (RSCWT) rules to be applied, a scheme receiving contributions must meet the criteria to be a “retirement savings scheme”. These criteria include circumstances in which withdrawals may be made, which are limited to the same circumstances as KiwiSaver withdrawal rules, except that the age of retirement may be set lower, and withdrawals may be made to repay student loans. These rules are too restrictive. They should be amended to allow retirement-oriented schemes with more permissive rules than KiwiSaver, provided the Commissioner approves the distribution rules as fair and reasonable. This would enable Whai Rawa to apply to use the RSCWT rules. Comment The rules for retirement savings scheme withdrawals are modelled on KiwiSaver withdrawal rules. The KiwiSaver rules are highly restrictive, in part because there are concessionary tax rates associated with contributions to KiwiSaver – for example, employer contributions are exempt from SSCWT up to a cap. However, the tax rates on contributions to retirement savings schemes are not concessionary, so it is reasonable for the withdrawal rules to be less restrictive. While there are some social assistance and tax administration concessions for retirement savings schemes, provided the Commissioner accepts the rules in the scheme’s trust deed as fair and reasonable, schemes should be able to apply to use the RSCWT rules, without having withdrawal rules that are as restrictive as KiwiSaver rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and the withdrawal conditions be amended so that the key criterion is that the savings scheme is set up as a trust or unit trust and the Commissioner approves the withdrawal rules as fair and reasonable. “Fair and reasonable” withdrawal rules would include rules which allow for withdrawals in the following circumstances: • retirement, at an age specified in the agreement; • housing, where the person making the withdrawal does not already own a home; • paying for tertiary education; • any withdrawals that would be permitted under KiwiSaver rules; • where the Commissioner approves the withdrawal as fair and reasonable. 113 Issue: RSCWT rates Clause 135 (47) Submission (68 – Te Rūnunga o Ngāi Tahu and Whai Rawa, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The tax rates on retirement scheme contributions should be set at the same level as portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax rates, or capped at 33%, like SSCWT. The 39% rate is inequitable because individuals cannot opt out of the scheme. Linking the rates to PIE rates, or capping the rate at 33% will reduce compliance costs and minimise exposure to penalties as a result of choosing an incorrect rate. Linking RSCWT rates to PIE rates would reduce compliance costs because scheme members would only need to declare one rate which would cover tax on both PIE income and RSCWT. Comment Income that is received in the form of retirement scheme contributions is income that would ordinarily be received as dividends or Māori authority distributions. Dividends and Māori authority distributions are taxed at individuals’ marginal tax rates, and the proposed RSCWT rates in the bill are consistent with individual marginal tax rates. The ability of individuals to opt in or out of the scheme does not affect marginal tax rates, so RSCWT rates are not inequitable. PIE rates are used to tax the income earned by investors through portfolio investment entities, not contributions to PIEs. Contributions to PIEs come from income that is taxed at investors’ marginal tax rates (except for employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes and complying superannuation funds which are taxed through SSCWT). Using PIE tax rates for RSCWT would be concessionary compared with individual marginal rates. Linking RSCWT rates to PIE rates would require tighter lock-in rules, so that the difference between RSCWT rates and individual marginal tax rates could not be exploited. However, according to Te Rūnunga and Whai Rawa, the tight lock- in rules will not meet their needs when setting up a savings scheme for their members. The treatment of taxpayers who elect an incorrect rate for RSCWT purposes is the same as that for taxpayers who elect an incorrect rate for PIE purposes. These taxpayers may be required to complete a tax return, which means that the income may affect any social assistance entitlements and the taxpayer may be required to pay use- of-money interest from the date at which terminal tax would have been due, until the date that any tax owing is paid. However, there are no penalties for declaring an incorrect rate for RSCWT other than the general penalties that may apply to any taxpayer who knowingly uses incorrect information for tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 114 Issue: Basis on which RSCWT rates are chosen Clause 135 (47) Submission (68 – Te Rūnunga o Ngāi Tahu and Whai Rawa) Like PIE rates, RSCWT rates should be based on the lowest marginal tax rate of the member over the previous two years, not the marginal tax rate in the preceding income year alone. This would reduce compliance costs. Comment Officials agree that compliance costs may be reduced by allowing RSCWT rates to be based on the lowest marginal tax rate of the member over the previous two years. Members would not need to look up one set of information for PIE purposes and another set for RSCWT purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: RSCWT rate on distributions to non-resident scheme members Clause 135 (47) Submission (68 – Te Rūnunga o Ngāi Tahu and Whai Rawa) The 39% rate on distributions to non-resident scheme members is too high. Given that the bulk of recipients are likely to be on the lowest marginal tax rate, 19.5% would be more appropriate, but in any case, the rate should not exceed the middle marginal tax rate of 33%. Comment Interest, dividends and royalties received by non-residents is normally subject to non- resident withholding tax. Retirement savings scheme contributions are dividends or Māori authority distributions, and they do not lose their character as dividends or Māori authority distributions even if they are paid as retirement savings contributions. Accordingly, contributions made to non-residents’ accounts in retirement savings schemes should be subject to tax in the normal way for dividends and Māori authority distributions that have been distributed to non-residents. 115 Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, by amending the bill so that instead of being subject to RSCWT and taxed at 39%, contributions paid to non-residents should be subject to non-resident withholding tax in the usual way for dividends and Māori authority distributions. Issue: Circumstances in which retirement scheme contributions are not treated as excluded income Clause 24 Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The drafting of the exceptions from excluded income is not clear. Comment The colon between subsections CX 42B(2)(a) and CX 42B(2)(b) indicates that if either or both of the circumstances in those clauses occur, retirement scheme contributions are no longer treated as excluded income. This reflects the policy intent accurately. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 ACC ATTENDANT CARE PAYMENTS Issue: ACC attendant care rules Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The ACC attendant care tax provisions are far too complex and should be deferred for at least another full income year to allow a simpler system to be designed. Comment Provisions to tax ACC attendant care payments were enacted in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. The provisions were to come into effect on 1 April 2008. However, this bill repeals those provisions and re-enacts them with modifications to clarify their intent and to delay the application date to 1 July 2008. The reason for the change in the application date is to give the Accident Compensation Corporation sufficient time to introduce a new claim management system. The amendments are intended to resolve problems of uncertainty in the law and non- compliance by people providing attendant care services, and to remove employer responsibilities from the ACC claimant. Many ACC claimants fully use their payment to purchase caregiver services. In this situation the amount received by the claimant will be treated as exempt income and the withholding tax deducted allowed as a credit against the caregiver’s tax liability. If the caregiver’s income is $9,500 or less, the caregiver’s tax liability will be the same as the withholding tax rate of 15 cents in the dollar. However, if the ACC claimant does not fully use the payment, the provisions in the bill apportion the payment and the tax credit between the ACC claimant and the caregiver according to the amounts retained and paid. Because the amounts received and on-paid will be net of the withholding tax, provisions are necessary to ensure that each party’s income includes the pre-tax amount and the correct portion of the tax credit. This adds some unavoidable complexity to the legislation. However, the provisions will be fully explained in a Tax Information Bulletin item once the bill is enacted. The Accident Compensation Corporation will also be providing information on the change to ACC claimants and caregivers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 117 Issue: Extending the cover over ACC rehabilitation payments Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should be amended to extend the withholding tax that will apply to attendant care payments made by ACC from 1 July 2008 to other similar rehabilitation payments and the tax applied to all payees. The payments subject to the tax would be: attendant care, home help, child care, training for independence, and escorted travel. Comment ACC pays a variety of entitlements to people who have had a personal injury to assist in their rehabilitation. Some of these payments are used to purchase services such as attendant care, home help and child care. This bill subjects attendant care payments to a withholding tax to deal with uncertainty in the law regarding the obligations placed on ACC claimants to deduct tax. It also addresses non-compliance, with respect to tax obligations, by the people providing the services. The intention was that the withholding tax apply only to independent caregivers as the issues mentioned above are not a problem with providers that are contracted to ACC. Subjecting only attendant care payments for independent caregivers to the withholding tax has the following problems: • it will create administrative difficulties for ACC in having to tax only attendant care payments that are paid as part of a package that also includes elements of home help and/or child care; • it could create incentives to re-characterise attendant care payments into other categories of rehabilitation payment that are not subject to the withholding tax; and • it will lead to difficulties for ACC in deciding who should be subject to the tax as there is no formal definition of an “independent caregiver”. To overcome these problems, we recommend that social rehabilitation payments that are for attendant care, home help, child care, training for independence or escorted travel be subject to a withholding tax, and that the tax should apply to all payees. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 118 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNT RULES Clauses 117(1), 118, 119(1), 120, 256 and 257 Issue: BETA debits for DWP on grey list investments Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Provision should be made to prevent the possibility of double taxation resulting from the proposal that debits to branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs) should no longer arise when dividend withholding payment (DWP) is imposed on dividends received from unqualified grey list controlled foreign companies. The purpose of a BETA is to prevent double taxation of foreign income which might otherwise occur as a result of the accrual taxation of controlled foreign companies (CFCs) and foreign investment funds (FIFs), in combination with the imposition of DWP on foreign dividends received by New Zealand companies. The Commentary to the bill pointed out that the generation of BETA debits when DWP is paid on certain dividends received from unqualified grey list CFCs is anomalous because there is no corresponding accrual taxation of the underlying profits. Accordingly, clauses 117(1) and 119(1) would prevent debits arising in these circumstances. PricewaterhouseCoopers points out that a New Zealand resident may have an indirect income interest, through an unqualified grey list CFC, in a foreign entity that is subject to accrual taxation. In that case, the denial of BETA debits relating to profits repatriated to New Zealand via the unqualified grey list CFC may give rise to double taxation, particularly given the operation of tracking accounts under Subpart LF of the Income Tax Act 2004 (underlying foreign tax credits). The submission states that a mechanism should exist to ensure that double taxation does not arise. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants notes that similar problems may arise if an unqualified grey list CFC becomes a tax-concession grey list CFC. The submission says that there should continue to be an ability to debit any DWP paid on dividends from an unqualified grey list CFC if profits distributed have been subject to accrual taxation. Comment Officials consider the concerns raised to be largely theoretical. In practice, taxpayers with controlling interests in foreign companies should generally be able to plan around the problems described. In particular, the proposed denial of BETA debits on dividends from unqualified grey list CFCs would give rise to the possibility of double taxation only when dividends are paid before profits are taxed on accrual. If foreign subsidiaries are under the control of a New Zealand taxpayer, the taxpayer ought to be able to arrange for that subsidiary to attribute income before paying dividends. BETA credits would then continue to be available to offset any DWP liability. 119 As explained in the Commentary, the current availability of BETA debits for certain distributions from unqualified grey list CFCs can leave a company with a pool of surplus debits. Officials consider there to be a material risk that companies may seek to use these surplus debits to offset or defer tax inappropriately, with potential consequences for the tax base. Nevertheless, in view of submissions received, and given that the BETA rules may be affected by the International Tax Review, we recommend that clauses 117(1) and 119(1) be omitted from this bill. We note, however, that the government may wish to return to this issue in a later bill if further examples of surplus debits being used inappropriately are identified. Recommendation That clauses 117(1) and 119(1) be omitted from the bill. Issue: Necessity of changes introduced by clauses 118, 120, 256 and 257 Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section MF 5(6) of the 1994 and 2004 Income Tax Acts already limits the amount of the BETA debit balance that can be offset under subsection (4). New subsections (5B) and (5C), introduced by clauses 118 and 256, seem to achieve nothing more than this existing provision. If, on the other hand, subsections (5B) and (5C) are considered necessary, the two provisions should be merged. Comment The assumption underpinning the existing provision about elections in sections MF 5 and MF 10 is that debits can only be converted into a loss to the extent necessary to offset income tax on attributed CFC income in the absence of New Zealand losses. However, we consider it better to put the matter beyond doubt. New subsection (5B) in section MF 5 is distinguishable from existing subsection (6) because the former deals expressly with the scope of elections under subsection (4) whereas subsection (6) is drafted in terms of the set-off of debits against income tax liability. New subsection (5C)(b) describes the consequences of subsection (5B) in terms consistent with subsection (6). We see no advantage in merging subsections (5B) and (5C) as suggested. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 120 BLACK-HOLE EXPENDITURE Submission (33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submission expresses disappointment that there is no legislative relief for taxpayers from black-hole expenditure. Concerns around black-hole expenditure were discussed as part of the Business Tax Review measures. The submission requests that black-hole expenditure be given a high priority on the next tax policy work programme. Comment The subject of black-hole expenditure is outside of the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 121 COMMISSIONER’S ACCEPTANCE OF A TAXPAYER’S NOTICE OF PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT Issue: Limiting Commissioner’s ability to override acceptance of a taxpayer NOPA Clause 163 Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed change is supported. Comment The bill includes a proposed amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to clarify when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can begin a new tax dispute. The change will make it clear that the Commissioner cannot issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) on the same issue after accepting (or being treated as having accepted) a taxpayer NOPA except when the taxpayer: • was fraudulent; • wilfully misled the Commissioner; or • failed to supply the Commissioner with relevant information. The change will ensure that the disputes procedures have their intended effect. However, to protect the revenue base, the timeframe may be overridden in cases of misrepresentation, material omission or fraud. The submissions support the change as it will provide more certainty to the disputes process. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 122 Issue: Exception for failing to provide relevant information Clause 163 Submissions (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Further guidance needs to be provided on what constitutes “relevant information”. The proposed exceptions to the taxpayer NOPA response period – and in particular the exception for failing to supply relevant information, should require an application to the High Court. Comment The proposed amendment to the disputes rules includes three new exceptions where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will still be able to override the time limits to respond to a taxpayer NOPA. The exceptions proposed apply when a taxpayer has: • been fraudulent; • wilfully misled the Commissioner; or • failed to supply the Commissioner with relevant information. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants has submitted that the Commissioner should be required to apply to the High Court in order to apply these new exceptions. NZICA considers that the proposed exceptions will widen the Commissioner’s powers and, in particular, that failing to supply the Commissioner with relevant information is a relatively low threshold. It also considers that this low threshold is not in line with the importance placed on completing the disputes process and could lead to a lack of equity between the requirements for taxpayers and those for the Commissioner. Officials have reviewed the proposed exceptions to the time limit for responding to a taxpayer NOPA. The exceptions for fraudulent or wilfully misleading taxpayer behaviour are identical to the exceptions for non-application of the time-bar. In respect of the time-bar, no application is required to the High Court and officials consider that the same process should apply to the new exceptions under the disputes rules. However, officials agree that the proposed exception for failing to supply relevant information could create uncertainty. A taxpayer NOPA is already required to have sufficient detail. If it does not meet this requirement, it does not constitute a NOPA and the Commissioner is not subject to the deemed acceptance rule. Therefore, officials consider that the third exception is a duplication of existing requirements within the disputes procedures and should be removed. 123 Inland Revenue Standard Practice Statement 05/04 provides guidance on the meaning of “sufficient detail”. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part by removing the proposed exception for failing to provide relevant information. Issue: Adjustments to assessments Clause 163 Submission (85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The wording of the amendment should specifically prohibit the Commissioner from proposing an adjustment to the assessment on the same issue. Comment Minter Ellison Rudd Watts has submitted that the current wording of the proposed amendment does not prevent the Commissioner from ignoring a taxpayer proposed adjustment by proposing an adjustment to the assessment on the same issue. Officials consider that the proposed wording does prevent such an action as it also refers to any further notice of assessment or further amended assessment issued to the disputant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 124 GST AND EXPORTED GOODS – NEW ITEM Clause 248 Overview An amendment is sought in connection with the application of the GST Act to exported goods when the purchaser takes possession or delivery of the goods in New Zealand. The situation in question involves the goods being exported and shipped on “free-on-board” (FOB) terms when the purchaser uses their own assets to ship the goods. Currently, the GST Act requires GST to apply to such supplies at the standard rate of 12.5%. Officials agree that a narrowly defined rule should be inserted into the GST Act to allow certain goods supplied on a FOB basis to be zero-rated. This is a new item for the Committee to consider and officials request that the change be included in the bill. Issue: Widen the scope of clause 248 to zero-rate goods supplied on free- on-board terms Submission (6 – Bell Gully) The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 does not allow zero-rating in situations when goods are sold in New Zealand and title passes to the purchaser before export – such as goods shipped under free-on-board (FOB) terms of sale using the purchaser’s own assets. In this situation, it is the purchaser and not the seller that undertakes the physical export of the goods. Provided, however, that there is sufficient certainty that the goods will leave New Zealand and that no consumption occurs in New Zealand, there is no good reason for the goods to be taxed at 12.5% rather than zero percent (or zero-rated). Commonly, the problem is overcome using arrangements that treat the purchaser as the seller’s agent. These arrangements are considered undesirable as they impose unnecessary costs to achieve an outcome that should, in principle, be allowed under the legislation. Comment The commodity motivating the submission concerns the supply of oil extracted from New Zealand’s natural field reserves. The first supplies of this product under FOB terms are expected to start in August 2007. 125 The submission notes that the Australian GST system has a zero-rating rule that permits FOB terms of sale to be zero-rated. The absence of a similar provision in New Zealand’s GST Act may result in a loss of commercial opportunity or profit for New Zealand exporters – for example, the supplier may have to potentially carry an unreasonably high GST exposure (if the supplier is forced to supply on terms acceptable only to the purchaser), or even the potential loss of sales. To ensure that New Zealand can offer competitive terms of supply compared with those offered by Australian exporters, the submission recommends an amendment to section 11 of the GST Act which would have the effect of allowing purchasers to take delivery of zero-rated goods in New Zealand, provided that those goods leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply; subject to: • the goods being entered for export under the Customs and Excise Act 1996; • sufficient documentation as evidence that the purchaser has exported the goods; and • the goods in question have not been altered or used except to the extent necessary to prepare them for export. The suggested amendment is not intended to change or alter GST existing rules in relation to personal items or duty-free shopping provisions. The problem The current zero-rating rules in the GST Act in relation to export do not generally apply to goods shipped on FOB terms of sale because a requirement of zero-rating is that the supplier must export the goods. FOB terms of sale means that the purchaser agrees to incur the cost of transporting the goods from New Zealand. If the purchaser undertakes the physical export of the goods, GST will usually apply. GST is not intended to tax consumption that occurs outside New Zealand. “Consumption” is, however, a difficult concept to define with any degree of precision. As a second-best practical solution, the GST Act treats the physical possession of goods in New Zealand as approximating consumption. Therefore, when a non- resident takes possession of goods in New Zealand, those goods are considered as being consumed in New Zealand and subject to GST at the rate of 12.5%. The submission suggests that the current framework is imposing unnecessary costs on exporters by requiring them to engage in unnecessary contractual arrangements. It recommends an amendment to allow exporters to zero-rate goods in commercial transactions even if the export is not undertaken by the supplier. The transactions of particular concern involve supplies of oil extracted from New Zealand’s natural field reserves. Officials agree with the submission as it applies to the supply of goods for commercial use. However, we do not consider that a similar change is required for goods acquired by tourists in New Zealand because, other than in limited situations such as the use of the “sealed-bag” system, these supplies should be treated as final consumption and therefore subject to GST. 126 The proposed solution Officials recommend an amendment be made to the bill to allow exported goods supplied by GST-registered persons and shipped by the purchaser (who is a non- resident) on an FOB basis to be zero-rated provided the following cumulative requirements are met: • the goods are physically exported by the purchaser; • the goods are not intended for reimportation for use other than making taxable or exempt supplies; • the goods are not used or altered in any way by the purchaser, except to the extent necessary to prepare them for export; • the supplier and recipient agree, at or before the time of supply, on the arrangements under which the goods will leave New Zealand; • the goods do not accompany a passenger or crew departing from a New Zealand airport or seaport; and • the supplier retains sufficient information supporting the fact that the goods have left New Zealand. These conditions are similar to the equivalent provisions that apply in Australia. They will apply in addition to the standard requirements imposed by the GST Act which require the supplier to enter the goods for export and for the goods to leave New Zealand within 28 days of the time of supply. The zero-rating restrictions imposed on exported second-hand goods for which an input tax deduction has been obtained will also apply. Application date Officials understand that activities connected with the extraction of oil have been in place for some time but production is unlikely to begin until August/September 2007 because of temperature concerns which could affect the quality of the oil. Supply contracts have, however, been in place since the middle of the year. To ensure that the amendment has application to these supply contracts, and to provide certainty about the GST treatment, officials recommend that the amendment apply to goods supplied on and after the date the bill was introduced – 17 May 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Officials recommend that the scope of clause 248 be extended to permit goods supplied on FOB terms to be zero-rated in defined circumstances. It is recommended that the changes apply to goods supplied on and after the date the bill was introduced, 17 May 2007. 127 GST AND CONSUMABLE STORES Clause 248 Issue: Support for the proposed amendment Submission (6 – Bell Gully, 10 – Deloitte, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submissions agree with the proposed changes to clarify the zero-rating rules as they apply to the supply of consumable stores to vessels and aircraft departing New Zealand. Comment Clause 248 amends the GST Act by clarifying the circumstances when the supply of consumable stores to departing aircraft and commercial ships may be zero-rated. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (10 – Deloitte, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The amendment highlights inadequacies that exist with the current rules. Despite these inadequacies, industry practice has been to zero-rate the supply of consumable stores covered by the amendment as the goods are consumed outside New Zealand. If the amendment applies prospectively, then arrangements that Inland Revenue have not previously questioned could be reviewed and challenged. To prevent this situation from happening, the amendment should apply from 1 October 1986 – the date GST started. Comment The bill currently specifies that clause 248 applies from the date of enactment. Submissions argue that because the clause clarifies an area of law to ensure that it is consistent with the wider policy intent of the GST Act, it should have retrospective application. The original legislation governing the treatment of consumable stores applied from 24 March 1988. 128 While there is a general presumption against making legislation retrospective, possible grounds for justifying retrospective application include: • the law as written is manifestly unjust under the circumstances; or • the law as written has given rise to clear expectations about how it would apply, but it does not apply in the expected manner. By themselves, however, these arguments do not justify retrospective changes in the law. Clause 248 introduces new legislation affecting the treatment of consumable stores supplied to ships (known as motherships) that are designed to transport consumable stores for the purpose of re-supplying fishing vessels that are operating outside New Zealand’s exclusive economic zone (new section 11(1)(l)(iib)). Further, clause 248 amends the definition of “consumable stores”, inserted into the GST Act on 24 October 2001, and the definition of “foreign-going ship” (which was amended at the same time). Officials note that section 11 was restructured and rewritten as part of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. Section 11(1)(l), which is being amended by clause 248, was further amended with effect from 24 October 2001 as part of changes that inserted the definition of “consumable stores” and widened the application of the section to departing visiting pleasure craft. Retrospectively applying clause 248 to 1 October 1986 is therefore likely to require additional drafting to take these earlier changes to section 11(1)(l) into account. The outcome sought by the submissions is the protection of tax positions taken by taxpayers in earlier taxable periods. In light of the fact that the Commissioner cannot increase an assessment after the expiration of the four-year time-bar (except in cases of fraud), officials consider that clauses 248(1) to (3) should apply from 24 October 2001, the date that section 11(1)(l) was last amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Clauses 248(1) to (3) should apply from 24 October 2001, the date section 11(1)(l) was last amended. 129 Issue: Drafting changes Submission (Matter raised by officials) To improve the readability of the section it is recommended that subparagraph (iib) be redrafted to remove unnecessary words. The subparagraph currently reads: “... a foreign-going ship, or a fishing ship, if the fishing ship meets the requirements in subparagraph (ii);” It is recommended that the subparagraph reads: “... a foreign-going ship or to a fishing ship that meets the requirements in subparagraph (ii).” Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 130 GST AND SHARED TAX INVOICES Clauses 246, 250 and 251 Issue: Broadening the scope of GST shared invoicing Submissions (13 – Vodafone, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 74R – Deloitte, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal should be widened to enable shared tax invoices to be issued by independent entities which are not members of a GST group, or do not have a statutory obligation to do so. Vodafone and PricewaterhouseCoopers have also made a number of recommendations on how the government could overcome some of the risks associated with widening the scope of the shared invoicing proposal. Comment The proposal allows two or more suppliers to invoice a customer using one tax invoice. The change is intended to apply to members of the same GST group or those suppliers who have a statutory obligation which makes it practical to use a single invoice. Submissions expressed concern that the proposed changes are too narrow and propose that the shared tax invoices rules apply to a broader range of circumstances. Officials accept that the proposed changes are narrow. This is because allowing one supplier to issue a tax invoice on behalf of multiple suppliers may decrease the chances of Inland Revenue identifying taxpayers who have failed to account for GST, thus increasing the potential for GST-base abuse. However, officials recognise that with appropriate safeguards, there may be potential for the proposed shared tax invoicing rules to apply more broadly. For that to occur, officials would need to examine closely all the issues involved, including considering who should be eligible to use shared tax invoices and what kind of mechanisms are necessary to reduce the possibility for GST-base abuse. Because of the risks involved in relaxing the requirements for tax invoices, this process will take time and will not be completed in sufficient time to meet this bill’s deadlines. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 131 Issue: Inclusion of groups of persons under section 55(8) of the GST Act Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment needs to be extended to include a group of persons under section 55(8) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Comment Officials consider it unnecessary to make any amendments to the clause to include a group of persons under section 55(8) of the GST Act. The proposal in the bill already refers to “the representative member of a group of companies for the purposes of section 55”. Therefore, groups of persons identified by the submission are already covered by the current proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “Grandfathering” current users of shared invoices Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposals should be amended to “grandfather” shared invoices issued before the enactment date, where the supplying companies satisfy the necessary requirements. Comment Officials consider the current rules to be clear on the use of shared tax invoices. Where these invoices have been used in the past, they have been allowed at the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 24(6) of the GST Act. The proposal to allow shared tax invoicing is meant to change the current law and result in future compliance cost reductions for certain taxpayers by not requiring taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner when they wish to use a common tax invoice to bill their clients. In the absence of any ambiguity, officials see no justification for making the proposed legislation retrospective. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 132 CHILD SUPPORT INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN INLAND REVENUE AND CUSTOMS Issue: Definition of “serious default” Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “serious default” needs to be subject to proper public consultation, as set out in the generic tax policy process. “Serious default” should be specifically defined by legislation, or by way of regulation or determination, rather than the proposed changes that would allow satisfying criteria to be determined by Inland Revenue and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (in consultation with the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Customs Service). Comment The definition of “serious default”, as proposed, means “the state of having an amount of financial support debt due and owing to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and satisfying criteria agreed by the Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner in consultation with the Chief Executive”. It is the specific role of the Privacy Commissioner’s Office to examine new legislation for its possible impact on individual privacy, monitor data matching programmes between government departments on an ongoing basis, and also inquire into any matter where it appears that individual privacy may be affected. Officials therefore consider that the requirement for Inland Revenue to consult with and agree criteria with the Privacy Commissioner’s Office will ensure that the interests of all parties concerned will be sufficiently considered and dealt with. Further, officials consider that the proposed definition of serious default will introduce a degree of flexibility by allowing for periodic reviews to ensure that criteria previously agreed upon between Inland Revenue and the Privacy Commissioner’s Office remain appropriate, equitable and workable. While administratively there is likely to be a threshold under which debt will generally not qualify as giving rise to serious default, we do not consider a specific fixed level of financial support debt in legislation to be a preferable option as it would prevent cases being considered on an individual basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 133 Issue: Financial support debt should not include penalties or interest Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “financial support debt” should not include any penalties or interest under the Child Support Act 1991, as penalties and interest under the Child Support Act are excessive, accumulate quickly, and have the effect of making the liable parent’s situation look much worse than it actually is. Comment The purpose of the proposed information sharing between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service is to allow Inland Revenue to identify when individuals with outstanding child support debt are entering or leaving New Zealand. In the first instance, this will be to allow Inland Revenue to contact liable parents when they are in New Zealand to discuss their child support debt and, where possible, come to a voluntary arrangement with them. It is relevant to note that penalty rules have recently been amended to allow relief from penalties when an individual enters into an instalment arrangement with Inland Revenue. Officials consider that the circumstances that have given rise to penalties and interest can often be relevant when considering whether an individual is in serious default. Penalties and interest should not therefore be excluded from criteria to be considered by Inland Revenue and the Privacy Commissioner’s Office when determining whether a person liable to pay financial support under the Child Support Act 1991 is in serious default. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The child support penalty structure should be changed Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Child Support Act 1991 should be amended to change its penalty structure, and to reduce initial and incremental late penalty rates. Comment The submission is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 134 TAX EXEMPTION FOR HOSPITALS OPERATED AS CHARITIES Clauses 19, 20, 21, 253 and 254(3) Issue: Support for proposal Submissions (42 – Auckland City Council and Metrowater, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submissions support the proposal that council-controlled organisations (CCOs) which operate hospitals as charities should be exempt from income tax. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Broadening or extending the exemption Submissions (34 – Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Ltd, 42 – Auckland City Council and Metrowater, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exemption should be broadened so that any CCO that has a charitable purpose, as defined under the Charities Act 2005, will qualify as a charity to which the income tax exemption applies. (Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Ltd) The income tax exemption should be extended to cover any CCO that is a public benefit entity established for charitable purposes. (Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Ltd, Auckland City Council and Metrowater, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment When the Local Government Act was amended in 1989 to permit councils to establish local authority trading enterprises (now called CCOs) it was intended that these council-controlled businesses would face the same commercial pressures as any other firms – including the requirement to pay tax. However, it became apparent that, because of the very broad legal meaning of “charity”, most activities carried out by CCOs could be structured to obtain tax-exempt status. Accordingly, the Income Tax Act was amended to exclude CCOs from the charitable tax exemption. 135 Allowing hospitals operated by CCOs to claim the tax exemption is correct because District Health Boards are exempt from income tax. Extending the exemption to all CCOs that have a charitable purpose, or meet the “public benefit” charity tests is not correct. This is because of the wide range of commercial activities that are conducted within CCOs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Charitable CCOs that are not operating in competition Submission (34 – Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Ltd) The proposed legislation should be amended to allow charitable CCOs that are not operating in competition with private sector organisations to use the charities income tax exemption. Comment The general policy is that CCOs that undertake a business activity, whether charitable or not, should be taxpayers. The specific exemption for CCOs that are hospitals is because government owned hospitals (district health boards) are tax exempt and there is no reason to not apply this treatment to local authority-owned hospitals. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of the term “hospital” Submission (34 – Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Ltd) The term “hospital” should be defined to provide clarity in the scope of its meaning. Comment When terms are not defined in statute, they take their common meaning. For example, the Concise Oxford Dictionary meaning of “hospital” is: “An institution providing medical and surgical treatment and nursing care for ill or injured people.” 136 Officials are aware of only one hospital that is operated by a CCO. We consider that there is little risk of confusion occurring over when the exemption should apply and when it should not. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Subsidiaries of CCOs Submission (34 – Toovey Eaton & Macdonald Ltd) The proposed legislation should clarify whether subsidiaries of CCOs will qualify for the exemption. Comment The definition of “council-controlled organisation” in the Income Tax Act 2004 includes: “(b) a company that is a council-controlled organisation, under paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of council-controlled organisation in section 6(1) of the Local Government Act 2002”. Paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of council-controlled organisation in the Local Government Act includes: “(a) a company – (i) in which equity securities carrying 50% or more of the voting rights at a meeting of the shareholders of the company are – (A) held by one or more local authorities; or (B) controlled, directly or indirectly by one or more local authorities;” A subsidiary of a CCO would generally be a CCO itself, by virtue of paragraph (a)(i)(B) of the definition above. This is because it would be controlled directly or indirectly by one or more local authorities. If it did not satisfy the definition of a CCO – say, because it was not controlled by one or more local authorities, it should not, and would not qualify for the exemption. Officials consider that the amendment currently reflects the policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 137 TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY COSTS Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority presents a very good forum for people with smaller tax disputes to have their case determined in front of an independent arbitrator. A filing fee of $400 may represent a significant barrier to these people. Comment The proposed empowering provision in the bill would allow the government to make regulations to prescribe circumstances in which any fees may be refunded, remitted, or waived. The government already has the power to make regulations to prescribe the amount of any fees to be paid under section 30(2)(d) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. The decision on the amount of the proposed filing fee was made by the government following recommendations from the Working Party on Civil Court Fees. The Working Party made its recommendations on courts’ and tribunals’ fees after consulting a large number of stakeholders. The $400 set for the Taxation Review Authority is the same as that proposed for a number of other tribunals. Officials do not consider that the increased fee would reduce the attractiveness of the Taxation Review Authority for people with smaller tax disputes. The cost of bringing proceedings in the Taxation Review Authority will still be less than in higher courts and, under the proposal, some litigants will be eligible to have their fee waived if they are unable to pay or if it is warranted by the public benefit of the case. It should also be noted that the disputant taxpayer may be able to receive the fee back as an award of costs if the dispute is decided in their favour. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 138 PROGRESSIVE TAX RATES ON BANK ACCOUNTS Submission (2 – John Fittock) The progressive tax rates applying to interest paid on bank savings accounts act as a disincentive to saving. A flat tax rate should apply instead. Comment Progressive taxation is a fundamental feature of the New Zealand tax system. Deducting tax at a flat rate from interest received on bank accounts would undermine horizontal equity in taxation, where people earning the same income are taxed at more or less the same average rate, no matter what form the income is received in. Officials also note that this is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 139 Remedial amendments 141 ALIGNMENT OF PROVISIONAL TAX PAYMENTS WITH GST Issue: Support for provisional tax payment frequency Clauses 101 and 249 Submissions (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA supports the proposed change in the bill to make it clear that taxpayers will only have to make two provisional tax payments when they cease using the GST ratio method and move to paying GST six-monthly. NZICA also agrees with the changes to provide additional time to file special GST returns over the Christmas and Easter periods. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Determining ratio percentage based on earlier years’ information Clause 102 Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When the legislation aligning provisional tax payments with GST was enacted, taxpayers that had not filed last year's return could have their GST ratio based on information from two years earlier. The current bill extends this to three years when there is an extension of time to file an income tax return. NZICA agrees with the amendment but suggests that the provision should be extended to instances where the taxpayer is in a dispute with Inland Revenue. Comment Officials agree that taxpayers who are in dispute with the department over a return should have their ratio based on information from three years earlier. If the amendment is not made then taxpayers in dispute would not be able to use the ratio until the dispute was resolved. 142 Officials have also identified two other sections which require amendment, sections MB 7(7) and MB 15(11) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Both of these sections deal with basing the GST ratio on figures from two years ago when last year’s return has not been filed. These sections should also be amended to enable information from three years ago to be used if later information is not available as a result of an extension of time to file, a dispute with the department, or in relation to section MB 7(7), when a later year is a transitional year (in which the taxpayer changed their balance date). Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that related amendments to sections MB 7(7) and MB 15(11) also be made. Issue: Sale of assets Clause 106 Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who account for GST on a payments basis and who use the GST ratio method are able to exclude asset sales if they have received payment for the asset, when basing provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST-taxable supplies. The wording of the current provision dealing with adjustments for asset sales (section MB 18) is linked to the ratio calculation formula in section MB 10. However, when the amendment proposed in the bill was drafted it omitted the link to the ratio calculation formula. The submission proposes that the link be restored. The submission also proposes that the wording of section MB 18 be redrafted to increase the clarity of the section. Comment Officials agree that the link to the ratio calculation formula should be reinstated but do not consider that the proposed wording would further clarify the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 143 Issue: Imposition of late payment penalty on GST ratio taxpayers Clause 177 Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The late payment penalty should not penalise taxpayers who comply with the GST ratio method of calculating provisional tax but who end up owing money at the end of the year. Taxpayers using the GST ratio method would expect that if they have met their provisional tax obligations they would be free from late-payment penalties. Comment Officials agree that taxpayers who meet their personal tax obligations under the GST ratio method should not be subject to the late payment penalty. No legislative change is required to achieve this as the legislative amendment included in the bill only imposes a penalty when the taxpayer fails to pay their provisional tax liability, calculated using the ratio method, by the due date. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: New provisional taxpayers Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A drafting oversight with section MB 8(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 has led to new provisional taxpayers being required to make provisional tax payments during their first year. This was not the original intention and NZICA has requested that the legislation be amended to remove the requirement for new provisional taxpayers to make provisional tax payments during the year. Comment Officials agree with the points raised in the submission and also recommend that further amendments should be made to clarify the treatment of new provisional taxpayers. The first is to remove the words “in relation to which they pay GST” from section MB 8(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that a provisional taxpayer who is not registered for GST would still be liable for provisional tax. The other amendments are to section MB 8(8) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 120KC(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify that a new provisional taxpayer who accounts for GST six-monthly is required to make two provisional tax instalments during the year. 144 The further amendments ensure that the provision applies to all situations where a new provisional taxpayer could be liable for provisional tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that two further amendments proposed by officials also be made. Issue: Exiting ratio method Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers who exit the ratio method should be allowed to use the safe harbour method of calculating provisional tax instead of being required to estimate, with exposure to use-of-money interest. Also, sections MB 17(5) and MB 6(5) duplicate advice to taxpayers who stop using the ratio method to change to the estimation option. NZICA recommends that these sections be amalgamated. Comment The ratio method was introduced to enable tax payments to more closely align with income flows by basing provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST taxable supplies. Also, taxpayers who use the ratio method are not subject to use-of- money interest if they comply with the ratio method. Enabling taxpayers to transfer between the ratio method and standard methods of calculating provisional tax would provide an opportunity for taxpayers to swap between the two regulations in order to pay the least amount of tax during the year, without being liable for use-of-money interest. This was not what the government intended when it introduced the ratio method. Neither is it possible to amalgamate sections MB 17(5) and MB 6(5). Each section takes a different approach, one section deals with estimating provisional tax and the other with exiting the ratio method. Although there is some repetition between the two sections for completeness there is a need to retain both, with relevant cross- referencing between the two sections. Officials recommend no change be made to the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 145 Issue: Due date for payment of provisional tax Submission (71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Legislation was enacted last year to extend the due date for March GST returns from 28 April to 7 May. The submission has identified two legislative oversights whereby the section that deals with the due date for payments of provisional tax in a transitional year has not been amended to reflect the extension of the due date to 7 May. The submission recommends that sections MB 20(2) and (3) be amended to allow an extension of the due date to 7 May. Comment Officials agree that these amendments are required. Officials have also identified other instances where legislation should provide for an extension of the due date – section MB 24(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 120KD(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The first provision specifies the due date for the final provisional tax payment where the taxpayer changes their balance date and the other provision specifies the date that interest starts, being the day after the due date. These sections currently do not allow an extension of the due date if the final payment occurs during the Christmas or Easter period. We recommend that these two sections also be amended to ensure that where the final period ends in November or March, that the due date is 15 January or 7 May respectively. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cancellation of registration Submission (Matter raised by officials) Taxpayers that advise Inland Revenue of their intention to cancel their GST registration from a future due date should be able to change from making two provisional tax payments to the standard three payments from that future date. Comment When a taxpayer who accounts for GST on a six-monthly basis cancels their GST registration, they move from paying two provisional tax payments a year to the standard three payments per year. 146 Currently the date this occurs from is the date of notification of intention to cancel registration. However, some taxpayers notify Inland Revenue in advance that they intend to cease registration from a future date. In these situations the legislation requires that provisional tax payments change immediately even though it could be months before the taxpayer ceases registration. Officials propose that section MB 25(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004 be amended to allow the change from two payments to three provisional tax payments to occur from the later of the date the taxpayer notified Inland Revenue of the change or the date the GST registration ceases. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use-of-money interest on payments in a transitional year Submission (Matter raised by officials) To ensure that for the purpose of calculating use-of-money interest, provisional tax will be due in two instalments; when a taxpayer starts a business after the first provisional tax instalment date and up to 30 days before the second instalment date. Comment Currently section 120KC (1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act only imposes use-of- money interest when two provisional tax payments are made by taxpayers registered for GST six-monthly. There is another situation where a provisional taxpayer makes two provisional tax payments in a year – where they commence business after the first provisional tax instalment date and up to 30 days before the second instalment date. Officials propose that the use-of-money interest provisions cater for this situation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 147 Issue: Taxpayers who use the ratio method not subject to use-of-money interest Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 120KD(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to ensure that use-of-money interest does not apply to ratio taxpayers in a transitional year. Comment One of the features of the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax is that taxpayers who use this method are not subject to use-of-money interest. However, section 120KD(1) of the Tax Administration Act does not specifically exclude taxpayers who use the ratio method in a transitional year (the year in which they change their balance date) from the use-of-money interest rules. Officials recommend that the section be amended to specifically exclude taxpayers from the use-of-money interest rules when they use the ratio method in a transitional year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting corrections Submission (Matter raised by officials) There are a number of drafting references and examples that need to be corrected, including: • the lack of cross-reference between section MB 8(6) and the determination section; • the reference to 15 January in the example at the end of section MB 13; • the reference to 7 months in the third table in the Schedule 13, Part B; and • the example in section 120KC. Comment The section that deals with taxpayers changing the method they use to determine provisional tax (section MB 8(6)) currently refers to the section that calculates the amount of provisional tax payable (section MB 9(1)(b)). However, the calculation section does not refer back to the determination section. Officials recommend that an amendment be made to ensure both sections cross-reference for increased clarity. 148 The example at the end of section MB 13 incorrectly refers to “20 January” as the due date for payments of provisional tax that would be due in December. The date should be “15 January”. The third table in Schedule 13, Part B of the Income Tax Act 2004, contains three tables. The reference in the left-hand column of the last table incorrectly refers to “7- mths”. This should be amended to refer to “7-8 mths”. The example at the end of section 120KC currently refers in the section heading to 120KC. This section heading reference should be amended to correctly refer to section 120KD. Also, the example at the end of section 120KD should be amended to change the section heading reference from 120KD to 120KE. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Extending GST ratio method to shareholders of close companies and partnerships Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Currently the ratio method only applies when the GST and provisional tax are paid by the same entity. The submission proposes that the GST ratio method should be extended to shareholders in close companies and partners in a partnership. Comment This question has been raised before by NZICA. It is scheduled to be included in the post-implementation review of the GST and provisional tax changes which will take place in 2009 when the rules have been in operation for a year. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 149 Issue: Changing terminal tax date Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The terminal tax due dates should be aligned with provisional tax and GST payment dates (the 28th of the relevant month). This would provide a consistent date and enable GST refunds to be offset against terminal tax payments. Comment The due date for the payment of terminal tax falls on the 7th of the month, with the date being extended to the 15th of January if the due date is the 7th of January. Shifting the terminal tax date from the 7th to the 28th of the month would have a significant cost to the government and is outside the scope of these proposals. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extending the ratio method to new business taxpayers Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The ratio method should be extended so that new businesses can use the ratio in their first years in business. This would assist in getting businesses to pay tax as soon as possible to avoid the large payment trap in their second year. To address the problem of a business not knowing what ratio to use without figures from earlier years to base the ratio on, the submission proposes that the new business should be able to use a standard default ratio or a self-select ratio (within reasonable parameters) to deter taxpayers from getting it wrong. Comment Currently the ratio method is limited to taxpayers who have been in business for the whole of the preceding year and for whom tax information is available on which to base the ratio for their specific business. It is difficult to determine the ratio level without the earlier year’s tax figures being available, especially when the business is starting out. Industry average rates only suit businesses which are around the middle of the distribution. However, the ratios that apply to businesses within the same industry vary significantly in their level of expenses and net profit ratios. If the ratio is set too low then too little tax will be deducted during the year, requiring tax to be paid at year-end. Deducting tax at too 150 high a rate can be financially detrimental to the business at the very time when the business is starting out and growing. Adopting a standard ratio may not resolve the tax-induced financial difficulties faced by some businesses and could impose these financial difficulties on other businesses that would not otherwise have faced them. There are other mechanisms available to provide an incentive for new businesses to pay tax in their first year in business, such as the early payment discount which provides a 6.7% tax-free return on voluntary payments to Inland Revenue in their first year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extending the filing date for November GST returns from 15 to 20 January Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Currently, the GST return for the November period is due on 15 January, to give taxpayers time to file the return as a result of the Christmas period. The majority of provisional taxpayers are required to make a provisional tax payment on 15 January as well. The submission states that many businesses and tax agents are on holiday during this period and it is difficult to contact clients and obtain the necessary information by 15 January. The submission proposes that the due date be moved to 20 January. Comment When the legislation aligning the payment of provisional tax with GST was introduced it extended the due date for the November GST return and the payment of provisional tax from 15 January to 20 January. The due date was subsequently changed back to 15 January as having all payments due on one date over the Christmas period would have a significant impact on Inland Revenue and the Westpac bank that processes Inland Revenue payments, resulting in a backlog of payments. Taxpayers would also be required to find a significant amount of money for payment of provisional tax and GST as well as terminal tax and PAYE, all of which would be due on 20 January. Retaining the 15th as the due date also enables Westpac and taxpayers to stagger the payment of GST/provisional tax and the payment of terminal tax and PAYE to smooth workflows and the financial impact on taxpayers. 151 It is therefore recommended that the due date for the payment of provisional tax and GST payments remains 15 January. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extending the 28 October due date to 7 November Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A previous legislative amendment moved the April GST and provisional tax due date to 7 May as a result of the high number of GST returns in the month of April and the difficulty this places on businesses and tax agents’ workloads. NZICA considers that a similar amendment should be made to extend the due date for September GST returns and provisional tax from 28 October to 7 November because of agents’ workflow pressures in this period. Many tax practices have the majority of their clients with six-monthly GST cycles, for which returns are due in October. To add to the problems, Labour Day always falls in the latter part of the month and many clients are unable to get their GST information to their agents until the last couple of weeks, leaving little time to finalise the returns. There are only 22 working days available to prepare returns. Comment The April GST due date was moved to 7 May because the majority of GST taxpayers (six-monthly, two-monthly, and monthly filers) have a payment due in April. Also, the Easter holiday period and Anzac holiday resulted in up to three working days being lost in the month. The same situation does not occur for October. Although there may be tax agents that have a high workload during this period, the majority of taxpayers do not have a GST and provisional tax payment due in October. Also, there is just one statutory holiday in October and there are other months where the number of working days available is lower than the 22 days during October. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 152 LARGE BUDGET SCREEN PRODUCTION GRANTS Clauses 32 and 41 to 44 Issue: Costs of film production and of acquiring film rights Submission (31 – New Zealand Screen Council) The opening words of proposed section EJ 4(1) (Expenditure incurred in acquiring film rights in films other than feature films) and EJ 5(1) (Expenditure incurred in acquiring film rights in films other than feature films) do not make it clear that the sections apply to both expenditure incurred in acquiring film rights and to film production. They should be amended accordingly. Comment Income tax legislation has recently been rewritten with the primary aim of producing legislation that clearly and unambiguously states the policy. One of the ways in which this was achieved was separating the rules for the deductibility of costs incurred in acquiring film rights from those relating to film production expenditure. With hindsight, the amendments in the bill do not recognise that distinction as well as they might. Officials agree with the tenor of the submission, and we will reconsider redrafting the amendment to ensure that this distinction remains apparent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Films disposed of before completion Submissions (31 – New Zealand Screen Council, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) At present it does not seem to be possible to claim a deduction for the cost of a film that is not completed. Before introduction of the Income Tax Act 2004, a deduction could be claimed under section EO 3(6) of the Income Tax Act 1994. (New Zealand Screen Council) The ambit of section DS 2 should be expanded to include production expenditure when a film is not completed or a film right is not acquired. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 153 Comment Before the introduction of the Income Tax Act 2004, a deduction was available for film costs, if a film owner or an owner of a right in a film ceased to own that film, or that right, before the film was completed. This deduction should be reinstated. However, the deduction should only be available to the current owner of any film or a right in a film. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Drafting Submission (31 – New Zealand Screen Council) The wording of section EJ 5(1) should be checked to ensure that all words currently in section EJ 5(1)(b) are intended to apply to section EJ 5(1)(b) alone. Comment The proposed new section EJ 5(1) reads: (1) A deduction for expenditure that a person incurs in acquiring a film right is allocated under this section if the film is not a feature film and – (a) the deduction is under section DS 1 (Acquiring film rights): (b) the deduction is under section DS 2 (Film production expenditure) and the film is one for which a large budget screen production grant is made. Section EJ 5 provides for the expenditure to be written off over two years from the date of completion. This treatment applies to all acquisition costs if the film is not a feature film. However, film production costs of non-feature films can be written off over one year for New Zealand films, if a large budget screen production grant is not made. Therefore, the words in paragraph (b) are correctly limited to paragraph (b). Whether or not a large budget screen production grant is paid, the cost of acquiring film rights can be written off over two years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 MISCELLANEOUS REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Australian imputation credit account company eligibility Submission (56 – Westpac) The repeal of section ME 1(2)(a) in 2006 appears to have had the unintended consequence of restricting the ability of certain Australian-resident companies to elect to establish and maintain an imputation credit account under section ME 1A(1). The repeal of section ME 1(2)(a) should therefore be reversed. Comment Officials agree that the repeal of section ME 1(2)(a) had the unintended consequence of restricting eligibility to be an Australian imputation credit account company. Section ME 1(2)(a) was repealed because it was a redundant provision; it is the cross- reference to this provision in section ME 1A(1) which causes the current problem. Instead of reinstating section ME 1(2)(a), officials consider that the problem identified by the submission can best be addressed by removing the cross-references to section ME 1(2)(a) and (b) from section ME 1A(1). The opening wording of section ME 1A(1) would therefore refer to a company that is not excluded by section ME 1(2)(c) to (i) from the obligation under section ME 1 to establish and maintain an imputation credit account. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Exclusion of land developed for owner’s own business Clauses 6 to 8 Submission (52 – Tower, 74 – Deloitte) The amendments to section CB 11 to exclude land developed for the owner’s own business or investment purposes should be supported. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 155 Issue: Disposals of land subject to major development Clauses 6 to 8 Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The ambit of section CB 11 should be restored to its state as originally enacted to include a test that the scheme or undertaking be carried on for subsequent sale. The application date should not refer to taking a position relating to the disposal in a return. Comment The provision should include a test that the scheme or undertaking be carried on for subsequent sale Officials do not agree with the submission. The policy at the time of the enactment of the land sales rules in 1973 was that profits from the sale of land should be taxed if: • the land had been subject to schemes or undertakings involving the development or subdivision of land; and • the scheme or undertaking gave rise to a significant change in the whole character of the use of the land. Before enactment of the land sale rules in 1973, this policy intention was expressed in section 88(1)(c) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, which contained a “purpose or intention of sale test”. However, the courts had consistently taken a view that this purpose or intention test could only apply to land that was held on revenue account and did not apply to disposals of land held on capital account. As a result, section 88AA(1)(e) \[CB 11 – 2004 Act\] was enacted to overcome these court decisions and to achieve the intended policy result. Officials consider the language of section CB 11 accurately reflects the provision as enacted in 1973 as section 88AA(1)(e) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. The language of section CB 11 accurately reflects the original policy intention that the application of the provision depends on three factors, none of which includes a profit- making purpose: • a sale of land; • the owner of the land has carried on or carried out a scheme or undertaking involving the development or subdivision of the land; and • the owner has incurred significant expenditure of the types referred to in the section. However, a policy statement by the Commissioner in PIB No. 126 in 1984 shows that it was not intended for section CB 11 to apply to a sale of land that the owner had developed, subdivided or improved for the use in and purposes of: 156 • A business carried on by the owner (including farming and any other businesses carried on from the premises). This exception is not intended to apply to a land developer. • A private residence for the owner and any member of his or her family living with him or her. • The deriving by the owner of rents or similar revenues from that property. In more recent years large-scale developments of land for the owner’s own business use (such as retail malls) involve quite significant expenditures. The Commissioner now considers that these expenditures could fall within the meaning of “significant expenditure” of the types referred to in section CB 11. Therefore, officials consider that the current drafting of section CB 11 does not adequately protect landowners carrying on a major land development for their own commercial purposes (other than a land developer) and that the business and investments exclusions should now apply to section CB 11. This approach is also consistent with the exclusions to section CB 10 for developments or subdivisions of land undertaken for the land owner’s own commercial activities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. The application date should not refer to taking a position relating to the disposal in a return Officials do not agree with the submission. Section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires a taxpayer to self-assess their taxable income for a tax year. Officials agree with the submission that in making that self-assessment, the taxpayer must have taken a tax position on whether the profit on the sale of land subject to a major development should be included in the calculation of taxable income for a tax year. As the Commissioner now considers section CB 11 applies to a sale of land on which a major development has occurred, the Commissioner has the discretion to reassess earlier tax years under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This discretion applies on an unlimited retrospective basis where the taxpayer has omitted to include income from any source or is of a particular type (section 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Officials therefore consider it is important that this amendment provide assurance to taxpayers who have taken a tax position for prior tax years not to include in their taxable income calculation a profit on the sale of land on which a major development has occurred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 157 Other matters raised by officials 159 VENTURE CAPITAL EXEMPTION Overview Section CW 11B of the Income Tax Act 2004 was introduced, with effect from 1 October 2005, with the intention of facilitating increased offshore venture capital investment into New Zealand. The section removes a potentially significant tax obstacle to in-bound venture capital investment, by removing any risk that a qualifying non-resident venture capital investor selling shares in an eligible New Zealand company could be subject to New Zealand income tax on any gain arising from the sale. One of the requirements of section CW 11B is that the investor must be from a jurisdiction approved by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Broadly, a jurisdiction will only be approved if effective exchange of information arrangements are in place with New Zealand. Until recently, New Zealand has only entered into exchange of information arrangements through its double tax agreements (DTAs). It is understood that most venture capital investment is structured to come through nil or low tax jurisdictions. However, New Zealand generally does not conclude DTAs with nil or low tax jurisdictions. Therefore section CW 11B has until now had little effect on encouraging venture capital investment into New Zealand. New Zealand is now beginning to conclude tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with nil or low tax jurisdictions. TIEAs will satisfy the requirement for effective exchange of information arrangements. However, officials have identified two technical problems that may render section CW 11B ineffective when the relevant treaty is a TIEA rather than a DTA: • Section CW 11B requires a determination of the investor’s residence, but a technical problem with the current mechanism specified for determining residence may prevent an investor in a nil or low tax jurisdiction from qualifying for the exemption. • Section CW 11B provides that a qualifying investor must be treated by the taxation laws of their home jurisdiction in a particular manner, depending on the category of investor. However, a nil or low tax jurisdiction will be unlikely to have the specifically required taxation laws. In addition, officials note that, in relation to nil or low tax jurisdictions, section CW 11B could be exploited by New Zealanders through a simple structuring arrangement that would enable them to avoid New Zealand tax on gains on the sale of the shares in New Zealand companies. A technical amendment to the rules is therefore required to ensure that the original policy intention of limiting the exemption to qualifying non- resident investors is preserved. This matter has been raised with representatives of the New Zealand venture capital industry. The industry representatives have indicated general support for any measure that might have the effect of further encouraging venture capital investment into New Zealand. Officials therefore recommend that these technical problems be addressed in the current bill. 160 Issue: Determining the residence of the investor Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section CW 11B requires a determination of the investor’s residence. Two tests for residence are prescribed: in the presence of a DTA between New Zealand and the other jurisdiction, residence is to be determined under the DTA; in the absence of a DTA, residence is to be determined under the domestic law of the other jurisdiction. The tests for residence should be amended to provide that, notwithstanding the existence of a DTA, if residence cannot be determined under that DTA then it is to be determined under the domestic law of the other jurisdiction. Comment Technically, a TIEA is a DTA for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, but TIEAs do not generally include any tests for residence. Therefore an investor from a nil or low tax jurisdiction may fail to satisfy the residence requirement of section CW 11B for purely technical reasons. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reference to “Taxation Laws” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The wording of section CW 11B should be amended to ensure that investors from nil or low tax jurisdictions do not fail to qualify simply because their home jurisdiction has no applicable taxation laws. Comment Section CW 11B defines three separate categories of qualifying investor – “foreign exempt person”, “foreign exempt entity” and “foreign exempt partnership”. Each definition requires the investor to be specifically treated in a certain manner by the taxation laws of the jurisdiction concerned. Broadly, the intention is that the investor must be tax-exempt in their home jurisdiction, and hence unable to claim any relief or benefit for New Zealand tax (in other words, they have no home jurisdiction tax to credit New Zealand tax against). A nil or low tax jurisdiction may not actually impose income tax, but because there is no specific taxation law rendering the investor exempt, section CW 11B will fail to apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 Issue: Mechanism for detecting New Zealand ownership of offshore entities Submission (Matter raised by officials) A “look-through” rule should be inserted into the legislation to prevent any New Zealand direct or indirect owner or member of an offshore entity established in a nil or low tax jurisdiction from gaining the benefit of the section CW 11B exemption. Comment Many nil or low tax jurisdictions operate an “offshore sector”, in which it is relatively simple to set up a foreign-owned legal entity such as an international business company (IBC). However, section CW 11B contains no mechanism for detecting, for example, the case of a New Zealander setting up an IBC in a nil or low tax jurisdiction to hold shares (either directly or indirectly) in a New Zealand company. Therefore, by means of a simple structuring arrangement, a New Zealander can gain access to an exemption from any gain on the sale of shares that would otherwise be taxable in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 162 GREY LIST COMPANY DEFINITION: DRAFTING CORRECTION Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “grey list company” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act should be amended to include foreign investment funds (FIFs) as well as controlled foreign companies (CFCs) (section EX 33). Comment In 2006, the Income Tax Act was amended to allow investors in foreign hybrids to receive grey list treatment and foreign tax credits for tax they pay overseas on income earned by a foreign hybrid. A foreign hybrid is an entity that has the characteristics of both a company and a partnership. It is treated as a company for New Zealand tax purposes, but is treated like a partnership (with “flow-through” tax treatment) or a branch of the parent company under another country’s tax system. The changes were to apply to foreign hybrids that were either a CFC or a FIF. Accordingly, the grey list exemptions in sections EX 24 (CFCs) and EX 33 (FIFs) were amended to enable taxpayers to receive a grey list exemption for investments in foreign hybrids. The underlying foreign tax credit rules in subpart LF were amended to allow shareholders to receive credits to offset their foreign dividend withholding payment for tax paid in respect of the foreign hybrid. The definition of “grey list company” in section OB 1 was also amended last year. It now refers to CFCs for the purposes of subpart LF by including a reference to section EX 24. However, it does not refer to section EX 33. This is an oversight and an amendment should therefore be made to the definition of “grey list company” to ensure it encompasses FIFs as well as CFCs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

contributions if an employee is contributing to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. The compulsory contributions are phased in over four years, starting at 1% from 1 April 2008 and reaching 4% of gross salary or wages from 1 April 2011. • An employer tax credit of up to $20 a week for each employee to reimburse employers for their contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund. The bill also contains a number of technical amendments to fine-tune the scheme as enacted last year in the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Two supplementary order papers (SOP No. 130 and SOP No 139) were released by the government and referred to the Committee for consideration and inclusion in the bill. The key features of the SOPs are: • Amendments to the member tax credit rules clarifying the relevant period of membership for the calculation of the credit (so that contributions held by Inland Revenue are included in contributions received for the purpose of calculating the member tax credit), and remedying a drafting error with the basic formula used to calculate the amount of the credit. • Amendments relating to complying superannuation funds to require employer participation agreements to be lodged with the Government Actuary and a requirement that members of such schemes will have the option to make a lump sum withdrawal. • Amendments to the rules that allow employer contributions to an existing superannuation scheme to count towards compulsory employer contributions, to explicitly include employer contributions and superannuation subsidies paid to Members of Parliament, judicial officers, and sworn members of the Police. Additional classes of employees may be prescribed by regulations. • The requirement for providers to disclose their approach to responsible investment. Issues relating to the member tax credit raised in supplementary submissions on SOP No. 130 will be considered in a later volume. 1 Other enhancements announced as part of Budget 2007 were contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Bill, which was tabled during the Budget debate and passed through its final stages in Parliament on 18 May. 4 Over 40 submissions on the proposed KiwiSaver changes were received. Most of the submissions supported the enhancements and focussed on technical matters. A small number of the submissions opposed the introduction of the compulsory employer contribution and others commented on the policy process relating to the announcements in Budget 2007, including the lack of consultation. Officials consider that the key policy issues include: • the minimum employee contribution rate of 4% and whether it should be lowered to 2%; • the impact of compulsory employer contributions on existing employment agreements; and • the age of eligibility for compulsory employer contributions and the member tax credit. The key technical submissions relate to: • What existing employer contributions should be included in the concept of “other contributions”. The amount of “other contributions” is offset against the amount of compulsory employer contribution so that employers who are contributing do not have to contribute twice. • The proposed change that will require contributions to a complying superannuation fund to be based on “gross salary or wages” rather than “gross base salary”. • The need to legislate rules around invalid accounts. A number of submissions commented on the need to renumber subpart KJ as it covers both the member tax credit (as enacted in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007) and the employer tax credit, which is included in the bill. SOP No.130 renumbers the employer tax credit provisions. Some submissions commented on the need for the design and administration of KiwiSaver to be practicable and minimise compliance costs for employers, employees and providers. Officials acknowledge the importance of this, which is reflected in our recommendations, as appropriate. 5 POLICY RATIONALE AND PROCESS Issue: Policy rationale Submission (81 and 81A – Retirement Policy and Research Centre, The University of Auckland) There are major concerns of principle with KiwiSaver as it has now evolved. What started as a relatively simple, universal workplace-based retirement savings scheme (“KiwiSaver I”) has now emerged as “KiwiSaver II”, a complex, distortionary, expensive instrument that will add significantly to the cost to New Zealand of our ageing population. Concerns include: • the way KiwiSaver I was transformed, virtually overnight and without debate; • the potential threat that KiwiSaver II now poses to the long-term future of New Zealand Superannuation; • the absence of a rigorous justification for the changes to KiwiSaver I in the bill; • the process of change; • the absence of local evidence to support the rewrite of the KiwiSaver I framework, even before it began; • the failure to acknowledge international evidence that indicates KiwiSaver II probably will not “work” (increased national savings to the extent justified by the costs); • the failure of KiwiSaver II to meet the standards suggested by the OECD for the measurement of good regulatory changes; and • the way in which the government seems now to have re-politicised superannuation as an issue. KiwiSaver II may not change anything of substance in the face of New Zealand’s ageing population, but will re-arrange things without growth in output, and KiwiSaver II may make things worse. Comment Several submissions dispute the policy rationale for the KiwiSaver package and its likely impact. Others support both the policy intent of the enhancements and their contribution to the objectives of encouraging a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement. 6 Consultation on changes to the KiwiSaver scheme is being done through the Select Committee process, as was signalled when the proposals were announced in Budget 2007. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Regulatory impact statement Submissions (9 – New Zealand Business Roundtable, 81 and 81A – Retirement Policy and Research Centre, The University of Auckland Business School) The bill should not proceed on the basis that it is in breach of the Cabinet regulatory analysis requirements. The government should be required to produce a rigorous regulatory impact statement and allow interested parties to make submissions on it before the bill is reported back to the House. The regulatory impact statement should indicate the problem the proposed legislation is attempting to address, the objectives of legislative action, a consideration of feasible options, the costs and benefits of those options and consultation. Comment The regulatory impact analysis (RIA) requirements have recently been updated to more accurately reflect good policy process. Part of this development has been the shift from the focus on the regulatory impact statement to the analysis undertaken in the development of regulation – the regulatory impact analysis. The new RIA guidelines provide that the RIA requirements do not apply if the proposal is to give effect under urgency, in terms first announced in the Budget, to a specific Budget decision, where the decision is to: • repeal, impose, or adjust a tax, fee or charge; or • confer, revoke, or alter an entitlement; or • impose, revoke, or alter an obligation. The matters relating to KiwiSaver in this bill were first announced in the Budget and were introduced under urgency. The proposals confer entitlements and impose obligations within the KiwiSaver framework. Accordingly, the bill is exempted from the RIA requirements and, as such, is not in breach of the Cabinet regulatory analysis requirements. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 7 Issue: OECD test of quality regulation Submissions (81and 81A – Retirement Policy and Research Centre, The University of Auckland Business School) The bill fails most of the eight OECD Guiding Principles for Regulatory Quality and Performance. Specifically, the bill: • only partly achieves Principle 1: to serve clearly identified policy goals and be effective in achieving those goals; • fails Principle 2: to have a sound legal and empirical basis as no evidence has been supported the objectives indicated by the bill; • fails Principle 3: to produce benefits that justify costs as there are no estimates of benefits to justify the doubling of government expenditure; • fails the second leg of Principle 4: to minimise costs and market distortions as the proposal confers further significant property rights on default providers; • fails Principle 5: to promote innovation through market incentives and goal based approaches as there is no ability to choose between alternative providers; • fails Principle 6: to be clear simple and practical for users as remuneration arrangements are likely to become substantially more complex and will affect employees at all tax levels; • fails Principle 7: to be consistent as far as possible with other regulations and policies as it breaches the fundamental voluntary nature of superannuation in New Zealand, by giving rewards for designated behaviours; and • fails Principle 8: to be compatible as far as possible with competition, trade and investment facilitating principles at domestic and international levels by conferring a benefit on default providers. Comment The OECD guidelines on quality regulations stemmed from an increasing reliance on OECD governments on regulation as a policy-making tool. As such, the guidelines were predominantly aimed at providing governments with a framework within which regulatory reform could be undertaken with more efficient results. Specifically, the guidelines stem from an OECD recommendation that member countries take measures to ensure the quality and transparency of regulation. The measures recommended by the OECD, are premised around establishing an appropriate regulatory impact analysis (RIA) framework. New Zealand has adopted these guidelines into our own RIA framework. The new RIA guidelines provide that the RIA requirements do not apply if the proposal is to be given effect under urgency. As such, the bill is exempted from the RIA requirements. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 8 Issue: Process, timing and consultation Submissions (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand INC (ISI), 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 47 – ING (NZ) Ltd) Superannuation is complex. Recent changes to key features of KiwiSaver have not been subject to any consultation with employers or the industry. The changes proposed in the bill have significant implications for employers, employees and superannuation providers. The lack of consultation and the very tight timelines will result in poorly crafted legislation which will need remedial legislation as the problems emerge. This will jeopardise the success of the initiatives and may have a long-term detrimental impact on attitudes to both KiwiSaver and the financial services industry. The proposals, if implemented in their current form, will force employers to restructure their remuneration arrangements and have the potential to cause industrial unrest. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting, ISI) There has been no consultation with the industry and the submitters believe there was minimal consultation with the Inland Revenue's KiwiSaver project team. As a result the legislation is unworkable in parts. (ISI, ING (NZ) Ltd) The manner in which the changes were introduced has been significantly at variance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. (CTG) Comment Remuneration agreements established prior to Budget announcements obviously could not factor in compulsory employer contributions. KiwiSaver does, however, provide a transition path to ensure employers and providers can accommodate compulsory employer contributions. These include: • introducing compulsory employer contributions from 1 April 2008, to allow for consultation through this process, and more than 10 months from announcement to implementation; • the phasing in of employer contributions from 1 April 2008 until 2011; and • the employer tax credit of up to $20 per week, with no phasing, to partly offset additional employer costs. The phasing in of employer contributions and tax credits will mean employers face no additional cost for employees earning less than $52,000 (which exceeds the average wage) until 31 March 2010. Employers will therefore have almost three years from Budget announcements to factor compulsory employer contributions into their industrial settlements, before incurring any costs for the majority of their employers. 9 In addition, employers who already provide employer contributions to KiwiSaver complying schemes will be able to access employer tax credits of up to $20 per week from 1 April. This will provide a windfall gain for payments these employers would have already been making. Also, employer contributions to existing superannuation schemes for employees employed before 1 April 2008 will count towards the compulsory employer contributions. In relation to the submission that the KiwiSaver enhancements were introduced at variance with the Generic Tax Policy Process, the proposals were developed in the context of Budget 2007, and the opportunity to present comments on the KiwiSaver proposals has been allowed through the select committee process. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Treasury report, A Synopsis of Theory, Evidence and Recent Treasury Analysis on Saving Submission (81B – Retirement Policy and Research Centre, The University of Auckland Business School) The Treasury report A Synopsis of Theory, Evidence and Recent Treasury Analysis on Saving implies that the radical extensions to KiwiSaver through Budget 2007 cannot, or by not much, change behaviour to increase either total individual or national saving. The submission argues that: • The report was written after the government had taken its controversial decision rather than to inform the government decision-making process. • The report highlights that policy analysis of savings remains difficult because high quality data remains elusive, the effectiveness of possible interventions to lift savings is often not unambiguous, and even interventions that are effective in achieving one objective usually have downsides measured against other objectives. • The OECD has stopped publishing New Zealand’s household saving numbers in its semi-annual Economic Outlook because of an apparent lack of confidence in them. • The report uses the Reserve Bank data that shows large increases in household wealth but this data excludes the value of businesses, farms, horticultural and forestry investments, and directly held commercial property, which is a recognised shortcoming of that data. • The report arrives at a disconnected conclusion. 10 The submission considers that: • Nothing much has changed in the economy or with respect to saving(s) to reach the conclusion that further or stronger pro-saving action is now justified, and that more compelling evidence is needed to support such a large and expensive change in government policy direction. • There is no clear economic analysis on how KiwiSaver II will address the national saving issues, distributional consequences, or the fate of the universal State pension. Comment Several submissions dispute the policy rationale for the KiwiSaver package and its likely impact. Others support both the policy intent of the enhancements and their contribution to the objectives of encouraging a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement. Treasury’s specific advice on KiwiSaver and its likely impacts is set out in a separate report, Overview of Enhanced KiwiSaver Package, which was posted on the Treasury website on 28 June 2007. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 11 KIWISAVER AND TOTAL REMUNERATION Issue: Employers already providing employee superannuation are penalised if contributions are provided in the wrong form Submission (8 – Christchurch City Council) Some employers are already providing employees with either a contribution to a superannuation fund or a cashed-up equivalent. These employers are unfairly penalised by only being allowed to count direct superannuation fund contributions as an offset for KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions. Employees receiving a contribution that is directed to a superannuation fund are also relatively disadvantaged compared with cashed-up colleagues, as the former group will be able to access additional KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions. To address this issue it is suggested that previous superannuation subsidies count against KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions. Comment Over time, many employees and employers have developed arrangements where some employees have “cashed up” superannuation, while others receive superannuation contributions. It would be difficult, misleading and potentially inequitable to try to “rebalance” the playing field retrospectively by, for example, asking employers to disentangle previous decisions to identify superannuation from other components of remuneration. An individual determination would be required for potentially every employment agreement in New Zealand. Allowing previously cashed-up superannuation payments to count against compulsory employer contributions would also encourage gaming to identify elements of existing remuneration as being a superannuation component. Arbitrary decisions would be required to determine what previous payments count as superannuation components and for what timeframes. In addition to potential extra costs, submissions neglect to mention that there are also potential extra benefits to employers. Employers making contributions to existing KiwiSaver-compliant schemes may receive a windfall gain from the employer tax credit. Any legislative change would need to address both aspects. Officials consider that this is a matter that is best left to wage bargaining discussions between the employer and the employee. The costs and complexity of addressing this issue are likely to be excessive and would require equally arbitrary and inequitable decisions. 12 Officials note that for an existing employee, depending upon the provisions of his or her employment contract, a switch from a cashed-up subsidy to an employer contribution that meets the “other contributions” criteria in proposed section 101D of the KiwiSaver Act may count towards the compulsory employer contribution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether KiwiSaver should form part of total remuneration Submissions (12 – Employer & Manufacturers Association (Northern), 26 – Hospitality Association, 30 – NZ Public Service Association, 50 – Eriksens Actuarial, 66 – Business New Zealand, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 86 – Employer & Manufacturers Association (Central) Incorporated), 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) A clause should be introduced to provide for employer contributions to be recognised as coming from an employee’s total employment package, whether or not the employee remains a KiwiSaver member on beginning employment or opting in later. (Hospitality Association) If employer contributions are not treated on a total remuneration basis (meaning that an employee joining KiwiSaver receives a reduction in salary or other benefits), then employers will be uncertain of their total remuneration bill. This will occur if employees later join KiwiSaver, compelling the employer to make unexpected additional compulsory contributions. (This cost would be partly offset by the employer tax credit.) (Employer & Manufacturers Association (Northern), Business New Zealand, Employer & Manufacturers Association (Central) Incorporated) If employer contributions are treated on a total remuneration basis, then employers would receive a windfall gain from employees joining KiwiSaver. This would occur as the employer would be able to reduce wages to offset compulsory employer contributions and the employer would also receive the employer tax credit. (NZ Public Service Association, Council of Trade Union, New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The employer tax credit should go to the right party. A number of employers are permitting their employees to salary sacrifice in order to fund their “employer” contributions. These salary sacrifice contributions are basically the employee’s and the employee should receive the tax credit for it, not the employer. (Eriksens Actuarial) 13 Comment The bill is deliberately silent on this matter as it is expected that employers and employees will bargain all employee terms and conditions in good faith. This will include negotiations on the appropriate way to include KiwiSaver in the employment relationship. Employers and employees have, however, raised concerns that, in the absence of government intervention, there may be opportunities for the other party to “game” industrial settlements. In particular, clarification has been sought on: • the legal standing of existing employment agreements that purport to require employees to fund KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions through a reduction in employees’ gross pay; • whether employee funding of compulsory employer contributions can legitimately be negotiated into future employment agreements; and • whether the employer tax credit is available to employers who require employees to fund the compulsory employer contributions through a reduction in gross pay. Policy to date has been to let employers and employees resolve any issues through negotiations. Ambiguity about the initial treatment of KiwiSaver employer contributions and the future ability to bargain in good faith is now, however, threatening to disrupt the smooth introduction of KiwiSaver. It is therefore recommended that KiwiSaver legislation clarify the policy preference underlying the funding of KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions during the phase-in of compulsory contributions. These are: • Initial KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions are not intended to decrease current total remuneration for existing or new employees opting into KiwiSaver before compulsory employer provisions come into force. As the employer tax credit removes or reduces the initial cost to employers of compulsory employer contributions, this benefit should be passed on to employees as an “on top of remuneration” payment. • While initial KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions are “on top of remuneration”, further into the transition period KiwiSaver employer contributions may be offset in part against pay movements. The funding of future compulsory employer contributions is therefore a legitimate matter for mutual agreement between the parties. • Where employers require employees to fund or part-fund compulsory employer contributions through a bargained agreement, the employer tax credit should be available only to the extent that employers themselves pay or part-pay for the employer contribution. (Without this provision, there would be a windfall gain to employers who have not previously provided for employees’ superannuation.) 14 To address the issue of any pre-existing agreements that purport to require salary sacrifice, it is recommended that legislation be amended to explicitly void any provisions entered into prior to the availability of full information on KiwiSaver. This is best timed from the date of enactment of legislation in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill. It is recommended that KiwiSaver legislation prescribe immediate transitional arrangements only. Any legislation seeking to achieve industrial relations outcomes risks dragging the government into a central role in individual employment negotiations. While it is most appropriate to allow parties to come to decisions themselves, the government will monitor any instances of discrimination arising from KiwiSaver membership and take whatever action is deemed appropriate where discrimination on the basis of KiwiSaver membership is identified as a problem. Recommendation That the concerns raised by the submissions be addressed by amending KiwiSaver legislation to provide that: • any employment agreement provisions entered into before the date of enactment of legislation contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill that bind employees to fund KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions (or arrangements with the same effect) are null and void; • initially, KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions will be in addition to current remuneration; • further into the transition period, KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions may be offset in part against pay movements (that is, the funding of contributions is therefore a legitimate matter for mutual agreement between the parties of the parties); and • where employers require employees to fund or part-fund compulsory employer contributions through a bargained agreement, the employer tax credit should be available only to the extent that employers themselves pay or part-pay for the employer contribution. 15 DEFINITION OF “SALARY AND WAGES” Issue: Scope of salary and wages definition Submissions (3 – Tonkin & Taylor, 74 – Deloitte, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 86 – Employers and Manufacturers Association (Central) Incorporated, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 94 – ABN-AMRO, 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) Submissions raised the following issues in regards to payments included in the “salary and wages” definition for the purposes of calculating contributions to KiwiSaver. • Consideration needs to be given as to whether the definition of “salary and wages” for the purposes of the compulsory employer contribution should exclude unexpected one-off payments. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) • Consideration should be given to allowing employees that receive bonus payments to choose whether extra pay over and above the capped amount are taken into account in calculating the employee’s KiwiSaver deduction. (Deloitte, ABN-AMRO) • Contributions should not be deducted from redundancy pay as that is a compensatory payment. (New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, New Zealand Nurses Organisation) • Benefits should be removed from the scope of “gross salary and/or wages” under the KiwiSaver Act and there would be more clarity if it instead referred to “base salary and/or wages and commission earnings”. (Employers and Manufacturers Association (Central) Incorporated) Other issues raised regarding the use of gross salary and wages as the KiwiSaver definition include: • Having 4% calculated on all pay including bonus amounts may be a barrier to some employees electing into KiwiSaver or may force employees into a contributions holiday when they become eligible for bonus schemes. (Deloitte, ABN-AMRO) • The terms of KiwiSaver should be altered so that contributions are made only as a percentage of base salary, therefore giving both the employer and employee a clear understanding of what savings level they are actually committing to. (Tonkin & Taylor) • The salary that is used to calculate the employer’s contribution should be capped at a reasonable level. (Tonkin & Taylor, Deloitte, ABN-AMRO) 16 Comment As KiwiSaver utilises the PAYE collection mechanism, the definition of salary and wages used in the KiwiSaver Act is based on the definition in the Income Tax Act 2004. The definition of salary and wages for KiwiSaver was devised to integrate with existing payroll systems so as to reduce compliance costs to employers and therefore uses a definition based on gross salary and wages as opposed to gross base earnings. The definition includes almost all income from employment, including sources such as overtime and bonuses. It does not include fringe benefits subject to fringe benefit tax. For simplicity and to limit compliance costs to employers, the definition of salary and wages used to calculate the employer contribution should be the same as that used to calculate the member contribution. However, officials agree that the inclusion of certain payments may have an impact on the affordability of KiwiSaver, from both employees’ and employers’ perspectives. Officials have reconsidered the types of payments included in the definition and agree that redundancy payments should be excluded from the KiwiSaver definition of salary and wages. However, we do not consider that bonus payments and other one-off payments should be excluded. The basis of excluding redundancy payments is that they are infrequent in nature and less likely to be open to abuse – that is, they are not likely to be used for the main purpose of limiting KiwiSaver contributions. We also consider that those being made redundant are less likely to be able to afford to forgo a percentage of their redundancy payment so as to contribute to KiwiSaver. Also, excluding payments made irregularly is less likely to impose significant compliance costs on employers. We note that after the first year, the contribution holiday mechanism can be used to prevent contributions being made from such payments if the employer is willing to accept a contribution holiday for a pay period. Officials also consider that the value of accommodation benefits and taxable allowances received for accommodation and the cost of living overseas should be excluded from the KiwiSaver definition of salary and wages as they are likely to have a significant impact on affordability for both employers and employees. Employer contributions are capped at 4% of an employee’s gross salary or wages and are dependant on the employees themselves also contributing at least the same amount. Officials do not consider that there should be an income threshold (cap) to limit contributions as this presumes that the government knows what an adequate level of retirement savings is, and that all people need the same amount of employer contributions to reach an adequate level of saving for retirement. Recommendation That the submission that employees be given the choice of whether bonus payments and extra amounts are to be included in the calculation of employees’ KiwiSaver deduction be declined. 17 That the value of accommodation benefits and taxable allowances received for accommodation and the cost of living overseas be excluded from the definition of salary or wages for KiwiSaver purposes. That the submission that unexpected one-off payments be excluded from the definition of “salary and wages” for the purposes of the compulsory employer contribution be declined. That the submission that contributions not be deducted from redundancy payments be accepted. That the submission that the salary that is used to calculate the employer’s contribution should be capped at a reasonable level be declined. Issue: Definition of “salary and wages” applicable to complying superannuation funds Submissions (3 – Tonkin & Taylor, 17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 28 – ANZ National, 45 – Chapman Tripp, 70 – Simpson Grierson, 74 – Deloitte, 87 – ASFONZ, 92 – Airways Corporation, 94 – ABN-AMRO) Submissions raised the following issues with respect to the definition of salary and wages used by complying superannuation funds for the purposes of calculating contributions: • Amendment should be made so that the contribution rate minima for complying superannuation funds remain specified by reference to gross base earnings. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting, Simpson Grierson) • Existing registered superannuation schemes as at 17 May 2007 should be allowed to retain their existing salary definitions for a period of, say, 10 years before gross salary must be used. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) • For complying superannuation funds, employers should be allowed to elect to use gross base salary or wages if their existing schemes currently use that approach. (ANZ National) • Clause 144(2)(b) of the bill, in respect of the contribution rate for complying superannuation funds being “gross salary and wages”, creates a level of complexity that is confusing for employees, and costly for employers, and will ultimately discourage members from locking-in funds to age 65. (ANZ National) 18 • By introducing the wider total gross salary and wages multiplier for contributions to complying funds from 1 April 2008, existing schemes will be required to use two multipliers: the wider gross salary for the lock-in section (including bonuses, overtime, allowances, etc); and gross base salary multiplier for the conventional non-complying section. (ANZ National) • A “grandfathering” arrangement should be introduced that would allow schemes (as a trade-off for attracting fewer government subsidies) to continue using salary or wage definitions that are at least equal to “gross base”. (Chapman Tripp, Airways Corporation) • Not introducing grandfathering: – will create significant administrative, member communication and remuneration design challenges; and – forced non-alignment with existing scheme definitions will (for many) terminally prejudice complying superannuation fund status. (Chapman Tripp) • Existing salary or wage definitions that are at least equal to “gross base” should be recognised. (ASFONZ) • A discretion should be vested in the Government Actuary to approve salary or wage definitions used for complying fund rules purposes where he is satisfied that the definition employed is genuinely required to align deductions made, and not a device to circumvent more onerous KiwiSaver obligations. (ASFONZ) Comment At present, the complying fund rules in the Income Tax Act 2004 require total minimum contributions to be deducted at 4% of annual gross base salary or wages. This allows contributions to be based on the definitions already in place for these existing superannuation schemes such as gross base salary. A change to the definition of salary and wages (from gross base salary and wages to gross salary and wages) will cause additional administrative and compliance costs for complying superannuation funds and may mean existing schemes are less likely to establish complying funds. There is also a risk that existing schemes may wind up and that savings may be leaked. Recommendation That the submission that complying superannuation schemes be able to continue to use the gross base salary definition for the purpose of calculating the employee deductions and matching employer contributions be accepted. 19 Issue: Shareholder-employees Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An amendment is required to allow those shareholder-employees in a close company who have opted for non-source deduction from their salary to be eligible for KiwiSaver, the member tax credit and the employer compulsory contribution. Comment Shareholder-employees have the option of joining and contributing to KiwiSaver either as an employee through the PAYE system contributing at 4% or 8%, or as a self-employed person (non-employee) by contracting directly with a provider. Shareholder-employees participating in KiwiSaver as employees will receive the compulsory employer contribution (and their employer the accompanying employer tax credit) whereas shareholder-employees participating as self-employed will not. Shareholder-employees who contribute outside the PAYE system will be entitled to the member tax credit (to the extent to which they contribute), as this is not limited to those making contributions from salary or wages. Allowing shareholder-employees who do not contribute from salary and wages that are not subject to PAYE to be eligible for the compulsory employer contribution would create significant administration costs, and would prompt calls for the compulsory employer contribution and employer tax credit to be extended to other self-employed persons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 COMPULSORY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS Issue: Employer contributions aspect of the bill should not proceed Submission (26 – Hospitality Association, 66 – Business New Zealand) The provision for employers to make any type of compulsory contribution to employee KiwiSaver accounts should not proceed. Comment Employees and employers alike have a stake in lifting the saving performance of New Zealand. Increased savings helps employees enjoy a higher standard of living in retirement and also increases the supply of domestic savings that can be invested in New Zealand businesses, helping local businesses grow. The compulsory employer contribution is being phased in over time (1% of an employee’s salary and wages from 1 April 2008, rising to 4% by 1 April 2011) to help ease the transition. Employers will be reimbursed for KiwiSaver contributions with a matching tax credit up to a maximum of $20 per week per employee. Employers may incur some compliance costs but these have been minimised by integrating KiwiSaver into the PAYE system. The employer tax credit will be paid through the PAYE system by offsetting the credit against the employer’s contribution and other PAYE liabilities, which will minimise cash flow issues. Contributions will also be exempt from Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT) up to a cap. The tax credits and the SSCWT exemption mean that employers can provide a larger benefit to staff through KiwiSaver contributions than through other remuneration, at the same cost to the employer. KiwiSaver gives all employers (in particular, smaller employers) access to a sophisticated and efficient superannuation scheme at low cost. KiwiSaver schemes are likely to be comparable to those currently offered by the largest employers and are something that smaller employers are not able to set up or offer themselves. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 21 Issue: Employer contributions to existing and KiwiSaver schemes Submissions (21 – MCK Metals Pacific, 26 – Hospitality Association of New Zealand, 35 – AW Fraser Ltd, 53 – BP, 66 – Business New Zealand, 70 – Simpson Grierson) If existing schemes do not become KiwiSaver schemes, companies will be faced with a double-up in superannuation contributions – potentially having to contribute up to 14% by way of contribution to both the existing and KiwiSaver schemes. (MCK Metals Pacific, AW Fraser Ltd) Employers should be given an opportunity to assess the implications of compulsory employer contributions for their current superannuation arrangements before they are required to contribute to multiple schemes. (BP, Simpson Grierson) The provision to ensure total employer contributions for all employer’s work-based superannuation schemes are not required to total more than 4% of an employee’s gross earnings should proceed. (Hospitality Association of New Zealand, Business New Zealand) Comment Employers will not be required to contribute to both the existing scheme that they have offered to employees and to KiwiSaver schemes for those same employees. Proposed section 101D of the KiwiSaver Act provides that employer contributions to an existing registered superannuation scheme will count towards the employer compulsory contribution rate if: • the employer provides access to a registered superannuation scheme on 17 May 2007; • the employer contributions are for employees who are members of that scheme before 1 April or, in the case of existing employees (employed before 1 April 2008), the employment contract provides access to that scheme; and • the employee is employed before 1 April 2008. The bill, as introduced, requires that the contributions that count towards the compulsory employer contribution must vest immediately in the employee. These transitional rules have been implemented to mitigate the effects on employers if they were required to contribute 4% of the employee’s salary or wages to KiwiSaver in addition to contributing to an existing superannuation scheme. The current transitional provision of allowing existing contributions to count in respect of employees who begin employment before 1 April 2008 allows employers time to asses the implications of compulsory employer contributions on their existing scheme in respect of new employees after 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 22 Issue: Scope and impact of provision concerning employer contributions to existing superannuation schemes Submissions (11 – Water Industry Superannuation Fund, 17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 23 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of New Zealand Incorporated, 45 – Chapman Tripp, 47 – ING (NZ) Limited, 53 – BP, 61 – KPMG, 70 – Simpson Grierson, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 87 – ASFONZ, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society, 98 – DLA Phillips Fox) A drafting error in the proposed section 101D(1)(c)(ii) defeats the policy by restricting the grandparenting to individual employees who were already offered access to the relevant scheme on 17 May 2007. This disqualifies contributions made in respect of: • persons first employed between Budget day 2007 and 31 March 2008; and • persons who were already employed on 17 May 2007, but had not yet been offered access to the relevant scheme (or were not yet receiving employer contributions) on that day. (Chapman Tripp) The section should be amended to include employees employed after 1 April 2008 but on terms agreed prior to 1 April 2008. (BP, Simpson Grierson) Employer contributions to existing schemes should continue to apply to employees employed after 1 April 2008. The section should be amended so that employer contributions to an existing registered superannuation scheme can count towards the employer compulsory contribution for employees who commence work between 17 May 2007 and 1 April 2008. (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The restrictions on when the employee began employment and when the agreement was reached should be removed and the requirement should simply be that the registered scheme was in existence as at 17 May 2007. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Amend section 101D(c)(ii) by adding the following on the end (after 17 May 2007) “and access to this registered superannuation scheme for employees who commence employment in the period 18 May 2007 to 31 March 2008 (inclusive)”. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of New Zealand Incorporated, ING (NZ) Limited) Section 101D(2)(c)(ii) should be amended to require that the employer provides access to a registered superannuation scheme for its employees generally instead of to a particular employee who is employed before 1 April 2008. (BP, Simpson Grierson) 23 “Other contributions” would exclude contributions made by an employer on behalf of all employees employed after 17 May 2007 and before 1 April 2008 from counting towards the compulsory matching employer contributions. The definition of “other contributions” should be amended to include specified superannuation contributions to a registered superannuation scheme that existed as at 17 May 2007 in relation to employees employed by the employer before 1 April 2008. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition should include any employer superannuation scheme contribution irrespective of whether the employee was employed to 1 April 2008. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The “other contributions” offset in the proposed 101D causes difficulty for employers who have a scheme that is compulsory for employees. Fully vested employer contributions should be included in the definition of “other contributions” in respect of employees whether they are employed before 1 April 2008 or after 1 April 2008 in circumstances where the contribution arrangement has been agreed to by the employer before 1 April 2008. (DLA Phillips Fox) Alternatively, it is suggested that an implied provision be added to the KiwiSaver Act whereby compulsory employer contributions that must be paid by the employer to a KiwiSaver scheme can be set off against the contributions the employer makes to a specified superannuation contribution to a superannuation scheme. This will avoid the need for costly deed amendments. (DLA Phillips Fox) The definition of “other contributions” is likely to have the practical effect of forcing employers to close existing registered superannuation schemes in respect of new employees after 1 April 2008. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The “other contributions” offset allowed against the compulsory employer contribution at the proposed section 101D(2) of the KiwiSaver Act is problematic and unduly limited in its scope. (ASFONZ) The “other contributions” offset will result in inconsistencies in the treatment of new and current employees. (Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) The definition should be expanded to accommodate employees employed after 1 April 2008, but on terms determined prior to 1 April 2008 or on terms determined prior to the bill coming into effect. (ASFONZ) Section 101D(2)(c)(ii) should be amended to confirm that an employer is able to benefit from the ability to off-set if it was providing its employees in general with access to superannuation arrangements as at 17 May 2007. (ASFONZ) Greater flexibility should be introduced to section 101D(2)(c)(iii) to recognise superannuation contributions made by the employer pursuant to any arrangement agreed by the employer prior to 1 April 2008. (ASFONZ) 24 Comment The policy intention of the rules allowing employer contribution to existing superannuation schemes to count towards the compulsory employer contribution was to: • mitigate against the risk that existing schemes may wind up if employers were required to contribute twice; and • apply to those employees that were employed before 1 April 2008, and who received an employer contribution or whose employment contract provided access to the scheme. This protected existing arrangements before the proposed application of the compulsory employer contribution. In respect of new employees from 1 April 2008, employers would be able to change their superannuation offer to take into account compulsory employer contributions to KiwiSaver. Officials agree with the submissions that the current rules do not apply to employees that began employment during the period 18 May 2007 to 31 March 2008. This was not the intention. The theme of these submissions is that the carve-out in respect of employer contributions to existing schemes should apply for new employees from 1April 2008. These existing schemes do not have the same lock-in rules as KiwiSaver, and members are able to withdraw their accumulated savings at the end of service. The reason for this limitation on new employees is to avoid undermining the objectives that, going forward, employer contributions are subject to KiwiSaver lock- in rules. Otherwise KiwiSaver schemes would be less attractive because employer contributions could be accessed via an existing scheme with less stringent lock-in rules. The effect of the “existing scheme member” restriction is that employers will likely set up a complying fund within their existing scheme and change their offer to new employees so that employer contributions up to the compulsory amount go towards the complying fund. If they do not change the offer they will be in the position of having to pay compulsory contributions on top of the current employer contributions (if they are not able to cease the contributions under the provisions of the scheme offer). DLA Phillips Fox suggest in their submission that an implied provision be included in the legislation to provide that compulsory employer contributions that must be paid by the employer to a KiwiSaver scheme can be offset against the contributions the employer makes as a specified superannuation contribution to a superannuation scheme. This is to avoid the need to make trust deed amendments. 25 This suggestion has the same outcome as the purpose of allowing “other contributions” to count towards the compulsory employer contributions. Instead of reducing the compulsory contribution amount to be paid it reduces the existing contribution, and the employer would receive the employer tax credit in respect of those compulsory contributions. Officials consider that it would be inappropriate to legislate for this outcome and that employers need to change their superannuation offer to new employees to take into account compulsory employer contributions to KiwiSaver and the employer tax credit. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but the legislation be clarified to ensure that it applies to employees who started employment during the period 18 May 2007 to 31 March 2008. Issue: Employer contributions and the age of eligibility of withdrawal for funds Submission (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Employers are not required to pay contributions in respect of an employee once they have reached the age of eligibility for withdrawal of funds from KiwiSaver or a complying superannuation fund. However, as employers do not always know when an employee reaches age 65, the employer will not know when this date has been reached. Comment Employers are required to make compulsory contributions into their employees’ KiwiSaver or complying superannuation fund only for employees who are over 18 and under the age of eligibility to withdraw. Members become eligible to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings when they reach the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation or after having been a member for five years, whichever occurs later. Officials consider that as employers may not have the information needed to know when employees have reached the age of eligibility to withdraw their funds, scheme providers should inform Inland Revenue about members’ eligibility to withdraw their funds. Inland Revenue will in turn inform employers that compulsory employer contributions can cease. Recommendation That providers be required to inform Inland Revenue before members reach the age of eligibility to withdraw funds so that Inland Revenue can then inform employers of the date that employees will reach the age of eligibility to withdraw their funds and, accordingly, that they should cease their employer contributions from that date. 26 Issue: Contributions holiday Submissions (61 – KPMG, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) It should be made clearer that the compulsory employer contributions cease when an employee takes a contributions holiday. (KPMG) When a worker takes a contributions holiday, employer contributions should continue. (Council of Trade Unions, New Zealand Nurses Organisation) Comment After members have been contributing to KiwiSaver for 12 months, they are able to apply for a contributions holiday of between three months and five years, or less than three months if their employer agrees. There is no limit to the number of times a member can take a contributions holiday. An employer is required to make a compulsory contribution only if contributions to a KiwiSaver and a complying superannuation fund are being deducted from the employee’s salary or wages. The policy is that an employer contribution must be made if an employee contribution is deducted from salary or wages. If there is no requirement to deduct employee contributions because the employee is on a contributions holiday, the employer is not required to make an employer contribution. Further, KiwiSaver is designed to encourage a saving habit by providing incentives for New Zealanders to save. If employer contributions continued while the member was on a contributions holiday (and thus did not contribute), it would remove the incentive for employees to save by providing for benefits to accrue to them even when they take no action of their own. A provision to require that employer contributions cease when an employee takes a contribution holiday is not necessary as the draft legislation already provides for this. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 27 Issue: Employer contributions to be paid through Inland Revenue Submissions (70 – Simpson Grierson, 87 – ASFONZ) There is an inconsistency between section 68(2)(b) of the KiwiSaver Act, which provides that contributions for “other things” such as life insurance cannot be paid via the Commissioner, and section 93 of the KiwiSaver Act as amended by section 64 of the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007, which requires all employer contributions to be paid via the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. It is therefore not clear whether or not employers can provide their employees with benefits such as life insurance through KiwiSaver schemes. (Simpson Grierson) The KiwiSaver Act should be amended to clarify that other employer contributions, such as for life insurance, can be made to KiwiSaver whether via the Commissioner or otherwise. However, the current position set out in section 68(2)(a), that these other employer contributions will not count as contributions under the KiwiSaver Act or towards the contribution rate, should remain. (Simpson Grierson) The proposed section 93 of the KiwiSaver Act requires all employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme to be paid through Inland Revenue. This creates an inconsistency with section 68(1)(b), preventing the use of funds paid through Inland Revenue for benefits other than retirement benefits. Remedial legislation is needed to address this. (ASFONZ) Comment The KiwiSaver Act 2006 does not prohibit money being paid to providers for things other than retirement benefits (such as life insurance). However, under section 68 money that is paid for things other than retirement benefits cannot count towards the contribution rate and cannot be paid via the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. With the introduction of compulsory employer contributions, section 93 of the KiwiSaver Act was amended by the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007 to require that all employer contributions be paid via the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Consequently, if an employer makes contributions for things other than retirement benefits, these are now required to be paid via the Commissioner. The system that Inland Revenue has designed and that will be developed further for the collection of compulsory employer contributions is premised on the basis that an employer contribution is for a particular employee. The collection of amounts that do not relate to a particular employee, such as the payment of group life insurance premiums and contributions to the costs of the administration of the scheme, cannot be integrated into the current Inland Revenue system without significant change. This is due to the need to incorporate this information into the existing employer monthly schedule system. Such a change is likely to place the 1 April 2008 implementation target at risk. 28 On this basis, officials recommend amending the proposed legislation so that employer contributions for things other than retirement benefits are to be paid directly to the provider. Recommendation That the legislation be amended to require employer contributions for things other than retirement benefits to be paid directly to the provider. Issue: Shortfall of employer contributions Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Employee contributions that are short-paid are allocated by Inland Revenue according to the formula in section 99 of the KiwiSaver Act. A similar formula is required for any shortfall of employer contributions under section KJ 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment From 1 July 2007, all employer contributions (both compulsory and voluntary) are required to be paid via Inland Revenue using the PAYE process. This is to allow Inland Revenue to ensure that compulsory contributions are being made. If an employer fails to make a compulsory contribution, Inland Revenue will make a payment to the employee’s KiwiSaver provider on the employer’s behalf (up to the value of the tax credit available to employers – $20 per week per employee). Inland Revenue will recover the short payment from the employer and pay any shortfall on to the employee’s KiwiSaver provider. The non-payment of compulsory employer contributions will be subject to current compliance and enforcements practices and penalties that apply to tax. In regard to the short payment of employer contributions to complying superannuation funds, from 1 April 2009, providers will be required to notify the Government Actuary when a compulsory employer contribution to a complying fund has not been paid in full. Debts of unpaid compulsory employer contributions will be transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. Officials contacted the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants to clarify its submission on this issue. After discussing what is proposed in the bill in regard to shortfalls of employer contributions, NZICA reported that it was satisfied that its submission on this matter has already been addressed in the current drafting of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 Issue: Employees on paid parental leave or ACC Submissions (51 – National Distribution Union \[NDU\], 78 – Council of Trade Unions \[CTU\], 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) When a worker is on paid parental leave or ACC and continues to contribute (and has not taken a contributions holiday), the employer contributions should continue (CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation), or a payment equivalent to compulsory employer contributions should be made (NDU). The payments should be based on 4% of an average week’s pay prior to leave or ACC being collected. (CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation) (In its oral submission the CTU noted that the employer tax credit would offset the cost to ACC and Inland Revenue.) Earnings-related compensation under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 and parental leave payments under part 7A of the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 are included within the definition of “wages and salary” under the KiwiSaver Act. This means that, unless a member seeks a contributions holiday, member KiwiSaver payments will continue to be deducted from their income. (NDU) Further, paid parental leave and ACC payments replace members’ normal remuneration while they are unable to work, and KiwiSaver payments will become an increasingly important part of total remuneration. If KiwiSaver payments are not continued/replaced when a member is on benefits, then their income replacement will be eroded. (NDU) Comment As people receiving paid parental leave or ACC compensation payments are no longer part of the workforce, compulsory employer contributions should not be required. In respect of paid parental leave and weekly compensation payments from the ACC, Inland Revenue and the ACC (respectively) are deemed to be the employer under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. However, there is no real employment relationship between those government agencies and the persons receiving these payments. Further, paid parental leave is considered to be more of a grant to aid parents taking parental leave, rather than employment payments. Finally, having compulsory employer contributions apply in respect of contributions deducted from such payments would add complexity. Employer contributions to KiwiSaver are also not included in the definition of salary/wages for the purposes of ACC payments, so they are not included in the replacement income employees receive from ACC. It should also be noted that those receiving ACC payments and paid parental leave are less likely to be in the position to make contributions to their long-term retirement savings at that time. For this reason, employees can take a contributions holiday and then restart their contributions to KiwiSaver when they are in a better position to do so (for example, upon returning to the workplace). 30 In any case, KiwiSaver members (or members of a complying superannuation scheme) that receive paid parental leave or ACC are still eligible for the member tax credit if they make KiwiSaver contributions direct to the provider (even if these deductions are made from their ACC or paid parental leave payments). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Employer contribution transition path ignores employers’ collective agreement commitments Submissions (1 – VT Fitzroy, 8 – Christchurch City Council, 12 – Employer & Manufacturers Association (Northern), 51 – National Distribution Union, 53 – BP, 70 – Simpson Grierson, 92 – Airways NZ) Under the proposed legislation, contributions to existing superannuation schemes count as compulsory contributions for KiwiSaver purposes only if the employee concerned was employed before 1 April 2008. This is problematic for employers who have legal obligations under a previously agreed collective agreement to provide access to an existing superannuation scheme. Employers will be legally compelled to continue to provide access for new employees to this scheme for the duration of the collective agreement. (VT Fitzroy, Christchurch City Council) The section should be amended to include employees employed after 1 April 2008 but on terms agreed prior to 1 April 2008. (BP, Simpson Grierson) Employers could be required to pay an employer contribution to the existing superannuation scheme as set out in the collective agreement. In addition, the employer would be liable for KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions if those new employees also elected to join KiwiSaver. Some consider that employers should not be required to pay compulsory employer contributions until the expiry date of existing collective employer agreement. (Christchurch City Council, BP, Airways NZ) Related issues are the maintenance of employee rights achieved under collective agreements (particularly employer commitments to paying 2% of employer contributions) and company rules (rather than legal entitlements) providing for a stand-down period prior to becoming eligible to join a company superannuation scheme. (National Distribution Union, BP) Others argue that employer contributions are being introduced too early. As a result, this cost cannot be factored into recent collective agreements, leading to onerous costs on employers. (Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern)) 31 Comment It is a legitimate concern that certain employees could double dip as a result of existing legal obligations. Collective agreements established before Budget 2007 announcements obviously could not factor in compulsory employer contributions. KiwiSaver does, however, provide a transition path to ensure employers can accommodate compulsory employer contributions. These include: • not starting compulsory contributions until 1 April 2008, to allow for consultation; • phasing in of employer contributions from 1 April 2008 to April 2011; • the employer tax credit of up to $20 per week, introduced in full from 1 April 2008; and • allowing existing contributions to count towards compulsory employer contributions in certain circumstances. As the requirement for compulsory employer contributions will apply from 1 April 2008, it allows employers a limited period to convert their superannuation offerings into KiwiSaver-compliant schemes and thus have access to KiwiSaver benefits. This grace period assumes that employers will be able to modify their existing superannuation offer to any new employees before 1 April 2008. As the submissions correctly identify, this is incorrect where an existing collective agreement compels an employer to offer new employees access to an existing superannuation scheme after 1 April 2008. However, the phasing in of employer contributions and the employer tax credit means employers face no additional cost for employees earning less than $52,000 (which exceeds the average wage) until 31 March 2010. Employers will therefore have almost three years from Budget 2007 announcements to factor compulsory employer contributions into their industrial settlements, before incurring any costs for the majority of their employees. In addition, employers who already provide employer contributions to KiwiSaver-compliant schemes will be able to access employer tax credits of up to $20 per week. This will provide a windfall gain for payments these employers would have already been making. The impact on collective agreements could be addressed by grandparenting all good faith legal obligations entered into by employers (those entered into prior to Budget announcements on 17 May 2007) until the expiry of the collective agreement. It should be noted that this will not apply to an individual employment agreement in that employees starting new employment are free to negotiate their agreement on an individual basis. In cases where company rules dictate a stand-down period that would allow employees to qualify for two employer contributions, it is entirely within the power of the company to amend its rules. The expectation is that companies could change their rules in these cases and no legislative changes should occur. 32 Recommendation That the submissions related to existing legal obligations be accepted, which would require: • amendments to allow contributions made to employees enroled in a registered superannuation scheme under the terms of a collective agreement settlement established prior to 17 May 2007 to count against KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions; and • accepting the submission that ongoing employee rights and obligations contained in existing collective agreements should be maintained. That the submissions requesting the grandparenting of company rules be declined. Issue: Level of employer compulsory contribution Submission (78 – Council of Trade Unions) Employer contributions should be either the relevant percentage or $20 per week, whatever is the greater (given that an employer tax credit is available). Comment Employers are required to make a compulsory employer contribution starting at 1% on 1 April 2008 and increasing to 4% by 1 April 2011. These employer contributions match employee contributions and are offset by an employer tax credit of up to $20 per week. The Council of Trade Unions’ proposal would do two things: • set a minimum employer contribution level at $20 per week, irrespective of the amount of the employee’s 4% contribution; and • transfer the cost from the employer to the Crown through invoking full claiming of the $20 per week employer tax credit. In the absence of a link between employer and employee contribution rates, an example of the impact of this proposal would be as follows: Employee Employer Government matching contribution Ratio Crown and employer to employee contributions Current $10 $10 $10 2:1 $20 minimum proposal $10 $20 $10 3:1 33 The affordability of KiwiSaver contributions to the Crown, employers and employees has been carefully considered. In officials’ view, there is no compelling reason to increase the KiwiSaver subsidy or level of contribution of any group at this time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Impact on defined benefit schemes Submissions (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 45 – Chapman Tripp, 64 – NZ Anglican Church Pensions Board, 71 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 87 – Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, 53 – BP, 7 – Simpson Grierson) • The definition of “db increase” in the proposed section 101D(2)(d) of the KiwiSaver Act does not reflect the intention of including this provision. This provision should be re-drafted in consultation with the Government Actuary. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) • There is no distinction between the member’s contributions in defined benefit schemes and the benefits accrued. In practice, the only way of determining how much the employer has contributed is to subtract the member contribution from the benefits that are accrued. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) • The changes in the accrued benefits can be a result of a number of factors, including a change in the assumptions made by the actuary. The change in the assumptions should not form part of the db increase, and the accrued benefit should be measured on the assumptions used at the start of the year. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) • Most defined benefits are contingent on specific events occurring. As such, to restrict the db increase to the amount that is vested is not considered to be appropriate. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) • For many defined benefit schemes, full vesting occurs only when an employee reaches retirement age and salary multiples for the defined benefit cease increasing. (Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) • The Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 requires an actuarial valuation of defined benefit schemes once every three years. To require a valuation to be done annually would increase compliance costs for schemes significantly. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) • Proposed section 101D(2)(d)(iv) should be deleted as the concept of accrued benefits has already been captured. (Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, Chapman Tripp) • Proposed section 101D(2)(d)(ii) should be extended to recognise increase in benefits as a result of scheme reserves. (Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, Chapman Tripp) 34 • The requirement for contributions to vest immediately creates difficulties for employers, as the employer will have to contribute the total amount in addition to a top-up to a KiwiSaver scheme for any part of the compulsory rate that has not been made up by the existing vested contribution. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) • It is not clear what is meant by section 101D(2)(d)(v) as there will be no undertaking by an employer to contribute at any set rate. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) • The frequency with which the db increase has to be calculated causes concerns. For practical reasons there should be an annual calculation of the extent of the db increase for the following year, which can then be apportioned appropriately between members. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) • Vesting in the employee in a defined benefit scheme can occur only when the employee leaves service and the employee’s final salary and length of service are known. (BP) • Existing schemes are likely already to be making contributions that have a vesting scale. This will effectively require the employer to contribute twice. In defined benefit schemes, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that benefits may not be able to be determined until the employee leaves service, and variables such as length of service and final salary are known. (Simpson Grierson) • Clause 219 of the bill, which inserts a new section 101D into the KiwiSaver Act 2006, should be amended. In particular, the definition of “other contributions” should be altered so that it applies where either: – the employee is employed by the employer before 1 April 2008 (the existing provision); or – the employer contributes a net amount of 4% or more of gross salary or wages. (NZ Anglican Church Pensions Board) • The qualification “before 1 April 2008” in the proposed section 101D(c)(iii) should be deleted. The proposed exemption from the compulsory employer contribution should be widened to allow it to apply to new employees after 1 April 2008 provided the employer contributes a net amount of 4% more of gross salary or wages. One of the reasons for the suggested amendment is that when ministers move between dioceses it is treated as new employment as each diocese is a separate employer. (NZ Anglican Church Pensions Board) Comment The intention of this provision was to ensure that contributions to defined benefit schemes could also count towards the compulsory amount. The provision should also ensure that employers that are not required to make additional compulsory contributions are, in fact, contributing an equivalent amount to an employee’s retirement savings. 35 Officials recommend that employers making contributions to defined benefit schemes be exempted from making compulsory employer contributions, if the contribution meets all of the following criteria: • the contribution is to a registered superannuation scheme; • the contribution is to a scheme that was in existence on 17 May 2007; • the contribution is for an employee in employment at 1 April 2008 or is otherwise employed under a collective agreement negotiated prior to 17 May 2007; • the contribution is a term of the employment contract; and • the contribution is made towards a benefit for the member that is established as a factor of salary. This approach will enable employers currently offering a defined benefit scheme to be exempt from the requirements of compulsory contributions. The exemption will be limited to employers that offer defined benefits in their defined benefit schemes. As such, it will not cover cash accumulation schemes, which are – technically – defined benefit schemes but are operated much more like a defined contribution scheme. This exemption is also likely to extend to Crown schemes, such as the Government Superannuation Fund (GSF), as they are likely to meet the criteria. The exemption will not affect the ability of anyone employed after 1 April 2008 (or on a collective agreement formed after 17 May 2007) to contribute to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying fund, for which employers will be required to make employer contributions. In relation to specific concerns raised by the Anglican Church, officials consider that if an existing employee (employed before 1 April 2008) changes employers and the new employer is required to contribute to the same scheme on the same basis, that contribution by the new employer will count. This approach would also extend to movements within the same group of companies and within government in relation to, say, GSF. It should apply only to defined benefit schemes. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted as follows. That the bill be amended to exempt employers from the requirement to make a compulsory employer contribution if they are making contributions to a defined benefit scheme that meets the following criteria: • the contribution is to a registered superannuation scheme; • the contribution is to a scheme that was in existence on 17 May 2007; • the contribution is for an employee in employment at 1 April 2008 or is otherwise employed under a collective agreement negotiated prior to 17 May 2007; 36 • the contribution is in terms of the employment contract; and • the contribution is made towards a benefit for the member that is established as a factor of salary. That the bill allow existing contributions to a defined benefit scheme to count if the existing employee (employed before 1 April 2008) changes employer and the new employer is required to contribute to the same scheme on the same basis. Issue: Contribution from reserve accounts Submission (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Section 101D should be amended to enable contributions from employers’ reserve accounts to count towards the compulsory rate. The present drafting precludes the use of reserves to fund the contribution rate, while many employers may use their existing reserve account to fulfil their contractual contribution obligations. Comment The purpose of the compulsory employer contribution is to encourage greater savings accumulation by members. This should not necessarily require employers to make active contributions on an ongoing basis, if those contributions can be made from alternative sources such as reserve accounts. This will align with the current practice for many existing schemes. As such, it will ensure that employers currently making contributions to an existing scheme from reserves will not be precluded from having those contributions count towards the compulsory rate. This will be especially desirable for existing schemes which are likely to have built up substantial reserves that could be used to top up their ongoing employer contribution. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 37 Issue: Priority between existing employer contributions and compulsory contributions Submission (86A – Employers and Manufacturers Assn (Central) Inc) The priority of the payments regime in proposed section 101E should be reversed to allow employer contributions into pre-existing superannuation schemes that meet the complying criteria to take priority over compulsory KiwiSaver contributions. Comment The proposed section 101E allows an employer and an employee to agree the proportions of a compulsory employer contribution that will be attributable to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund if the employee is a member of both. If no agreement is made the proposed section provides that the employer contribution first goes to the KiwiSaver scheme and then to the complying superannuation fund. The provision relates only to the amount of a compulsory employer contribution calculated under proposed section 101D. It will not apply to any employer contribution included in the “other contributions” offset in proposed section 101D against compulsory contributions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The proposal in the supplementary order paper No 130, to prevent double dipping, does not go far enough Submission (86A – Employers and Manufacturers Assn (Central) Inc) The submission notes that the 13 August 2007 press statement (Greater protection for savers in super schemes) issued by the Ministers of Finance, Commerce, State Services and Revenue makes it clear that Parliament’s intention is to improve regulation over complying private superannuation schemes. However, the proposal to prevent double dipping does not go far enough. It is expressed to apply to state sector schemes. It is suggested that the amendment go further to cover complying private schemes. 38 Comment The proposed amendment contained in the supplementary order paper No 130 to the proposed section 101D of the KiwiSaver Act is intended to cover situations where an employer may not be able to prevent employees receiving existing superannuation contributions plus the compulsory employer contribution because the terms relating to their employer contributions are imposed by a person independent of the employer and the class of employees. The proposed amendment names three specific employee groups (Members of Parliament, judicial officers and sworn Police) and allows for regulations to be made to name other groups of employees. The remuneration of Members of Parliament and judicial officers is set by the Remuneration Authority. In relation to sworn Police, there is the ability for final arbitration in setting remuneration. The ability to make Regulations for groups of employees is not limited to State sector employees. The submission’s substantive concerns relating to mitigating the risk of double dipping are addressed in officials’ recommendations elsewhere. They deal with vesting of employer contributions, exempting defined benefit schemes (that meet specified conditions) and the ability to include new employees covered by collective agreements to count employer contributions to existing schemes against the compulsory KiwiSaver contribution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Existing employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund should count towards the compulsory employer contribution Submissions (86A – Employers and Manufacturers Assn (Central) Inc, 98 – DLA Phillips Fox) The definition of “other contributions” in proposed section 101D should be amended to expressly include voluntary employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund. The comfort from Inland Revenue as to the policy intent is that voluntary contributions will be taken into account is insufficient, and probably not compatible with the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation (EMA (Central)). As currently drafted, KiwiSaver employer contributions do not come within the “other contributions” offset in the proposed section 101D. This provision relates only to specified superannuation contributions to a registered superannuation scheme. It should be clarified that compulsory employer contributions to an employee’s KiwiSaver scheme are not in addition to existing employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme. (DLA Phillips Fox) 39 Comment The policy intent is that existing employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund would count towards the compulsory amount for existing employees. We agree that the legislation should be clarified to ensure that the policy intent is achieved. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Vesting of contributions to an existing superannuation scheme for the purposes of counting towards compulsory employer contributions Submissions (11 – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 70 – Simpson Grierson) The compulsory employer contributions to existing schemes have to be immediately vested for the contribution to count towards the compulsory employer amount, which is contrary to normal scheme design, and inconsistent with the concept of long-term savings. In an existing superannuation scheme this would mean that an employer’s contributions may be withdrawn when the employee leaves employment. The requirement for an employer contribution to an existing scheme to be vested should be replaced with a requirement that any unvested contribution that has counted towards the compulsory amount be transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund. (Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) The requirement that contributions be fully vested in order to count towards the compulsory contribution is likely to result in increased costs for their employers where the employer also offers a work place scheme, as it will permit double dipping if an employee chooses also to become a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. Employers will have to contribute the total value of their contribution towards their employees existing account, and will have to contribute an additional amount (being the compulsory rate minus the vested employer contributions) towards KiwiSaver. (Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The bill requires employer contributions to vest immediately if they are to count against the compulsory contribution rate. Existing schemes are likely already to be making contributions that have a vesting scale. This will effectively require that employer to contribute twice. (Simpson Grierson) 40 Comment Officials agree with the submissions and recommend that employer contributions vest within a specified period of time to count towards the compulsory rate. The industry “norm” of five years makes most sense and would be consistent with the rules for exemption from automatic enrolment. (Employers can get an exemption from automatically enroling new employees only if their contributions to the scheme vest within five years.) This option requires a change to the bill. This would enable most existing employer contributions to count towards the compulsory amount, greatly reducing the double dipping risk for defined contribution schemes, while ensuring that vesting is not used to separate members from employer contributions that are provided. Officials consider that the change suggested by the Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund would add complexity to the design of KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted to allow a vesting period of five years. Issue: Counting contributions to subsidise scheme operation Submission (88 – The Colonial Motor Company) The bill should allow all payments made on behalf of an employee to an existing registered superannuation scheme to count towards the compulsory rate, irrespective of whether such payment is made to a member’s account or not. Comment The submission argues that superannuation schemes are used by employers to provide a variety of benefits to their employees, including benefits such as the payment of insurance premiums. All contributions for such purposes are for the benefit of the employee, and as such, it recommends that they count towards the compulsory amount. The purpose of the compulsory employer contribution, however, is to encourage long- term savings and to boost the level of savings accumulated in these schemes. If other contributions towards other benefits were able to count, these policy outcomes would not be served. The contributions would not be locked in for retirement and might be used for the payment of unrelated expenses. It should be noted that this is also consistent with the treatment of funds in KiwiSaver, where the minimum contribution requirements cannot be used for other benefits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 Issue: Group life cover Submission (23 – ISI) ISI raised in its oral submission that group life cover should be able to be provided by a KiwiSaver scheme. Comment Group life cover can be provided by a KiwiSaver scheme. However, employee contributions, as required by the KiwiSaver Act and the proposed compulsory employee contribution, cannot be used to pay group life insurance. Those contributions have to be used to provide retirement benefits. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Corporate restructuring and successor funds Submission (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The provisions of section 101D need to be modified to ensure that it remains possible for continuing employers in mergers or acquisitions to mirror the superannuation arrangements that existed before the merger or acquisition. This is often a part of the employer’s retention of the terms and conditions of the various employment contracts that pre-existed the merger or acquisition. As the section is currently worded, such arrangements would not qualify under section 101D. Comment The Superannuation Schemes Act provides a mechanism for employers to transfer between providers if the terms of the new scheme are no less favourable than the terms of the old scheme. This ensures that employers can provide access to the most appropriate scheme for their employees without affecting the terms of the employees’ participation. We agree that proposed section 101D should be amended to provide that the scheme must have been in existence at 17 May 2007 or created as an approved scheme under section 9BAA. This change should be applicable only if all members of the existing scheme, or all members relevant to an existing participation agreement, are transferred under section 9BAA. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 42 Issue: Employers who act on behalf of ACC in paying weekly compensation Submission (Matter raised by officials) The KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that when KiwiSaver members are paid ACC weekly compensation by their employer instead of by ACC, employer contributions will automatically stop. However, employers who wish to do so may continue to contribute to their employees’ KiwiSaver schemes provided that their employees are also contributing while they are on weekly compensation. Comment When claimants are incapacitated from a personal injury, ACC pays weekly compensation at 80% of their previous earnings. However, some employers can act on behalf of ACC and pay weekly compensation to their employees for work injuries that require time off work. To pay weekly compensation on behalf of ACC, employers are either: • part of ACC’s Partnership Programme, whereby “accredited employers” take responsibility for managing work-related injuries in exchange for a reduction in levy – meaning the administration of the claim is managed by a third party; or • part of the Employer Reimbursement Programme, whereby employers who are part of the programme can continue paying their employees salary/wages during the incapacity and seek reimbursement from ACC (at 80%) for weekly compensation. In a number of cases, employers will often pay 100% of an employee’s salary/wages in these situations. Under KiwiSaver, existing members’ contributions automatically stop when ACC starts paying weekly compensation. For contributions to continue, the ACC recipient or Inland Revenue will notify ACC to start making deductions. To have such contributions cease, the recipient will need to apply for a contributions holiday. Employer contributions will also automatically stop for KiwiSaver members who are receiving weekly compensation from ACC, as the bill excludes weekly compensation from being salary or wages for the purposes of compulsory employer contributions. The situation is different, however, for existing KiwiSaver members who receive their ACC compensation from their employer on behalf of ACC. If such members wish to have their contributions cease while they are on ACC, they will need to apply for a contributions holiday. There is, however, no mechanism that allows employers in this situation to stop making KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions when they are paying weekly compensation to their employees. 43 Officials consider that the provisions around ceasing employer contributions while claimants are receiving weekly compensation should equally apply in circumstances where claimants are receiving compensation from ACC or their employer. Accordingly, we recommend that the KiwiSaver Act be amended so that compulsory employer contributions will automatically stop for KiwiSaver members who are receiving weekly compensation from their employer. However, employers who wish to do so may continue to contribute to their employees’ KiwiSaver. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 44 AGE ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLDS Issue: Upper age limit for being able to become a member of KiwiSaver Submissions (12 – Employers & Manufacturers Association (Northern) Incorporated (EMA), 50 – Eriksens Actuarial, 75 – Matt Barker, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants matter raised orally) Allowing people aged 65 and over to join KiwiSaver, with the minimum period of five years applying to them, will encourage people to work later in life, thus contributing positively through paying income tax, helping reduce the acute labour shortage and staying healthier. (Eriksens Actuarial and EMA) People should not be disadvantaged if they leave saving for retirement later in life from necessity and, in contrast to New Zealand, older people in Australia benefit significantly from the Australian superannuation scheme. (EMA) Comment The upper limit to the age of eligibility reflects KiwiSaver’s purpose of encouraging a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation to improve financial wellbeing, particularly in retirement. It could be considered inequitable that those who have reached the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation, and who receive a government pension, continue to benefit from a government policy aimed at retirement savings. A boundary needs to be drawn at some level and the most reasonable level is that which is considered the “retirement age” when people are eligible to receive the aged pension from the government, notwithstanding whether this is their status or not. It should be noted that receipt of the Australian pension is subject to two tests – an income test and an assets test, while New Zealand Superannuation is not means tested (meaning that New Zealanders receive the same amount of pension notwithstanding the income they earn or the assets they hold). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 45 Issue: Lower age limit for being able to become a member of KiwiSaver Submissions (12 – Employers & Manufacturers Association (Northern) Incorporated (EMA), 51 – National Distribution Union (NDU), 75 – Matt Barker, 78 – Council of Trade Unions (CTU), 95 – New Zealand Law Society (NZLS), 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) Automatic enrolment and eligibility for member tax credits should apply to employees above the age of compulsory schooling, or who have been granted an exemption for early release from schooling (NDU). The full benefits of KiwiSaver should apply to workers aged 16 and 17 years old (CTU). The tax credits are available to all people who are working and paying taxes regardless their age. (EMA) Preventing young workers from the tax credits and the employer contributions is discriminatory (CTU, NDU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation) and is inconsistent with the Human Rights Act 1993 (NDU, NZLS). Further, 16 and 17-year- olds in the workforce will not have higher-level qualifications and will never become high income earners and are in more need to save. Comment While 16 and 17-year-olds are legally able to work full-time and are eligible for certain benefits (such as the community services card and the independent youth benefit), the government’s preference is that 16 and 17-year-olds be engaged in some form of study, rather than working. Setting the threshold at 18 years of age is consistent with this, and with the age of automatic enrolment rules. While restricting access to the member tax credit on age could potentially act as a disincentive to introducing a savings discipline early in life, the arguments against extending the tax credit to those under the age of 18 are: • If no age restriction is set on accessing the member tax credit, parents will have an incentive to set up a KiwiSaver account for their children predominantly to benefit from the tax credit. This could benefit high-income earners more, since they are more likely to be in a position to set aside money for their children. In contrast, low-income earners may have no choice but to spend their money on essentials (such as education). • Along with encouraging savings, another of the government’s main priorities is to lift standards of education and skills development. Most young people are in full-time education or training until they are 18 and often far beyond this age, although some are not. The provision of government tax credits (and compulsory employer contributions for those who are working) could conflict with the government’s education goals. This is why automatic enrolment of new employees applies only to those aged 18 years and over, and why the government sought to align eligibility for the tax credits to this policy. 46 • There would be a significant increase in the cost of KiwiSaver if the member tax credits were extended to those aged under 18. In addition, any disadvantage to members under 18 is transitional. They will still receive the $1,000 kick-start and an ongoing $40 annual fee subsidy, which will provide a reasonable incentive to join, and, as soon as they turn 18, they will be eligible for the member tax credit on their contributions and for compulsory employer contribution if they are in employment and contributing. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Age limit for withdrawing funds from KiwiSaver Submission (50 – Eriksens Actuarial) The age at which KiwiSaver members are able to withdraw funds should be reduced from 65 to 60. There is no actuarial cost implication on choosing a slightly lower age, as it is a defined contribution scheme. Further, there is a risk that if the New Zealand Superannuation age is raised to 70, KiwiSaver funds will be locked in until 70 as well. Comment To withdraw funds, members must be 65 or over and have been a member for at least five years. That requirement reflects KiwiSaver’s purpose of encouraging a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation to improve financial wellbeing, particularly in retirement. This age threshold has not changed since the original KiwiSaver design and has been maintained in relation to the member tax credits and compulsory employer matching contributions, as they maintain the focus on retirement. Eriksens also argued in its submission and before the Committee that age of entry to KwiSaver should be extended to prolong workers’ participation in the workforce. This submission could have the opposite effect. Setting the age of withdrawal to coincide with the age of eligibility for New Zealand superannuation logically links two complementary policies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 47 MINIMUM EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS Issue: Minimum contribution rate to KiwiSaver Submissions (30 – New Zealand Public Service Association (NZPSA), 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 45 – Chapman Tripp, 50 – Eriksens Actuarial, 51 – National Distribution Union (NDU), 61 – KPMG, 74 – Deloitte, 78 – Council of Trade Union (CTU), 87 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The current provision whereby the employee contribution can help make up the 4% minimum should be retained (NZPSA, CTU and Eriksens), or the minimum contribution level should be reduced to 2% of salary or wages (NDU, CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation). A 2% contribution rate is a better point of entry for new savers to establish a savings habit, and the addition of the member tax credits and the employer contributions will help someone accumulate a reasonable saving balance (CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation). Further, it can help target KiwiSaver to those that have a saving problem (low income workers), especially in view of the resistance by low-income workers to contribute 4% (CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation). If the minimum employee contribution is not reduced from the proposed level of 4% of salary or wages, alternatives should be considered. The following alternatives are suggested (in order of preference) by the CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation: • Allow employer contributions to count towards the employee contribution rate. • Allow employer contributions to count towards an employee’s minimum contribution rate of 4% of salary or wages until April 2010, then increase to 6% and then to 8% by 2011 (minimal alternative). • Allow the contributions of employers that have entered an arrangement prior to April 2008 for employer contributions to count towards the minimum employee contribution, and allow those employers to offer any combination of employee/employer contributions totalling 4% for employees beginning work after April 2008 and before April 2010. Employers and employees should be entitled to choose their contribution rates, provided the minimum total values in clause 2 of Schedule 4 are achieved. (KPMG, ASFONZ) Removing the current ability for employees to contribute on a 2 plus 2 basis will place KiwiSaver beyond the reach of many employees unable to forgo 4% of salary. The original provisions of the Act should be retained. (ASFONZ) 48 Regardless of whether this is accepted, section 66A and Schedule 4 require redrafting to enable their effective application. Apart from being difficult to interpret, requiring references to three different clauses of Schedule 4, the rules do not work properly. (KPMG, Chapman Tripp, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte ASFONZ, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The design of KiwiSaver has involved trade-offs between encouraging participation by a wider group (greater participation of low-income earners) and encouraging higher rates of saving across the board. Under the original KiwiSaver design, the minimum employee contribution was 4% of salary or wages, and employer contributions were voluntary. To the extent that employers were prepared to make voluntary contributions, the KiwiSaver Act 2006 allowed for any voluntary employer contributions to count towards the employee’s minimum 4% contribution rate if the employee so elected. The bill phases out the ability of employer contributions to count towards the minimum level of employer contribution from 1 April 2008. The decision to phase this out is supported by the purpose of the Act (to increase individuals' well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and to provide retirement benefits), the introduction of incentives proposed in the bill (member and employer tax credits and the compulsory matching employer contributions), and the need to ensure that employees make contributions at a rate that would make a difference. The key aim of KiwiSaver is to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by those who aspire to standards of living in retirement similar to those they enjoy before retirement. While a sustained contribution may be achievable during some periods in people’s lives, at other times they may have difficulty in finding 4% of salary or wages to contribute to KiwiSaver. For some people, saving for retirement does not make economic sense – for example, those on very low incomes, since New Zealand Superannuation will give them a similar income level, and those paying high interest on debt. This is why joining KiwiSaver is not compulsory and why members can apply for a contributions holiday. A contribution rate of 4% could be insufficient to provide a 70% replacement income in retirement for a large number of New Zealanders. The following table shows the saving rate required to supplement NZ Superannuation to achieve 70% income replacement in retirement for different starting ages. 2 For example, someone with a gross income of $30,000 who started saving at age 25 would need to save 2 to 5% until retirement to achieve a retirement income of 70% of $30,000 (after tax, including NZ Superannuation). Starting saving later in life or having a higher salary increases the required savings rate considerably: 12 to 16% would be required for someone starting saving at age 40 with a gross income of $60,000. 2 The required rates differ for male/female (owing to life expectancy) and single/couple (owing to NZ superannuation rate). The assumptions include: retirement at 65, life expectancy 82/85 (male/female), net real rate of return 2.5% (gross rate of return 8%). Note that these calculations do not include the effects of other asset accumulation, such as a house (for example, when a house is sold and a cheaper house purchased, providing additional income). Also note that the results are sensitive to the rate of return (and other assumptions). For example, an increase in gross rate of return of 2 percentage points would decrease the required contribution rate by around 1 to 2 percentage points. 49 Contribution rate required for 70% income replacement in retirement Income $30,000 $40,000 $50,000 $60,000 25 2%-5% 4%-7% 5%-8% 6%-8% 30 3%-6% 5%-8% 7%-10% 8%-10% Age 40 4%-10% 9%-14% 11%-15% 12%-16% Source: Treasury calculation using www.sorted.org.nz information. With employers required to contribute to employees’ long-term savings, and with the government contributing more to each member’s KiwiSaver account on an ongoing basis, there is an expectation that employees will also seriously commit to their long- term savings. The CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation have suggested a couple of alternatives if the minimum employer contribution level is not decreased. Allowing employer contributions to count towards the employee minimum for those who have entered an arrangement is already allowed under the provisions in the bill relating to those employed at 1 April 2008. That means employees do not have to have started contributing before 1 April 2008 to be eligible for the employer contributions to count towards the employee minimum contribution. They would have had to enter into an agreement before 1 April 2008. In any case, the phasing out of employer contributions counting towards the employee minimum contribution would still apply to such arrangements. A suggested alternative was to allow employer contributions to count towards an employee’s minimum contribution rate of 4% of salary or wages until April 2010, then convert to 6% and then to 8% by 2011. This effectively would just extend the phasing out of the ability for employer contributions by two years for all new employees after 1 April 2008. This would just delay the introduction of a minimum contribution level of 4% and would not overcome the problem of someone not being able to afford to contribute on an ongoing basis to KiwiSaver. As is mentioned above, while a sustained contribution may be achievable during some periods in people’s lives, at other times they may have difficulty in finding 4% of salary or wages to contribute to KiwiSaver. This is why KiwiSaver is not compulsory. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 50 Issue: Minimum contribution rate to complying superannuation funds Submission (28 – ANZ) For complying superannuation funds the minimum employee contribution should be decreased from 4% to 2% of the employee’s gross salary or wages. The employee contribution of 4% is too high for many people and it impacts negatively on many of ANZ’s existing schemes by requiring a contribution rate higher than under their current trust deeds. Comment The minimum 4% employee contribution rate for complying superannuation funds is consistent with the minimum rate required for KiwiSaver. This minimum rate is discussed further in “Minimum contribution rate to KiwiSaver”, above. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 51 EMPLOYEE STATUS Issue: Recognise employment with multiple DHB employers as continuous Submissions (93 – New Zealand Resident Doctors’ Association and Auckland Regional RMO Services Ltd) Registered Medical Officers are obliged to change DHB employer frequently in order to complete their training. These employees are subject to the automatic enrolment and have to opt out (if that is their choice) every time they change employer, creating significant additional administrative and compliance costs for the DHBs as well as Inland Revenue. An amendment to the Holidays Act has been made to recognise that RMOs change employers frequently but their period of employment is considered as continuous for the purposes of the Act with regard to the accrual of annual leave. The KiwiSaver Act should be amended to recognise employment with multiple DHB employers as continuous. Comment KiwiSaver has been specifically designed so that when there is a change in employment, automatic enrolment occurs and keeps occurring over an employee’s working life. This is intended to counter the inertia which prevents people from beginning and maintaining a savings habit. An exemption to the automatic enrolment rules for RMOs would undermine the intent of these rules as it would create a precedent for other groups that change employers regularly to request an exemption. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 52 Issue: Casual employees Submissions (12 – EMA Northern Incorporated, 26 – Hospitality Association of New Zealand, 66 – Business New Zealand, 86 –EMA Central Incorporated, 91 –New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 95 – New Zealand Law Society) The submissions note their support for the amendment to the KiwiSaver Act to ensure that casual employees are not subject to the automatic enrolment rules of KiwiSaver. (EMA Northern Incorporated, Hospitality Association of New Zealand, Business New Zealand, EMA Central Incorporated) Section 12 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended, to exclude from the automatic enrolment rules employment under a contract of service that is for a period of 63 continuous days or less rather than the present 28 days. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A provision should be made so that when casual employees become permanent the automatic enrolment rules apply. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Changes to the automatic enrolment rules for casual employees should contain provisions for employers to backdate their application to the commencement of work with the employer so as to provide a clear, ongoing position for employers. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Amendments to section 12 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should apply with effect from 1 July 2007. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The policy intention was for employees to be exempt from the automatic enrolment rules if they were employed for a continuous period of 28 days or less. If employment was extended beyond 28 days, employees would then become subject to the automatic enrolment rules (as if they had started new employment). The period of 28 days or less significantly reduces the compliance burden for employers and short-term employees without undermining the automatic enrolment mechanism. Officials consider that a period of more than 28 days could undermine the intent of automatic enrolment. Whilst casual agricultural workers are able to work for a period of three months without becoming subject to the automatic enrolment rules, they are a defined term in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and have their own special tax rate. Accordingly, casual agricultural workers are an easily identifiable subset of casual employees, and the compliance cost on employers of casual agricultural workers is significantly less than that for employers of other casual employees. The KiwiSaver design has, where appropriate, leveraged off current rules to minimise compliance costs for employers. 53 Under the proposed amendments to section 12 of the KiwiSaver Act, “casual employment” will be defined by reference to the Holidays Act 2003, which defines it as employment that is “intermittent or irregular”. Accordingly, casual employees who are paid holiday pay with their salary and wages will not be subject to the automatic enrolment rules. There is currently no provision for casual employees to be automatically enroled if they stop being paid holiday pay and become permanent employees. In this situation, it would be up to employees to opt in, either through their employer or by contacting a provider directly. However, temporary employees become subject to automatic enrolment if their employment is extended beyond 28 days, and a person who ceases to be an agricultural worker also becomes subject to automatic enrolment. There is a consistency argument that casual employees should be subject to automatic enrolment if they cease to be casuals. However, this would require employers to set up systems to monitor whether the employment contract changes. Given the compliance costs associated with this and the incentive to join KiwiSaver, officials would not recommend that such employees be subject to automatic enrolment when they cease to be a casual. If casual or temporary employees were able to backdate their application for KiwiSaver when they began working for their employer, it would create administrative difficulties for employers. Employers would need to deduct 4% of their employees’ salary or wages retrospectively and contribute matching compulsory employer contributions retrospectively. The member tax credit would also need to be applied retrospectively. The Law Society has recommended that the application date apply from 1 July 2007 rather than 1 April 2008. Officials consider that this could create problems for employers who have automatically enroled casual employees based on current law. However, it would provide certainty for those employers who have not automatically enroled casuals because they thought that they were excluded. On balance, officials consider that the amendments should apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendations That the submissions be declined. 54 Issue: Definition of “permanent employees” Submission (98 – DLA Phillips Fox) The definition of “permanent employee”, as it relates to section 46 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, which deals with an employer choosing a KiwiSaver scheme for employees, needs to be addressed. This definition includes only employees that are not temporary employees and to whom the automatic enrolment rules would apply but for the application of section 14 of the KiwiSaver Act. The recent amendment to this definition has limited its scope. Comment Officials agree that the definition should be amended to reflect its intent. The scheme should be open to all new permanent employees of the employer except those who are not subject to automatic enrolment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Secondments Submission (Matter raised by officials) The KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that when employees enter into a secondment arrangement whereby they are transferred from one employer to another but remain “employed” by the original employer, such an arrangement is not subject to the automatic enrolment rules. Comment The definition of “employer” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act states that an employer is a person “who pays, or is liable to pay” salary or wages to another. The drafting of this definition means that employees who are seconded under certain arrangements may have two employers. This has the potential to create complications for employers in the management of their responsibilities under KiwiSaver. The issue arises where an employer (employer A) seconds employees to another employer (employer B) under an arrangement whereby employer B agrees to pay the employee directly (rather than reimbursing employer A for the cost of the seconded employee). Under current law the employee has started new employment and is therefore subject to automatic enrolment. 55 Officials accordingly recommend that an amendment be made to the KiwiSaver Act, so that when employees are seconded under an arrangement as described above, they will be excluded from the automatic enrolment rules. However, if an employee terminates employment with employer A and starts with employer B this will constitute new employment and be subject to the automatic enrolment rules. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 COMPLYING SUPERANNUATION FUNDS Issue: Participation agreements established before 1 July 2007 Submissions (70 – Simpson Grierson, 87 – Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) There is no good policy reason to exclude schemes from obtaining complying superannuation fund status that are not registered or have not concluded a participation agreement prior to 1 July. It is more appropriate for employers to determine, on an ongoing basis, whether KiwiSaver or an alternative complying superannuation fund offers the best benefits for members. This would necessitate the employer being able to shift between various providers and types of schemes as the employer determines is most appropriate. (Simpson Grierson) The only grandparenting that is necessary should relate to the existing scheme and not to the employer that provides access to the scheme. (Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) Comment It is important to note that the creation of the complying superannuation funds was a response to a problem that arose for employers that provided access to registered superannuation schemes. The objective of these provisions was to ensure that the introduction of KiwiSaver, and particularly the SSCWT exemption, did not result in existing superannuation schemes winding up. This rationale does not extend to employers that had not already established superannuation arrangements before the introduction of KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Parity between different savings vehicles Submissions (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 33 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 70 – Simpson Grierson, 78 – Council of Trade Unions (CTU), 87 – Association of Superannuation Funds New Zealand (ASFONZ), 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) There should be parity between savings vehicles, in particular, the government-funded $1,000 one-off kick-start and the fee subsidy should also be available to complying superannuation funds. 57 Transfers from KiwiSaver schemes to complying funds should be allowed (Mercer Human Resource Consulting, Simpson Grierson, CTU, ASFONZ and New Zealand Nurses Organisation), and this should occur without the loss of benefits aside from the fee subsidy (CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation). This will ease the complications and the administration burden of employer compulsory contributions (ASFONZ) and will allow employees the option of swapping to an employer superannuation scheme when they change jobs (CTU). It is also argued that there is no good policy reason for the disparity between transferring from a KiwiSaver scheme versus a complying superannuation scheme (Simpson Grierson). Comment Permitting transfers from KiwiSaver to complying funds would undermine a fundamental feature of the original KiwiSaver model by extending a facility that was only intended to be a means of accommodating employers that were already offering and contributing to a superannuation scheme on behalf of their employees. It would provide a way to access all KiwiSaver benefits without members being subject to all the conditions, unless the additional benefits are clawed back and, if they are, would add considerable complexity and cost. Further, it should be noted that portability in the KiwiSaver context is crucial as members can have only one account. This is not the case for complying funds and, as such, there is a reduced need for portability to such funds. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 58 COMPLYING FUNDS: IRD NUMBERS Submission (87 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) In respect of a complying superannuation fund it would be helpful if the legislation included a power for trustees of the fund to obtain IRD numbers from the Commissioner or from the employer of a member for the purpose of administering the tax credits. Comment Inland Revenue requires sufficient information to ensure that members do not receive a member tax credit payment when ineligible because, for example, they may have already received the full member tax credit in respect of their contributions to another fund. Officials consider that, for privacy reasons, a complying fund should obtain the IRD number from the member directly or with the member’s consent from the employer. For Inland Revenue to be able to administer the member tax credits, a complying fund should provide the IRD number, if known. If the IRD number is not known, the Commissioner has the authority to request other information, such as the member’s date of birth, from the provider in order to make the payment. If there is insufficient information to make a payment, the provider will be advised to write to the member and request the necessary information. Officials consider that there is sufficient incentive for members to provide this information to providers and that a legislative provision is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that complying superannuation funds that do not have a member’s IRD number be able to supply other information to Inland Revenue to assist it in making the payment. If it is unable to make the payment based on the information provided, Inland Revenue will inform the provider so that the provider can write to the member requesting the necessary information. This will require an amendment to subsection 68C (3)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that the IRD number be provided if known. 59 Issue: Complying superannuation funds – successor funds Submission (70 – Simpson Grierson, 87 – Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) The requirement for a participation agreement to be entered into prior to 1 July 2007 to obtain complying superannuation fund status effectively locks employers into an agreement with a specific provider. It is more effective to allow employers to be able to offer access to other schemes if they determine that their existing provider is no longer appropriate. While the proposed amendments in clause 240 go some way towards allowing successor participation agreements, the test for commercial necessity is too onerous a requirement. There should be no requirement for necessity, and employers should be able to shift between providers as they wish. This would encourage competition between complying superannuation funds and be in the best interests of members. (Simpson Grierson) How will the commercial necessity requirement be applied in practice? (Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) Comment The purpose of restricting the availability of complying superannuation funds to employers already providing access to superannuation schemes reflects the fact that the complying superannuation fund mechanism was intended to ensure that such employers had a cost-effective option as a result of the introduction of KiwiSaver and that existing schemes were therefore less likely to wind up. The proposed amendment to the complying fund provisions is aimed at dealing with the issue of mirror schemes. These are essentially schemes that are established to replace existing schemes, which may occur where there is a merger or an acquisition at the employer level. A result of the merger may be to establish a single superannuation offering for all the employees of the merged entity. The inclusion of the term “commercial necessity” is intended to reflect this concept and extend the complying fund mechanism to schemes that replace existing complying funds as a result of mergers and acquisitions. This could be clarified in the clause 240 of the bill. The first submission also suggests that there is a need to address the lack of competition that has been created by the complying superannuation fund requirements. The Superannuation Schemes Act provides a mechanism for employers to transfer between providers if the terms of the new scheme are no less favourable than the terms of the old scheme. This ensures that employers can provide access to the most appropriate scheme for their employees without affecting the terms of employees’ participation. Officials recommend that the eligibility requirements for complying superannuation funds extend out to schemes that replace complying superannuation funds under the transfer provision in section 9BAA of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. This vehicle should be applicable only if all members of the existing scheme, or all members relevant to an existing participation agreement, are transferred under section 9BAA and approved by the Government Actuary. 60 Recommendation That the submissions be partially accepted and the proposed legislation relating to “commercial necessity” be clarified as follows: • The provision for successor funds should be extended to schemes that meet the requirements in section 9BAA. • This vehicle should be applicable only if all members of the existing scheme, or all members relevant to an existing participation agreement, are transferred under section 9BAA and approved by the Government Actuary. Issue: Inclusion of a trust deed within the meaning of a participation agreement Submission (70 – Simpson Grierson, 87 – Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) Clause 240(2) may have some undesirable consequences. The clause currently allows for the argument that any amendment to the trust deed which impacts on the employer participation in a scheme may mean that a previously complying fund may no longer be compliant. The wording should be clarified to establish the intention that a participation agreement may be entered into by deed. Comment The purpose of this provision was to ensure that where successor schemes were established on amalgamation or acquisition of an employer’s business, the successor scheme could be either a stand-alone scheme or master trust arrangement. We agree that the intention of this provision should be clarified to provide that trust deeds may replace participation agreements as complying superannuation successor funds. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 61 Issue: Failure to pay Submission (24 – AMP, 87 – ASFONZ) The proposed section 101H of the KiwiSaver Act introduces strict obligations on the providers of complying superannuation funds to take reasonable steps to ensure payment by the employer if it has reason to believe that an employer has failed to pay the amounts of compulsory employer contribution. The terms “reason to believe” and “reasonable steps” are uncertain and require further definition. (AMP) As the section is currently drafted, it could result in a requirement that the provider stringently monitors employer contributions where the provider may not necessarily have the salary details relating to the relevant members. This may also be a problem where the employer is paying more than the compulsory rate, as the provider may not know what part of the contribution relates to the compulsory rate. (AMP) The proposed section 101H is unduly onerous, and the obligation should be limited to annual certification as to the contribution levels. (ASFONZ) Comment Officials agree that the requirement for a provider to take reasonable steps to recover funds in this situation creates uncertainty for the provider. A provider may not know how far such an obligation extends. To rectify this uncertainty, officials recommend that the obligation to take reasonable steps be replaced with an obligation to notify the employer that the compulsory contribution has not been received and seek payment of that contribution as soon as practicable after the provider becomes aware of the non- payment. This notification should also be sent to the Government Actuary. Officials note that it is current practice for an employer to certify to providers that all contributions required have been made, a practice we expect to continue. Further, to remove the uncertainty in respect of the timing of the process, we recommend that the collection process start as soon as the provider is aware that an employer has not made an employer contribution. Providers would have to keep track of the relevant level of contributions being made on behalf of members. This is consistent with the existing framework for superannuation schemes. Recommendation That the submission is accepted and the relevant provisions amended accordingly. 62 Issue: In-service portability Submission (45 – Chapman Tripp) Portability in the context of complying superannuation funds should mean portability when changing employers or otherwise leaving service. The ability to change funds while in-service will risk undermining an existing scheme’s critical mass. The rationale that has been provided in favour of in-service portability has been based on achieving consistency between KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds. However, such consistency would require reciprocal portability, which is currently not permitted. As such, paragraph (d) of the complying fund rules prescribed in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be deleted. Comment The purpose of allowing in-service portability is to give consumers the power to choose which scheme they wish to become members of, without restricting such portability to changes of employment. Rather than members being tied to a scheme during the term of their employment, which may, over time, fail to meet their needs, members can change to a more suitable scheme. Schemes can compete for new members by providing superior service and returns for members. Schemes that fail to meet consumer expectation may wind up, which will be a positive outcome in respect of market efficiency – ineffective funds may over time be superseded by efficient and effective funds. Portability and lock-in provisions are fundamental to obtaining complying fund status and obtaining the related benefits – particularly the member tax credit. The rationale behind complying fund status was not to provide an alternative to KiwiSaver, but to enable existing schemes to co-exist with KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 Issue: In-service portability – ancillary benefits Submission (87 – Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) Allowing portability at any time from a complying superannuation fund may impact on the benefit structures in those schemes, including where insurance may be calculated as part of those benefits. These ancillary benefits should be able to be re- adjusted if portability is maintained, irrespective of any adverse consequence to members. Comment Many existing superannuation schemes attach insurance benefits to the superannuation benefits that are provided. Most arrangements require an insurer to pay the relevant benefit if the insured event arises during the course of the member’s participation in that scheme. Officials believe that a viable option will be to enable the insurer to cancel the cover if a member chooses to transfer the funds out of the complying funds. This would ensure that the insurer would not have considered the transfer of the accumulation in its risk assessment, which in turn, would mean that the premiums that are currently charged are unlikely to be affected. This protects the status quo, by maintaining the member’s right to transfer, while ensuring that employer would not have to bear the costs of premiums on accumulated balances that have been decreased by transfers to other schemes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and a suitable provision allowing the cessation of other benefits on transfer from a complying fund be included. Issue: Extending the SSCWT exemption to defined benefit schemes Submission (64 –The New Zealand Anglican Church Pension Board) The definition of “complying superannuation fund” should be amended to include defined benefit schemes as long as the terms of the scheme are reasonable. This would allow such schemes to qualify for the SSCWT exemption on employer contributions. 64 Comment The complying superannuation fund rules were introduced to minimise the risk of existing employer schemes winding up. The rules do not explicitly exclude defined benefit schemes. Any defined benefit scheme will be able to establish a complying superannuation scheme under the current arrangements. The complying superannuation fund section, however, would be required to operate on a defined contribution basis. Furthermore, an exemption would not increase retirement savings as the retirement benefits are a factor of salary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 MEMBER TAX CREDITS Issue: Low income employees and the tax credit Submission (51 – National Distribution Union) The full benefit of the member tax credit may not be available to some on low incomes, particularly those working part-time or seasonally, or making member contributions of less than 4%. The submission suggests further investigation of ways to ensure that members with low annual incomes who demonstrate a commitment to the aims of the scheme by saving where they are able to receive the full benefit of the member tax credit. Comment The member tax credit is an incentive for people to make regular contributions to KiwiSaver. Not everyone is in the position to do this, which is why joining KiwiSaver is not compulsory and why members can apply for a contributions holiday. The current KiwiSaver design already benefits those on lower incomes more than those on higher incomes, as the member tax credit operates on a “matching” basis up to the $20 a week cap. For example, people earning $26,000 who save 4% of their salary through KiwiSaver ($20 per week) will receive an additional $20 a week from their employer (from 1 April 2011) and $20 a week from the government – an additional $2 for every $1 saved. In comparison, as the government contribution is capped at $20 per week, the pay-off for an individual earning $52,000 falls to 1.5:1 and decreases the further you go up the income scale. At incomes of $26,000, employees will continue to get the full benefit of the member tax credit. The income threshold was specifically set at this level which is well below the average wage to ensure that employees on lower incomes would receive the full benefit of the credit. If the member tax credit was to be available to employees notwithstanding the contribution rate (say, for those contributing 2% of salary and wages notwithstanding the amount contributed per week), it would open the system to potential abuse. It would also be inequitable because, at relatively low income levels, some members would contribute more of their salary for the same benefit. This is contrary to the incentive system that the member tax credit aims to imbed (that members receive a larger tax credit the more they contribute up to a cap) and contrary to the objectives of KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 Issue: Member tax credit – payment upon transfer, emigration, death and closure Submissions (23 – ISI, 47 – ING, 54 – ASB, 61 – KPMG, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) No allowance is made for payment of the member tax credit upon transfer. Inland Revenue should make the payment to the provider who is the member’s current provider at the time of payment. (ING) Allowance should also be made for payment of the member tax credit in exceptional circumstances to the saver or their estate such as in the case when an account is closed. Payment could be made where the saver has permanently emigrated or died before any tax credit due has been claimed. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association, ING) The provider must claim a tax credit on the day prior to the member ceasing membership. The provider must pro rata the credit, which must vest upon receipt of the payment. These are not possible after a full withdrawal. When a member exits KiwiSaver, Inland Revenue should remit any tax credit directly to the member or the member’s estate along with any contributions Inland Revenue is holding. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association, ING, ASB, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Upon permanent immigration providers should inform Inland Revenue of the member’s details and Inland Revenue should advise the fund provider of the amount of tax credits to be refunded. Providers should be able to make ad hoc requests to Inland Revenue where there is a closure. Alternatively, the member should lodge the final claim. (ASB) Comment Providers can claim the member tax credit annually, on the basis of a 30 June year, on behalf of members. They can also claim the credit part-year for those who stop being a member of KiwiSaver or a complying fund during the year (whose account is closed). The concerns raised in submissions are dealt with by Supplementary Order Paper No. 130. The SOP provides that in respect of members whose accounts are closed, Inland Revenue will make the final payment of credit to them or their estate directly (once probate is granted) provided that members’ details are supplied to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will pay the credit to the member’s provider at the time the claim is made. Therefore, if there is a change in provider, the credit will be paid to the new provider if requested. 67 The SOP also provides that a credit will be paid for contributions held by Inland Revenue for members who subsequently cease to be members for reasons such as death before contributions can be on-paid to the member’s provider. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and note that these submissions are addressed by the Supplementary Order Paper. Issue: Changes to the claw-back of the member tax credits on permanent emigration Submission (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Section KJ5 (6)(a)(i) requires that the relevant fund provider must pay to the Commissioner the lesser of three amounts – one of which is the amounts of the tax credit that have been paid for the person. As a person may have tax credits in one or more complying superannuation funds, as well as in a KiwiSaver scheme, this provision should be clarified to capture only the tax credits that have been paid to the provider of the scheme or fund in question plus the amounts of any tax credits that have been transferred in from another scheme. Comment The policy intent is that that the nominal value of the member tax credit should be clawed back from the provider when members permanently emigrate and withdraw their accumulated interest. The provider should be required to repay only those credits which that provider has received either directly from Inland Revenue or as a result of a transfer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 68 Issue: Abolition of claw-back on permanent emigration Submission (23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc (ISI), 47 – ING, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The claw-back should be removed on the basis that: • The claw-back will act as a disincentive to joining KiwiSaver, especially for younger employees. The term “tax credit” implies that employees are receiving back part of the tax they have paid as an incentive to save. The claw-back will be viewed as a tax grab. • There is a clash between the tax credit claw-back and PIE rules. The member’s accumulation may have to be refunded to Inland Revenue, leaving no interest to adjust to fund the member’s PIE tax liability. This liability will then be borne by the other investors in the KiwiSaver scheme. • The claw-back is complicated to implement for both providers and Inland Revenue, especially when members transfer between providers over the life of their KiwiSaver membership. • There is insufficient time to implement the required changes to enable tracking of tax credits within providers’ systems to allow this information to be passed between providers when members transfer. Comment KiwiSaver is designed for people living in New Zealand to have access to retirement savings and offers taxpayer-funded benefits and incentives to join. These benefits and incentives also work to encourage inward migration and the return of New Zealanders living overseas. It would be unfair to allow people that have relocated overseas to access tax credits in cash while those who stay in New Zealand have their tax credits locked in until the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation (or after five years of membership, whichever is the later). KiwiSaver does allow people to start and stop contributing to KiwiSaver as they wish by applying for a contributions holiday for up to five years at a time, enabling young New Zealanders to start saving for their retirement and then to travel overseas, rejoining KiwiSaver on their return. There is no requirement for people to withdraw their accumulated interest on permanent emigration. The tax credit claw-back does not conflict with the PIE rules as a member’s tax liability (and fund management fees) will be taken into account before a member’s tax credit is clawed back. Systems to record and track member tax credits do not have to be in place until after 1 July 2008, as the first member tax credit will not be payable until that date. Furthermore, to manage concerns around providers having the necessary systems in place by July 2008, the bill allows the date on which the member tax credit claim to be made to be determined by the Commissioner. Submissions have recommended that legislation prescribe timeframes for processing the claims. 69 In addition, a permanent emigration withdrawal cannot be made until one year has lapsed after the permanent emigration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Permanent emigration and the member tax credit Submission (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Clause 14(2) in schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended. At present there is no requirement to deduct the Crown contribution arising from section KJ 1 of the Income Tax Act. Comment Officials agree that an amendment should be made to clause 14(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to reflect the policy intention that when KiwiSaver members permanently emigrate and transfer all of their funds in their KiwiSaver scheme to a foreign superannuation scheme authorised for that purpose by regulations, the nominal value of their member tax credit, up to the value of their accumulation in their scheme, is repaid to the Crown. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 EMPLOYER TAX CREDITS Issue: Employer tax credit should not proceed Submission (85 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Clauses 143 and 219 should not be proceeded with. Employer tax credits and compulsory employer contributions should be dropped and replaced with a refundable credit for all eligible taxpayers whose aggregate employer and member contributions exceed the minimum 4% of their gross personal services income. Also, the SSCWT exemption for employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund should be replaced with a deduction for 50% of the aggregate employer and member contributions (capped at 4% of the gross personal services income). Comment The submission supports the government’s aim of increasing incentives to join and make regular contributions to KiwiSaver, although it questions the mechanics adopted. Officials consider that the suggested mechanisms will not achieve the objectives of increasing savings as there is no requirement for employers to contribute. The employer tax credit is paid in respect of a contribution paid by the employer. The benefits of these suggested mechanisms are likely to be directed at higher income earners who can afford to “salary sacrifice”. Both the suggested mechanisms will result in a tax reduction for savers based on the amount contributed to KiwiSaver. This is because the refundable credit is payable to the saver, rather than to the employer to offset the cost of employer contributions or to the provider, as occurs with the member tax credit. The deduction to replace SSCWT has the same effect in reducing the tax payable by the saver. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 71 Issue: Employer tax credit formula Submission (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The maximum employer tax credit is set as $20 per week and is calculated by considering fractions of a week that are included in any pay period. Consideration needs to be given to the employer tax credit formula as it may result in inadequate compensation to employers who have seasonal operations. Mercer Human Resource Consulting provided the example of a waged employee who works a 40 hour week for 6 months of the year and a 20 hour week for the remainder of the year. He is paid $17 an hour. In the on-season period his KiwiSaver weekly contributions will be 17\*40\*0.4 = $27.20. In the off-season they will be 17\*20\*.04 = $13.60. The employee will qualify for the full member tax credit having made contributions in excess of $1042.86 for the year. However, the employer tax credit will be restricted to $875.95 (26.07\*$20 + 26.07\*13.60). Comment The submission has assumed that the employer tax credit has an annual cap of $1042.86 and that it will match employer contributions up to that cap. The policy intent is that the employer tax credit is to compensate an employer up to $20 per week for contributions made on behalf of the employee for that week. Introducing an annual cap would increase both compliance and administrative costs for both employer and Inland Revenue in having to run annual totals. The employer tax credit has been integrated into the PAYE process, which is based around pay periods in a month to minimise compliance costs and cash flow costs for employers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Entitlement to the employer tax credit Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section 101C should be amended to ensure that the entitlement of the employer tax credit occurs from the point at which employee contributions commence through PAYE deduction. Comment In contract terms, an individual generally becomes a member of a superannuation scheme when the securities are allotted by the providers. 72 Section 101C requires an employee to be a member of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund before the employer is required to make employer contributions. However, the policy intention is that compulsory employer contributions begin at the same time a deduction is first made for an employee. The employer tax credit is to be integrated into the PAYE remittance process so that the value of the tax credit is given to employers at the same time they are required to remit the contributions to providers or to Inland Revenue. Officials recognise that, owing to the requirement that an employee be a member of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund before the employer is required to make employer contributions, the policy intention is not met. Accordingly, we recommend that an amendment be made to proposed section 101C so that employer contributions are required to start from the first pay from which an employee deduction is made. Eligibility for the employer tax credit should be tied to that date as well. If the employee opts out, the actual employer contributions paid will be refunded to the employer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Employer tax credits for people employed by two or more associated employers Submission (17 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The limitation on the amount of employer tax credit that is available in respect of someone who is employed by two or more associated employers will be difficult for employers to administer and will necessitate the flow of remuneration information between employers that may breach the terms of the Privacy Act. An alternative means of preventing abuse of the employer tax credit arrangements should be sought. Comment Proposed new section KJ 7 of the Income Tax Act specifies that if someone is employed by a number of employers who are associated for tax purposes, the associated employers will be considered as one employer for the purposes of claiming the tax credit. This provision is being introduced in order to prevent associated employers claiming more than one credit for the same employee. Officials do not consider that the flow of remuneration information in this manner will create privacy concerns. However, if employers are concerned, they have the option of requiring employee consent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 Issue: Entitlement of self-employed to tax deduction for contributions Submission (69R – BKR Walker Wayland) Self-employed people should be entitled to a tax deduction for contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme to reflect that employer contributions are tax deductible to the employer and not subject to SSCWT. This would: • equate a self-employed person to an employee; • ensure the self-employed person was not disadvantaged in relation to an employee; • ensure both are locked in until 65 years; and • need some form of maximum contribution limit. Comment Self-employed people are able to join and contribute to KiwiSaver schemes. They must contract directly with a provider and agree to a contribution amount. There is no minimum contribution rate for the self-employed as there is for employees (4% of salary or wages). 3 Self-employed people will be eligible for the member tax credit on their contributions in the same way that employees are eligible. However, because self-employed people do not have an employer, they will not be eligible for an employer contribution. The change suggested by the submission would result in an actual tax reduction for the self-employed rather than the incentives going into their retirement savings. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Offset of the employer tax credit Submission (Matter raised by officials) The rules in the bill for offsetting the amount of employer tax credit should be amended to ensure that the amount of employer tax credit is applied against employer contributions in the first instance. 3 To be eligible for the first home subsidy, self-employed people will need to contribute around 4% of their income for at least three years. 74 In addition, it is possible to simplify the rules for creating a debt when an employer tax credit that has been offset against employer contributions is subsequently on-paid to a complying superannuation fund, owing to the fact that Inland Revenue has been notified by the Government Actuary of short-paid compulsory employer contributions. In this situation, a debt would be created for the amount of the amount paid to the complying superannuation fund provider and this debt should be collected as if it were unpaid PAYE. Comment The bill currently provides that the employer tax credit will be used in the following order: • to offset the amount of any compulsory employer contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme or paid to a provider to meet any unpaid compulsory employer contributions to a complying superannuation of which the Government Actuary has notified Inland Revenue; • to offset any amount that is payable to the Commissioner by the employer under the Revenue Acts for the PAYE period to which the employer tax credit relates (which would include any voluntary employer contributions); • to pay other amounts payable by the employer under the Revenue Acts; and • if any amount is still to be used it will be refunded. In most situations the employer tax credit will be fully offset as part of the application of the first two rules. Given that, the employer tax credit is payable in respect of both compulsory and voluntary employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund, officials consider that in the first instance, the credit should be offset against all employer contributions. The effect of this change is that voluntary contributions would move from the second rule to the first rule. This would ensure that employer tax credits are offset against employer contributions so that the value of the credit is paid to the employee’s scheme if the employer does not pay such contributions. In addition, we think it is possible to simplify the proposed process around creating a debt to the employer when employer tax credits arising from employer contributions to a complying superannuation fund have been offset against compulsory employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme or other PAYE amounts are subsequently on- paid to the complying superannuation fund provider. These employer tax credits are paid to the provider when Inland Revenue is notified by the Government Actuary of a shortfall in payment of compulsory employer contributions. At present, the bill requires the amount of the tax credit to be reversed in the tax type it was offset against, which adds complexity in having to track the revenue type the credit was offset against. The process can be simplified so that the employer is treated as short- paying an amount and that amount can be treated as PAYE for collection purposes. 75 We recommend that the change apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Calculation of the amount of the employer tax credit Submissions (Matter raised by officials) The amount of the employer tax credit for a PAYE period should be the lesser of the actual contributions made during that period or the amount calculated on the basis of the number of days in the PAYE period. For a PAYE period with 31 days, the amount calculated would be $88.57. At present, this amount is calculated on the basis of $20 a week for the number of weeks for which an employer contribution is made. Comment The bill currently provides that the amount of the employer tax credit for a PAYE period is equal to the lesser of: • the employer contribution for an employee in that period; and • $20 a week for the number of weeks (including part weeks) in the PAYE period for which an employer contribution was made. This is the correct calculation in relation to the tax credit. However, because of the information Inland Revenue will receive as part of the EMS process, it will not be able to calculate the amount of the tax credit for each employee if it is necessary to refund the employer contributions because an employee opts out. This is because Inland Revenue will receive information, at the employee level, on the amount of employee contribution and employer contribution for the month. (This amount is not reduced by the amount of the tax credit.) The amount of the employer tax credit will be an aggregate amount for all employees which will be off-set against the amount payable. This process reflects the limitation of the EMS in terms of the amount of data that can be incorporated into the form and reducing compliance costs for employers. This process, however, creates difficulties in determining the amount of employer contribution that should be refunded if the employee opts out. This is because the amount to be refunded to the employer is the actual amount of the employer contributions for that employee, reduced by the amount of the employer tax credit claimed in respect of that employee. Inland Revenue will not hold this data at the employee level. To avoid the need to request additional information from the employer as to the amount of the employer tax credit claimed in respect of an employee that has opted out, officials consider that the employer tax credit for a PAYE period should be the lesser of: 76 • the actual employer contributions made during the period; and • the amount calculated on the basis of the number of days in the PAYE period. (For a PAYE period of 31 days the amount calculated would be $88.57.) This approach does not require an employer contribution to be made every week to claim the credit in respect of a particular week in that PAYE period. The maximum amount per employee can be claimed if the actual contributions made exceed the amount calculated based on the number of days in the PAYE period, despite contribution not being made in respect of each week in the PAYE period. While this approach increases the benefit of the employer tax credit for some employers, it allows Inland Revenue to calculate the amount of any refund of employer contributions without the need to seek additional information. Furthermore, it would allow Inland Revenue to accurately calculate the tax credit in other situations, such as when there is a shortfall, and avoid the need for Inland Revenue to contact employers. It is a trade-off between increased entitlement (a fiscal cost) and a reduction of compliance costs. Employers will benefit from this approach in any PAYE period in which the period for which employer contributions are made is less than the full period and the actual contributions exceed this nominal amount. This will occur when an employer starts or ceases to make contributions because an employee starts or ceases employment, or takes a contribution holiday or starts contributions again. This approach reduces compliance costs for employers and allows an automated system to be developed to calculate and refund employer contributions when an employee opts out. This will reduce the cash flow consequences of having to wait for such refunds if additional information has to be supplied. The amendments should apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of KiwiSaver to non-resident employers that have no fixed establishment in New Zealand Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 6 of the KiwiSaver Act, as it applies to employers, should be extended to cover non-resident employers that do not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand if they elect to be an employer for KiwiSaver purposes. In addition, “employer”, for the purposes of the employer tax credit, should be limited to employers that are subject to KiwiSaver. 77 Comment Section 6 of the KiwiSaver Act sets out the rules to whom the KiwiSaver Act applies. “Employers” are: • those employers that are New Zealand-resident within the meaning of the Income Tax Act; or • those employers that carry out a business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand. This definition includes all employers based in New Zealand except non-resident employers who do not carry on a business from a fixed establishment in New Zealand – for example, a non-resident company that operates a warehouse in New Zealand for the storage of goods. The policy intent was that KiwiSaver should apply to all non-resident employers that employ resident employees if PAYE is deducted in respect of those employees. Officials consider that this policy intent has not been achieved with the current wording of the legislation as it excludes a small group of non-resident employers. We consider that non-resident employers with no fixed establishment in New Zealand should be included within the scope of KiwiSaver if they so elect, by either deducting KiwiSaver contributions from an employee’s salary or wages and/or making employer contributions. As such employers will be entitled to the employer tax credit in respect of employer contributions, it is recommended that an employer, for the purposes of the employer tax credit, be linked to the definition of employer for KiwiSaver purposes. The amendments should apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reference in proposed section KJ 5 to period should be to PAYE period Submission (95 – New Zealand Law Society) Reference in proposed section KJ 5 to “period” should be amended to refer to “PAYE period”. 78 Comment Proposed section KJ 5 addresses several situations where the tax credit has been used and subsequently an unpaid amount or shortfall is identified. References in those clauses to “period” are presumably intended to refer to “PAYE period”, as the tax credits arise in each PAYE period. The type of period should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Private domestic workers Submission (Matter raised by officials) Private domestic workers should have the option of electing to make compulsory employer contributions. If they choose to do so, they should also receive the employer tax credit. Comment Under the PAYE rules, the employer of a private domestic worker (defined term) is not required to deduct PAYE. Instead, private domestic workers are required to deduct their own PAYE. If they contribute to KiwiSaver from their “salary or wages”, the question arises as to whether they should be required to make compulsory employer contributions and receive the employer tax credit. As private domestic workers will be required to fund both the employee and employer contribution, officials recommend that compulsory employer contributions be at the election of the worker. If they make employer contributions, they will receive the employer tax credit. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 79 GENERAL TAX CREDIT ISSUES Issue: Inflation indexation of employer/member tax credits Submission (26 – Hospitality Association, 30 – NZ Public Service Association, 66 – Business New Zealand, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 76 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The government should provide for inflation adjustments to employer and member tax credits for contributions. Comment It is acknowledged that the value of the tax credits will reduce in real terms over time. However, indexation would add significantly to the fiscal costs of KiwiSaver and add to the complexity and administration of the scheme as values would change by very small amounts each year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Pro-rating across investment products Submissions (23 – ISI, 24 – AMP, 45 – Chapman Tripp, 47 – ING, 54 – ASB, 91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The provider must credit each instalment of the fee subsidy and member credit on a pro rata basis across the investment products of the KiwiSaver scheme to which the member has subscribed or been allocated. It is not clear whether the means the contribution splits elected by the member or whether it must be based on the current investment account balances. Many provider systems are set up to pro rata base on the member’s current contribution instructions. It should be clarified that the reference to pro rata basis across investment products means the current investment allocation splits that the member has elected or the investment allocation to which the member has been allocated. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association, ING, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It should be clarified that member tax credits and fee subsidies should be applied pro rata on a prescribed basis. The preference is for the member’s contribution split instructions. (Chapman Tripp) 80 The credit should be split according to the contribution strategy selected by the member, not the current balance across all funds. This is much easier administratively as the methodology is already provided for in the registry systems. (ASB) Comment Officials agree that clarity is needed in relation to the rules dealing with the allocation of the member tax credit and fee subsidy. It should be clarified that reference to pro rata basis across investment products means the current investment allocation instructions the member has elected or the investment allocation to which the member has been allocated (if a default scheme). Officials consider that the rules dealing with the pro-rating of the kick-start contribution of $1,000 and the compulsory employer contributions should be pro- rated on the same basis to ensure consistency. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and sections 226(2), proposed section 101G(1) and clause 20(4) of the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 also be amended on the same basis. Issue: Generosity of the tax credits over tax cuts Submission (84 – NZ Chambers of Commerce) A smaller subsidy (tax credit) and some personal tax cuts are preferred so that people have more choice as to how much they put into KiwiSaver and how much they spend otherwise. The Budget 2007 changes have shifted the balance too far towards “future” as opposed to “current” spending. Comment New Zealand’s saving rate has been on the decline for a number of years. The proposed tax credits aim to incentivise a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those of their pre-retirement. On recent evidence, personal tax cuts are more likely to be spent than saved. At this time, that would generate further domestic demand and place further pressure on inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 81 INVALID ENROLMENTS Submissions (24 – AMP, 23 – ISI, 47 – ING, 87 – ASFONZ) The treatment of invalid enrolments should be expressly prescribed in the KiwiSaver Act as not all invalid enrolments will necessarily be void. (AMP) There is merit in the legislation prescribing that a person is deemed to have validly prescribed for membership of the relevant scheme for the period until his or her membership is terminated as the result of ineligibility. (AMP, ISI, ING) There needs to be prescription in the legislation regarding treatment of a member’s membership when the invalid enrolment is due to the member not meeting the eligibility criteria where at a future date the member meets the criteria, such as when a person becomes a permanent resident. (AMP) Refunds should be based on current investment values; otherwise other members of the scheme may be unjustly enriched as a consequence. The securities have been issued in good faith and any gain or loss should be borne by the person who held the securities regardless of their ineligibility under the KiwiSaver Act. Contributions should be refunded at current market value. (AMP, ISI, ING) Inland Revenue should manage the refund process. The refund of any contributions received by the provider should be refunded to Inland Revenue, who will then refund the balance to the original payer of the contribution after claiming the Crown contributions. (AMP, ISI, ING) A new provision should be inserted that allows a withdrawal benefit to be paid in respect of invalid enrolments, to be refunded via the Commissioner, notwithstanding the KiwiSaver rules or provisions of the relevant trust deed. (ASFONZ) Comment Invalid KiwiSaver enrolments can occur in a range of circumstances. For example, someone who is not entitled to join KiwiSaver, maybe because she does not meet residence requirements, might “opt in” or, alternatively, someone might be automatically enroled, but the enrolment is invalid, maybe because he is under 18 or over the New Zealand superannuation qualification age. While it is expected that cases of invalid enrolment will be occasional, officials agree that certainty is needed as to how contributions and accumulations from invalid enrolments are to be treated and that this should be expressly provided in the KiwiSaver legislation. Prescribing how those invalid enrolments should be treated will enable consistency across providers and between the various types of invalid enrolment. Officials also agree with submissions that the legislation should be amended to enable providers to treat enrolments that have been identified as invalid as if they were valid in as far as the administration of the fund is concerned. 82 Officials recommend adopting the following set of rules, which would accommodate all invalid enrolments and, for certainty’s sake, should apply irrespective of the reason for the invalid enrolment occurring. These rules reflect the concerns raised in submissions. The recommended rules are as follows: • At the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, enrolments can be subsequently validated when employees subsequently meet the criteria – for example, if they subsequently meet the residence requirements in the KiwiSaver Act or the requirements relating to automatic enrolment. • Refunds can occur when a person’s membership cannot be validated as he or she does not meet the requisite criteria. • The legislation should be amended to ensure the opt-out mechanism can apply to those who are not eligible to be members. This would ensure that those automatically enroled and identified as ineligible to join can use the normal KiwiSaver opt-out process to cease being a member. The Commissioner’s discretion to accept late opt-out notices will also apply. When an invalid enrolment cannot be validated and a member cannot opt out, a refund process needs to apply. Inland Revenue will manage the refund process to individuals, employers and other third parties. • When a refund is to occur, providers will be required to refund the value of the investment to Inland Revenue, along with details of contributions received and any amount diverted under the mortgage diversion facility. This means that any gains or losses between the investment values and contributions paid out will be borne by the Crown. • Inland Revenue will make refunds to individuals on the basis of contributions received (paid to providers) with interest – not on investment values. Regarding employer contributions, individual circumstances are likely to vary. Some employer contributions may represent income the employee would otherwise have received, while some will constitute an additional cost that the employer is not legally required to bear. (As the employee is not entitled to be a KiwiSaver member, the employer is not legally required to make contributions.) Inland Revenue will refund employer contributions to the employer so that the employer and employee can resolve the matter. • A Permanent Legislative Authority will be established to allow Inland Revenue to make a refund, including interest to a KiwiSaver member if the contributions and interest payable on those contributions is more than the value of the investment returned to Inland Revenue by the provider in respect of that member. Interest should be payable on amounts refunded, set at the current rate payable under KiwiSaver Act for money in holding account. The rate is subject to change but currently set at 6.66%. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and that the rules outlined above apply. 83 HOME OWNERSHIP FEATURES OF KIWISAVER Issue: Housing deposit subsidy and house prices Submission (84 – NZ Chambers of Commerce) The KiwiSaver housing deposit subsidy is likely to increase house prices (that is, benefit the seller) rather than benefit first-time home buyers. Comment The impact of the first-home deposit subsidy on the housing market is unlikely to be significant. First, the subsidy offers limited assistance (up to $5,000 per borrower) and is confined to people who meet specific criteria. Second, the subsidy will not become available in practice until July 2010. This is because members have to show that they have been contributing regularly around 4% of their income for at least three years. If someone joined KiwiSaver at its inception (July 2007) they will be able to apply from July 2010 and will be eligible for the $3,000 subsidy (since the subsidy is based on the number of years a member has been saving and it is capped at $5,000). Third, there are strict eligibility criteria applying to the first-home deposit subsidy. To be eligible a borrower must: • be a first-home buyer (in general terms, not have previously owned a home); • be a member of KiwiSaver, a scheme that is exempt from KiwiSaver automatic enrolment rules, or a complying superannuation fund; • live in the home they buy for at least six months following the purchase; • have gross (before tax) household income of less than $100,000 per year (for one or two borrowers), or less than $140,000 per year (for three or more borrowers); and • be purchasing a lower-quartile priced home. (The income and house price caps are subject to review in 2009.) Overall, these eligibility requirements ensure that the subsidy is targeted in such a way that house prices are unlikely to increase as a result. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 84 Issue: Regulations relating to mortgage diversion Submissions (23 – ISI, 47 – ING, 84 – New Zealand Chambers of Commerce) The amount that can be diverted to a mortgage is “half of the person’s contribution rate for their KiwiSaver scheme.” A provider does not know the member’s salary or wages and does not know the member’s contribution rate. It is assumed that the contribution compliance (of salary and contribution rate) is completed by the central administrator. This clause should be reworded to be half of the amount received by a provider as an employee contribution via Inland Revenue. (ISI, ING) The mortgage diversion is supported. (New Zealand Chambers of Commerce) Comment Officials agree that, for administrative simplicity, the amount that can be diverted under mortgage diversion should be expressed as no more than half the member contribution amount received by a provider. This would include both member contributions (including contributions deducted from salary or wages) paid via Inland Revenue and member contributions received directly from the member. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: First-home deposit – withdrawing employer contributions Submission (45 – Chapman Tripp) Clause 8(8) in schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act should be deleted as it creates an unnecessary complication for KiwiSaver scheme administration. Clause 8(8) in schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act introduces the concept that a participation agreement may provide that monies contributed by the employer and held by the scheme could be withheld on a withdrawal for a first home. In a fully vested compulsory environment, the employer contribution is more akin to a member contribution than a true employer subsidy. This makes it unfair at a member level to allow the employer to withhold the employer contribution. Further, it will also unduly complicate the administration of the scheme. Comment It would be possible to limit this to additional voluntary contributions made by the employer over the compulsory rate, although this is still likely to cause some administrative difficulty. 85 This provision is permissive. It allows employers to add conditions to their contribution as they choose to, thus increasing the scope for flexibility within KiwiSaver. Subject to the terms of the participation, an employer may impose conditions on voluntary contributions made to the scheme. The agreement documenting these conditions would have to be agreed to by both the trustees of the scheme and the employer. If such a provision was to add increased complexity to the administration of the scheme, the trustees of the scheme may refuse to offer such a facility. Recommendation That the submission be partially accepted, and clause 8(8) be clarified to provide that only voluntary contributions may be withheld in such a manner. Issue: Level of first-home buyer subsidy Submission (78 – Council of Trade Unions, 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The $5,000 matching for first-home buyers is too low and instead a 2:1 subsidy should be offered by the government (up to $10,000). Comment Increasing the first-home subsidy of 2:1 (up to $10,000) would have a significant fiscal cost and is not necessary to support first-home buyers entering the housing market. Eligibility for the first-home subsidy is restricted to household income (before tax) of less than $100,000 per year (for one or two people), and to the purchase of a lower- quartile priced home. The current KiwiSaver savings scheme would enable a couple earning a combined income of $60,000 to have a deposit of $30,400 after five years (consisting of $20,400 of KiwiSaver savings and a deposit subsidy of $10,000). A deposit of $30,400 would provide a 10% deposit on a $300,000 house, which is the maximum lower-quartile house price for most of New Zealand (excluding Auckland City, North Shore City and Queenstown Lakes). Other government policies such as the Welcome Home Loan and Shared Equity Scheme (a pilot in development) provide further assistance to first-home buyers. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 86 Issue: Second-chance buyers Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to clause 8 of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to include within the eligibility for the first home ownership withdrawal second- chance buyers that have a determination from Housing New Zealand that they are in the same financial situation as first home buyers. Comment The government agreed in June 2006 that eligibility for the KiwiSaver first home deposit subsidy and the first home ownership withdrawal should be broadened to include previous home owners who are in the same financial situation as first home buyers in terms of income and assets. Such second-chance home buyers will apply to Housing New Zealand for a determination on whether they are in the same financial situation as a first home buyer. Clause 8 of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act concerns withdrawals for the purpose of the purchase of a first home, and describes the circumstances in which a withdrawal may be made. In particular, the clause notes that the member must not have held an interest in land. Accordingly, officials recommend that an amendment be made so that second-chance buyers who have a determination from Housing New Zealand that they are in the same financial situation as a first home buyer are not excluded from the first home ownership withdrawal. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Mortgage diversion – extending to complying superannuation funds Submission (Matter raised by officials) The KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 should be amended to ensure that they extend to complying superannuation funds. Comment The KiwiSaver Amendment Regulations 2007 (which amended the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006) concern the administration of the annual fee subsidy and the mortgage diversion facility. As the regulations needed to be enacted to ensure that providers, banks and members had detailed information about the fee subsidy and mortgage diversion facility when KiwiSaver started, on 1 July 2007, the regulations applied only to KiwiSaver schemes. 87 As the bill extends the application of the mortgage diversion to complying superannuation funds, officials recommend that an amendment be made to the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 to ensure that they extend to complying superannuation funds in respect of the mortgage diversion. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Principal place of residence Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 229 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that the mortgage diversion will apply for the remainder of the term of the loan after the diversion is made available, but only in relation to a mortgage over the person’s principal residence. Comment The KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that mortgage diversion is available only in relation to a mortgage over a person’s principal residence, providing the example of the family home. However, section 229(2)(e) states that the mortgage diversion may apply for the remainder of the term of the mortgage after the diversion is made available. As this subsection does not specify that the mortgage diversion can apply only in relation to a mortgage over the person’s principal residence, the policy intention behind the mortgage diversion facility has the potential to be undermined. For example, if someone decides to rent out what was their principal residence and purchases another property, under the current wording in section 229(2)(e) the mortgage diversion may be applicable for the remainder of the term of the mortgage over the rental property, even though it is no longer the principal place of residence of the purchaser. Officials accordingly recommend that an amendment be made to section 229 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 so that the mortgage diversion will apply for the remainder of the term of the loan after the diversion is made available, but only in relation to a mortgage over the person’s principal residence. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 88 SUPERANNUATION REGULATION FRAMEWORK Issue: Unitisation Submissions (4 – Gareth Morgan, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association) The practice of unitisation and unit pricing should be prohibited in KiwiSaver, as this practice prevents savers being able to see what they own. This barrier to information also facilitates mis-pricing errors, which are often in favour the scheme provider. (Gareth Morgan, Council of Trade Unions) The inference that there are concerns with unit pricing does not stand scrutiny. This issue has been the subject of reviews conducted by both the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Securities Commission in New Zealand. Both reviews found no evidence of unit pricing concerns. (Investment Savings and Insurances Association) Comment Unitisation also allows for the possibility of investors with a relatively minor input to have the same advantages of investors with a relatively greater input of investment money such as minimised risk through a diversified investment portfolio, the benefit of expert investment management giving greater sophistication to investment strategies and minimisation of administration costs. In the KiwiSaver environment, the benefits of pooling are likely to be especially significant. People able to contribute smaller amounts to their retirement savings are likely to have increased access to a variety of securities through the pooling process. This is especially appropriate as a long-term savings strategy. Unitisation of KiwiSaver schemes allows providers an efficient and cost-effective means of accomplishing this. Unitisation is an industry standard, and thus there is a wide variety of choices for prospective investors. Prospective investors can make these choices by considering the regularly published unit prices, allowing consumers to compare and contrast the performance of schemes and calculate their own balances if they have already invested. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a problem of mis-pricing in New Zealand. Reviews undertaken in both Australia and New Zealand have supported these views. Recommendation That submissions 4 and 78 be declined and submission 23 be noted. 89 Issue: Disclosed but unquantified expenses Submissions (4 – Gareth Morgan, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association) Providers should be prohibited from being able to charge unquantified expenses to scheme members, as this will enable members to know all the costs that are being charged upfront. Expenses should be covered within their declared fees. (Gareth Morgan, Council of Trade Unions) All KiwiSaver funds are governed by strict regulations that place considerable onus on the trustees to manage the funds in the best interests of the investors. The fees charged by all KiwiSaver fees are reviewed by the Government Actuary on registration to ensure that all charges are fully disclosed and not unreasonable. The Securities Act and regulations coupled with the KiwiSaver process require full disclosure of all charges and fees. The suggestion that the industry will apply hidden fees suggests that the Government Actuary Approval process, the Securities Act and the Securities Commission will all be ineffective in their purpose and conduct of responsibilities. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association) Comment The KiwiSaver Act ensures that all fees charged are not to be unreasonable. Where such a fee is brought to the attention of the Government Actuary, he may direct the trustee to remove that fee or de-register the scheme if he believes it to be appropriate. Any person may bring such fees to the attention of the Government Actuary. As such, all fees will be subject to scrutiny by the regulator and subject to the protections in the KiwiSaver Act. Some fees can be charged directly to the fund and these are likely to be subject to a guideline issued by the Government Actuary. This draft guideline is currently with providers for comment and will be peer reviewed shortly by a panel of experts. The release of this draft guideline has given some further clarification of unreasonable fees. Recommendation That submissions 4 and 78 be declined and submission 23 be noted. 90 Issue: Reserves Submissions (4 – Gareth Morgan, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 23 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association) Reserving should be completely prohibited because the creation of reserves puts the ownership of funds into question. Specifically, the practice of reserving for tax changes, expense changes and smoothing of returns should be prohibited to ensure that savers are not separated from their funds. (Gareth Morgan, Council of Trade Unions) Reserving in the manner suggested does not occur. Reserve accounts occur within employer-sponsored superannuation funds within very specific circumstances involving unvested employer contributions. Further, as the portfolio investment entities (PIE) taxation regime will fully allocate fund earnings to scheme members, the reserving for other purposes would be inconsistent. (Investment, Savings and Insurance Association) Comment The practice of reserving for tax changes, expense changes and smoothing of returns will not occur in the KiwiSaver environment and it is inconsistent with the PIE taxation rules. However, it is important to ensure that employer reserve accounts can still be operated to ensure that employers may continue to apply vesting scales to their voluntary contributions. In many existing employer superannuation schemes, employer contributions only vest in the employee after a specified period of time. This practice allows employers to use their superannuation arrangements as a means of encouraging retention of staff. In our view, it is desirable for employers to be able to use superannuation arrangements to encourage staff retention. In the KiwiSaver environment, the use of vesting scales is permitted for any voluntary employer contribution. As such, the KiwiSaver Act does not prohibit the creation of reserve accounts to hold unvested employer contributions. The funds held in these accounts are generally distributed equitably on a regular basis. It should also be noted that all compulsory employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes will have to vest immediately. Recommendation That submissions 4 and 78 be declined and submission 23 be noted. 91 Issue: Discretionary trusts Submissions (4 – Gareth Morgan, 78 – Council of Trade Unions) Remove the practice of having trusts operate as an intermediary between the saver and the investment of the fund. This approach compromises a member’s sovereignty over his or her own savings. The problem is further exacerbated as fund managers will continue to use this trust structure to circumvent any legislative restrictions to further its own commercial benefit. The preferred approach is to have a bare trust approach, where the beneficiary is sovereign. This approach would need a regulatory overlay to ensure that the KiwiSaver rules are adhered to. Comment All KiwiSaver schemes are required to be established as trusts for the principal purpose of providing retirement benefits. As a consequence, the appointed trustees have a direct fiduciary obligation to members that cannot be avoided. Nonetheless, trustees may outsource the investment and administration management functions to third parties who may not automatically owe a fiduciary duty to members of the scheme. Should these administration or investment management firms engage in unfair or fraudulent conduct, it is likely that the member will have a claim against the trustee for the consequent breach of its fiduciary obligation to the member in failing to appropriately monitor these firms. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Principles-based regulation Submissions (4 – Gareth Morgan, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The regulatory regime for KiwiSaver should operate within a principles-based framework, rather than within the rules-based framework. In a principles-based framework, the principle would take precedence over the rules. A principle of fairness should be enshrined in the legislation. This would be implemented by requiring KiwiSaver providers to make a statutory declaration on an annual basis that they have not done anything to enhance their commercial position at the expense of the customer. If they do not make such a declaration, the provider would automatically be liable. This would ensure that trustees and directors of providers take their obligations to members far more seriously. 92 Comment This issue is outside the scope of this bill. It should be noted that the Ministry of Economic Development is currently undertaking a Review of Financial Products and Providers that will be examining the regulatory framework for Superannuation, KiwiSaver and other Collective Investment Schemes more generally. It is more appropriate for the regulatory framework for KiwiSaver to be examined in that environment. It should also be noted that the existing regulatory environment for KiwiSaver operates in a framework that blends both principles-based regulations with rules- based regulation. Notable examples include the application of principles-based fiduciary obligations by trustees to act in the best interests of members and rules- based requirements for trustees to diversify their investments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of superannuation scheme Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “superannuation scheme” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to remove the explicit reference to “a KiwiSaver scheme”. Comment An amendment was made to the definition of “superannuation scheme” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 to include a KiwiSaver scheme that is registered under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. However, the amendment was not needed as a KiwiSaver scheme is already covered by the definition of a superannuation scheme in subsection (a)(i), being a trust established by its trust deed mainly for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to beneficiaries who are natural persons or paying benefits to superannuation funds. Subsection (a)(ib) is therefore redundant, and officials recommend that this subsection be repealed. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 93 DEFAULT SELECTION PROCESS Submission (28 – ANZ National Bank) The existing KiwiSaver legislation should be amended so that contributions from people joining KiwiSaver default to a balanced fund to maximise the returns for members who are otherwise inert towards managing their investment options. It is believed that a balanced fund generates a better return than a conservative fund over the longer term. This has been supported by a review of their existing superannuation arrangements. Comment This issue is outside the scope of this bill, as the selection of default KiwiSaver providers and the provision of a default investment profile is a power that has been conferred on the Ministers of Finance and Commerce. As such, the KiwiSaver Act does not specify any specific investment portfolio that a member should be automatically enroled into. This ensures that, should a need to amend the default portfolio arise, such amendments may be made efficiently without the need for legislative intervention. It is also useful to note that in selecting a default investment profile for the default providers, it was necessary to cater to the most conservative risk appetites of employees that may be automatically enroled into KiwiSaver. The purpose of the selection was to ensure that the contributions made by members were protected. While a higher risk portfolio may have yielded better returns in the long run, such an investment may not have been appropriate for members reaching retirement. It should also be noted that members are able to switch between various product profiles should they believe that the conservative product is not appropriate for them. The government will review the appointment of default providers regularly and will be undertaking a comprehensive evaluation of KiwiSaver in the coming years. These reviews may identify a need to re-examine the default investment portfolio as a result of the changing demographics of employees that are being automatically enroled. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 Issue: Default enrolment Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Employees who are automatically enroled into KiwiSaver but have not elected to contract with a scheme provider will be put into their employer’s chosen scheme, if one exists. This may not always be in the employee’s best interest. Section 48 of the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to allow a member to opt to invest into one of the default Inland Revenue schemes. Comment Employees who begin new employment and are automatically enroled into KiwiSaver are able to choose their own KiwiSaver scheme. If they do not choose their own scheme, they will be allocated to their employer’s preferred scheme if the employer has one. (Employers are able to choose a KiwiSaver scheme for their employees provided that the scheme meets certain criteria.) However, this does not displace the employee choice, as section 45 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 specifies that employees always retain the right to select their own provider at any time. Accordingly, no amendment is needed to section 48 of the KiwiSaver Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section 50(1) Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 50(1), as proposed, only applies when an automatic enrolment or opt-in notice is received from the employer to the Commissioner. Clarification needs to be provided as to whether this applies when the Commissioner receives notices directly from the scheme provider or the intermediary. Comment Section 50 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 deals with the provisional allocation of employees to a default KiwiSaver scheme who are subject to automatic enrolment or opt-in via their employer. The submission raises two issues: • whether this section should apply to enrolments via a scheme provider; and • whether this section should apply to opt-in via a PAYE intermediary. 95 In relation to the first, a person is able to join a KiwiSaver scheme by contracting directly with the provider. As such, section 50 does not need to apply as the person becomes a member on joining. In relation to the second, officials accept that the legislation should be clarified that for the purposes of section 23 and the opt-in rules, a PAYE intermediary can be treated as an employer. Clause 204 of the bill allows a PAYE intermediary to be treated as employer for the purposes of the opt-out rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part in relation to a PAYE intermediary. 96 DISCLOSURE BY SCHEMES Submissions (30 – Public Service Association, 78 – Council of Trade Unions, 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The requirement for KiwiSaver providers to disclose their approach to responsible investment from 1 April 2008 is supported. This should include considerations about labour standards, in addition to consideration for tobacco, armaments or environmentally damaging companies. (Public Service Association) If not, the Committee should require that funds disclose whether they have a responsible investment policy and if so, describe it. (Council of Trade Unions) The need for ethical investment rules is supported. It is recognised that any investment fund will always seek maximum returns, subject to the design of the fund. However, as the government is providing a significant level of funding, it is appropriate for the government to set certain standards of ethical investment. (Council of Trade Unions and New Zealand Nurses Organisation) Comment Supplementary Order Paper No 139 establishes a disclosure regime for responsible investment. The Responsible Investment disclosure requirements will be established within the KiwiSaver Act, which will prescribe information that is to be included in KiwiSaver scheme and complying superannuation fund investment statements. This will require KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds to disclose and describe the extent to which responsible investment, including environmental, social and governance considerations, is taken into account in the investment policies and procedures of the scheme. The proposed provisions will leverage off the existing legal framework for disclosure set out in the Securities Regulations 1983. Officials consider that it is not appropriate for the government to specify which investments are ethical or not. The approach adopted provides information to the investor so that he or she can make an informed decision. The provisions give a scheme provider the flexibility to adopt or not to adopt a responsible investment policy. This will ensure that the providers are able to respond to the demands in the market as required. Regulatory standards will circumscribe providers’ ability to respond to those changing demands as time progresses. Such flexibility is seen to be especially crucial in the area of responsible investment, as concepts of responsible investment are likely to change over time. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 97 Issue: Member statements Submission (Matter raised by officials) All KiwiSaver and complying superannuation scheme providers should be required to supply members with a personalised statement of their investment holding, on at least an annual basis. At a minimum, all member statements should provide information on: • the level of contributions made by the member, employer and Crown in the period since the last member statement; and • the total value of the member’s interest in the scheme. Comment The current legislation requires KiwiSaver providers to publish annual reports on fund performance and asset values at an aggregate level. At present, there is no requirement for providers to supply members with individualised statements in respect of the value of their own investments, notwithstanding that the provision of personalised member statements is a widespread practice across the retirement savings industry. Given the new incentives and the expected increase in both the level and duration of financial contributions, it is recommended that all KiwiSaver and complying superannuation scheme providers be required to supply members with a personalised statement of their investment holding, on at least an annual basis. The information may be sent to members electronically if members agree to receive it electronically. On request from the member, or if there is no agreement with the member, the scheme must provide any member with a hard copy of the relevant member statement. The member statement may be sent, at the provider’s choice, either on the anniversary of the member’s subscription or at the scheme balance date. The primary objective of this requirement is to mandate regular personalised disclosure of the value of an individual’s holding. We recommend that at a minimum all member statements provide information on: • the level of contributions made by the member, employer and Crown in the period since the last member statement; and • the total value of the member’s interest in the scheme. Given current industry practice and the option to use electronic communication, this is anticipated to be a relatively low-cost intervention that will enable members to make informed decisions about the performance of their provider, and whether to switch providers or to cease or reduce contributions. 98 In so doing it reinforces a competitive marketplace for retirement savings, underpins personal responsibility and facilitates choice. It also has the benefit of aligning with the government’s wider goal to promote financial literacy. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 99 EMPLOYERS NOT INVESTMENT BROKERS Submissions (24 – AMP, 87 – Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand) The legislation should clarify that employers are not investment brokers for the purposes of the Investment Advisers (Disclosure) Act 1996 or the Securities Markets Act 1988 simply by complying with the requirements in the KiwiSaver Act. Comment Officials recommend adding the terms “Investment broker” and “Broker” to the relevant provision (section 206 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006). Although section 206 does give an exemption from the Investment Advisors (Disclosure) Act 1996, where the definition of Broker is found, the section does not go further to specify that an “Investment broker” and “Broker” are exempt. The rationale for adding these terms is that those reading the KiwiSaver Act 2006 do not need to go further than section 206 and are not confused by the exception of the terms “Investment broker” and “Broker”. This is particularly relevant where the Crown or persons operating under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 may function as a broker in one or more transactions. It should also be noted that the Investment Advisers (Disclosure) Act 1996 requirements on advisers and brokers has been amended and moved to the Securities Markets Act 1988. It is important to ensure that the provisions in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 referring to the Investment Advisers (Disclosure) Act 1996 should be amended to refer to the appropriate provisions in the Securities Markets Act 1988. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 100 IMPACTS ON SMALL BUSINESSES Issue: Costs on small businesses Submissions (84 – New Zealand Chamber of Commerce, 12 – Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) Inc) While the provision of employer tax credits is likely to partially offset the compulsory employer contribution, the provision of such a contribution is likely to increase compliance costs in the process. This is a significant concern. The scheme’s introduction has been rushed and employers have not had enough time to prepare for it. Small businesses in particular will be disadvantaged as they lack the resources to adequately deal with the additional obligations. This is likely to result in adverse consequences for their productivity and efficiency. (New Zealand Chamber of Commerce) The employer contributions aspect of KiwiSaver in this bill should not proceed because the complexities arising from some employees joining while others do not, together with the short implementation timeframe, means it will be an added cost to business. (Employers and Manufacturers Association (Northern) Inc) The benefits to business and the economy of the company tax rate reduction will be partially offset by the compulsory employer contributions to the extent they exceed the offsetting tax credits. (New Zealand Chamber of Commerce) Comment The introduction of KiwiSaver and the 2007 Budget proposals have been accompanied by a significant communications campaign on the implementation aspects of the scheme. There has been particular awareness of the challenges being faced by small and medium-sized enterprises. As such, the communications campaign has focussed on ensuring that such businesses are given sufficient information to implement their new obligations under the proposals. Officials note that it is government policy to seek to minimise the compliance costs arising from the introduction of new government measures as far as possible. When that is not possible, compliance costs can often be offset in other ways. Small employers, those with up to five employees, have recourse to the new subsidy for using payroll agents to take on payroll-related work. There is no reason that payroll work could not cover activities relevant to KiwiSaver. 101 The design of the employer tax credits has focused on minimising employer compliance costs. This is done by building off existing processes, such as employer tax credits being paid through the PAYE system by offsetting the credit against the employer’s contribution and other PAYE liabilities. This not only minimises compliance costs but also reduces any cash flow impacts. The amount of the compulsory employer contribution will be phased in over four years, starting at 1% on 1 April 2008 and reaching 4% of gross salary or wages from 1 April 2011. The employer tax credit was introduced to assist employers with the contributions that they will be required to make to their employees’ KiwiSaver scheme or complying superannuation fund. The tax credit reimburses employers for contributions that they are required to make, up to a maximum of $20 a week for each employee. The following table shows the maximum annual gross salary or wages covered by the tax credit: From Compulsory employer contribution as a percentage of gross salary or wages Annual gross salary or wages completely offset by the value of the employer tax credit 1 April 2008 1% $104,000 1 April 2009 2% $52,000 1 April 2010 3% $34,667 1 April 2011 4% $26,000 Accordingly, the employer tax credit will cover the cost to employers for the majority of their employees in the first year, while allowing employers time to plan, and allow for compulsory employer contributions to be taken into account in wage bargaining. The employer tax credit will apply only in respect of contributions made to employees that are 18 years of age and over and under the age of eligibility to withdraw their funds. Employers do not have to pay income tax in order to receive the tax credit. Accordingly, charities and other tax-exempt organisations that make employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes will be eligible for the employer tax credit. Improving savings habits will offer many benefits to New Zealanders through a stronger economy resulting from reduced pressure on inflation and the current account deficit and further boosting financial market development. On the other hand, the company tax rate reduction has been aimed at improving the international competitiveness to ensure New Zealand becomes a much more attractive place to invest and do business. The Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT) exemption means that employers can provide a larger benefit to staff through KiwiSaver contributions than through other remuneration, at the same cost to the employer. 102 The KiwiSaver and the Business Tax Review proposals will affect each business differently depending on the particular circumstances of each business (such as its structure and the taxable income and how many staff choose to become KiwiSaver members) and also on its salary negotiations with employees. In some cases the impact on the compulsory employer contributions will offset the impact of the company rate reduction, although this will not always be the case. The employer tax credit will help to reduce some of the impact of the employer compulsory contributions. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 103 KIWISAVER INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES Issue: Definition of “independent” trustee – employer contributors Submission (58A – Trustees Corporations Association) The KiwiSaver Act requires the directors of trustee corporations to be independent from any employer contributor in KiwiSaver. The introduction of compulsory employer contributions would effectively mean that many trustees are likely to be excluded from the definition of independent trustees. Many trustees also hold a number of positions as directors of other organisations. This could effectively result in that trustee ceasing to meet the definition of independence if an employer actively elects to join the scheme that the trustee is an independent trustee for. Accordingly, the definition of independence should be amended to exclude employer contributors from the definition Comment This submission would ensure that when a trustee inadvertently becomes an employer contributor, the independence of that trustee is not compromised. The definition would still encapsulate employers that are intentionally more heavily involved in the provision of the relevant scheme. They are likely to include employers that offer an employer-based KiwiSaver scheme or that enter into a participation agreement with a KiwiSaver provider. In such instances, the employer is likely to be instrumental in designing the offer of the scheme for its employees and is likely to fall under the definition of “promoter” (and, as such, will not meet the definition of “independence”). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Trustee corporations Submission (58A – Trustees Corporations Association) Trustee Corporations are governed by their own Acts of Parliament and subject to specific legislative duties and obligations. It should also be noted that all default KiwiSaver schemes must have at least one trustee that is a trustee corporation. The requirement that all directors of trustee corporations meet the requirements of independence creates a number of difficulties for trustee corporations. This requirement also imposes a more onerous obligation in comparison to the decision that KiwiSaver schemes only need to have one independent trustee at a minimum. 104 The submission recommends that one director of a trustee corporation should be required to meet the independence requirements established in the KiwiSaver Act. Comment This submission would ensure that trustee corporations are not overly burdened with an obligation to ensure the independence of every director of its organisation. It would continue to provide a sufficient level of protection for members as the independent director would provide a check on the decision of the trustee as a whole. An amendment to the definition of “independent trustee” in the KiwiSaver Act is required to give effect to this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Independent trustee – administration managers and investment managers Submission (58A – Trustees Corporations Association) The KiwiSaver Act provides that the independent KiwiSaver trustee must be independent from the administration and investment managers of the scheme. The submission argues that administration and investment management are matters for which a trustee is, by definition, legally responsible. As such, it impracticable to require independence from administration or investment managers. The submission recommends that there should be no prohibition on a trustee corporation performing administration or investment management services. Comment KiwiSaver schemes are offered by trustees to members. For the purposes of the Securities Act, the trustee of a KiwiSaver scheme is the issuer of securities. As such, the trustee bears primary responsibility for all roles related to the offering of a KiwiSaver scheme. The implied requirement for a trustee to be responsible for all aspects of the offering of the scheme is in conflict with the requirement that a trustee be independent of the administration manager or the investment manager. The difficulty, however, arises only if those functions are not outsourced. Accordingly, officials recommend that the definition of “independence” be amended to require independence from the administration or investment manager only where the trustee is not performing the administration or investment management functions itself. 105 This approach would ensure that where trustees are performing either the administration or investment functions themselves, they will not have to establish an artificial separation between the various arms of the organisations undertaking the various functions. Recommendation That officials’ recommendation be accepted. 106 GOOD FAITH EMPLOYERS Issue: Liability for good faith employer and employee KiwiSaver discussions Submissions (12 – Employer & Manufacturers Association (Northern), 66 – Business NZ) Submissions were received for and against extending immunity to employers for good faith discussions that employers hold with employees in relation to KiwiSaver. Employers should be able to discuss with employees the merits of superannuation and other savings options, including KiwiSaver, and section 206 of the KiwiSaver Act, which excludes certain investment from the ambit of the Investment Advisers (Disclosure) Act 1996, should be extended to cover such discussions. (Employers & Manufacturers Association (Northern)) Business New Zealand recommends that section 41 stand. It covers what information is contained in the information pack and requires an employee to seek financial advice from a professional financial adviser rather than an employer. Furthermore, there should be no amendment to include good faith discussions between an employer and employee(s) involving any and all superannuation policies. Comment Under securities legislation, employers do not have any liability if they merely provide general savings or KiwiSaver information. This does not extend to financial advice, including whether or not employees should enter KiwiSaver. Because of the employment relationship, the employer is not an impartial, independent adviser. In particular, a conflict of interest would arise from employers advising employees on a component of their remuneration. This conflict is particularly acute as employers potentially benefit from employees not joining KiwiSaver (and hence employers not being required to provide compulsory employer contributions). Recommendation That submission 12 be declined and submission 66 be noted. 107 Issue: Further information requested by the Committee Submissions on the original KiwiSaver Act also raised the issue of the need for a good faith requirement, as submissions both supporting and opposing the need for a good faith requirement were received. As part of their initial review of the submissions, the Committee requested and received the following advice. The submission requesting the insertion of a good faith requirement was subsequently declined. KiwiSaver: Good Faith Requirement The Committee has asked for a confirmation that employment law requires employers to act in good faith in respect of KiwiSaver. The Committee has also requested that officials refer the Committee to the relevant provisions of the Employment Relations Act 2000 and to indicate whether there are any penalties for a breach of such a requirement. Section 4 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 requires that the parties to an employment relationship deal with each other in good faith. The good faith requirement is not confined to the provisions in the employment contract, it applies to the totality of the employment relationship, including interactions between an employer and an employee in respect of KiwiSaver. Good faith applies to both individual and collective employment relationships, and requires the parties to those relationships to be open and honest in all their dealings and communications with each other. For example, in an individual bargaining context, good faith requires the parties to give genuine consideration to each other’s views. Part 6 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 also provides a number of protections for new employees entering employment, under the umbrella of the good faith obligation. The following protections minimise the potential for an employer to pressure an employee not to join KiwiSaver in the context of wage negotiations. If there is a collective employment agreement covering the work the employee will undertake, the employee is automatically given the terms of the collective agreement for the first 30 days of employment, after which the conditions can only be changed by agreement. The employee must also be given information about being able to join the union (and if they choose to join, they remain covered by the collective agreement). If there is no collective agreement, the employer must: – give the employee a copy of the intended individual employment agreement; – tell the employee that he or she is entitled to seek independent advice and give the employee a reasonable opportunity to seek that advice, and – consider any issues the employee raises. An individual employment agreement must contain the wages or salary, and must not contain anything contrary to law. 108 These provisions help avoid any “take it or leave it” approach to bargaining in relation to wages and the employee’s entitlement to choose to remain in KiwiSaver. The Act provides that a party to an employment relationship who fails to comply with the duty of good faith is liable to a penalty under the Act if the failure was deliberate, serious, and sustained or the failure was intended to undermine an employment relationship. The Act also provides that an employer will be liable for a penalty of up to $10,000 for a breach of this provision. Officials have discussed the matter with officials from the Department of Labour who have confirmed that this interpretation is accurate. 109 AMENDMENTS TO THE HOLIDAYS ACT 2003 Submission (86 – Employers and Manufacturers Association (Central) Incorporated) For the sake of consistency, clause 275 of the bill needs amending to also exclude KiwiSaver contributions from the Holidays Act 2003 definitions of “ordinary weekly pay” and “relevant daily pay”. Comment Clause 275 excludes employer contributions to a superannuation scheme from the definition of “gross earnings” under the Holidays Act 2003. While there is an existing Court decision which produces the same effect in relation to the other definitions, officials agree that in order to provide clarity and consistency and avoid any doubt, employer contributions to a superannuation scheme should also be explicitly excluded from the definition of “relevant daily pay” and “ordinary weekly pay” in the Holidays Act 2003. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 110 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Clarifying that the employer tax credit is treated as contributions received by the Commissioner under section 74 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section KJ 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to clarify that the employer tax credit is treated as contributions received by the Commissioner under section 74 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Comment The bill provides for Inland Revenue to on-pay the value of an employer tax credit (the lesser of $20 per week or the required compulsory employer contribution) to KiwiSaver members if their employer does not make the required compulsory employer contribution. For Inland Revenue to be able to do this the employer tax credit must be deemed a contribution received by the Commissioner. Clause 143 of the bill amends section KJ 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to allow the employer tax credit to be used for the short payment to be treated as a compulsory employer contribution received by the Commissioner for the purposes of calculating the amount of short payment under Part 3, subpart 3 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Officials believe it will be clearer if section KJ 4(3) also states that the employer tax credit is treated as contributions received under section 74 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Compulsory employer contributions are contributions received by the Commissioner under section 74 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, and, as provided by section 74(4), are trust money for the purposes of sections 66 to 68 of the Public Finance Act 1989. As compulsory employer contributions are contributions received by the Commissioner under section 74, similarly, any employer tax credit that is used to pay the short payment of compulsory employer contributions should also be treated as contributions received by the Commissioner under that section. The amendment will make it clear that any employer tax credit that is used to pay the short payment of compulsory contributions is “trust money” received by the Commissioner under section 74 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 111 Issue: Successor funds – provision of investment statements when making a compulsory transfer Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to sections 9BAA and 9BAB of the Superannuation Schemes Act, which deem an offer of subscription to have been made to a new superannuation or KiwiSaver scheme where a transfer is effected under those provisions. Comment Sections 9BAA and 9BAB allow the Government Actuary to consent to a transfer of members from one superannuation or KiwiSaver scheme to another where the terms and conditions of the new scheme are no less favourable than the terms of the current scheme and the transfer is otherwise reasonable. The member does not have to consent to the transfer. The primary objective of these provisions was to overcome the consent issues, so that the wind-up risk could be mitigated. All memberships of superannuation or KiwiSaver schemes are defined as securities under the Securities Act. As such, any offering of membership in a scheme must be made in conjunction with the provision of an investment statement. The securities transaction is subsequently completed once the member has signed the investment statement and made an offer to purchase and the provider has accepted and allocated the security. The requirements of the Securities Act essentially put schemes back in a position where consent from members will be required, as investment statements will need to be provided to members and signed by members. This is tantamount to requiring members to consent to the transfer. Officials recommend that a provision be included in the Superannuation Schemes Act that deems an offer to have been made where an application under section 9BAA has been approved by the Government Actuary. This would validate the transfer of members. Further, it would also retain the obligation on the new provider to send investment statements to all relevant members. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 112 CROWN CONTRIBUTION Issue: Initial contributions in holding account and the Crown contribution Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 75 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that the Commissioner holds contributions for a person in the Inland Revenue holding account only for three months after receiving the first contribution or receiving notice that the person is a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. Comment Under section 75 of the KiwiSaver Act, when a person first becomes a KiwiSaver member the Commissioner must hold all contributions (including the $1,000 kick- start) for that person in the holding account for three months after the first contribution was received. Under section 226 of the KiwiSaver Act, the Crown must pay a contribution to the first KiwiSaver scheme of which a person is a member: • as soon as practicable three months after the Commissioner receives the first contribution for that person (for a person who is required to have deductions of contributions from salary or wages); or • as soon as practicable three months after the Commissioner is given notice that the person is a member of a KiwiSaver scheme for any other case (for example, non-employees such as a self-employed person or a beneficiary who contract directly with a scheme provider). Reading these two sections together means that for KiwiSaver members who have deductions made from their salary or wages, the Crown contribution and any contributions made during the first three months of their membership will be released from the Inland Revenue holding account three months after their first contribution was made. This generally occurs around the time of new employment (automatic enrolment), opting in (via an employer), or forming a contract directly with a provider as an employee, in which case Inland Revenue, on receipt of advice from the provider, notifies the named employers to start making deductions from their employees’ salary or wages. However, a problem arises for those members who do not have deductions made from their salary or wages and have joined KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a provider. If they make their contributions directly to their provider rather than through the Inland Revenue holding account they may have to wait a further three months before the Crown contribution will be released from the holding account as the Crown contribution may be treated as the first contribution received by the Commissioner into the holding account. 113 Officials accordingly recommend that an amendment be made to section 75 that the Commissioner holds contributions for a person in the Inland Revenue holding account only for three months after receiving the first contribution or receiving notice that the person is a member of a KiwiSaver scheme. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Payment of the Crown contribution Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 226(1) of the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to provide flexibility around when the Crown contribution (the $1,000 kick-start contribution) must be paid to employees and members transferring from a complying superannuation fund to a KiwiSaver scheme. Comment Section 226(1) of the KiwiSaver Act specifies that the Crown must pay the Crown contribution ($1,000) as soon as practicable three months after a person becomes a KiwiSaver “member”. That must occur either by the Commissioner receiving contributions for those for whom deductions are made, or receiving notice of “membership” for those who have opted in by contracting directly with a provider. The bill amends section 226(1)(b) to provide flexibility for the payment of the Crown contribution in situations where someone opts in to KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a scheme provider. Flexibility for the payment of the Crown contribution is also needed for those members who have deductions made from their salary or wages or who are transferred from a complying superannuation fund to a KiwiSaver scheme. Officials accordingly recommend that section 226(1) of the KiwiSaver Act be amended so that: • in the case of members who have deductions made from their salary and wages, the Crown must pay the contribution as soon as practicable after three months after the earlier of the Commissioner receiving the first contribution in respect of a member, or the Commissioner being given notice that the person is a member of the KiwiSaver scheme; and • if a person who has been a member of a complying superannuation fund for more than three months transfers to a KiwiSaver scheme (and the person is not already a KiwiSaver member), the Crown must pay the Crown contribution as soon as practicable after the transfer occurs. 114 It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Vesting of the Crown contribution Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 226 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that the Crown contribution is paid only into an account that is fully vested in the member. Comment The Act requires the Crown to pay a contribution of $1,000 to the first KiwiSaver scheme that a member joins. There is, however, no requirement that the account that the contribution is paid into be fully vested in the member. This may result in a member losing the contribution or part of it if he or she leaves that scheme and the contribution is credited to the employer account. Officials recommend that an amendment be made so that the Crown contribution is paid only into an account that is fully vested in the member. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disclosure of fee subsidy and Crown contribution in annual reports Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 123(5) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that all Crown contributions are disclosed in the annual reports. Comment The Act is silent on the need to disclose the amount of Crown contributions that are made to member accounts. This may result in some scheme providers failing to disclose that the Crown contribution has been made. 115 Officials recommend that an amendment be made to require disclosure of the total amount of the Crown contribution and the total amount of fee subsidy paid to schemes in their annual report and the number of members that those contributions have been applied to. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 116 PENALTIES Issue: Section 214(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 214(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be repealed as a consequence of repealing section 216, and the references in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to section 216 should be consequentially repealed as well. Comment Section 215 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 sets out the penalties for employers who fail to provide information, and section 216 sets out the penalties for employers who fail to make a deduction or make deductions incorrectly. The bill proposes the repeal of section 216. Section 214(2) states that if sections 215 or 216 of the Act apply, the following provisions in the Tax Administration Act will not apply: • Part 7 (which relates to interest); • section 139B (which relates to late payment penalties); and • sections 141 to 141L (which relate to tax shortfalls). The exclusion set out in section 214(2) was originally designed to allow a lenient approach to be taken when enforcing compliance with KiwiSaver obligations. In reality, the sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994 excluded would have applied only to situations covered by section 216, so the reference to section 215 in section 214(2) was always unnecessary. With the repeal of section 216, however, the reference to section 215 will become a major impediment to the intended compliance regime in respect of KiwiSaver contributions. Accordingly, officials recommend that section 214(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 be repealed as a consequence of repealing section 216. Furthermore, officials also recommend that the references in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to section 216, be consequentially repealed. It is recommended that the amendments apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 117 Issue: Month that penalty applies from Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sections 215(3) and 216(3) should be amended to clarify in which month the penalty is imposed. Comment Sections 215(3) and 216(3) both state: “However, an employer is not liable for more than one penalty per month to which an employer monthly schedule relates.” The month to which the employer monthly schedule relates is the month in which KiwiSaver deductions are required to be made. However, some obligations relate to the provision of employer information by a due date, and many relate to more than one employer monthly schedule. This adds confusion as to when a penalty should be applied and to which month it relates. In order to avoid confusion, officials recommend that sections 215(3) and 216(3) be amended to remove the reference to an employer monthly schedule. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Penalties and collection powers Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill amends the definition of “tax” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include compulsory employer contributions to KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds. This is to allow the Commissioner to impose penalties and use existing collection powers. Sections 143A and 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should also apply. Section 143A concerns knowledge offences, which include knowingly failing to provide information (including tax returns and forms), knowingly providing false, incomplete or misleading information and knowingly failing to make a deduction or withholding of tax as required by law. Section 157 applies to situations where a taxpayer has defaulted in the payment of income tax, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue may send a written notice (an attachment notice requiring a person to deduct from any amount payable (or to become payable to the taxpayer) an amount and pay it to Inland Revenue. 118 Comment To enable the Commissioner to collect unpaid employer contributions, sections 143A and 157 of the Tax Administration Act should apply. Both sections should apply where the employer fails to pay the compulsory contribution to a KiwiSaver scheme. Section 157 should apply to employer contributions not paid to complying superannuation funds (when Inland Revenue receives a notice from the Government Actuary to collect them). The effect of this recommendation is that penalties in the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply to employers who fail to make deductions or who deduct an incorrect amount. The new graduated penalty will apply when an employer files an employer monthly schedule but does not pay the associated PAYE, and employers will be liable for use-of-money interest, shortfall penalties and late payment penalties. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. Issue: KiwiSaver should provide a non-locked-in section Submission (70A – Simpson Grierson) The bill should be amended to allow KiwiSaver schemes the option to provide a non- locked-in section for amounts transferred from existing employment based schemes or for lump sum voluntary contributions. Providing a non-locked-in facility within KiwiSaver supports the KiwiSaver initiative (namely, to encourage long-term retirement savings for New Zealanders). Comment The submission indicates that over the next few years many employers are likely to wind up their existing superannuation schemes owing to the difficulties of continuing to operate those schemes alongside KiwiSaver, and it will be unrealistic to expect members to transfer existing accumulations to a KiwiSaver scheme where it will be locked in as provided for under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The submission expresses concern that when existing schemes are wound up the members of those schemes will have their accumulations paid out, usually as a cash lump sum. As a consequence there is a real risk that a large amount of money currently invested in employment- based superannuation schemes will either be spent by members or invested in non- superannuation based investments. 119 An existing provider cannot change the benefits payable to members if the change will be detrimental without the agreement of all members. Requiring existing accumulations to be transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme would mean that employees would have to be able to access their funds as currently provided for in the existing scheme for the Government Actuary to approve such as requirement. Section 9BAA of the Superannuation Scheme Act 1989 allows employers or trustees to effect the transfer if the terms of the non-locked-in section are no less favourable than the old scheme. Officials consider that allowing KiwiSaver providers to provide a non-locked-in section would add complexity to KiwiSaver for very little gain in terms of increased retirement savings. As such accumulations can be withdrawn on the winding-up of the existing scheme, the transfer to a KiwiSaver scheme would have to be at the option of the member. Furthermore, the member is likely to require flexibility around access to those funds on an ongoing basis to ensure that the terms are no less favourable than the old scheme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 120 INTEREST Issue: Interest on trust monies Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be clarified that section 68(2) of the Public Finance Act 1989 does not apply in respect of returns on the investment of Holding Account money (section 72 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) and that interest earned from 1 July 2007 is public money. Comment Section 84 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that a specified interest rate is payable by Inland Revenue on money in the Holding Account (in accordance with sections 85 to 91 of the KiwiSaver Act). On this basis the policy aim was to set a level of interest payable by Inland Revenue on contributions received, or treated as received, into the Holding Account by the Commissioner under the KiwiSaver Act. Further, section 84(2) of the KiwiSaver Act provides that section 69 of the Public Finance Act does not apply to the Holding Account (meaning that returns on investment of Holding Account funds do not have to be paid to the relevant depositor or entitled person). In addition, section 82 of the KiwiSaver Act provides that the investment rules in Part 2 of the Trustee Act do not apply to money in the KiwiSaver Holding Account. This indicates that the policy aim was that the normal rules that would have applied to investment of trust money and the returns earned would not apply. Instead, a specified interest rate is payable on that money by Inland Revenue. However, the KiwiSaver Act 2006 gives full effect to the policy aim detailed above only in relation to money entered into the KiwiSaver Holding Account through section 73 (deductions from salary or wages), which are considered public money, and not in relation to money entered into the KiwiSaver Holding Account through section 74 (deductions other than those made through salary or wages), which are considered trust money. Although other provisions regarding trust money do not apply, section 68(2) of the Public Finance Act still deems the returns on the investment of trust money in the KiwiSaver Holding Account to be trust money. As there is no policy reason why the returns earned on money entered in the KiwiSaver Holding Account under section 74 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be treated differently from Holding Account money entered under section 73, officials recommend that changes should be made to section 84 of the KiwiSaver Act to clarify that: • Section 68(2) of the Public Finance Act does not apply in respect of the investment of Holding Account trust money. • Returns on the investment of Holding Account money are deemed to be public money and that this applies for returns earned from 1 July 2007. 121 It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Payment of interest to Muslims Submission (Matter raised by officials) A concern has been raised with officials regarding the application of KiwiSaver to Muslims. The concern relates to the payment of interest on contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account and interest being paid on refunds of contributions to an employee or an employer. To deal with the concern, officials recommend that the KiwiSaver Act be amended to allow a person to notify the Commissioner that he or she does not wish to be paid interest on contributions held by Inland Revenue or on a refund. Comment A concern has been raised that as interest is payable in respect of contributions held by Inland Revenue, Muslims will be prevented from joining KiwiSaver. This is because, for religious reasons, Muslims are not permitted to receive the payment of interest. In the 2006 census, 36,000 people in New Zealand identified themselves as Muslim. To deal with this issue, officials consider that a person should be able to elect not to receive interest on contributions held in the holding account (or on a refund). However, Inland Revenue will not be able to implement this recommended change until 1 April 2009 owing to the need to implement the Budget 2007 enhancements first. In the interim, if interest is paid with a refund, the recipient has the option of paying the interest to a charitable organisation. Officials understand that this mechanism is sometimes used by Muslims when interest is received. This issue does not arise in respect of the investment of contributions by a provider as such contributions can be invested in equity rather than debt instruments. The recommended amendment should apply from 1 April 2009. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 Issue: Start date for calculation of interest on employer contributions Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 so that, for the purposes of the calculation of interest on employer contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account, the start date is the first day of the month in which contributions were received by Inland Revenue. This will also apply in respect of the contributions received to which the employer tax credit applies. Comment Under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, for the purpose of the payment of interest, every amount of contribution that is deducted from salary or wages is treated as received by the Commissioner on the 15th day of the month in which the deduction is made. However, for other contributions, such as employer contributions, the start date is the date that the contribution was received by Inland Revenue. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 mandates that all employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme be paid via Inland Revenue using the PAYE process. With the introduction of compulsory employer contributions and the employer tax credit, this process makes the start date for the calculation of interest on employer contributions (including contributions offset by the employer tax credit) held in the holding account difficult to apply. This is because large employers pay employer contributions and claim the employer tax credit twice a month. However, information relating to the amounts contributed for each employee by large employers is received only once a month. Furthermore, the employer tax credit is treated as being received on the due date, which may not necessarily be the date that the employer contributions are received. Accordingly, officials recommend that an amendment be made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 so that, for the purposes of the calculation of interest on employer contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account, the start date is the first day of the month in which contributions were received by Inland Revenue. This will also apply in respect of the contributions received to which the employer tax credit applies. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 April 2008. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 123 SCHEME WITHDRAWALS Issue: Beneficiaries Submissions (78 – Council of Trade Unions, 96 – New Zealand Nurses Organisation) The CTU and New Zealand Nurses Organisation note that assurances were made on 5 June 2007 that the Social Security Amendment Act will not require that a person needs to withdraw retirement savings before becoming eligible for a benefit, but this needs to be confirmed. Comment Officials understand that funds held in KiwiSaver and other retirement scheme accounts do not have to be withdrawn prior to becoming eligible for a benefit. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Serious illness withdrawal Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Amendments to clause 12(2) and 12(3) of the KiwiSaver scheme rules (schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) will ensure that the serious illness withdrawal facility applies only when the member is permanently and totally disabled or when death is imminent. The member will then be able to withdraw the $1,000 Crown contribution. An amendment to clause 13 of the KiwiSaver scheme rules also ensures that applications for withdrawal on the grounds of serious illness can be made without the need to complete a statutory declaration of the assets and liabilities of the applicant. The Institute agrees that in the case of serious illness, the member should be able to apply for refund of the Crown contribution. However, the amended criteria in schedule 1 part 12(3) are too harsh. The requirement that a member is “totally and permanently unable to work” is too hard a test to pass. If there are concerns regarding the Crown money, the Crown contributions should be excluded from the amount that could be withdrawn (similar to the significant financial hardship provisions). The amendment to KiwiSaver Act 2006, schedule 1 part 12(3) is appropriate. 124 Comment The threshold for serious illness has been set high as KiwiSaver is primarily designed to encourage saving for retirement. Provision has already been made to allow withdrawal of members’ funds where there is significant financial hardship which could be bought about, for example, by an illness temporarily reducing a member’s ability to work. However, in this instance, when the member recovered, he or she would then be in a position to continue to contribute to KiwiSaver – and enjoy the value of contributions and the accumulated tax credits on retirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Renaming of scheme and withdrawals Submission (69R – BKR Walker Wayland) The fund should be relabelled “KiwiSaver Retirement Income Fund” and withdrawal should not be allowed as a lump sum in entirety. Comment KiwiSaver is a programme to encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those of pre-retirement. The KiwiSaver Act allows the establishment of KiwiSaver schemes to facilitate savings. There is no one, single fund, and therefore the suggested name is misleading. Clause 5 of schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act requires a provider, at the request of the member, to make a withdrawal as a lump sum. However, this requirement does not prevent a member purchasing an annuity or a pension. Furthermore, it does not prevent a member withdrawing regular amounts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 125 Issue: Significant financial hardship rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) In respect of applications for a refund of initial contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account on the grounds of significant financial hardship, the Commissioner should have the authority to consider whether alternative sources of funding having been explored, and be able to limit the amount withdrawn. Comment Section 113 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 allows a KiwiSaver member to apply to the Commissioner for a refund of initial contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account if the person is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant financial hardship or if he or she is suffering serious illness, as defined in schedule 1 of the Act. If a KiwiSaver member makes an application for a significant financial hardship withdrawal, the trustees of the scheme must be reasonably satisfied that reasonable alternative sources of funding have been explored and have been exhausted, and may direct that the amount withdrawn be limited to a specified amount that, in the trustee’s opinion, is required to alleviate the particular hardship. However, there is no equivalent provision for Inland Revenue. It therefore has no authority to consider whether alternative sources of funding have been explored and have been exhausted, or to limit the amount withdrawn when a KiwiSaver member makes an application for refund of initial contributions on the grounds of significant financial hardship. Instead, it is limited to considering whether the person is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant financial hardship or is suffering serious illness. Officials therefore recommend that an amendment be made so that, in respect of applications for a refund of initial contributions held in the Inland Revenue holding account on the grounds of significant financial hardship, the Commissioner should have the authority to consider whether alternative sources of funding have been explored, and to limit the amount withdrawn. This will ensure consistency in the application of such requests. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 126 OTHER MATTERS Issue: Refunds of contributions Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Once the Commissioner has given approval for a refund of contributions under section 221, the refund of contributions should be able to be made directly from the scheme provider. Comment The administrative design of KiwiSaver provides that all refunds of contribution will be made by Inland Revenue as part of its role as the central administrator for KiwiSaver. ISI, AMP, ING and ASFONZ, in their submissions on invalid enrolments, stated that amounts should be refunded to Inland Revenue, which should be responsible for the distribution to members, employers and the Crown. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Information packs Submission (91 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Under section 40, there is an onus on employers to supply KiwiSaver information packs to employees within seven days, therefore the Commissioner needs to ensure that the packs are supplied on a regular basis. The amendments to section 40 are not required, as the Commissioner should ensure that the packs are supplied on a regular, ongoing basis, and the Commissioner should supply all requests for packs, without applying a “reasonableness” test. Comment The KiwiSaver Act 2006 requires Inland Revenue to provide each employer with the number of information packs that it believes will be sufficient to enable the employer to meet its obligations. There should be no inference that Inland Revenue will, on an ongoing basis, forecast the number of information packs employers would need and issue them automatically. 127 After the initial mail-out of information packs which occurred in May to June of this year, Inland Revenue will send information packs to employers only upon request. Inland Revenue does not provide employer packs on an ongoing basis because of difficulties in estimating the numbers required and possible wastage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Refund of employer contribution by provider Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 101(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be repealed and section 101(1) should be consequentially amended. Comment The provider of a KiwiSaver scheme may refund to Inland Revenue any amount of employer contribution that it paid to the provider in excess of the amount it was required to on-pay. The provider is not, however, required to make a refund if that refund would reduce the amount of the employee’s contribution below the minimum employee contribution rate required under the KiwiSaver Act. As the provider does not have the employee employment income information needed, the provider will always refund any amount requested by Inland Revenue, even if it would breach the minimum employee contribution rate required under the KiwiSaver Act. Officials accordingly recommend that section 101(2) of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 be repealed and section 101(1) be consequentially amended to require that the provider of a KiwiSaver scheme refund to the Commissioner any amount of employer contribution that was paid by the Commissioner in excess of the amount of the employer contribution that the Act requires. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 128 Issue: Notification of transfers and requirement to transfer funds and information Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 56 of the KiwiSaver Act should be amended to require that when a KiwiSaver scheme member transfers to a new scheme, the provider of the old scheme must notify the new provider as to whether the Crown contribution (the $1,000 kick-start contribution) is part of the member’s accumulated interest that is to be transferred. Comment When a KiwiSaver member transfers to another KiwiSaver scheme, section 56 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 specifies, among other things, the information that the provider of the old scheme must give to the provider of the new scheme. The $1,000 initial Crown contribution cannot be withdrawn in respect of particular requests for withdrawal (such as significant financial hardship). Accordingly, when a member transfers to a new scheme provider, that provider will need to know whether the $1,000 Crown contribution is part of the member’s accumulated interest to be transferred under the old KiwiSaver scheme, as this amount may need to be ring- fenced by the new provider. Officials therefore recommend that an amendment be made to section 56 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to require that when a member of a KiwiSaver scheme has transferred to a new scheme, the provider of the old scheme must give notice to the new provider as to whether the Crown contribution (the $1,000) is part of the member’s accumulated interest. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 129 Issue: Consent to electronic transactions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 219 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended to exclude the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from the deemed consent provided for in that section. Comment Section 219 of the KiwiSaver Act provides that where a person’s electronic address has been given to any other person, the former is treated as having consented to the use of electronic communication under the Electronic Transactions Act 2002. Inland Revenue has provided both a telephone number and an email address to the public in respect of KiwiSaver, which may mean that it has consented to receive and send notices via these mediums. However, Inland Revenue is not operationally capable of such receipt or issuance and has not yet determined if these media are functionally equivalent to writing. Officials therefore recommended that section 219 of the KiwiSaver be amended to exclude the Commissioner from the deemed consent provided for in that section. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 July 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Permanent legislative authority for on-paying contributions received through section 73 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 73 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that a permanent legislative authority is established to allow Inland Revenue to on-pay deductions from salary or wages entered in the holding amount by inserting the words “without further authority than this section”. Because the relevant part of section 73 is also subject to the on-payment requirements of sections 75 (initial contributions) and 77 (small contributions), consistent amendments are required to sections 75 and 77 of the KiwiSaver Act. 130 Comment It was originally envisaged that a permanent legislative authority would be established through the KiwiSaver Act 2006 which would allow Inland Revenue to on-pay contributions received from salary or wages to the provider of the relevant KiwiSaver scheme. However, the legislation, as it was drafted, did not give effect to a permanent legislative authority. Officials therefore recommend that the appropriate wording changes are made to give effect to a permanent legislative authority for on-payment of money received by Inland Revenue under section 73. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Employer exemptions with master trusts Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 28 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended so that an employer using a Master Trust scheme as a vehicle for an exemption can use any other evidence to demonstrate compliance with the exempt employer criteria. Comment For an employer to become an exempt employer it must exhibit to the Government Actuary that, in practice, the KiwiSaver scheme is open to all new employees. This provision was intended to enable the employer to prove that it met the criteria, without necessarily relying on solely the trust deed to establish compliance. However, where an employer uses a Master Trust scheme as a vehicle for an exemption, the Government Actuary can consider only the parts of the master trust deed that applies to the employer and any relevant participation agreement. This effectively undermines the intention of the provision. It is recommended that an amendment be made so that an employer using a Master Trust scheme as a vehicle for an exemption can use any other evidence to demonstrate compliance. It is recommended that the amendment apply from the date of assent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
