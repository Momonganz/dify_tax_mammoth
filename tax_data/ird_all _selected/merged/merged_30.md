response to the problem of excessive debt funding by banks. The fundamental objective is to measure more accurately the income associated with the New Zealand activities of banks, ensuring that excessive debt cannot be allocated to the New Zealand operations of a multinational bank. The new thin capitalisation rules for banks compare the equity associated with the New Zealand banking business (net of certain outbound investments) with a prescribed level of required equity based on 4% of the banks’ New Zealand risk- weighted exposures, and deny interest expenses where there is a deficiency. The measurement of equity is based on accounting and regulatory concepts of equity, which enables verifiability and minimises compliance costs. The objective of the new rules is not to regulate the amount of equity in New Zealand per se, but the use of equity as a benchmark for achieving an appropriate allocation of interest expenses. Officials have worked closely with the banking industry to develop these rules. These rules will be monitored to ensure that they are operating in a way that reflects the policy intent. Proposed thin capitalisation rules for foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand are summarised in figure 1. Figure 1: Thin capitalisation rules for foreign-owned banks 4 INCOME NOT FULLY TAX FREE Submission (35W – Deutsche Bank, 23 – Russell McVeagh) In some circumstances income from an offshore investment could be subject to New Zealand tax. In that case costs incurred to earn such income should be deductible. The new thin capitalisation rules could act to deny a deduction for interest on debt funding the investment. Comment The submissions suggest that some interest should be deductible because the income is subject to non-resident withholding tax of 15% in New Zealand under either the conduit rules or the dividend withholding payment (DWP) rules. Under the conduit rules the 15% non-resident withholding tax is paid in respect of the offshore assets income when the New Zealand company ultimately distributes that income to its non-resident shareholders. However, the payment of this tax can be delayed indefinitely. Likewise, under the DWP rules the offshore income will ultimately only be subject to 15% non-resident withholding tax. Albeit 33% is initially paid with an 18% refund when these profits are distributed to the non resident shareholders of the NZ Bank. Given that 15% non-resident withholding tax rather than 33% income tax is paid on the offshore income it does not seem appropriate to claim a full interest deduction. Apportionment calculations would be extremely complex to take account of the different rates of tax. Consequently officials do not recommend that any interest deduction be available in respect of this income. It should also be noted that when setting the prescribed level of capital required to support the NZ business of the bank, at 4% of risk weighed exposures it was acknowledged that in some cases the offshore income could be subject to some NZ tax. Consequently if an interest apportionment was considered in the future, the 4% rate would need to be reviewed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 SELECTIVE CONSULTATION CONTRARY TO GTPP Submission (31 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The consultation of the proposals was selective and contrary to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). Comment The analysis leading to the introduction of the new thin capitalisation rules for banks involved base-maintenance of a significant size which needed a more timely response than would be possible under the full GTPP. Only a small number of taxpayers were directly affected. The issues involved were extremely complex and required a more intensive technical interaction with the taxpayers directly involved. Extending the consultations to individual firms would have diverted resources from these consultations. Accordingly it was decided to keep other taxpayers informed through meetings with general bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and the New Zealand Law Society. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 6 IMPACT OF IFRS Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed rules should be considered in light of the effects of the new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Comment It anticipated that the key areas affected by IFRS will be: EQV, INTG and I. Lesser areas affected by IFRS are: REV, TXB, CEFA, NAFA, EOI, AEQ, AEQI and GFD. One difficulty in assessing the effect of IFRS is that the details of the change in standards are not yet known. The banks are likely to be in a better position to have considered and implemented the changes and are likely to raise issues themselves in the future. Officials will also monitor the IFRS changes and the need for consequential tax law changes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That changes to IFRS be monitored to determine if there is any impact on the operation of the new rules. 7 THE NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP A foreign-owned registered bank will be required to determine its “NZ banking group” under section FG 8C. This group will include all resident entities and fixed establishments (generally branches) operating in New Zealand that would be required to consolidate with the ultimate foreign parent of the registered bank for financial reporting purposes. Section FG 8C also provides an option to exclude life insurance companies from the NZ banking group. Entities that are part of a life insurance company’s group can likewise be carved out, provided they do not have a main activity that is banking, financing or leasing, and they are not holding companies of banking, financing or leasing companies. Issue: Inadvertent exclusion of certain non-residents Submission (23 – Russell McVeagh) The provision which defines taxpayers who are subject to the thin capitalisation rules (section FG 2(1)) may inadvertently exclude non-resident companies, including registered banks, to which the thin capitalisation rules were intended to apply. Section FG 2(1) should be rewritten to be consistent with the language used in the present section FG 2(1). Comment The proposed section currently states that a non-resident company will be subject to thin capitalisation rules only if: • no person who is resident in New Zealand has a direct ownership interest that is equal to or greater than 50%; and • a non-resident has a direct ownership interest that, when aggregated with the direct ownership interest of persons associated with the non-resident, is equal to or greater than 50%. If a non-resident company is widely held, the second requirement may not be satisfied and the company will therefore not be subject to the thin capitalisation rules. Officials agree that FG 2 (1) should be rewritten to be consistent with the language used in the present thin capitalisation rules in section FG 2(1) in order to achieve the intended effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 8 Issue: Reporting bank confusion where there is more than one registered bank Submission (23 – Russell McVeagh) Section FG 8D should be amended and simplified to provide more certainty in its application. It is not clear how section FG 8D is intended to apply to a banking group which includes two registered banks, one of which carries on business in New Zealand as a New Zealand-resident subsidiary, and where the other carries on business in New Zealand as the branch of a non-resident bank. The submitters note that in this example, the wording as currently stands would not classify a branch as a registered bank for the purposes of section FG 8D. Section FG 8D should be redrafted to the effect that: • where a banking group only includes one registered bank (including a branch), then that registered bank is the reporting bank; and • where a banking group includes more that one registered bank (for example, two companies, two branches, or a combination) then the reporting bank of the group should be determined by way of election or by the Commissioner. Comment Under FG 8D, a fixed establishment will be a reporting entity only when there is no registered bank included in a New Zealand banking group. If there is both a registered bank and a fixed establishment included in a New Zealand banking group, it is clear from FG 8D that only the registered bank can be the reporting bank. The submitter is therefore correct in stating that the branch (the fixed establishment) in their example would not be the reporting entity. This result is consistent with the policy intent, in that fixed establishments cannot be reporting entities unless there are no registered banks included in a New Zealand banking group. The election of fixed establishments would allow banking groups to elect branches which may not have interest deductions. Officials consider that the section as currently written clearly reflects this policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 Issue: SOP – exclusion of non-resident life insurance business Submission (38W – ASB Bank Limited) The bill should be changed so that reporting banks can elect to exclude from a NZ banking group a non-resident person or company (with a fixed establishment in NZ) whose main activity is the provision of life insurance. Comment There appear to be no negative issues arising from the proposal to elect to exclude from a NZ banking group a non-resident company whose main activity is the provision of life insurance. Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 EQUITY OF THE NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP The NZ banking group’s net equity is calculated under section FG 8G. The starting point will be the accounting values of shareholders’ equity and branch equity included in the financial statements of the members of the NZ banking group, based on accounting consolidation principles. Section FG 8G also requires a number of additional deductions from the aggregated accounting equity described above. These deductions essentially follow the prudential deductions required by the regulator (the Reserve Bank of New Zealand). The requirement to make these deductions from equity is based on the premise that the NZ banking group must have enough equity to fully fund certain assets of the group. With offshore assets for example, the effect of this is that interest deductions cannot be taken in respect of the funding for these offshore assets. This reflects the policy that where these assets generate income that is exempt from NZ tax there is no entitlement to a tax deduction in respect of the funding of these assets. A supplementary order paper (SOP) was tabled on 15 March 2005 to require the deduction of fixed-rate shares held by the New Zealand banking group from the calculation of the groups NZ net equity. The deduction from net equity for fixed rate shares applies to fixed rate shares that have been offered to the public on or after 1 January 2005. Fixed rate shares that have been offered to the public before 1 January 2005 are not required to be deducted from net equity until after 1 January 2010. The SOP 337 also provides for a regulation-making power to amend the definition of equity of the NZ banking group. Issue: Definition of New Zealand net equity Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) In some circumstances the New Zealand bank will consolidate a “Special Purpose Vehicle” (SPV) in which an equity interest is held by a third party. The resulting equity may be included in equity under GAAP, although in substance this equity reflects the interest of the third party. The equity held by the third party and the proportionate share of risk-weighted exposures needs to be reduced by the amount funded by the third party. 11 Comment Officials agree that this would be the ideal approach. However, the proposal to determine the amount of a third party’s equity in an SPV would significantly increase compliance costs because of the complexity of the issue. It does not currently appear to be a significant issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the situation be monitored. Issue: Scope of AEQI Submission (31 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 33W – New Zealand Law Society, 18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 23 – Russell McVeagh) The scope of AEQI is too wide as it uses a very wide definition of associated person. Comment The definition of AEQI was intended to ensure that equity investments held by the New Zealand banking group in a carved-out life insurance group or other associates (that are not within the New Zealand banking group) would have to be equity funded within the New Zealand banking group. This is required as the carved-out life insurance group or other associate should be subject to the existing thin capitalisation rules and its equity should not be allowed to be debt funded by another New Zealand taxpayer. That is, without AEQI, the carved out life insurance group could be debt funded within the constraints of the existing thin capitalisation rules and its equity could then be debt funded in the New Zealand banking group. This outcome would not be appropriate. It also ensured that the new rules could not be avoided by placing offshore investments in such companies outside the New Zealand banking group. Officials agree that the provision as currently drafted is too broad and would affect certain transactions in an unintended way. We propose to deal with this by limiting the AEQ and AEQI definition to cross holdings between the NZ banking group and the carved-out life insurance group. To effect this change we propose removing the reference to associated persons in AEQ and AEQI and replacing it with a reference to the carved-out life insurance members. 12 To ensure the new rules cannot be avoided by placing shares in a non-resident company into a company outside the NZ banking group, we propose certain amendments to the EOI definition. Shares in a non-resident company (subject to the exclusion for small portfolio share holdings as provided for in EOI) held by a company outside the banking group would be deducted from the NZ banking group equity where the company that holds those shares is either: • a member of the carved-out life group (currently reflected in the legislation before FEC); or • a company that a member of the NZ banking group has a 10% or greater direct voting interest in, and that shareholding results in conduit relief in respect of the shares in the non resident being flowed through to the NZ banking group. The 10% direct voting interest threshold is being recommended as this shareholding could result in conduit relief in respect of any offshore assets being flowed through to the NZ banking group. Officials believe if such offshore assets were present the New Zealand banking group would be aware of its existence and therefore be able to determine the quantum of offshore assets. Russell McVeagh submitted that securitisation vehicles could be included in the New Zealand banking group as a result of the “associated person” definition. Officials note that the proposal to limit the definitions of AEQ and AEQI would address this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Grey list shares excluded from EOI Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exclusion from EOI for certain shares in non-residents should be amended to better reflect the underlying policy. Comment Currently the bill provides an exclusion from EOI where a member of the NZ banking group holds shares in a non-resident and those shares are in a company that is resident in a grey list country, are held on revenue account and the shares are listed on a recognised exchange. Officials recommend that the exclusion is made clearer to reflect the original policy intent. 13 We recommend including a reference to the foreign shareholding not being a “sufficient interest” (as defined in section LF 1(2)) in the offshore company, or not being a “sufficient interest” if this were the only class of share on issue by the offshore company. Originally this exclusion was intended to cover small investment holdings by life companies held as part of their life insurance business, as a de minimis for compliance reasons. In this regard shares that are part of funding arrangements were not intended to be covered by this exclusion. This area will need to be monitored to ensure the legislation is operating as intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Consistency of debt and equity treatment throughout Act Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) As a general matter, the definitions of equity of debt and equity for the proposed thin capitalisation rules should be consistent with the concepts employed elsewhere in the Act. Comment The thin capitalisation rules do not alter the definitions of debt and equity for other purposes of the Act. For most purposes in the Act, the distinction between debt and equity follows the legal form of the instrument. However for some provisions, the instruments that are accorded equity treatment are restricted to ensure that the provision achieves its policy intent. Similarly, the definition of New Zealand net equity has been altered significantly (with both additions and subtractions) to ensure that it achieves its policy intent of protecting the New Zealand tax base against the excessive deduction of interest. Each of the adjustments to equity calculation fulfils this criterion. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: Removal of fixed-rate shares from definition of net equity Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 31,31A – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 33WA – New Zealand Law Society) A number of submissions questioned the proposal to remove fixed-rate shares from the definition of New Zealand net equity as preference shares are equity. Comment The thin capitalisation rules do not alter the definitions of debt and equity for other purposes of the Act. For most purposes in the Act, the distinction between debt and equity follows the legal form of the instrument. However, for some provisions, the instruments that are accorded equity treatment are restricted in order to ensure that the provision achieves its policy intent. Similarly, the definition of New Zealand net equity has been altered significantly (with both additions and subtractions) to ensure that it achieves its policy intent of protecting the New Zealand tax base against the excessive deduction of interest. Each of the adjustments to equity calculation fulfils this criterion. Fixed-rate shares are a case in point. Redeemable preference shares are an example of a fixed-rate share. They have many economic attributes similar to debt, and can be used flexibly as a substitute for it. However their tax treatment is quite different, which means that they can be used to circumvent the intent of the new thin capitalisation rules for banks. Interest is considered to be a cost to a business and so is deductible in the calculation of income. Tax is paid by the recipient of the interest, who must include it in income. Dividends, on the other hand, are a share of profit and so are not deductible. The dividends are income to the recipient. Double taxation is avoided in New Zealand through the imputation system which provides the recipient with an imputation credit, which can be used to offset tax payable by the shareholder. In effect, for fixed rate preference shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers, the company can be said to have withheld tax on behalf of the shareholder in relation to the imputation credit attached to the dividend paid. In the context of the new thin capitalisation rules, a bank which would otherwise have a denial of interest, particularly where the shares are held by NZ residents, could issue preference shares, avoiding the interest denial. The tax paid by the bank would give rise to imputation credits, as deductible interest would be replaced by non-deductible dividends. However this apparent increase in tax would be offset by a reduction in tax paid by the lender/shareholder who would receive an imputation credit equal to the increased tax paid by the bank. The transaction would not result in any net tax increase in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue: Subsequent review of legislation Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) There should be scope for expeditious refinement to the legislation in order to deal with unintended effects of the legislation. Comment The new thin capitalisation rules involve a number of innovative concepts and need to be applied in complex transactions. It is almost inevitable that adjustments will need to be made to ensure that the rules achieve their policy intent without impeding legitimate business arrangements. The banking industry is concerned that waiting for an appropriate legislative vehicle could lead to extended uncertainty and the potential for disruption of transactions. Officials note this concern and refer to the regulation- making power provided for in the SOP. It is proposed there should be authority provided through Order in Council to deal with situations where it is unclear whether an instrument should be considered equity or debt for thin capitalisation purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: SOP – regulatory power to amend the definition of “net equity” for thin capitalisation purposes Submission (18A – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 21A – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 31A – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 33WA – New Zealand Law Society) The New Zealand Bankers’ Association (NZBA) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ) consider that the scope of regulatory power is too wide. NZBA suggests that the power should be narrowed to deal with instruments where, due to particular characteristics, it is unclear whether they would constitute equity for the purposes of the thin capitalisation regime. FG 8G is currently silent as to whether the effective date of the regulations would be retrospective or prospective. NZBA submits that retrospective regulations should be used only where the affected taxpayer has agreed to the retrospective approach, or where the GTPP has been followed. NZBA submits that officials should respect the principles of the GTPP process and consult with affected parties prior to the introduction of Orders in Council. NZBA asks that the Committee confirms that this is desirable. 16 ICANZ submits that regulatory changes should be properly consulted on so that, at a minimum, appropriate effective dates are determined. They also submit that the ability to exclude items from capital should not proceed. Minter Ellison Rudd Watts and the New Zealand Law Society submit that changes to the definition of net equity should be made only after adequate consultation with the banking industry and professional taxation advisors. The submitters argue that items PSCH and NSCH should not be included in the definition of net equity. If this is not accepted, they argue that the inclusion of an amount in NSCH should not have retrospective effect, or affect instruments issued, or transactions executed, prior to the date of the law-change. Comment The SOP proposed that the definition of New Zealand equity could be modified by Order in Council. The proposed amendment recognised that the definition introduced new, complex concepts into the Income Tax Act which might require alteration based on experience. Concern was expressed by industry that undesirable uncertainty might be created if amendments to the definition were forced to await a suitable legislative vehicle. If a delay were to occur, legitimate business transactions and arrangements might be impeded. On the other hand, officials were concerned that instruments or arrangements might be developed which were not contemplated by the new rules and which would be contrary to the policy intent of the legislation. Again, a timely response would be needed to reduce the possibility of revenue loss. The amendment was proposed as a way of addressing these two issues. Two concerns have been raised with respect to the proposed amendment. There is a concern that the Order in Council power is not broad enough as amendments might be required in other sections as part of the response to a particular situation or arrangement. The second, more substantive, concern is that changes as fundamental as redefining New Zealand equity would properly require Parliamentary oversight, given that they could raise policy questions or benefit from the wider discussion that would attend a legislative amendment. Officials recommend that the regulation-making power should be limited to situations where it is unclear whether an instrument should be considered equity or debt for the purposes of thin capitalisation. This would provide clarity and certainty in a timely manner. Officials agree that changes made through an Order in Council should not be retrospective. Officials agree that consultation with affected parties following the Generic Tax Policy Process prior to introduction of an Order in Council is desirable. This intention should be reflected in Inland Revenue’s Technical Information Bulletin on the new banking legislation. Recommendation That the submission to limit the regulation-making power be accepted. 17 Issue: SOP – grandfathering Submission (18A – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The grandfathering period for fixed-rate shares should be extended beyond the present five years. The grandfathering period should be the lesser of the term of the instrument, or 20 years. Comment The submitter argues that, as a matter of principle, companies who have issued instruments with long-dated terms prior to the introduction of new legislation should be able to grandfather those instruments over a significant period of time. Many different types of instruments with long-dated terms can be affected when tax policies change. Officials consider that from a broader policy perspective, it is not appropriate to grandfather instruments on this basis. In the present situation, it does not appear that companies with fixed-rate shares will be materially disadvantaged by the change and will have the ability to plan for the change over the transitional period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Calculation of New Zealand net equity Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) EQV is currently defined as being “the sum of the financial value of the shareholders’ equity relating to members of the New Zealand banking group”. This potentially suggests that the equity of each member is to be aggregated, with no eliminations. Comment The policy intention is that equity should be calculated on a consolidated basis. The legislation needs to be clear that EQV is calculated on consolidated grouping, not on aggregation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 18 NEW ZEALAND NET EQUITY THRESHOLD USING RISK- WEIGHTED EXPOSURES Section FG 8H provides for the measurement of the net equity threshold based on 4% of the NZ banking group’s risk-weighted exposures. Risk-weighted exposures, a regulatory concept, include the on and off-balance sheet assets of the NZ banking group adjusted for risk. Under section FG 8F, regulatory values are determined by applying the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Capital Adequacy Framework, which sets out the methodology and rates for risk-weighting assets. Resident entities and fixed establishments that are members of the NZ banking group that do not currently risk-weight their assets for the regulator will need to carry out this risk-weighting exercise for the new thin capitalisation calculation. Issue: Calculation of net equity threshold Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) In determining the risk-weighted exposures of the bank for the purposes of applying the 4% required equity threshold, certain items are excluded. The excluded items are defined in DEQ. The submitter argues that a hybrid debt amount which gives rise to a tax deduction should not be deducted in calculating risk-weighted exposures. Comment In order to make the deduction from risk-weighted exposures the item must have a regulatory value. This item was left out because it does not have a “regulatory value” attached to it and consequently there is no way of adjusting for it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Treatment of deferred tax Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The adjustment for future tax benefits in the definition TXB in section FG 8G(1) requires future tax benefits to be equity funded. This should refer to any net future tax benefits. 19 Comment Officials agree with the submission. The required deduction should be matched to the Reserve Bank Capital Adequacy Framework deduction and therefore refer to net future tax benefits as this is the basis for the calculation of equity for the purposes of the new tax rules. Officials note that in order to reflect the Reserve Bank definition that the definition of TXB (c) in FG8G should be replaced with: (c) timing or temporary differences \[to the extent that a net loss would have arisen in the current tax year if the items giving rise to the timing or temporary differences were deductible in the current tax year if there had been a net loss for the tax year\]. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and changes should be made to the definition of TXB to reflect the Reserve Bank definition. Issue: Valuations where denominated in foreign currency Submission (23 – Russell McVeagh) A concession similar to that in the existing FG 7 should be included. FG 7 enables taxpayers to measure any foreign currency denominated assets or debt, by reference to the forward rate on the first day of the income year for the relevant measurement date. A similar concession should be included in the thin capitalisation rules for registered banks with respect to financial arrangements and risk-weighted exposures so that taxpayers can better predict the value of their exposures and debt. Comment The submission does not explain why further modification is necessary. No evidence of the current approach being a practical problem has been presented. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 INTEREST DENIAL If, for any quarter (or more frequent measurement date that the bank chooses), net equity is less than the net equity threshold based on 4% of risk-weighted exposures, there will be an adjustment under section FG 8B to the reporting bank’s annual total deductions for that measurement period. The adjustment amount will be calculated under section FG 8B, using an average cost-of-funds interest rate based on the total interest expense of the NZ banking group divided by average quarterly interest-bearing debt for the group. Issue: Clash between accounting and tax concepts Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association, 23 – Russell McVeagh) New Zealand Bankers’ Association (NZBA) and Russell McVeagh submit that there is a clash of tax and accounting concepts in FG 8B(3) and FG 8B(4). Russell McVeagh submits that the “group funding debt” should be calculated only by reference to interest-bearing debt for tax purposes, not accounting purposes. FG 8B(3) sets out the calculation for determining the “group funding debt”. FID is included in this calculation of group funding debt. Russell McVeagh submits that FID should not refer to financial arrangements for which the “consolidated financial statements” of the group would show a deduction, because this would omit instruments which are treated as debt for tax purposes, but equity for accounting purposes. NZBA argues that some hybrid instruments will give rise to a tax deduction but the instrument will not be classified as interest-bearing debt under GAAP. They will therefore fall outside SFI which is also included in the calculation of group funding debt. Although such instruments are presumably intended to fall within FID, technically they do not because the requirement that consolidated financial statements show a deduction is not satisfied. This is because payments on the instrument will be shown as movements in equity on the statement. NZBA and Russell McVeagh note that the definition of interest for the purposes of calculating interest expense only picks up expenditure that is classified as interest under GAAP. They submit that interest should be interest expenditure for tax purposes and not interest expenditure under GAAP. NZBA submits that the definitions should also exclude instruments that are classified as debt for accounting purposes but as equity for tax purposes, where no tax deduction has been taken. 21 Comment The difficulty with the definitions of group funding debt and interest derived from tax definitions is that the NZ banking group is a fictional group, so that no tax consolidation of this group occurs. It is therefore difficult to isolate the debt and interest as defined for tax purposes of this fictional group, particularly excluding eliminations on consolidation. Notwithstanding this, officials agree that clarification is required and that the legislation should be amended to clarify that taxpayers can adjust the group funding debt to take into account of amounts that are considered debt for tax purposes and not accounting. Furthermore the interest amount should take account of the differences between tax concepts and GAAP concepts. That is, if an amount is included as debt for the purposes of the group funding debt definition, the interest associated with that debt should be included as interest for the purposes of these new rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 22 MINOR DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Drafting issues raised by NZBA Submission (18 – New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Paragraph (c) of the definition of EQV in section FG 8G(1) refers to the provision of funds by a “parent”. The term is not defined for the purposes of FG 8G. Paragraph (c) also refers to “permanent establishment”, instead of “fixed establishment” used elsewhere in the bill. Comment Both drafting issues should be clarified. The term “parent” should be defined for the purposes of FG 8G. Paragraph (c) should refer to fixed establishment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting issues raised by Russell McVeagh Submission (23 – Russell McVeagh) The words “in New Zealand” should be inserted between “resident” and “is a potential member” in FG 8C(3). The definition of “group quarter day” in OB 1 should refer to FG 8B(6) rather than FG 8B(5). Comment Both drafting corrections should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 23 Issue: Use of “contribute to” Submission (23 – Russell McVeagh) The words “contribute to the value of item EQV” which are used in items “UPB” and “REV” of section FG 8G(1) are too vague. The words should be replaced by “included in calculating the value of item EQV”. The words “contribute to SFI” are similarly vague. The words should be replaced by “are included in item SFI”. Comment This is a deliberate drafting choice. We believe the change suggested does not make the intended meaning any clearer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 25 Changes to the tax depreciation rules 26 27 OVERVIEW The bill introduces a number of technical changes to tax depreciation rules. The changes were outlined in an officials’ issues paper released in July 2004, Repairs and maintenance to the tax depreciation rules, and are intended to reduce compliance costs by clarifying and improving the application of various depreciation provisions. The changes are intended to: • better align the depreciation treatment of patents with useful life by allowing a depreciation “catch up”, when the patent is granted, for the period the patent was pending; • improve the operation of the special tax depreciation rules; • add plant variety rights and the right to use plant variety rights to the list of depreciable intangible property; and • allow deductibility for losses on buildings where a building is destroyed or rendered useless (irreparably damaged) as the result of a “qualifying event”. Sixteen submissions were received on the tax depreciation changes. While submissions were broadly supportive of the changes in the bill, they considered that some did not go far enough. In particular, in relation to the amendment to allow deductions for losses on buildings affected by a “qualifying event”, submissions commented that a deduction should be allowed for all losses on buildings. Also, in relation to the changes to the tax treatment of patents, submissions commented that a better treatment would be to allow depreciation to commence when a patent application was lodged (rather than waiting until the patent is granted and allowing a depreciation “catch up”). 28 PATENTS Issue: Commencement date of depreciation Submission (1W – Fisher & Paykel Appliances, 2W – Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, 9W – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys, 13W – Industrial Research Limited, 17W – Ernst & Young, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Costs relating to a patent application should be depreciated from the time the patent application (with a complete specification) is lodged – the date from which legal effect will be given if the patent is granted. Comment Submissions have commented that the proposed changes to the tax treatment of patents, in clause 21 of the bill, have no regard to the date from which patent protection actually applies and the time at which the underlying invention is used or is available for use. When a patent is granted, protection is applied retrospectively from the date the patent application was lodged (the legal life of a patent is 20 years). The changes in the bill allow for this to be better reflected in the tax treatment by providing a deduction for depreciation for the period a patent is pending as a “catch up” when the patent is granted. Submissions have argued that the better tax treatment is to allow depreciation from the date a patent application is lodged, instead of waiting until a patent is granted to recognise an asset (and then “catching up” depreciation). They consider that an asset arises at the date a complete patent application is lodged as, in the case of competing patents, it is the application date that determines priority and therefore the validity of a patent. The application first filed has priority legally and enables its owner to both generate revenue from commercialisation of the invention as well as prevent others from operating in the same field. Submissions also argue that, for financial reporting purposes, an asset is realised when an application is lodged. Submissions make useful points in relation to the validity of a patent application as an asset. In particular, comment that an invention is typically only commercialised when a patent application is lodged. If an invention were to be disclosed prior to an application for a patent, a patent would not be able to be sought in respect of it as the secrecy provisions of the Patents Act 1953 would no longer be met. This would leave it open for competitors to also extract value from the invention. Also the date of filing an application in New Zealand is important as it has implications for priority given to applications filed offshore (which is where the majority of costs are incurred). 29 In light of these comments, officials consider that some economic benefits do arise when a patent application is lodged even though the full benefits may not arise until the application is subsequently granted. And while technically legal protection does not exist until a patent is granted, the unique nature of this type of intellectual property (the back-dating of legal life once the patent is granted) requires a different approach to be undertaken. We therefore agree with submissions and recommend that depreciation be allowed from the date a patent application is lodged. The date a patent application is lodged should be the date an application with a complete specification (of the invention being patented) is lodged. The alternative is to allow depreciation from the date an application is lodged with a provisional specification (a complete specification is required to be filed within 12 to 15 months of a provisional specification). However, a patent’s legal life is only retrospective to the date a complete specification has been lodged and we therefore consider this to be the appropriate benchmark for commencing depreciation. We recommend that the change to allow depreciation to commence when a patent application with a complete specification is lodged should apply to such applications that are filed on or after 1 April 2005. This is different from the application date currently in the bill (in respect of the provisions which would allow a depreciation “catch up”), which applies in respect of patents granted in the 2005-06 and later income years (applications for which were filed prior to 1 April 2005). Officials do not consider that the change proposed in response to submissions would be sensible in relation to applications that have been made prior to the 2005-06 income year. We do however recognise that moving to this new treatment (from what is currently in the bill) will disadvantage those taxpayers who would have been entitled to a depreciation “catch up” (under the provisions currently in the bill) for patent applications lodged prior to 1 April 2005 that are granted in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years. To maintain equity across taxpayers, officials consider that the provisions currently in the bill (principally clause 21) should be retained as a transitional measure for taxpayers who have lodged patent applications prior to 1 April 2005 which were granted in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year. It is our view that if taxpayers are able to commence depreciation in respect of patent costs from the date an application with a complete specification is lodged, then this is recognition that to all intents and purposes some of the benefits of patent protection arise (for example, the ability to commercialise), albeit indirectly. If a “patent” is effectively deemed to arise for tax depreciation purposes, we consider that a patent application should also be deemed to be a patent for the purposes of other provisions in the Income Tax Act. This would include the provision which requires any gains on the sale of patents to be returned as gross income (under section CB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004). Under this change any gains on the sale of a patent application would become taxable. 30 While officials consider that treating a patent application as a patent, for the purposes of section CB 26 is the correct result if the patent application is deemed, for depreciation purposes, to be a patent, we recognise that the bill as introduced did not contain a provision to tax any gains on the sale of a patent application. Consequently, it would be unfair to apply such a provision to taxpayers who, in the interim, have filed for a patent without the knowledge that any sale of the application will give rise to a taxable event. We therefore consider that the proposed change to deem a patent application to be a patent for the purposes of section CB 26 should only apply in relation to patent applications that are lodged on or after the date of Royal assent. These changes should apply in respect of applications with provisional specifications (and not complete specifications) lodged on or after the date of Royal assent. Recommendation That depreciation be allowed from the date a patent application with a complete specification is lodged. This change should apply in respect of patent applications that are lodged on or after 1 April 2005. The provisions currently in the bill (clause 21), that allow a depreciation “catch-up”, should apply to patent applications that were lodged prior to 1 April 2005 but are granted in the 2005-06 and subsequent years. A patent application should be deemed a “patent” for tax purposes (with any gains on sale being taxable, as per the case with patents at present). This change should apply in respect of patent applications with provisional specifications that are lodged on or after the date of Royal assent. Issue: Useful life of patents Submission (1W – Fisher & Paykel Appliances, 2W – Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, 9 – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys, 13W – Industrial Research Limited) Taxpayers should be able to depreciate patents over a timeframe that more accurately reflects the economic reality of the underlying invention. Options include depreciation over seven or 10 years, or more reliance being placed on taxpayers’ financial reporting policies. Comment Submissions have commented that a 20-year straight-line basis for depreciating patent costs bears little resemblance to economic reality, with the tax treatment having a penal impact. Most comment that if there is significant economic value to be derived for a high-technology invention, it is likely to be extracted in its early years in the market before alternatives are offered by the competition or the technology itself is superseded. Consequently, few patents extend beyond 10 years in the current environment of fast-moving technology development and adoption. 31 Suggestions to better align the tax depreciation treatment of patents with commercial realities include: a depreciation rate based on a 10 or seven-year life; a 10% diminishing value rate; closer alignment with financial reporting policy; or a special tax depreciation rate for patents as an asset class (in respect of a taxpayer’s portfolio of patents and patent applications). This latter proposal has been considered as part of a submission on the special tax depreciation rate rules. The issue that arises is determining what an appropriate economic life for patents, as an asset class is, given that no single patent is likely to be similar to another. For example, it may well be that some mechanical patents become obsolete prior to expiry of legal life while others like pharmaceutical patents may be held for close to legal life. Different classes of mechanical and pharmaceutical patents may also have varying economic lives. Also, the costs of holding a patent are unlikely to be significant (just renewal fees) which may mean that taxpayers are more readily able to “carry” patents, even though they are not being used in the income earning process (for example, as a defensive ploy to prevent a competitor from extracting rents from a patented technology, product or process). A seven or ten-year economic life, as suggested in submissions is therefore no less arbitrary than the current estimated useful life, which is based on legal life for patents. Officials recognise that the legal life of a patent is unlikely to be an accurate reflection of true economic life in all instances, but then depreciation is not meant to be a perfect reflection of how assets actually depreciate. Rather it is an approximation, and as with any approximation, there will be some assets in the class that depreciate faster and others that depreciate slower than the average. In the case of a patent, legal life is arguably one of the better proxies available as it provides a cap on the life of a patent. Also, where a patent lapses (for example, the patent is not renewed) the tax rules allow the remaining book value to be written-off. We therefore do not consider that the approach of depreciating patents over their legal life should be changed. Officials have serious concerns about allowing the use of financial reporting policy to derive tax depreciation rates because under the new International Financial Reporting Standards, patents will be recognised on a cost/valuation basis (as opposed to a depreciated value basis). Given the uncertainties associated with valuation for accounting, it would not be appropriate to allow tax depreciation to follow financial reporting policy. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 32 Issue: Transitional issues Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) Subject to the earlier submission on when depreciation in respect of a patent should commence, clauses 20 and 21 of the bill should be retained as transitional provisions where a patent application has been lodged before the start of the 2005-06 income year, but a patent is not granted until the 2005-06 or a later income year. Comment The submission comments that the provisions currently in the bill, which allow for a “catch-up” of depreciation for the period a patent is pending, should be retained for applications that were lodged prior to the 2005-06 income year (and are not granted until that or a later income year). The submission suggests that retention of clauses 20 and 21 for patent applications lodged prior to the 2005-06 income year might be appropriate in the interests of achieving taxpayer equity. Officials have previously agreed that depreciation in respect of patent costs should commence from the date a patent application with a complete specification is lodged, with this change applying to patents lodged on or after 1 April 2005. We also recommended that clause 21 of the bill should be retained to accommodate taxpayers who have filed a patent application prior to 1 April 2005. Recommendation Clause 21 of the bill should be retained in respect of patent applications that are granted in the 2005-06 or a subsequent income year that were lodged prior to 1 April 2005. Issue: Patents granted in other jurisdictions Submission (9 – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys, 13W – Industrial Research Limited, 17W – Ernst & Young, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed changes should also cover a patent application accompanied by a complete specification that is lodged with the appropriate intellectual property office in a foreign jurisdiction. 33 Comment Submissions comment that the intent of the changes should be that they apply to all patent applications lodged by New Zealand tax residents in all international jurisdictions, not just New Zealand. They comment that New Zealand will not be the only country in which patent applications are made where any sort of export or overseas commercialisation or use arising from the underlying invention is contemplated. Some argue that patents pertaining to New Zealand are likely to form just a small percentage of those held, both in number and expense, and a taxpayer may elect to lodge a patent in an overseas jurisdiction(s) and not in New Zealand due to the nature of, and likely market for, the underlying invention. Officials agree that the proposed amendments should apply to all patents (and patent applications), not just those lodged with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted Issue: When ownership of patent applications change Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) In Clause 21, the proposed description of the required adjustment (when a patent is granted to a person who did not lodge the complete patent application) is unclear and should be clarified. Comment The submission comments that the use of the word “affected” in clause 21 does not describe adequately the adjustment required in circumstances where a patent is granted to a person other than the person who lodged the patent application. Officials consider that the purpose of this clause is to reduce the deduction available as a depreciation “catch-up” in the first year a patent is granted, to reflect the period the patent application was held by a person who is not the person to whom the patent was granted. We agree that there is potential for ambiguity with the current wording and consider that an amendment to clarify clause 21 should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 34 Issue: Patent renewal fees Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) The legislation should state clearly that any patent renewal fees paid during the legal life of a patent are of a revenue nature and deductible in the year incurred. Comment The submission contends that a draft interpretation statement (IS2215) on the tax treatment of patents, issued by Inland Revenue, which takes the position that patent renewal fees (payable at the end of the 4th, 7th, 10th and 13th year of a patent) should be capitalised and depreciated is incorrect. The submission considers that such fees are not capital in nature as they do not effect the acquisition of any capital asset or provide an enduring benefit. Instead they protect the holder from losing the rights already created through the patent application process. The submission comments that this plus their recurrent nature present strong arguments for treating such fees as expenditure of a deductible, revenue nature. We consider that this issue is outside the scope of the bill and should be dealt with as part of the formal process for providing feedback on the draft interpretation statement. The interpretation statement outlines the Commissioner’s view that patent renewal fees relate to the ownership of the patent and are therefore capital in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that such expenditure is not incurred to maintain a patent, in the sense of keeping it up-to-date, and nor are they simply administrative fees. The process for considering submissions on the interpretation statement is currently under way. The process will involve the re-issue of the exposure draft after feedback from the current consultation round has been considered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting Submission (9 – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys) In clause 21(1)(a), the words “complete application” should be changed to “patent application accompanied by a complete specification”. 35 Comment The submission comments that there is no such thing as a complete application. The correct term is a “patent application accompanied by a complete specification”. Officials agree with the recommendation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Costs associated with obtaining a design registration Submission (9 – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys) Costs associated with obtaining a design registration should be depreciable intangible property under Schedule 17 of the Income Tax Act. Comment The submission comments that design registrations (under the Designs Act 1953) should be depreciable intangible property as the process for obtaining a design registration and the fixed lifetime protection means that design registrations are more similar in nature to patents and plant variety rights than other types of intellectual property. It also comments that such a change should encompass design registrations in all jurisdictions, not just New Zealand. The submission raises a number of important issues in relation to the tax treatment of registered designs, which officials need more time to consider. We therefore consider this issue to be outside the scope of the current bill. However, we intend to consider the implications of including registered designs as depreciable intangible property as part of the next phase of the tax depreciation review. Recommendation That the submission be declined in relation to the current bill, but note that officials intend to consider this issue as part of the next phase of the tax depreciation review. 36 Issue: Commencement date for intellectual property rights generically Submission (9 – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys) Costs relating to all fixed-term intellectual property rights – patents, registered designs, utility models and plant variety rights in New Zealand and overseas – should become depreciable as the costs are incurred (over the estimated useful life of the relevant intellectual property right). Comment The submission comments that the rationale for allowing depreciation for patents from the date of application (as opposed to the date of grant) applies equally in the case of other types of intellectual property. The submission attempts to deal with the issue of the tax treatment of intellectual property generally by standardising their treatment. However, different types of intellectual property have different features (for example, legal life, the type of protection offered or the commencement of that protection). The tax treatment, to an extent, attempts where possible to reflect these different features. While a simple approach to depreciating intellectual property would be desirable, we consider that it would be very difficult to have a standard treatment for the different variants of intellectual property available. Consequently, this is why there is recognition in the bill that patents, for example, need different depreciation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 PLANT VARIETY RIGHTS Issue: Plant variety rights granted in other jurisdictions Submission (4W – Zespri International Limited, 9 – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys, 17W – Ernst & Young) The proposed change to include plant variety rights (and the right to use plant variety rights) as depreciable intangible property should also apply in respect of plant variety rights secured offshore and licensing fees incurred to maintain plant variety rights offshore. Comment Submissions have commented that in the absence of wording changes to the proposed amendment, a New Zealand taxpayer who incurs expenditure to preserve a plant variety in an offshore jurisdiction in order to derive taxable income in New Zealand, would not be able to claim this expenditure for tax purposes. Submissions have also noted that the costs of obtaining protection offshore would normally greatly exceed the costs associated with New Zealand rights and it is therefore anomalous to restrict depreciation deductions solely to plant variety rights registered under the New Zealand legislation. Officials agree that plant variety rights granted offshore (as well as the right to use plant variety rights secured offshore) should be included within the scope of the proposed change. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Deductibility for plant variety development costs Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) Specific provisions should be included in the Act to ensure plant variety development costs can be deducted or depreciated in the same manner as plant variety rights 38 Comment The submission comments that, as well as direct plant variety rights registration costs, there can also be very substantial costs incurred over a number of years in developing the underlying plant varieties (after they have been identified as new varieties to ensure consistency of standards and quality, particularly where crops and produce are involved). The submission contends that such costs may not be deductible under the scientific research or development provisions in the Income Tax Act and therefore may be non-deductible/non-depreciable expenditure. Costs associated with developing plant varieties are separate from the cost of obtaining protection over the relevant plant variety. They should not be included in the cost of obtaining plant variety rights. To the extent that further development costs need to be incurred in developing a plant variety, for example for commercialisation, these costs should be treated separately. These costs may, as suggested in the submission, currently be non-deductible under current rules. Officials need to work through the costs that are involved and the tax treatment of these costs at present in more detail. Therefore, we do not consider that we are in a position to recommend a change as part of the current bill. We intend to consider this issue as part of the next phase of the tax depreciation review. Recommendation That the submission be declined in relation to the current bill, but note that officials intend to consider this issue as part of the next phase of the tax depreciation review. Issue: Application date of the changes Submission (4W – Zespri International Limited) The proposed change should include some type of grandfathering clause to allow for amortisation of all existing plant variety rights ownership costs or, in the case of the right to use plant variety rights, the costs of acquiring those rights. Comment The submission comments that it seems inequitable to only apply the legislative amendment to acquisitions of plant variety rights occurring either in or post the 2005-06 income year. The submission argues it would be more equitable to include some type of grandfathering clause to allow amortisation of all existing plant variety rights ownership costs or the costs of acquiring those rights. 39 The changes to allow depreciation in respect of plant variety rights (and the right to use plant variety rights) are intended to be prospective and apply to new grants/acquisitions of plant variety rights. Allowing plant variety rights obtained prior to the 2005-06 income year to be depreciated would provide an economic gain to taxpayers who undertook this expenditure with the knowledge that it was not depreciable at the time. Officials therefore do not agree that allowing existing plant variety rights to be depreciated would be equitable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of clauses 20 and 21 to plant variety rights Submission (9 – New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys) The proposed change to allow depreciation in respect of the period a patent is pending to be claimed along with the first depreciation deduction (in clauses 20 and 21 of the bill), should be also allowed in respect of plant variety rights. Comment Subject to earlier comments on when depreciation should commence for intellectual property, the submission argues that alternatively, the proposed amendments to allow a “catch-up” of depreciation for patents should be extended to also apply to plant variety rights. The submission contends that plant variety rights involve long periods from initial submission (of the application) to grant, as there is a requirement for test trials involving the growing of plants to establish that the variety is unique, stable, distinct and homogeneous. Our understanding is that in New Zealand, on lodgement of an application for plant variety rights, provisional protection over the plant variety applies. This allows the taxpayer who developed the plant variety to undertake commercialisation with the knowledge that any infringements during this provisional protection phase are able to be actioned as and when they arise. This is distinct to the process for patents, which allows infringements during the period a patent is pending to be actioned only once the patent is granted. In the case of plant variety rights, the rights are deemed to exist until the application is granted. If an application is subsequently not granted, the rights (during the provisional phase) are deemed never to have existed. This in itself creates some complexity over when depreciation should commence in respect of plant variety rights. The Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 also deems a plant variety to be new (and hence able to be registered) if a taxpayer has not sold that plant variety in New Zealand for a period of more than 12 months (and a longer period offshore). This contrasts with the treatment of patents where any disclosure of an invention prior to the filing of a patent application results in the loss of the ability to patent that invention. 40 Given these considerations, the submission argues that the best treatment is for plant variety rights (and, in effect, all intellectual property) to be depreciated from the time the relevant costs are incurred. In response to an earlier submission on this point in relation to patents, it was agreed that there is a case for allowing depreciation to commence from the date a complete specification is lodged. However, we do not consider that a similar treatment (depreciation from the date of application) should apply to plant variety rights. Officials’ reasoning for applying depreciation in respect of plant variety rights from the date of grant is on the basis that legal protection applies from this date. Given this, it is not possible to say on the date of application when plant variety rights, if granted, will expire. This is because the application phase, even though provisional protection applies, is not counted towards the ultimate legal life of 20 or 23 years (unlike a patent). This makes it difficult to consider allowing costs incurred in obtaining plant variety rights to be depreciated from the date an application for such rights is made because the period over which depreciation should be allowed is uncertain. In our view, allowing a depreciation “catch up” for plant variety rights, when these rights are granted, has greater merit. However, the concept of a depreciation “catch up” would be different from that of patents for the reasons outlined above. Under such an approach for plant variety rights, estimated useful life would be legal life (20 or 23 years depending on the plant variety) plus the time taken for the application to be granted (the provisional protection phase). A deduction for depreciation relating to the provisional protection phase would then be allowed in the year of grant (together with the depreciation deduction for that year). For example, assume an application for plant variety rights takes five years to be granted. Once granted, legal life will be 20 years. For tax purposes, the estimated useful life would be legal life plus the five years that the application was pending. In the year of grant a deduction equivalent to 5/25 th of the costs incurred would be allowed (for the period the application was pending) as well as 1/25 th relating to the depreciation in the year of grant. In each subsequent year, a depreciation deduction equivalent to 1/25 th of the costs would be allowed. Recommendation That the submission recommending applying the depreciation “catch up” provisions to plant variety rights be accepted, subject to officials’ comments on how a depreciation “catch up” should work for plant variety rights. 41 LOSSES ON DESTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS Issue: Losses on disposal of buildings should be wider Submission (5W – Christchurch City Holdings Limited, 10 – Port Companies of New Zealand, 15W – Business New Zealand, 20W – Contact Energy Limited, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 27W – Alliance Group Limited, 28W – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 32W – The Warehouse Limited) All losses on the disposal of a building should be tax deductible. To mitigate any risk to the tax base, a loss should be allowed where a taxpayer originally built the building and has owned since that time; or a taxpayer has owned the building for a minimum period. Targeted anti-avoidance provisions should be used to address any specific concerns. Comment The provisions in this bill focus on a quite narrow issue, where buildings have been irreparably damaged by an event outside the control of the taxpayer. These submissions raise much wider concerns. We acknowledge that in some cases, such as Port Companies, the concerns seem valid. Submissions argue that all losses on disposal of a building (including a loss on sale) should be deductible. For example, submissions argue that in some sectors of the economy buildings become obsolete from a technological or marketing perspective sooner than they would from a purely functional perspective. Submissions also argue that losses are allowed in relation to other depreciable property and that buildings should be treated in an identical manner. Some contend that the current policy creates a tax bias in favour of repairing/reconfiguring/upgrading existing buildings rather than demolition and construction of new buildings, an outcome which may not be socially or economically desirable. They further state that if the submission above is not accepted, at a minimum, all losses on the destruction of a building (whether or not there is a “qualifying event”) should be deductible. We agree that there is a case to consider for allowing a general deduction for losses from the sale or disposal of buildings. However, there are two important balancing considerations: • Although buildings may usually be expected to depreciate over time, rates of depreciation are typically low. The market value of buildings is subject to fluctuations and, as a consequence, the value of buildings can be variable. If gains are not taxed when buildings appreciate, there is an argument for not allowing deductions for losses on sale, in order to prevent over-investment in buildings. Although similar issues can arise for other assets, this is likely to be a particularly important problem for buildings because of their low depreciation rates and the volatility of estimates of the value of buildings. 42 • There is also a concern that the value of land improvements (including buildings) is normally calculated as the difference between the overall value of a property and unimproved value of the land. There are tax integrity issues when values are apportioned (between the land and improvements) for tax reasons, rather than their actual value. This issue has the potential to create a significant tax avoidance problem and is exacerbated by the fact that buildings move in and out of the tax base. The submissions acknowledge what they consider officials’ key concern to be – the ability to manipulate the tax rules in relation to claiming deductions on losses on buildings. They make a number of suggestions on how to manage this concern. Submissions identify a number of measures that could be implemented to address the issue of taxpayers attributing a substantial portion of the value of a property to the building to create an artificial loss, including: • allowing a deduction for losses on buildings where the building is owned by the taxpayer who originally constructed the building; or where a taxpayer has owned the building for a minimum period (5 or 10 years); or • requiring taxpayers to satisfy the Commissioner of the apportionment methodology used (between land and buildings) used to value buildings; • specific anti-avoidance provisions to address any mischief that arises. Officials have considered the suggestions for less comprehensive changes to the tax treatment of buildings, to allow losses in certain circumstances. The anti-avoidance measures raised in submissions could potentially reduce the risk of valuation manipulation. But the suggestions do not address our concern that allowing more general losses on buildings may create a tax-driven investment bias. In addition, the suggestions are not without problems. We would be concerned that lock-in effects may occur if we allow losses for the demolition of a building and not on its sale. In these circumstances a taxpayer would have an incentive to hold a building until it was scrapped rather than selling the building shortly before scrapping. This would also be true if a taxpayer who demolished a building were able to claim deductions in the same way as could be claimed if a building were not in use. On the other hand, the status quo does have a very unattractive feature of providing incentives for taxpayers to refrain from demolishing a building merely because this forgoes a stream of depreciation deductions. And it may be true that our general concerns about allowing losses on buildings do not necessarily apply to all taxpayers all of the time – for example, port companies who are not selling port land and buildings. The above issues demonstrate the difficulty of drawing sensible borderlines in this area. Officials would like to consider some generic policy solution rather than attempting a quick fix in this area. 43 Submissions have also argued that the definition in the bill relating to instances where a loss is allowed – a “qualifying event” –will create unnecessary disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. For example: whether the qualifying event was of such a magnitude that it resulted in or brought about the destruction of a taxpayer’s building; or whether the destruction or damage was caused by the action or inaction of the taxpayer or a related party. Decisions about whether to allow losses on buildings irreparably damaged as the result of a qualifying event or taxpayer actions will be fact-specific. As such there is the potential for disputes between taxpayers and the department concerning the facts in each case. To mitigate some of these risks, the department will provide guidance and examples in the Tax Information Bulletin on the policy intent and how Inland Revenue will apply the proposed law. However, some cases will end up in court and it will be the court’s role to determine questions of fact. The changes proposed in the bill are aimed primarily at extending the provisions in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act relating to disaster relief, to take account of more generic events that may cause a taxpayer’s building to be destroyed. Officials consider that the issue of general deductibility of losses on buildings should be considered as part of the ongoing depreciation review. Recommendation That the submissions be declined in relation to the current bill, but note that officials are considering the issue of tax depreciation for buildings more widely as part of the ongoing tax depreciation review. Issue: Dredging costs Submission (10 – Port Companies of New Zealand) The Committee asked officials to report on whether dredging costs are currently depreciable, following the submission by the port companies of New Zealand. Comment The short answer is that dredging costs are not currently depreciable. The reason is that as long as capital dredging is maintained – through regular maintenance dredging – it is believed unlikely that the dredged area will be subject to a decline in value. Economic theory suggests that tax depreciation rates should mirror how an asset declines in value. This avoids a situation whereby the tax depreciation rates artificially encourage or discourage investment in particular types of assets. This is our starting point. 44 We have considered whether capital dredging might reasonably be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while it is in use or available for use. Capital dredging is when dredging is undertaken for the first time to remove some of the seabed in order to deepen a channel or harbour. Dredging to maintain this depth is akin to repairs and maintenance. We considered capital dredging in the following circumstances: • When capital dredging is maintained (and a deduction is allowed for these repairs and maintenance): It is a reasonable expectation that the capital value of the dredging will not change with maintenance. The correct result is not to allow depreciation deductions for capital dredging. • When capital dredging is subject to deferred maintenance (and the harbour depth is not regularly maintained): It can be reasonably expected that its capital value will decline during the period of deferred maintenance, but that its value would be restored by any subsequent dredging. It is also likely that the taxpayer would argue that such dredging was akin to repairs and maintenance. Again, the correct result is not to allow depreciation deductions for capital dredging. • When capital dredging is abandoned or sold: In principle, a deduction for any loss realised on the capital value of the dredging costs ought to be allowed. However, there may be a number of practical and avoidance considerations that lead to a different final policy response. For example, how to define abandonment. Recommendation Under current rules, losses from the abandonment of capital dredging costs would not be allowed. This is similar to other “black hole” expenditure and will be considered as part of the ongoing depreciation review. Issue: Losses when a building is no longer used/required to be demolished as the result of a qualifying event Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of a “qualifying event” to be applied in determining whether a person is entitled to deduct a loss on a building needs to be amended to ensure that it applies also where a person destroys a building already damaged (or partially destroyed) by an event outside their control. Guidance should also be provided to taxpayers where an asset is partially damaged, but not destroyed, to enable taxpayers to determine whether in such a situation the asset can be considered to have been rendered useless. Section EE 32 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to allow a deductible loss to be claimed in respect of a building owned but no longer used as a result of a “qualifying event”. 45 Comment The submission comments that, on occasion, a taxpayer may need to demolish a building after it has been damaged by a “qualifying event” (for example, arson, a natural event or accident). It argues that the definition of “qualifying event” should be drafted so that in such circumstances a taxpayer is entitled to claim a loss on disposal even though the actual destruction is caused by their own action. Officials consider that this submission raises some fundamental questions about when a deduction is allowed for losses on buildings under the proposed definition of “qualifying event”. The policy intent of this change is for a loss to be allowed where an unexpected event results in a taxpayer’s building being irreparably damaged and rendered useless, when the damage is not caused by the actions of the person or their failure to act (or the actions or inaction of the taxpayer’s agents). The unexpected event could be a natural disaster such as an earthquake, or an event like a fire. It does not include changes to regulation (for example, health and safety) that make a building obsolete and which require it to be knocked down. The event must have caused damage to the building. What is meant by “irreparably damaged” and “rendered useless” is that the building has no continuing economic value for the taxpayer. It should be irrelevant whether the building is still standing and therefore needs to be demolished by the taxpayer or whether the taxpayer chooses not to demolish the building (but is no longer able to use it). A deduction for the loss should arise. We consider that the current definition of “qualifying event” (in clause 60 of the bill) and the amendments to section EE 41(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 (in clause 24) are deficient in this regard and should be amended. Section EE 32 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should also be amended to mirror the loss on disposal provisions. Officials will ensure that the Tax Information Bulletin announcing the changes (once they are enacted) will contain general examples of what constitutes a building being irreparably damaged and rendered useless as the result of a qualifying event. Recommendation That the definition of “qualifying event” in clause 60 of the bill be amended so that it means an unexpected event that results in a taxpayer’s building being irreparable damaged and rendered useless, where the damage is not caused by the actions (or inaction) of the taxpayer and their agents. Amendments will also be needed to section EE 41(2) and EE 32. 46 Issue: Application date of changes Submission (5W – Christchurch City Holdings Limited, 10 – Port Companies of New Zealand, 28W – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 32W – The Warehouse Limited) The changes should apply from the commencement of the 2004-05 income year (buildings destroyed on or after 1 April 2004) rather than the commencement of the 2005-06 income year. Comment Submissions have commented that there is no policy reason why a building that is destroyed by a “qualifying event” before 1 April 2005 is not tax deductible whereas a building destroyed post that date is tax deductible. The issue that arises is providing a bright line for taxpayers so that they know that events after a certain date qualify and others don’t. Submissions suggest that the line should be drawn earlier so that more events qualify. This change is meant to be prospective. Officials do not consider there to be any exact science to picking the date for applying a change to the tax rules. 1 April 2005 is the start of the 2005-06 income year for most taxpayers and was considered the most appropriate date, given the considerations above, to apply this change from. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “qualifying event” Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The insertion of a new definition of a “qualifying event” in the Income Tax Act 2004 may result in confusion. The provisions should state clearly the purposes for which the definition is to apply. Comment The submission comments that the bill inserts a new definition of “qualifying event” and this may cause confusion as the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 also inserted a definition of “qualifying event”. 47 The definition of “qualifying event” in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 is limited to destruction caused by the February and July 2004 storms. The definition inserted by the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 also applies more widely in relation to the Income Tax Act (for example, it also applies to section MB 3B of the Income Tax Act 2004 which deals with the provisional tax rules). The definition of “qualifying event” in the current bill is designed to widen the definition that was inserted by the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, for the purposes of the tax depreciation rules. Ideally, the current change would have amended the definition as inserted by the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. However, when the current bill was being introduced, the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 had not yet received Royal assent. Consequently, this was the reason for the two definitions of “qualifying event” identified in the submission. We consider that the definition currently in the bill should extend the existing definition for “qualifying event” but only for the purposes of the tax depreciation rate rules (in section EE 41(2)). That is, the definition of “qualifying event” inserted by the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 should remain for the purposes of other provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 (for example, section MB 3B). Recommendation That the definition currently in the bill should extend the definition for “qualifying event” that already exists, but only for the purposes of the tax depreciation rate rules (in section EE 41(2)). Issue: Losses on sale of a temporary building Submission (22 – KPMG) The loss on sale of a temporary building should be able to be spread back from the year of sale. Comment The submission comments that there may be instances where buildings have been constructed for specific purposes, and at the end of the life of the project for which the building was constructed (or acquired) the building is demolished. While a deduction on disposal of a temporary building is available, there is no income earning process against which to offset the deduction. This is analogous to the restoration cost issue for taxpayers with environmental expenditure. 48 The New Zealand tax rules do not allow carry-back of tax losses to past periods to offset against taxable income in those periods. This is for a variety of reasons, including the uncertainty that such rules would create for past tax assessments (including “use-of-money interest” issues) and the associated uncertainty for government revenue flows. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 49 SPECIAL TAX DEPRECIATION RATES Issue: Special tax depreciation rates for classes of depreciable property Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) The legislation should allow the Commissioner to set special or provisional tax depreciation rates for classes of depreciable property, not only for single items of depreciable property. Comment While welcoming the proposals to increase the Commissioner’s flexibility in setting special tax depreciation rates, the submission comments that it would be more helpful for taxpayers if they were able to apply for special tax depreciation rates on a class of asset basis rather than on an item-by-item basis. The example provided is where taxpayers have a portfolio of patents and/or patent applications, and the potential cost of having to make individual special tax depreciation rate applications could be significant. Officials do not support allowing the Commissioner to provide special tax depreciation rates in respect of a class of depreciable assets. The special tax depreciation rules are designed to deal with case-specific instances where an individual asset is expected to depreciate in a manner that is different to that envisaged when a general depreciation rate for that asset was set. The idea behind the rules is to allow taxpayers the ability to apply for a special rate where there are, for example, special circumstances that will impinge upon the use of the particular asset at some future date. Officials consider that this is different to an instance where a taxpayer may have a set of identical assets (for example, five printing presses) and requires a special tax depreciation rate to cover the set. Each printing press is expected to be subject to the same special circumstances. Currently, the legislation would seem to require taxpayers to file a special rate application for each individual asset in the set. This is in spite of the fact that the different applications would typically be considered together (and the same special rate issued for each asset if the applications were successful). We consider that the legislation should be amended to ensure that the Commissioner can grant a special tax depreciation rate for a set of identical assets (without requiring a separate application for each asset in the set). The class of asset (or a “pool”) approach cannot, however, be readily applied in the case of special tax depreciation rates for an asset class where different assets in the class may have different factors that will affect how they depreciate. Issuing a special tax depreciation rate for a portfolio of intellectual property (as opposed to on an item- by-item basis) would be especially problematic as it would involve determining an average rate for assets that are often difficult to value (and hence susceptible to manipulation) and for which economic lives may vary significantly (for example, for different types of patents). Therefore, as a general rule, officials do not consider that 50 the legislation should require the Commissioner to set a special tax depreciation rate for a pool of assets, such as a taxpayer’s portfolio of intellectual property. It should be noted however that provisional tax depreciation rates are allowed for classes of depreciable property. A taxpayer can apply for a provisional tax depreciation rate if there is no general rate for the particular asset or asset class (for example, where the asset is new). The key difference between a provisional and special tax depreciation rate is that in relation to the former, a general rate exists, but for a variety of reasons may not be applicable in the case of a particular taxpayer (and their use of a particular asset). In the case of the latter, no general rate exists so a new rate must be considered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, the special tax depreciation rate rules should be amended to allow taxpayers to apply for a special tax depreciation rate for a set of identical assets (without requiring a separate application for each asset in the set). Issue: Guidelines for issue of special tax depreciation rates Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) There need to be clear guidelines available on the special tax depreciation rate setting- process which set out the documentation and evidence required. Comment The submission comments that such guidelines would assist taxpayers and their advisors in determining whether or not it is appropriate to proceed with an application for a special tax depreciation rate. It argues that at present, it is difficult for taxpayers to assess the likelihood of success and as a result many taxpayers decide not to proceed because of uncertainty. It should be noted that Inland Revenue currently provides information in relation to applying for special tax depreciation rates – for example, on its website. Inland Revenue Adjudication and Rulings Field Liaison and Communication unit also fields enquiries on these applications. In relation to the proposed changes to these rules, the amendments in the bill are only the legislative side of the changes to the special tax depreciation rules. A number of administrative changes will also support the new legislation. It is the combination of the two that officials consider will allow the Commissioner greater flexibility in being able to consider special tax depreciation rate applications. Officials agree that some guidance in relation to the changes to the special tax depreciation rules are necessary and will release a Tax Information Bulletin on these changes once the legislation is enacted. 51 Recommendation A Tax Information Bulletin on these changes will be released once the legislation is enacted. Issue: The six-month deadline for issuing special tax depreciation rates Submission (17W – Ernst & Young, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Where the issue of a special tax depreciation rate determination is delayed beyond the initial six-month period there should be some remedy for affected taxpayers or, alternatively, a sanction of the Commissioner for breach of the limit. Comment Submissions recognise that it is not always practicable for the Commissioner to complete special tax depreciation rate determinations within the six-month period currently legislated for. However they express concerns about extending this period without providing protection to affected taxpayers. One submission argues that where the issue of a special tax depreciation rate is delayed beyond the initial six-month period, then there should be a remedy for taxpayers whose tax positions may be affected. Possible remedies could be an extension to their due date for filing a return; or an express provision to require the Commissioner to amend any assessments already made. The submission also argues that the legislation should allow the Commissioner to exercise his discretion in relation to a wide variety of matters that may be affected by the depreciation determinations. Another submission argues that an extension to the six-month limit be restricted to circumstances in which the taxpayer agrees specifically to the extension. Where the taxpayer does not agree to the extension and the six-month limit is breached, a sanction should be imposed on the Commissioner. The purpose of the proposed change is to provide greater certainty to both the Commissioner and the taxpayer involved where a special tax depreciation rate application is not able to be considered with the current six-month time limit. Currently, under the six-month time limit, the Commissioner must refuse a special tax depreciation rate application if he is unable to reach a view on the validity of the application within the prescribed timeframe. 52 Administratively, this would require taxpayers to re-file the application, at their expense, in terms of both time and money. In practice, the Commissioner considers applications outside this time-limit with the approval of taxpayers. However, there is uncertainty about the legislative validity of these determinations. The proposed change simply validates this practice in legislation. The change is not intended to provide greater flexibility to the Commissioner at the expense of the taxpayer. Special tax depreciation rate applications are becoming increasingly complex, both in terms of the variety of assets for which special rates are being sought and the factors which taxpayers consider will affect their useful life. This is expected to become further complicated with the addition of fixed-life intangible property (for example, patents and other intellectual property) to the category of assets for which a special rate may be sought. Equally, the Commissioner is bound by the time limit even though information necessary for processing the application may still be held by the taxpayer (and only known to them). The process of requesting and receiving this information can also add to the time taken to process an application. There is also the process of consulting with independent valuers for certain applications, which can add to the time taken. Consequently, it is likely the six-month time limit will be breached for certain applications. It is important to note that under the proposed change it will be at the discretion of the taxpayer to elect to extend this initial deadline. Inland Revenue will endeavour to meet the six-month deadline but the proposed change is a reflection of the fact that in future it may not be as easy to meet. We do not support requiring the Commissioner to extend return filing dates for taxpayers or to suffer a sanction if a special tax depreciation rate application cannot be set within six-months. This could impose unrealistic timeframes in relation to complex special tax depreciation rate applications. It could also create incentives for taxpayers to, for example, delay the provision of important information in relation to an application to extend the time available to file their returns. There is already scope for dealing with concerns around special tax depreciation rates issued beyond the six-month time limit, which impact on tax assessments. Officials consider that taxpayers whose tax assessments are affected by special tax depreciation rate applications that are pending, should make a request to the Commissioner, under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, for an amendment to those assessments once a special rate is granted. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but it be noted that mechanisms already exist for dealing with concerns around special tax depreciation rates that are issued outside the current six-month time limit, which affect past income tax assessments. 53 Issue: Estimated useful life under the special tax depreciation rate rules Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG) Estimated useful life should be able to be changed to reflect an asset’s remaining useful life. More flexibility could also be provided in the special tax depreciation rules to enable more options in relation to second-hand assets. Comment The submissions have commented that changes to the special tax depreciation rate rules should explicitly make it clear that estimated useful life should incorporate estimated useful life where economic life is shortened by a change in technology or regulation. Other submissions suggest that taxpayers are currently locked into depreciating second-hand assets over the estimated useful life of a new asset, and that the special tax depreciation rules should provide taxpayers with a mechanism to satisfy the Commissioner as to the appropriate treatment in relation to second-hand assets (for example, depreciation over remaining life). The treatment of second-hand assets is a difficult issue. Under current rules, the effective life of second-hand assets is treated as if these assets were new when a taxpayer acquires them. This is sometimes referred to as the “whole of life” approach. Suppose, for example, a taxpayer acquires an asset with an estimated useful life of 20 years, 12 years after it was used. The taxpayer is required to calculate depreciation based on the assumption that the asset has a future economic life of 20 years rather than eight. If a taxpayer acquires the 20-year asset and depreciates it on a diminishing value basis, the depreciation rate allowed is 9.5% before loading (or 11.4% after). If a subsequent purchaser, who acquires the asset second-hand after 12 years, were able to claim depreciation as though it had an economic life of eight years, this would boost the rate of depreciation to 22%. It would seem unattractive to provide incentives for taxpayers to sell and repurchase assets merely to claim higher depreciation rates. This suggests that allowing depreciation on a “whole of life” approach is attractive. Also, if all 20-year assets had an economic life of exactly 20 years, it would be arguable that a second-hand asset acquired after 12 years should attract depreciation deductions based on an expected future life of eight, not 20 years. However, in practice the economic lives of assets vary. If some assets which have an expected useful life of 20 years when new expire within 12 years, a 12-year-old second-hand asset will have an expected future life of more than eight years, but how much more is a matter on which it is difficult to generalise. 54 The New Zealand tax depreciation rules are a pragmatic response to the difficult issues outlined above. They may set depreciation rates which are too low for second- hand assets but it is difficult to find a more satisfactory general approach in the absence of fundamental changes. Special depreciation rates should be set on a basis which is consistent with the general depreciation rules. If the “whole of life” estimate of economic life is generally used for second-hand assets, then taxpayers should not be able to apply for higher special rates merely because an asset has aged. To allow this would be to encourage taxpayers to apply for special depreciation rates for any second-hand assets. There is, however, a separate issue. At times, some event that is outside the taxpayer’s control may mean that the asset’s useful life will be curtailed (and the asset will not be able to be salvaged). Examples include where the regulatory environment changes so an asset is no longer able to be used lawfully (for example, environmental legislation which outlaws the use of a particular type of machine) or where the raw materials that are used as an input into the asset are expected to run out. Another example is where the rate of technological obsolescence for an asset is significantly higher than was originally envisaged. Here, uncertainty about future life is not an issue. In principle, it would appear reasonable for the Commissioner to take such factors into account when setting a special depreciation rate for a particular asset. The above view does not require a legislative amendment. Rather, it is the view of the Commissioner on what estimated useful life should be in the context of special tax depreciation rate applications. The legislative changes aimed at widening the factors that the Commissioner can have regard to when considering special tax depreciation rate applications are designed to support this interpretation of estimated useful life. Recommendation That in setting special tax depreciation rates for second-hand assets’ the Commissioner should normally continue to apply a “whole of life” approach. Where, however, it is evident that an asset will have a shorter economic life as a result of changes in regulation or the lack of availability of raw materials, then these factors should be able to be taken into account when setting special tax depreciation rates. Issue: Special tax depreciation rates part way through an asset’s life Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The special tax depreciation rate rules specifically need to allow the Commissioner to grant an application for a special tax depreciation rate part way through an asset’s useful life. 55 Comment The submission comments that there may be instances where economic factors which determine the useful life of an asset have been changed radically part-way through an asset’s life and the Commissioner has declined to issue a special tax depreciation rate that reflects these changes. These factors include outside events such as changes to the availability of a raw material that an asset processes or significant changes to the economic viability of the asset that were not anticipated when the asset was acquired and have not been factored into the standard calculation of the asset’s useful life. The submission suggests that the new rules should confirm specifically that the Commissioner has the flexibility, in the appropriate circumstances, to amend the useful life of a depreciable asset part way through its life. The issues in relation to allowing a special tax depreciation rate part-way through an asset’s economic life is similar to those discussed under the previous submission on the estimated useful life of second hand assets. That is, assume that an asset which has an estimated useful life of 20 years when new, is expected to expire within 12 years, eight years into its use. There may be a similar asset, which at year eight, is expected to have an expected future life of more than 12 years. Again, this is because the economic lives of assets vary (and can do so at different points in their life). Consequently, officials consider that allowing depreciation on a "whole of life" approach is also a pragmatic approach in these circumstances. However, in the response to the previous submission we considered that there may be some events that are outside the taxpayer’s control which may mean that an asset's useful life will be curtailed (such as availability of raw materials and regulatory changes). In those scenarios, we recognised that it would appear reasonable for the Commissioner to take such factors into account when setting special depreciation rates. We consider that a similar approach is reasonable with respect to special tax depreciation rate applications part-way through an asset’s life, as in the case of the example outlined above, this is in substance no different to a second-hand purchaser who buys the asset at year eight (and is able to show that the asset will expire within three years). To not do so would create a distortion to sell and repurchase the asset to claim higher depreciation rates. Again, we consider that no legislative amendment is required as the above view is that of the Commissioner on what estimated useful life should be in the context of special tax depreciation rate applications made part-way through the life of an asset. Recommendation That in setting special tax depreciation rates for assets part-way through their useful life the Commissioner should normally continue to apply a “whole of life” approach. Where, however, it is evident part-way through the useful life of an asset, that an asset will have a shorter economic life as a result of changes in regulation or the lack of availability of raw materials, then these factors should be able to be taken into account when setting a special tax depreciation rate for a particular asset. 56 Issue: Special tax depreciation rates for excluded depreciable property Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Taxpayers should be permitted to apply for a special rate in respect of “excluded depreciable property”. Comment The submission comments that there is no policy reason why the special tax depreciation rate rules should not be accessible in respect of “excluded depreciable property” (typically, assets acquired prior to 1 April 1993, the date of introduction of the current tax depreciation rules). The submission argues that this discriminates against older assets and this exclusion should not apply in circumstances where the historic depreciation rate for the property is inappropriate or non-existent. To be excluded depreciable property, an asset must have been held by the same taxpayer since before the introduction of the current rules. Consequently, excluded depreciable property typically comprises a number of large infrastructural assets. The depreciation rates for these assets were “grandfathered” to reflect the fact that the decision to invest in these assets was made based on the tax rules that existed at the time. Also, given the unique nature of most excluded depreciable property, it would be difficult to find comparable investment undertaken under the current rules, to act as an appropriate benchmark (against which to compare historic rates). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issues: Drafting Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The words “and include a rate determined by the Commissioner under section 91AD, 91AE or 91AJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994” do not need to be included in section EE 12(1). \[Clause 19\] In relation to section 91AE(2) of the Tax Administration Act, the words “after having regard to the factors in subsection (2)” should not be removed. \[Clause 93\] Comment The submission comments that the above drafting changes are not necessary. 57 In relation to Clause 19 of the bill, officials consider that this is a clarification that a depreciation deduction is allowed under the general rules, but also as the result of a special tax depreciation rate and a provisional tax depreciation rate determination or where the Commissioner opts to increase the maximum value under the pooling method for depreciation. In relation to clause 93 of the bill, officials consider that the proposed new wording of section 91AE(2) is broader in scope and offers greater flexibility to the Commissioner in considering special tax depreciation rate applications, than the wording that it replaced. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 OTHER Issue: Deductibility for resource consents that are not granted or are withdrawn Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Sections DJ 14B of the Income Tax Act 1994 and DB 13B of the Income Tax Act 2004 do not achieve the stated policy intent of allowing a deduction for costs incurred in relation to certain applications for resource consents that are not granted or are withdrawn. Comment The submission comments that the above sections, as enacted in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, are deficient in that their wording limits their application to resource consents that are themselves depreciable property rather than including a reference to the costs of a resource consent application that otherwise forms part of depreciable property. It further comments that this is contrary to the policy intent as stated in the report-back of the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the relevant legislation – to allow a deduction where a resource consent application is refused or withdrawn, which if granted, would have formed part of the cost of other depreciable property. The submission also comments that this provision should be further extended to provide a deduction for costs that would otherwise have been tax deductible under an industry-specific provision. Examples given include the provisions relating to expenditure to prevent or combat pollution, the cost of minerals, timber and flax, and forestry expenditure. Officials consider that the above submission raises an important shortcoming with respect to sections DJ 14B and DB 13B. It correctly points out that the policy intent was to allow a deduction for resource consent applications, which if granted, would have been depreciable both in their own right and as part of other depreciable property. An example of the latter is a consent to construct a building or other structure which is typically included in the cost of the building or structure and depreciated accordingly. The sections as currently drafted do not allow deductions for consent costs which would have been part of the cost of other depreciable property. Officials consider that given the relatively minor remedial nature of this change, an amendment in the current bill should be included to correct this discrepancy. The other point made in submissions is in relation to consent costs, for which a deduction is allowed under specific tax rules (as opposed to the depreciation rules). The submission recommends that consents that would typically be deductible as part of other expenditure under specific tax rules should also be within the scope of sections DJ 14B and DB 13B. Officials consider that the policy intent of the relevant sections is to allow a deduction for the cost of failed or withdrawn resource consent applications, to the extent that these costs would have been allowed as deductions 59 (either under the depreciation rules, the general tax deductibility rules or, where applicable, specific tax rules), if the application was granted. We therefore agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 60 61 Death and asset transfers 62 63 OVERVIEW Clauses 11, 18, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 45, 47, 48, 60(5) & (12), and 100 Provisions in this bill clarify the income tax rules on transfers of assets by introducing generic rules for the treatment of “in kind” or “in specie” distributions and gifts, including transfers of assets and liabilities upon a taxpayer’s death. The changes will apply only to assets and liabilities that are in the tax base, such as buildings for which depreciation is claimed – for example, rental properties and land or shares for which the gain is taxable. The vast majority of estates will not be affected as their assets are not in the tax base. Under the bill: • A disposal and acquisition of a taxpayer’s assets and liabilities will be deemed to occur at market value, on the day of their death. • “In kind” distributions of assets by companies and trusts (including estates) will be treated as dispositions and acquisitions at market value. • Gifts will be treated in the same way as “in kind” distributions. This means that for a number of estates, there will be two market value transactions: one at the time of the taxpayer’s death, and one on the subsequent distribution of the estate to beneficiaries. However, rollover relief applies to both these transfers for estates left wholly to spouses and to forestry assets where the beneficiaries are close relatives. This allows for the transfer of assets and liabilities at the book values they have for tax purposes. For simple estates when the assets are left to charity or to close relatives only, rollover relief applies to the subsequent distribution to the beneficiaries. These exceptions continue to apply where there are specific legacies to third persons of assets that are not in the tax base. Four submissions discussed the provisions in the bill relating to death and distributions. The submissions supported the clarification of the rules, but all sought more extensive rollover relief. As a result we recommend that financial arrangements owned by the deceased at the date of death should be excluded from the market value rule where the deceased taxpayer was a cash basis holder and the beneficiaries are related. This will reduce compliance costs and mean that the new rules will apply to even fewer estates. 64 SUPPORT FOR AMENDMENTS Clause 45 Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group, 29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission supports the introduction of legislation which clarifies the treatment of property that is within the tax base on the death of a taxpayer and the distribution by the executor/administrator of that property to the beneficiaries of the estate. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission supports the proposals to clarify the tax treatment of death and certain other “in kind” transfers but have a number of concerns regarding the draft legislation. The Institute explicitly offered its congratulations on bringing forward the proposals. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 65 ROLLOVER RELIEF Clause 45 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) Elective rollover relief should be available at the time of transfer, provided the property would be held by the beneficiary for the same purpose as it was held by the deceased. Comment The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand argues that, in addition to the limited rollover relief provided in the bill, elective rollover relief is justified because: • Death should not accelerate the creation of a taxable event when there is no amount that has been received by any party. • Any specific concerns about assets leaving the tax base should be addressed by specifically excluding or denying the application of rollover relief when this occurs. • There will be cases where a taxable event takes place under the proposed rules and the taxpayer will not have the cash available to pay tax and may well have to liquidate part of the asset to do so. An asset should not need to be realised to meet a tax obligation triggered by the event of death. • The existing taxation system, with notable exceptions such as the accrual rules, does not tax on a full accrual basis, but on the basis of derivation of income. There is no good policy reason to move from that principle. • Death is not an opportunity for tax planning or avoidance. Officials consider that these arguments are insufficient to justify an extension of rollover relief. Extensive rollover relief would undermine the purpose of the policy clarification because of the potential for differences in the tax circumstances of the deceased and the estate/beneficiaries. It is also appropriate to finalise a taxpayer’s affairs at death, including their taxation obligations. Under the amendments the main taxation item at date of death is likely to be depreciation. Most other tax adjustments will almost always be insignificant. If the depreciation adjustment results in taxable income this indicates that depreciation deductions prior to date of death have been overclaimed. It seems entirely appropriate that there should be a depreciation adjustment at death. (Under current law, livestock and financial arrangements are already explicitly valued at market value at death.) An elective mechanism would mean the certainty objective would not be as well addressed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 66 Submissions (22 – KPMG, 29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There should only be one valuation point for transfers relating to death – the date of distribution to beneficiaries. Comment It is appropriate to finalise a taxpayer’s affairs at death, and any exclusions to that rule need to be justified. Rollover is already proposed at death for estates left to spouses who are the only beneficiaries, and for forestry assets where the beneficiary is a close relative. Officials consider that further exclusions are unjustified. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Rollover relief should be available, both at death and upon the transfer of assets and liabilities to beneficiaries, for all assets which pass to the spouse or de facto partner of the deceased, irrespective of whether other property in the tax base passes to other beneficiaries. Rollover relief should be available for transfers of property to beneficiaries who are close relatives or charities, regardless of whether there are other bequests of assets that are in the tax base. Comment The exclusions included in the bill are carefully targeted at simple estates to reduce risk to the revenue. Officials consider that further exclusions are not justified. Further, in the limited number of estates where both the spouse and other family members are beneficiaries of assets that are in the tax base, it is likely that they will be in partnership. This would be simpler to administer if the beneficiaries have the same cost base, as proposed in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 Submissions (24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) Elective rollover relief should be available for resettlement of assets between family trusts. Elective rollover relief should be available for transfers from an estate to a family trust. Comment Resettlements are difficult to conceptually address. Any concessionary treatment, if it can be done, would have to be carefully restricted to ensure that it is appropriate. In contrast, the proposed market value approach offers certainty and simplicity. Thus, officials believe a market value treatment is correct for the resettlement of assets between family trusts. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (22 – KPMG) There should be only one deemed disposal for transfers relating to death where the deceased is not resident in New Zealand at the time of death – that is, the date of death. Comment Where the deceased is non-resident the only assets in the New Zealand tax base are those assets located in New Zealand. Further, where the deceased is non-resident, it is likely that the executors or administrators will also be non-resident. In these circumstances, according to the submission, the distribution of the deceased’s property to the executors or administrators would be at market value. However, distributions to New Zealand beneficiaries would be an undetermined value. This is not an appropriate tax treatment. The tax treatment under the amendments is more appropriate as it offers certainty. Under the amendments, distributions to beneficiaries will generally be at market value. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 68 DE MINIMIS Clause 45 Submission (22 – KPMG) A de minimis should be introduced. Estates where the value of property is below the de minimis should be excluded from the regime. Comment It is envisaged that the proposals will not affect the affairs of most deceased taxpayers, financial arrangements excepted. A de minimis would have little, if any practical effect. However, there seems to be little point in requiring a typical financial arrangement (say a bank deposit) to be valued at market value where it has been issued at par and the deceased accounted for it as a cash basis holder. We therefore recommend that where the deceased was a cash basis holder and the estate also qualifies as a cash basis holder, any fixed-principal financial arrangements should be valued at face value. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that an amendment be inserted to provide that where both the deceased taxpayer and the estate are cash-basis holders, fixed- principal financial arrangements will be valued at their face value, both at death and upon distribution to beneficiaries. 69 COST BASE FOR DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY Clause 45 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The cost base for depreciation for the recipient of an asset as a result of death should be clarified. Comment Generally, under current law (section EG 17 of the Income Tax Act 1994 \[section EE 34 of the Income Tax Act 2004\]) a taxpayer who acquires depreciable property from an associated person, either directly or indirectly, cannot claim more depreciation on that property than the associated person would have been able to if they had retained the property. Subject to certain exceptions, the taxpayer’s depreciation base is limited to the original cost of the property incurred by the associated vendor for anti- avoidance reasons. As death is not a planned event, where the section FI 6 rollover relief for property transferred to close relatives or charities applies, there is no concern about anti- avoidance. Therefore section EE 34 should be amended to ensure that the rollover can apply. Where the rollover does not apply, the estate should be allowed to use market value if that is considered appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST Submission (29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill should be amended to include a discretionary power for the Commissioner to extend the period for which use-of-money interest will not apply in appropriate circumstances. Comment The bill already provides that use-of-money interest will not be imposed in relation to a deceased person’s terminal tax liability in the year of death, provided all provisional tax instalments and terminal tax are paid by the respective dates. Further this would imply that there might also be issues with late payment penalties. After discussing this matter with the submitter, we are of the view that no further relief is warranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 71 APPLICATION DATE Clause 45 Submissions (22 – KPMG, 29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Application should be deferred until 2006-07. (KPMG) The new legislation should apply prospectively, and assuming the legislation is passed within the next few months, it should apply to deaths occurring on or after 1 October 2005 and distributions by executors/administrators occurring on or after 1 October 2005. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Officials agree that a prospective date would be more appropriate than the current application date of 1 April 2005, and agree that 1 October 2005 is suitable. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 72 PUBLICITY Submission (22 – KPMG) Inland Revenue should undertake advertising/public notification of changes to the bill. Comment As part of the normal process for the passage of the bill, Inland Revenue will issue a Tax Information Bulletin on the provisions in the bill, including the death and transfers issue. A press statement was issued earlier when the policy design was completed, and publicity also surrounded the introduction of the bill. Officials consider that no additional public notification is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 73 DRAFTING Clause 45 Submission (22 – KPMG) Reference to “subsection (5)” in section FI 1(2) should be to “subsection (4)”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) Resettlements of assets from one family trust to another do not appear to be caught by the draft legislation they are effected: • through a power of advancement contained in the trust deed; • through a resettlement clause contained in a trust deed; and • under the powers contained in section 41 of the Trustees Act 1956. It seems logical that all resettlements should be subject to the new rules. Comment The policy intention is that these transactions should be caught by the new rules. Through oversight they are not reflected in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 74 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section FI 2 (Disposal and resulting acquisition of property treated as occurring at market value) should be amended to read “A transaction to which this subsection applies is to be treated as ...” Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section FI 3 (Market value of property to recipient) should be deleted. Comment The section usefully clarifies that the market value to the transferee should be the same as the market value of the property to the transferor. However, section FI 3 should be amalgamated with section FI 2. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that sections FI 2 and FI 3 should be amalgamated. Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group, 29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section FI 5(1) (Rollover for a spouse or de facto partner who are sole beneficiaries of the estate) should be amended to apply to both the transfer to the executor and the distribution to the spouse or de facto partner. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) The word “not” in the third line of subsection FI 5(2) should be removed. (Auckland Trust Special Interest Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers) It is not clear that section FI 5 (Rollover for spouse or de facto partner who are sole beneficiaries of the estate) achieves its objective. (KPMG) 75 Consideration should be given to whether the words “a beneficiary of the deceased” in the proposed section FI 5(1)(b) are redundant and should be removed. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Section FI 5 is to be redrafted. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submissions (22 – KPMG, 24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group, 29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) It is not clear that the drafting of section FI 6 (Rollover for close relatives) achieves its objectives. (KPMG) The current wording of section FI 6 is unnecessarily complex. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The words “other than” in section FI 6(2) (Rollover for close relatives) should be replaced by “being”. (Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) The proposed section FI 6(1)(b) should be redrafted to apply only to property that is within the tax base. As it is currently drafted the subsection refers to all property. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Section FI 6 is to be redrafted. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 76 Submission (29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The term “FIF’ in section FI 6(1)(a)(i) should be replaced with “foreign investment fund”. Comment FIF is a defined term in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. It means a foreign investment fund as defined in section EX 29 (Meaning of FIF). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) Reference to section CW 36 in sections FI 6, (Rollover for close relatives and charities) and FI 11, FI 12 and FI 13 (Transitional provisions) should be extended to section CW 34 and CW 35. Comment Section FI 6 provides rollover relief for distributions to beneficiaries who are close relatives or charities. Section CW 36 refers to amounts of income derived by a deceased’s executor or administrator from assets of the estate that have been left in trust for charitable purposes which, if the income had been derived by the charity directly, would have been exempt income. In order to qualify under section CW 36, income of the charity needs to be exempt from income tax under sections CW 34 and CW 35. References to sections CW 34 and CW 35 in section FI 6 are unnecessary, because including them would not extend the scope of that section. Similarly, sections FI 11, FI 12 and FI 13 do not need to refer to sections CW 34 and CW 35. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In section FI 6(2)(c) (Rollover for close relatives) the words “that is practicable” be replaced by “to the maximum extent allowable under the terms of the will and in compliance with trustee law”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group, 29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Sections FI 7 (Rollover for forestry) and FI 8 (10-year rule for property purchased on capital account) should be amended to apply to transfers to executors and administrators and distributions to beneficiaries. Comment Officials agree with the submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Submission (29B – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed sections FI 7 & FI 8 should be expanded to apply to property that is “timber”, “standing timber” and “a right to take timber”. Comment Officials agree with the recommendation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 78 Submission (24W – Auckland Trust Special Interest Group) Section F10 (Relationship of subpart FI to unexpired prepayments) should be rewritten to make it clear that: • the unexpired expenditure at the date of death must be included in the tax return of the deceased person for the period up to the date of death; • the administrator, executors or trustees of the estate can deduct the amount included in the tax return of the deceased person for the period up to the date of death; • the administrator, executors or trustees of the estate must continue to account for the unexpired expenditure as if they and the deceased person were the same taxpayer; • the section also applies to all other “in kind” transfers of assets. Comment Officials agree that some clarification of section FI 10 is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section FI 11(1) (Transitional provision relating to death occurring before the commencement of 2005-06 income year) should be amended to remove the words “that involves the disposal of property to an administrator, or executor or trustee on the death of a person”. The section should simply refer to “a transaction that section FI 1(3)(d) applies to”. The same submission is made in relation to sections FI 12 and FI 13. Comment As section FI 1(3)(d) comes into force after the commencement of the 2005-06 income year it cannot apply to deaths occurring before the commencement of that income year. Accordingly, these changes should not be made to the proposed new sections FI 11, 12 and 13. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 79 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In section FI 13, references to 2004-05 should be to 2005-06. Comment Section FI 13 has now been deleted. 80 81 Imputation credit shopping 82 83 OVERVIEW The dividend and imputation rules are being introduced to ensure that in certain circumstances, when a company is sold, the benefits of any prepaid tax will stay with the original group that paid the tax and cannot be refunded. The changes have been designed as a revenue protection measure. A number of submissions argued that the amendments were not necessary because the outcome being achieved was conceptually correct. Officials disagree with this and still believe that the specifically targeted proposals are necessary. 84 THAT THE MEASURES IN THE BILL TO COUNTER IMPUTATION CREDIT SHOPPING ARE UNNECESSARY OR INAPPROPRIATE Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the proposed amendments are unnecessary if the government reconsiders the policy intent of the imputation rules that underpin the proposal and shifts the focus from an individual taxpayer perspective to a wider economic basis. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) That the legislation supporting imputation credit transfer proposals should be withdrawn. Instead, legislation should be enacted that specifically allows these arrangements in the circumstances when it is clear that the imputation rules are actually giving rise to over-taxation. (KPMG) That the government should not be promoting tax policy that obliges taxpayers to pay tax when they are making losses. (KPMG) The government should introduce rules to allow corporates who are in loss and who have a policy of fully imputing dividends, and who can demonstrate a history of fully imputing dividends, to be able to purchase imputation credits from other fully taxable taxpayers. (KPMG) Imputation credit shopping transactions appear to be within the ambit of existing anti-avoidance provisions, therefore the proposed measures are unnecessary and should be withdrawn. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment To explicitly allow companies to purchase imputation credits from other companies is inconsistent with the underlying tenets of imputation. The imputation credit shopping provisions are designed to buttress the existing provisions within the imputation rules, which include anti-avoidance rules, to ensure that imputation credits are only for the benefit of the shareholders that have borne the tax. This is an underlying principle of imputation. While it is true that with measures to reduce compliance costs, such as the 66% continuity and notional single person rules, this may not be the outcome in every case, the imputation rules do aim to ensure that this principle is generally upheld. 85 Currently companies who are in a loss-making situation are only required to make payments of income tax to the extent that they have attached imputation credits to dividends paid to the shareholders. As far as the tax base is concerned, the prepayment of income tax simply offsets the reduction in tax paid by their shareholders that have received the imputation credits. The prepayment of income tax is merely the consequence of a choice, made by the loss making company, to pay imputed dividends to its shareholders. Recommendation That the submissions be declined 86 THAT THE MEASURES PREVENTING SHARE SPLITS FROM BECOMING TAXABLE BONUS ISSUES ARE INAPPROPRIATE AND SHOULD NOT PROCEED Submission (17W – Ernst & Young, 29 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The provisions that prevent share splits from being taxable bonus issues would legislate against a widely accepted means of utilising imputation credits in circumstances where a cash dividend is inappropriate or otherwise not possible. The ability to attach imputation credits to a taxable bonus issue is an important feature of the imputation system. It allows imputation credits to be moved within a group of companies or provided to shareholders where there are insufficient cash reserves to pay a dividend. Comment Officials have some sympathy for the views expressed in these submissions. Before the imputation credit shopping transactions came to light, the taxable bonus issue appears to have been used to facilitate the movement of imputation credits up a chain of companies or used as a mechanism to pass the benefit of imputation credits to shareholders before a continuity breach. While the outcomes may not have been inappropriate from a policy viewpoint, the original policy for share splits set out in the 1993 discussion document Taxation of Company Law Reform was that they were to be synonymous with non-taxable bonus issues. As share splits have been used as a method of conveying imputation credits within imputation credit shopping transactions, it has proved necessary to revisit this situation. Since the introduction of imputation grouping in 2003, officials no longer see it necessary that a mechanism is necessary to pass imputation credits up chains of wholly owned companies, particularly as such a mechanism is also used in the imputation credit shopping transactions. Officials do not, however, at this juncture see any mischief in allowing the status quo to prevail with regard to the passing of imputation credits to shareholders that are not subject to the intercorporate dividend exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted with regard to taxable bonus issues that are not exempt intercorporate dividends. 87 ABILITY TO MAKE TAXABLE BONUS ISSUES IN EXCESS OF RESERVES CAPITALISED WHICH COULD HAVE INAPPROPRIATE OUTCOMES Submission (Matter raised by officials) Although the proposed legislation is only targeted at share splits, it is still possible under existing legislation for taxpayers to elect that a taxable bonus issue has a value in excess of the reserves capitalised. Comment As with the previous situation, where this is used solely as a mechanism for moving imputation credits up a chain of companies or the resulting taxable bonus issue is a taxable dividend in the hands of the recipient, the outcome does not appear to be offensive from a policy point of view. However, officials are concerned that this mechanism could become a substitute for the current mechanism of using share splits in imputation credit shopping transactions. Our view is that the correct outcome is the same as the previous submission, and for taxable bonus issues that are exempt dividends in the hands of the shareholder the value should be restricted to the value of the reserves capitalised. However, as this is not in the bill and there is insufficient time for the select committee to call for submissions, officials do not recommend that amendments be made at this stage. In the event that this mechanism is used inappropriately in transactions such as the current imputation credit shopping ones, officials will recommend to the government that it seeks to also close this mechanism. In such circumstances, the appropriate application date recommended is likely to be retrospective to the 16 November 2004, for consistency with the current proposed changes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 88 THE PROPOSED ANTI-IMPUTATION CREDIT SHOPPING RULES IN SECTIONS ME 9B AND ME 9C SHOULD ONLY APPLY WHEN THE DOMINANT PURPOSE IS TO OBTAIN AN IMPUTATION OR REFUND ADVANTAGE Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) The provisions should be expressed to apply where the dominant purpose of the transfer of the leaving/joining company is to obtain an imputation advantage or to allow a refund to be paid or transferred. Such criterion would not prevent the targeting desired as a matter of policy but would ensure that other companies are not unwittingly affected by these provisions or their penal consequences and that the latter are not required to invest time and cost in determining the possible application or otherwise of the new provisions. Comment Officials agree that targeting of these provisions is appropriate as they do introduce additional complexity to the legislation. The current targeting is aimed at groups of companies that have accumulated losses in excess of $1 million in the previous income year. This measure was chosen because it is objective and easily measurable. Consequently we do not support a subjective “dominant purpose” test as a possible method of targeting the provisions. Such a test is neither objective nor easily measurable and would be more difficult to administer and comply with. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 ANY PROPOSED FURTHER INCOME TAX PAYABLE SHOULD BE CREDITABLE TO FUTURE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND TO THE IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNT Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) There is no valid reason why such payments should not be treated as credits in the imputation credit account or as available to meet any future income-tax liabilities. As far as any targeted mischief is concerned, the position will have been effectively reversed and the companies should be in no worse position than if they were in before with regard to imputation credit account balances or prepaid tax. Comment It is important to note that such a payment is effectively optional as it is possible for the leaving company to elect to transfer a debit balance or a prepayment of tax to the extent the credit balance of the imputation credit account is exceeded. Officials expect that any payment of such a tax will be rare and very much the exception rather than the rule. Officials agree that any payments of further income tax by the leaving company should create imputation credits for the leaving company. This is particularly significant as the most likely scenario for the further income tax to be paid is when a company would otherwise leave the group with a debit in its imputation credit account. Officials, however, do not agree that it is appropriate that payments of further income tax should be creditable against future income tax liabilities of the acquiring group. The further payment of tax is made, in the case of a debit balance in the imputation credit account, because imputation credits have been used by the leaving group’s shareholders in excess of the tax paid by its shareholders. With creditability, the further payment of tax would be used by shareholders that are different from the ones that received the imputation credits. Officials expect that it is unlikely that a further payment of tax will be made where there is an amount in the account with the Commissioner. In this case, it is appropriate that this amount be used to offset the further payment of tax as it simply represents the tax benefit received by the leaving company’s shareholders before it left the original wholly owned group. This is to be contrasted with the more general case of further income tax which is creditable against other income tax liabilities. This is appropriate as the shareholders that have had the benefit of the imputation credits have paid the further income tax and will offset it against future income tax liabilities will be materially the same. Recommendation That the submission be accepted with regard to the creation of imputation credits but otherwise declined. 90 THAT CLEAR RULES ON THE TIMING AND FORM OF ELECTIONS AVAILABLE UNDER PROPOSED ME 9B ARE REQUIRED Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 17W – Ernst & Young) The proposed legislation is currently deficient in that it allows companies to elect to transfer ICA debit balances or prepaid tax to the extent a credit balance in the imputation credit account is exceeded but gives no guidance on the acceptable approach. Comment Officials agree that the legislation is deficient in the manner set out in the submissions. We recommend that the process be as follows: • Furnished in “a form the Commissioner may require”. • Elections must be made by the leaving company, with the receiving company also notifying the CIR that they agree to receive the debit balance or the amount in the “account with the CIR”. • Elections should be made within 20 working days of the company leaving the group. • Late and revised elections may be accepted at the Commissioner’s discretion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 91 DEFINITION OF ULTIMATE OWNERS Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) The definition of ultimate owners should be replaced with a simpler means of determining whether there has been a critical change of ownership and grouping – preferably by reference to sections OD 3 and 4. Comment Officials have some sympathy for the view expressed in the submission, as legal tests to ascertain ultimate ownership are complex regardless of the test chosen. It may be that the test proposed in the submission is superior to the one currently in the bill but officials have had insufficient time to properly analyse the differences. At this point officials note the submission and at a future stage may consider an amendment. Recommendation That the submission be declined but possibly considered at a future time. 92 TECHNICAL ISSUES Submissions (Matter raised by officials) Further income tax within sections ME 9B and ME 9C should be renamed as unlike further income tax generally, this payment of tax is final and not creditable against other tax liabilities. The term “account with the Commissioner” be clarified to apply only to payments of income tax and provisional tax. Voluntary tax within the provisional tax rules be amended to include payments of tax when the taxpayer is not a provisional taxpayer rather than the proposed addition to imputation credits. Sections ME 9B and ME 9C should also apply to consolidated imputation groups. The restrictions to taxable bonus issues should also include subdivisions or the equivalent made under other parts of the Companies Act 1993. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 93 DRAFTING ISSUES Submissions (17W – Ernst & Young, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, Matter raised by officials) The imputation credit shopping measures should be clarified to ensure that they only apply to companies leaving or joining after the date of introduction. (Ernst & Young, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The reference to debits “recorded” should be a reference to debits “arising” during the relevant period. (Ernst & Young) The reference to “tax year” in sections ME 9B and ME 9C proposed to be inserted in the ITA 1994 should be changed to “year” as “tax year” is not a defined term for the purposes of the ITA 1994. (Ernst & Young) Section ME 9C (1) – this should only apply where the former group has losses in excess of $1 million. (Matter raised by officials) Section ME 5(2)(fb) – “credit” should be “debit” as it refers to ME 5(1)(fb) which is a debit. (Matter raised by officials) Sections ME 9B(3) and ME 9C(4) – after excess tax should have inserted “or has an amount in a tax pooling account” or a similar type of expression. (Matter raised by officials) Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 94 95 Privilege – right of non-disclosure for tax advice 96 97 OVERVIEW Clauses 82, 83, 84 and 89 The privilege, or non-disclosure right, will protect tax advice documents from disclosure to Inland Revenue. To qualify for the privilege, a document (the tax advice document) will need to be created by the taxpayer for the main purpose of instructing a tax advisor, or by the tax advisor if the document was brought into existence for the main purpose of giving tax advice, on tax laws about the taxpayer’s own affairs. In each case, the tax advisor will need to be a member of an approved advisor group. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have a discretion to allow bodies to be approved as an approved advisor group. It is expected that the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand will apply. Other organisations may also apply, and approval will depend upon those organisations fulfilling the requirements of the definition of an approved advisor group, that is a group whose members have a significant function of providing tax advice, and are subject to a professional code of conduct and disciplinary processes. The professional code of conduct and disciplinary processes are considered to be important factors in countering any abuse of the privilege. The privilege will be subject to restrictions. Certain information (tax contextual information) included in advice given to clients will have to be disclosed, such as factual information, information that supports financial statements and tax returns, and non-tax advice such as valuation, investment, and debt collection advice. This information will need to be disclosed in the form of a statutory declaration. Advice provided for the purpose of committing, or promoting or assisting the committing of an illegal or wrongful act will not be covered by the privilege. Inland Revenue will publish detailed guidelines on how the provisions in the bill should be interpreted. Eleven submissions were made on the clauses in the bill relating to the privilege. Seven of those explicitly supported the privilege, although two considered the legislative provisions were overly complex. 98 SUPPORT FOR THE AMENDMENTS Submissions (6W – Taylor McLachlan Limited, 15W – Business New Zealand, 17W – Ernst & Young, 23 – Russell McVeagh, 30W – Deloitte) The amendment is supported because it addresses an inconsistency in the current law whereby taxation advice obtained from a lawyer may be protected from disclosure to Inland Revenue but the same advice if received from a tax advisor other than a lawyer would not enjoy that protection. (Taylor McLachlan Limited, Business New Zealand, Ernst & Young, Deloitte) The introduction of a statutory non-disclosure right for tax advice provided by approved tax advisors is supported. In the interests of having taxpayers comply with their tax obligations, there should be no barriers to taxpayers obtaining professional advice that may inhibit the provision of confidential information regarding their affairs. The reforms in this area are therefore to be welcomed as a step that should promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers with their tax obligations. (Russell McVeagh) Comment These submissions reflect the policy intention of the amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 99 LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE Submissions (15W – Business New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 30W – Deloitte) In place of the current proposals existing section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to provide a client of a tax advisor (being a member of an approved advisor group) with the same privilege (in relation to tax advice) as clients of legal practitioners. (Deloitte) Statutory privilege for tax advice provided by accountants should also include factual background matters. (Business New Zealand, KPMG) Comment Legal practitioner privilege extends, for the purposes of the Revenue Acts, to any information, book or document brought into existence as a confidential communication between a legal practitioner and their client. It is broader than the privilege that is being introduced for non-lawyers as it extends to both opinion and fact. Officials do not support extending legal professional privilege to non-lawyers because it could harm the tax base. For example, much relevant and useful documentation about taxpayers’ affairs is held by accountants because of the very central and important role that accountants play in the administration of the tax system and in the conduct of their clients’ business affairs. Accountants are the largest single group of tax agents and advisors and are responsible for a very large percentage of tax returns filed with Inland Revenue. If the scope of the proposed accountants’ privilege is extended in the manner suggested, more information would be protected by privilege and the effect could be a significant loss of government revenue. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 100 COMPLEXITY Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) As currently drafted, the provisions are unnecessarily complex. In terms of both structure and complexity the provisions should be re-drafted so that they are similar to section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (for legal professional privilege). Consideration should be given to redrafting the provisions so that they set out general principles only, as this would achieve the same result. Comment It is agreed that complexity could be reduced in some areas and a number of the recommendations that follow aim to achieve this. Following section 20 would not generally assist as most of the complexity is around the provision of “tax contextual information” which is not a requirement under section 20. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 101 WHETHER STATUTORY DECLARATIONS SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Statutory declarations should not be required automatically as to do so would impose onerous compliance costs on taxpayers and their advisors. Comment Under the amendment as introduced, a tax contextual information statutory declaration must be provided within the same timeframe as the claim for privilege. Officials agree that a “two-step” process should instead be introduced to reduce compliance costs. Under the two-step approach, a request for information by Inland Revenue will be accompanied by a request for a tax contextual information statutory declaration only if the Commissioner considers this is necessary for proper administration of the revenue. Guidelines will be issued to clarify the circumstances under which such a request would be made. In other circumstances where a claim for privilege is made, unprivileged material will initially be provided, and Inland Revenue will review this material to determine whether sufficient information has been provided to finalise the investigation. If not, a tax contextual information statutory declaration will be requested at that stage. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 TAX ADVISOR Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) The definition of “tax advisor” should include in-house tax advisors. Comment Currently, the definition of “tax advisor” does not exclude in-house advisors. Accordingly, a change in law is unnecessary. The Tax Information Bulletin that is issued when the bill is enacted, and Inland Revenue guidelines will make it clear that requests for tax advice and tax advice provided by in-house advisors will qualify for the privilege. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Submissions (6W – Taylor McLachlan Limited, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) The definition of “tax advisor” contained in proposed section 20B(4) should be amended so that there is no requirement that the person has a significant function of giving tax advice. Section 20B(4)(b) should be deleted. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte) The meaning of “a significant function of giving advice on the operation and effect of tax laws” should be clarified. (Taylor McLachlan Limited) Comment It should be sufficient for a tax advisor to be part of an “approved advisor group” and subject to a code of conduct and disciplinary process. Public practitioners or others that do not provide tax advice on a regular basis should be covered. Officials now recognise that the requirement to meet the significant function test would cause difficulties in practice. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 103 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If the above submission is not accepted, the requirement in section 20B(4)(c) that the tax advisor be a natural person who is subject to a professional code of conduct and disciplinary process should instead be removed. Comment If the recommendation for the submission relating to section 20(4)(b) is accepted, this submission will not need to be addressed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) The bill should be amended to clarify the appropriate treatment of non-member partners in a chartered accountancy firm who are subject to the Institute’s professional code of conduct in giving tax advice and are subject to the Institute’s disciplinary process in giving that advice. These non-member partners should be treated as part of the approved advisor group. Comment Officials agree that these partners should qualify as tax advisors. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Submission (6W – Taylor McLachlan Limited, 17W – Ernst & Young, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The bill should be amended to clarify the appropriate treatment of employees of a chartered accountancy firm from other professional disciplines that are authorised to sign tax advice for that firm. A member partner (or director) of the chartered accountancy firm should be allowed to make a statutory declaration. In such cases the advice would be covered by the Institute’s ethical standards (because the member partner/director would be held responsible), although the advisor may not be a member. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) 104 The proposed definitions of “tax advisor” and “approved advisor group” should be amended to clarify that tax advisors providing tax advice as employees, contractors or through limited liability companies or trusts are included. (Taylor McLachlan Limited, Ernst & Young) The definition of “tax advisor” should be amended to account for incorporated professional practices. (Taylor McLachlan Ltd) Comment Chartered accountancy firms employ staff from other professional disciplines (for example, lawyers and economists). In some instances more senior employees (senior managers, associates and principals) may be authorised to sign tax opinions for the chartered accountancy firm. Under the bill the Commissioner would have discretion to allow the New Zealand Law Society to become an approved advisor group in order for an employee of the chartered accountancy firm who is a lawyer to qualify as a “tax advisor”. The position with economists is less clear. It is the view of officials that the ability to claim the right of non-disclosure should be limited to persons who are themselves subject to the disciplinary rules of the approved body. This would include employees who are members. However, for non-member employees this may mean that the claim and any related statutory declaration must be completed by a partner or employee who is a member of an approved group or subject to the group’s rules. Similar considerations should apply when a chartered accountancy firm operates through a limited liability company or trust. A principal of the firm who is a member of an approved group or subject to the group’s rules will be able to claim the privilege. Under this approach there will be no need for the definition of “tax advisor” to be amended to account for incorporated professional practices. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 105 Submission (3W – David Deck, Public Accountant) The requirement that, to qualify for the privilege, a person will need to be a client of a tax advisor who is a member of a group or organisation approved by the CIR goes against section 32 of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand Act. That Act provides that any person who is suitably qualified may act as an accountant. Another definition could be: any person that has been accepted by Inland Revenue as a tax agent. Comment Abuse of the privilege could lead to serious loss to the government revenue, so the reliance on an approved advisor group’s code of conduct and disciplinary procedures is an important element of the privilege. Not all tax agents are subject to such measures. Officials consider, therefore, that no change should be made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 106 TAX ADVICE DOCUMENT Submissions (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) A document should be eligible to be a “tax advice document” not only where the document is created for the main purpose of giving instructions and requesting or providing advice, but also to the extent that the document has been created for the purpose of providing instructions or requesting or providing advice on the operation and effect of tax laws. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A document should be eligible to be a “tax advice document” for a person if it was created for the purpose of giving to the person advice about the operation and effect of tax laws, as long as that purpose was not a minor or incidental purpose. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment The policy intention is that privileged documents should be created for the main purpose of giving instructions or providing advice. If this is not the case, the document will be primarily factual and Inland Revenue should be able to access the relevant factual information. Removing the “main purpose” test would significantly widen the scope of the privilege, and could create a revenue risk for the government. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) As long as a document is created in order to provide a record of tax advice given by the tax advisor then it should be eligible to be a tax advice document for the purposes of section 20B(2)(a)(ii). Comment Officials agree that records of advice should be eligible for the privilege and the legislation should be clarified accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 107 Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) A document that is created in order to record the research and analysis for the purpose of the tax advice given by the tax advisor should be eligible to be a tax advice document for the purposes of section 20B(2)(a)(ii). Comment Under existing protocols access to this type of information would be requested only after Inland Revenue had attempted to obtain the information required from the taxpayer. However, officials agree that research papers for the purpose of giving the advice should be covered by the new non-disclosure right. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (6W – Taylor McLachlan Ltd, 17W – Ernst & Young) The legislation should also clarify that documents may be included as “tax advice documents” where they are created wholly or partly by employees or contractors of approved tax advisors who may not be individually bound by a professional code of conduct or disciplinary process because, for instance, they have not yet been admitted as members of a relevant professional society or institute. Comment In order to qualify for the privilege, a document must be a “tax advice document”, that is, it must be prepared by a “tax advisor” who is a member of an approved advisor group. Under the bill, therefore, a document that contains tax advice but is prepared by an employee who is not a member of an approved advisor group would not be eligible for the privilege. This is not the intended outcome. Where an employee does not satisfy the definition of tax advisor, a partner of the firm could be expected to be able to claim the privilege and make the tax contextual information statutory declaration on the employee’s behalf. The definition of “tax advice document” should be amended so that tax advice prepared by employees who are not members of an approved advisor group can qualify for the privilege. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 108 TAX ADVICE DOCUMENTS GIVEN TO OTHER PERSONS Submissions (6W – Taylor McLachlan Limited, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 30W – Deloitte) A document should be eligible to be a “tax advice document” for a person if the advice about the operation and effect of tax laws is given to the person or to another person pursuant to instructions from the first person. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) A document should be eligible to be a “tax advice document” for a person if the advice is about the operation and effect of tax laws, irrespective of whether the advice is given to the person or to persons associated or unassociated with the person. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed sections do not appear to provide protection to tax advice given to an agent of the taxpayer in relation to the taxpayer’s taxation affairs. Provision should be made for protection of tax advice documents provided to agents of the taxpayer. (Taylor McLachlan Limited) The definition of a tax advice document should include one or more associated persons in the category of persons who have the right to non-disclosure of tax advice. In practice, a document may record tax advice for one or more members of a group of companies. Members of a group of companies should have the same rights as “a person” otherwise each member of the group will need to replicate the expense of giving a separate instruction to the tax advisor. (Deloitte) Comment The policy intention is that the privilege should apply to confidential communications. It is not appropriate that the privilege should apply to documents that the taxpayer has allowed to be disseminated widely. Officials consider that the provisions in the bill need to be clarified on the issue of confidentiality, and a recommendation to this effect is made below under the heading Third Parties. However, we consider that the privilege should apply where the document has been provided to a taxpayer’s agent or an associated person of the taxpayer. Therefore, the privilege should not apply if the document is provided to unassociated parties. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. The privilege should apply if a document is provided to an agent or associated person of the taxpayer. 109 TAX CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION Submissions (22 – KPMG, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 30W – Deloitte) Delete the definition in new section 20F(3) (tax contextual information) and replace the definition to include reference to material facts or assumptions relating to a transaction which has taken place. (Deloitte) Section 20F(3)(a) and (b) (requirements to disclose a fact, assumption or transaction step relating to a transaction that has occurred or been postulated) should be deleted. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) Comment The policy intention is that tax contextual information should include transaction steps and assumptions which are included in the communication to support the actual transaction entered into by the taxpayer, or a similar transaction, being investigated by Inland Revenue. The intention is to access the factual information that formed the basis of the advice. In some cases the advisor may not be aware if the transaction advised on is implemented, or if it was, exactly how it was implemented. Accepting the submission could, therefore, undermine Inland Revenue’s entitlement to factual information and is not recommended. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) If the above submission is not accepted, the legislation should be clarified so that tax contextual information is limited to such information that is stated in the tax advice document. Comment The policy intention is that tax contextual information should be limited to that contained in a document. This will be clarified in guidelines. Officials consider that no change to the legislation is required. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 110 Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section 20F(3)(a) and (b) should be amended so that assumptions and transaction steps postulated by the person creating the tax advice document are not always “tax contextual information”. The tax advisor should be entitled to use professional judgement about whether facts or assumptions postulated in creating tax advice are relevant as “tax contextual information”. Comment There is no valid policy reason for the factual content of communications between taxpayers and their advisors to be confidential because taxpayers have an obligation to provide factual information to Inland Revenue. Further, the definition of “tax contextual information” must cater for a variety of situations in which Inland Revenue will be seeking factual information about actual transactions. One such situation could be where a tax advisor provided advice on an anticipated transaction, but was no longer acting for the taxpayer at the time the transaction took place, and has no real knowledge of how the advice was implemented. Without information about how the advice was implemented, it could be difficult for the tax advisor to reach a professional judgement about the facts and assumptions that are relevant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The disclosure requirements, as currently drafted, are unduly restrictive. The provisions should be amended to clarify that tax contextual information does not need to be provided verbatim, but may be based on the understanding of the tax advisor. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 20F(4) is unclear to exactly what is being sworn. (KPMG) Comment Verbatim recording of factual information is not required. It is the tax advisor’s understanding of a transaction that should be required. The legislation will be amended to clarify this, but will not preclude the advisor providing verbatim extracts if, in their view, this is the best representation of the tax contextual information. This will clarify the application of section 20F(4). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 111 Submission (22 – KPMG) A tax advisor should not be barred from making a statutory declaration or, if they are, it should not be because of a conviction under the offence provisions in section 20F(5). These exclusions create a very powerful opportunity for the Commissioner to threaten prosecution under any one of those provisions, knowing what effect that would have on a tax advisor. By imposing such a sanction the taxpayer will be barred from claiming privilege if their tax advisor is barred from making the statutory declaration. Comment Officials consider that this sanction is necessary to address any serious abuse of the privilege. Taking prosecution action is likely to be a last resort for Inland Revenue. Generally, to gain access to information that was withheld but which Inland Revenue considered was not privileged, a court order for the production of relevant information under section 17A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be sought. The bill allows the District Court to determine whether or not the information is privileged. Further, there is no requirement in the law for the tax advisor who prepared the tax advice to be the same tax advisor who prepares the statutory declaration. Therefore if the tax advisor who prepared the tax advice is barred from making a statutory declaration the taxpayer would not lose their right to the privilege. Another tax advisor could make the statutory declaration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (30W – Deloitte) The time limits (in section 20F(2)) to disclose tax contextual information should be periods of at least 28 days, giving the Commissioner discretion to extend such periods on the written request of the information-holder. Comment The draft legislation specifies a number of time limits, depending upon the provision under which information is requested. The Commissioner has discretion to extend the time limit where appropriate. Officials consider no change is warranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 112 Submission (6W – Taylor McLachlan Limited) The requirements of proposed section 20F(2)(a) (time limit for disclosure of tax contextual information where the Commissioner accesses premises to obtain information or removes and copies documents) are impractical. We consider that a set period of five working days from the time the Commissioner requests disclosure should be allowed to provide the information required to support a claim that a document is a tax-advice document, with the Commissioner retaining the discretion to allow a later date. Comment The proposed two-step process will generally not apply to these requests, because the Commissioner will have discretion to request an earlier tax contextual information statutory declaration where it is necessary for the proper administration of the revenue. In the limited circumstances where the Commissioner finds it necessary to access premises to obtain information, production of the tax contextual information should occur within a tight timeframe. However, the provision gives suitable flexibility for the Commissioner to agree a later date for obtaining the information. Officials consider that no change is warranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 113 ILLEGAL OR WRONGFUL ACTS Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 20B(2)(b) dealing with documents created in relation to illegal or wrongful acts should be the same as the equivalent provision for legal privilege in section 20(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment Section 20(1)(c) provides that legal professional privilege does not apply to a communication that is brought into existence for the purpose of committing or furthering some illegal or wrongful act. The bill is wider than this because the exclusion also applies to promoting or assisting such an act. The privilege for non-lawyers differs from legal professional privilege. Accordingly, consistency with legal privilege is not a reason for change. Promoting or assisting an illegal or wrongful act is a justifiable basis for denying the non-disclosure right. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 114 PROCESS FOR CLAIMING PRIVILEGE Submission (22 – KPMG) Documents should enjoy privilege without the necessity to make a claim for the privilege with the antecedent requirements (such as providing a brief description of the document). Comment The requirement to make a claim for privilege is important in ensuring the integrity of claims. It allows Inland Revenue to identify all information that is withheld, to request the tax contextual information if required, and in less frequent cases to contest the claim. Officials also consider the application process for the privilege has other important implications, such as for the security of the privileged documents. We consider that no changes should be made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) Sections 20D(2) and (3), which require certain information to be provided with a claim for the privilege, should be deleted because such requirements are better dealt with in guidelines. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Sections 20D(2)(a) and 20D(3)(a), which provide that a brief description of the tax- advice document should accompany a claim for privilege, should be deleted. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment The legislation should prescribe minimum standards to ensure that the document for which privilege is claimed is identifiable. Guidelines will be published on how the provisions should be interpreted. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 115 Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 30W – Deloitte) Section 20D(3)(d), which provides that the areas of law the tax advisor was intending to advise on must be disclosed, should be deleted. Comment Officials consider that paragraph (d) should be retained so Inland Revenue is made aware of whether the document for which privilege is claimed is within the ambit of the issues under consideration. However, we now consider that the term “areas of law” is too wide, and suggest that the reference should be changed to the relevant statute and revenue type. Recommendation That the reference to “areas of law” should be changed to “the relevant statute and revenue type”. Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) If the submissions that section 20D(2) and 20D(3) be deleted is not accepted then consideration should be given to simplifying the procedure for claiming privilege. Comment The introduction of a “two-step process” for providing tax contextual information (discussed above) will simplify the procedure for claiming privilege. Guidelines will also be issued to clarify the process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (22 – KPMG) There should be no timeframe within which a claim for privilege should be filed. Comment Without timeframes for claiming privilege, extensive delays could occur in the tax- assessment process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The time limit stipulated in section 20D(4)(a) for disclosing information under section 16 or 16B should be a minimum of at least 28 days. Comment The Commissioner has discretion to extend the time limit for these types of requests where appropriate. Officials consider no change is warranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) There should be no need for confirmation from the client that the tax advisor is authorised to act on their behalf nor for the tax advisor to swear a statutory declaration that they are authorised to act. (KPMG, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The requirement that a claim for privilege be accompanied by a written confirmation and statutory declaration that the tax advisor is authorised to act on behalf of the person may restrict the person’s ability to claim the right of non-disclosure where the person is required to claim privilege immediately or at short notice. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A tax advisor who is a member of an approved advisor group is already subject to a code of conduct. A statutory declaration that they are authorised to act on behalf of the taxpayer and requirements for confirmation from the client or a statutory declaration will not provide further assurances. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 20D(5), which states that when privilege is claimed the tax advisor must supply written confirmation of the tax advisor’s authority to act for the taxpayer and produce a statutory declaration to that effect, should be deleted. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In section 20D(5)(b) “statutory declaration” should be deleted and replaced with “written confirmation”. (Deloitte) Comment A tax advisor who is a member of an approved advisor group will be subject to a code of conduct. Officials now consider that the tax advisor should not be required to provide a statutory declaration or written confirmation from the taxpayer to this effect. 117 However, in order to provide certainty, the tax advisor should provide their own written acknowledgement that they are authorised to act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. A statutory declaration or written confirmation from the taxpayer that the tax advisor is authorised to act should not be required, but the tax advisor should be required to provide their own written confirmation that they are authorised to act. Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If the above submission is not accepted, the requirement for a statutory declaration should not be automatic. Comment If the recommendation for the submissions relating to the authority for the tax advisor to act on behalf of the taxpayer is accepted, this submission will also be addressed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The requirement in section 20F(4) that a disclosure of tax contextual information must be in the form of a statutory declaration is unnecessary. Comment Officials consider that the tax contextual information statutory declaration is an important element of the new privilege, as it protects the integrity of the privilege. We consider that no change should be made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The provision (section 20C(4)) should clarify what is meant by a “secure place”. Comment This term will be clarified in guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submissions (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) The provisions should be drafted to ensure that the tax advisor who created the document need not be the same tax advisor who later claims privilege on behalf of the taxpayer. Comment Section 20D(1) simply requires that a claim that a document is a tax-advice document must be made by the taxpayer, or a tax advisor who is authorised to act on behalf of the taxpayer. There is no requirement that the tax advisor who claims the privilege must be the same one that provided the advice. No change is required. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 119 THIRD PARTIES Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 30W – Deloitte) Section 20B(1) needs to be clarified to ensure that it applies to third parties holding a document (for example, banks and insurance companies). Comment The policy intention is that the privilege should apply to tax advice documents that are confidential. In some instances the fact that documents are held by third parties may mean that they are not confidential. The issue of documents held by third parties will be clarified in guidelines. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Officials’ recommendation That the provisions in the bill should be clarified by providing that the privilege should apply only to documents that are confidential. The meaning of “confidential” should be determined in accordance with case law, particularly that relating to legal professional privilege. Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If a document held by a third party is required to be disclosed as a result of a request by Inland Revenue directly to the information holder, the provisions should be amended to allow a degree of flexibility in relation to the claim procedure. Alternatively, we suggest a simplification of the claim procedure, including elimination of the written confirmation and statutory declaration requirements. Comment If a document is held by a third party, this will be taken into account in setting the date by which the information will be required.. This will provide any required flexibility to the claim process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 120 DEFINITION OF “DOCUMENT” Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) A definition of “document” should be included in section 20B to ensure that coverage of non-disclosure rules is wide enough to include electronic material and information provided by other media. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 121 INLAND REVENUE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Requests for tax opinions (and related information) from external and in-house tax advisors should be made only in exceptional circumstances, and this should be legislatively addressed. Comment Inland Revenue proposes to issue guidelines covering accountants’ privilege once the bill is enacted. These will include guidance on requests for tax opinions. It is expected that the guidelines will provide for the Commissioner to make requests for information from tax advisors in limited circumstances only, and that this type of request will need to be approved by a senior officer. This is consistent with Inland Revenue’s current policy, which is set out in a statement entitled Commissioner’s Policy on Access to Advice and Other Work-Papers Prepared by Accountants. Currently, access to the opinion content of advice work– papers is sought only when the information provided by the taxpayer does not lead to a complete description of a specific transaction under review. Requests for access to the opinion content of advice work-papers is not made as a matter of course, and only after careful consideration by a senior officer. This practice is well understood and officials do not, therefore, consider it needs to be codified in legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 122 INLAND REVENUE GUIDELINES Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Inland Revenue should publish guidelines to be available on enactment of the bill to clarify the extent of the new rules’ application. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 123 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO APPROVED ADVISOR GROUPS Submission (22 – KPMG) The ability to advise an approved advisor group of something that the Commissioner considers to be a breach of a member’s responsibilities under sections 20B to 20F goes too far in the context of these proposals. Not only does this differ from the rules for legal privilege, but: • what happens if the Commissioner gets it wrong and makes a complaint that later transpires was ill-founded, or overstated?; • in what circumstances does the Commissioner intend to use this provision? The law as drafted simply refers to a breach of a member’s responsibilities under sections 20B to 20F, but what is a breach of a member’s responsibilities;? • what exactly is the Commissioner asking or expecting the approved advisor group to do? Comment The fact that tax advisors are required to operate under an approved advisor group’s code of conduct and disciplinary procedures is an important element of the privilege. If a tax advisor is not abiding by the rules of the privilege, this would be an issue that Inland Revenue would want to bring to the notice of the approved advisor group. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand has also indicated that it would like this type of issue to be brought to its attention. An example of when Inland Revenue may decide to notify the approved advisor group could be where a tax advisor provided a statutory declaration about a transaction and when information provided was subsequently determined by the District Court to be significantly inadequate. Once the matter has been referred to the approved advisor group, it would be up to the group to decide on an appropriate action relative to their code of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Clarification of this and any other circumstances in which the Commissioner’s discretion would be applied should be included in the guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 124 DRAFTING Submission (22 – KPMG) The rules need a ground-up redraft to better reflect their intent and objectives as announced by the Minister of Revenue, and also to remove the overly cumbersome requirements placed on taxpayers and non-legal tax advisors seeking to claim privilege. Comment The legislation reflects the government’s intent and objectives, save for the changes recommended above. Officials consider that a major redrafting exercise is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The word “by” at the beginning of section 20B(2)(a)(ii) be deleted. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30W – Deloitte) The reference to “subsection (6)(a)(ii) and (iii)” in section 20B(4)(c) needs to be a reference to “subsections (5)(a)(ii) and (iii)”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 125 Submission (30W – Deloitte) In section 20F(3)(f) the words “relating to” are too vague and should be deleted. Comment Under the current policy statement relating to Inland Revenue’s access to advice papers, Inland Revenue has full access to all relevant accounting and tax-return work papers. Consistent with this, it is appropriate that the words “relating to” remain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 20C(3)(d) should be amended to insert the word “not” after “an approved advisor group informs the Commissioner that a tax advisor is ....” Without the word “not”, the subsection could be read as providing that a document will cease to be treated as a tax advice document when the approved advisor group informs the Commissioner that the tax advisor is a member of that group. Comment Officials agree with this change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 30W – Deloitte) In the definition of “tax advisor” in section 20B(4) the use of the word “part” (of an approved advisor group) is inappropriate and should be replaced by “a member”. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 126 Submission (30W – Deloitte) There could be confusion in the use of the word “created” in section 20D(2)(c) and (3)(e). Comment This issue will be clarified in guidelines. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 28A – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Redraft section 20B(3), which provides a definition of “tax-advice document”. The amendments suggested are: A document is a tax-advice document for a person if – (a) the document is eligible under subsection (2) to be a tax advice document for the person; and (b) the person makes a claim is made, under section 20D, that the document is a tax advice document; and (c) the person satisfies the requirements of sections 20E and 20F are satisfied for the document. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section 20B(3)(b) should be amended to reflect the fact that a tax advisor can make a claim under section 20D that the document is a tax advice document. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials consider that the suggested changes will not change the interpretation of section 20B(3). Therefore, the changes are unnecessary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 127 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 20C(4) (that a tax-advice document must be kept in a secure place) should not distinguish between a tax advisor who is accepted by the Commissioner as being a member of an approved advisor group and a tax advisor who is a member of an approved advisor group. The reference to acceptance by the Commissioner should be deleted. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 128 129 Tax deductions for business environmental expenditure 130 131 OVERVIEW Clauses 4, 10, 13-17, 30, 68, 86 and 95 The proposed changes to the income tax legislation will introduce new rules for business environmental expenditure (expenditure to avoid, remedy or mitigate the discharge of contaminants). Section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (section DJ 10 of the 1994 Act) will be clarified and expanded by: • specifying categories of qualifying environmental expenditure and default amortisation rates; • giving the Commissioner the power to issue amortisation rates for other categories of environmental expenditure; • removing the current distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste; and • introducing a matching mechanism so that site restoration and monitoring costs can be matched against prior business income. These changes are being made to ensure that all business operating costs, including those for dealing with environmental issues, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate. Eleven submissions were made on the proposed changes to the income tax treatment of business environmental expenditure. Seven submissions supported the changes to the income tax treatment of business environmental expenditure. One submission supported the removal of the distinction between industrial and non-industrial waste but did not support the other proposed changes. There were a number of submissions making recommendations on various technical aspects of the proposals. 132 REVISION OF SECTION DB 37 Submission (26W – Waste Industry) The proposed changes to section DB 37 should be withdrawn (other than the removal of the word industrial) as they will create additional compliance costs for taxpayers. Comment The waste industry considers that the proposed changes to section DB 37 will result in increased compliance costs for taxpayers compared with the simple pooled approach in the current rules. Officials agree that in changing to a more accurate deduction period taxpayers may incur additional compliance costs. However, the new rules will ensure that a broader category of environmental expenditure is deductible, provide for faster deductions in some cases and ensure a more accurate measurement of income consistent with the treatment of other capital expenditure. The new rules have also been designed to minimise any increase in compliance costs. A default deduction rate has been provided for those taxpayers who do not want to incur the cost of applying for a category-specific deduction rate. The record-keeping obligations for costs required to be spread over a longer period are consistent with the timing of other obligations associated with resource consents. Finally, if the legislation is enacted, Inland Revenue will publish a Tax Information Bulletin article (including examples) to assist taxpayers in applying the new business environmental expenditure rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 133 FORMAT OF DEDUCTION Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 26W – Waste Industries, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The format of the proposed tax deduction for business environmental expenditure should be amended to: • remove the 35-year period for amortising certain types of environmental expenditure; • remove the claw back in section CB 24B; • change the formula in proposed section DB 37(2)(a) to rate x cost rather than rate x diminished value; and • allow a wash-up deduction where a taxpayer ceases business and a full deduction has not been allowed for the expenditure by the time of cessation. Comment Period of deduction Three submissions questioned the appropriateness of the default deduction rate (the lesser of the period of the applicable resource consent, or 35 years). The current business expenditure rules allow an arbitrary five-year deduction for a narrow category of expenditure. The proposed rules will broaden the categories of deductible expenditure. In particular, deductions will now clearly be available for dealing with any type of waste, for site restoration expenditure and for environmental costs which do not involve construction (such as riparian planting). The changes also introduce a more accurate deduction period consistent with the approach taken for other capital expenditure. In designing the new rules, the aim has been to ensure that the period of deduction is appropriate. Three of the four categories of environmental expenditure (feasibility and testing, monitoring and site restoration) will now be immediately deductible. The final category, involving creation of an environmental improvement, will have a default amortisation rate of the lesser 35 years or the length of the applicable resource consent. However, taxpayers are able to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a shorter category specific amortisation rate. In order to ensure that Inland Revenue is well placed to offer such rates should the legislation be enacted, a process to review and process applications has already been developed. Officials consider that in many cases the changes will result in a shorter deduction period. For example, over 80% of the environmental costs incurred by the waste industry should have a shorter deduction period under the proposed rules. Certain environmental costs will have a longer deduction period. However, as a result of using a rate based on actual life, the proposed treatment will result in a better measurement of taxable income. 134 Claw back Proposed section CB 24B contains a claw-back mechanism which will apply to taxpayers who have obtained an environmental expenditure tax deduction based on the period of a resource consent. Where that resource consent is extended or renewed, the taxpayer will derive taxable income equivalent to the difference between the tax deductions claimed and those calculated using the extended resource consent period. A number of parties have submitted that the claw back is a new concept in tax legislation, unnecessary in practice and should be removed. Officials recommended the inclusion of the claw back because of concerns that taxpayers could manipulate the period of their resource consent in order to obtain a faster tax deduction (as the default deduction rate is the lesser of 35 years or the period of the applicable resource consent). Officials have discussed the issue further with submitters. While officials appreciate that there are often significant costs involved in applying for resource consents, and that for commercial certainty a taxpayer would generally apply for the longest consent possible, officials still consider that an anti-avoidance provision is required. However, officials have taken account of the concerns raised by submitters with respect to the cash flow and compliance cost implications of the claw back calculation. Officials therefore propose that the claw back mechanism be replaced by a specific anti-avoidance measure with a much narrower scope. Taxpayers who have claimed a tax deduction based on the period of a resource consent and then substantially altered the period or who have renewed that consent for the purpose of obtaining a faster tax deduction would be required to calculate tax deductions based on the default rate of 35 years. Any difference between the deductions claimed to date and tax deductions based on the default rate of 35 years would be clawed back as taxable income in the year that the consent is altered. Taxpayers altering or renewing their resource consent for normal commercial reasons should not be affected by the specific anti-avoidance provision. Straight line versus diminishing value deduction The policy objective behind the proposed amendments to section DB 37 is to accurately measure taxable income by allowing a deduction for business environmental expenditure over the estimated life of the expenditure. The method for spreading the deduction is not important as the rate will be adjusted accordingly. The tax depreciation regime allows a taxpayer to choose between a diminishing value and a straight-line deprecation deduction. For those categories of deductible capital expenditure outside the standard tax depreciation regime, a straight-line rate is usually adopted. Officials agree that amending section DB 37 to provide for a straight line deduction will ensure consistency with other capital expenditure amortisation provisions. 135 Wash-up calculation PricewaterhouseCoopers has submitted that the proposed tax deduction under section DB 37 be amended to allow a wash-up deduction where a taxpayer ceases business and a full deduction has not been allowed for the expenditure by the time of cessation. Proposed section DB 37 allows a deduction for business environmental expenditure spread over the estimated life of that expenditure. However, section DB 37(2), which sets out the amount of the deduction allowed, already provides for the situation where the operations of the business cease and there is still unamortised expenditure. Recommendations That the submission on removing the 35-year period for amortising certain types of environmental expenditure be rejected. That the submission on removing the claw-back mechanism be accepted and that instead, a specific anti-avoidance provision be included as part of the proposed environmental expenditure rules. That the submission recommending a straight line deduction be accepted. The submission requesting a wash-up calculation should be rejected, as this is already allowed for in proposed section DB 37(2)(b). 136 DEFINITION OF DEDUCTIBLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURE Submissions (8W – Ports of Auckland, 14W – Lyttleton Port Company Limited, 19 – Environment Waikato, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 26W – Waste Industry, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed schedule 6B which sets out the definition of deductible business environmental expenditure should be amended to: • allow a deduction for environmental dredging costs; • allow a deduction for the cost of land in circumstances where the future use of that land is restricted as a result of incurring environmental expenditure; • ensure a tax deduction is available (for fencing, planting and alternative water sources) where any agricultural land is retired for the purposes of reducing pollution; • remove the distinction between riparian and screen planting and allow a tax deduction for both types of expenditure when incurred; • replace the words “before a choice between options, of locations and methods...” in paragraph 1, part A with “before a commitment is made to an option”; • replace the words “expenditure on the construction of an improvement to land...” in paragraph 2, part A with the words “expenditure in the construction on land”; and • define “expenditure” to include those items anticipated to fall within the ambit of parts A and B of the schedule. Comment Submissions have put forward a number of changes to proposed schedule 6B. This is the schedule which sets out the categories of deductible environmental expenditure. Each of the proposed changes is discussed below. Dredging Part C of the proposed schedule sets out the types of expenditure which will not be deductible as business environmental expenditure under proposed section DB 37. This includes expenditure related to dredging. The exclusion for dredging was included because officials were concerned that taxpayers might be able to claim a tax deduction for capital dredging costs unrelated to avoiding, remedying or mitigating the detrimental effects of a discharge of contaminants. 137 Following the submissions on this point, officials have considered the issue further. Dredging is the removal of sediment, sand, silt, mud, gravel or other materials from the bottom of a water body. Dredging is regularly carried out by port operators to maintain or deepen the depth of shipping channels and berths, but may also be carried out to remove contaminants from the seabed. Dredging can be split in to three main categories: • maintenance; • capital; and • environmental dredging. Maintenance dredging is undertaken to maintain or restore a shipping channel or berth to its established depth. This is necessary because over time the build-up of silt and other materials reduces the effective depth of channels and berths. This expenditure is deductible under ordinary tax rules as a regular business cost. Capital dredging is intended to deepen a shipping channel or berth beyond its established depth to increase the capacity of the channel or berth. For example, deepening a shipping channel may allow the channel to be used in a wider variety of tide conditions or by larger ships. This expenditure is capital in nature and is not tax deductible. Environmental dredging refers to circumstances where dredging is required to prevent, combat or mitigate the impact of a spill of contaminated waste or materials. It is often significantly different to routine dredging and can involve the use of specialised or modified equipment to ensure the contaminants removed are not re- suspended in the water during removal. A significant international environmental dredging industry has developed to deal with this specialised task. In certain situations environmental dredging may qualify as a regular business expense and therefore be deductible under the general deductibility provisions. However, there may be cases where there is more of a capital element to the expenditure and a deduction may not be available under the general deductibility provisions. However, where the expenditure has been incurred for the principal purpose of remedying a discharge of contaminants, officials agree that a tax deduction should be available. Inevitably the removal of contaminants from the seabed may slightly increase the depth of the original seabed. However, this is incidental to the main purpose of the expenditure and should not mean that a deduction is denied outright. Restriction on future uses of land A number of parties submitted that section DB 37 should be extended to cover a deduction for the cost of land used for the treatment of waste or where the future use of the land is restricted as a result of incurring environmental expenditure. 138 Under ordinary tax rules a deduction is not given for the cost of land because: • it does not normally decline in value; • any gain in relation to land (unless held on revenue account) is not taxable; and • there is a perceived risk of manipulation. However, land can decrease in value as a result of contamination. Therefore, as a proxy, a tax deduction is now proposed for site restoration. Rather than a deduction for incurring a loss on land, expenditure in rectifying that loss will be deductible. A deduction for site restoration will not always equate to the loss in land value suffered from contamination but in the majority of situations it provides a practical solution. However, for taxpayers whose business is the acquisition and use of land for the purpose of constructing and operating a landfill, no matter how much is spent on site restoration, the loss in value will be complete. Officials therefore support a deduction for a loss in land value in these circumstances. Officials recommend that the deduction be granted by putting the land on revenue account (this would need to be done in such a way that deductions were still available under DB 37). A deduction would then be available on sale of the site. This methodology would also provide for the ability to tax any gain on the value of the land should this ever result. Taxpayers should be required to elect that land is held on revenue account within one year of the legislation being enacted or from date of purchase thereafter. In order to ensure a consistent treatment, all of a taxpayer’s landfill sites and those of any associated parties would need to be treated on a consistent basis. Officials also consider that a deduction should not be available for losses generated from related- party transactions. Officials also recommend that part C of schedule 6B be amended to make it clear that no deduction is permitted for the cost of land, other than in the situation described above. Retirement of land In broadening the categories of tax deductible environmental expenditure, officials have worked closely with Ministry for the Environment to ensure that the proposed rules are broad enough to cover alternative solutions to environmental issues – for example, riparian planting and the use of wetlands as natural filters. In its submission in support of the proposed amendments to the tax treatment of business environmental expenditure, Environment Waikato has sought clarification that tax deductions will be available for any agricultural land that is retired for the purposes of reducing pollution. The types of expenses incurred in retiring land include fencing, planting and installing alternative water supplies. 139 For taxpayers carrying on a farming business, expenditure incurred on fencing, planting and installing alternative water supplies (such as troughs and pipes) should already be tax deductible or amortisable: • via a tax depreciation deduction for assets such as fences, pipes and tanks; • under section DP 1 for the cost of planting a commercial forest; • under section DO 2 for farmers who plant and maintain trees for purposes of preventing or combating erosion or providing shelter; and • under section DO 3 (up to $7,500 per year) for farmers who incur costs in planting and maintaining trees. As the costs associated with retiring agricultural land for environmental purposes should already be deductible, officials do not consider that any amendments are required to schedule 6B. Riparian versus screen planting The waste management industry has submitted that there should be no distinction between riparian and screen planting and that both types of expenditure should be 100% tax deductible when incurred. The cost of riparian planting 1 is considered to be preventative environmental expenditure. Similarly, screen planting 2 is seen as preventative environmental expenditure. As such, both categories of expenditure have a default deduction period of the lesser of 35 years or the length of the applicable resource consent. Where this is not appropriate taxpayers are able to apply for a special amortisation rate which would allow for a deduction over a shorter period. Therefore, there is no disparity in the tax treatment afforded to these two types of expenditure. Both categories of expenditure have been classified as environmental improvement expenditure because they result in some future benefit (such as the reducing visual impact of the improvement or reducing the amount of contaminants entering the water). They are not in the nature of site restoration expenditure (which involves removing historic contamination). Therefore, officials disagree with the submission that riparian and screen planting should be immediately deductible using a 100% amortisation rate. Definition of environmental testing and feasibility expenditure A number of submitters have suggested that the words “before a choice between options, of locations and methods...” in paragraph 1 of part A should be replaced with “before a commitment is made to an option”. 1 The planting of trees or shrubs adjacent to a body of water in order to reduce the amount of contaminants in surface runoff and shallow ground water. 2 The planting of trees to reduce the visual impact of an environmental improvement such as a landfill. 140 Paragraph 1 relates to environmental testing and feasibility expenditure. Inland Revenue’s position of the deductibility of general feasibility expenditure is set out in the draft interpretation statement – IS2783. Expenditure may be denied a deduction on the basis that it was incurred with a view to bringing into existence an enduring benefit or in relation to the profit-making structure of the business. In these circumstances, the critical issue is whether a decision has been made to commit to a particular proposal – for example, to acquire or develop a particular asset. Once a decision has been made to proceed with a particular course of action, any expenditure incurred after that time will be treated as relating to the underlying capital project and thereby to the profit-making structure of the business and will not be tax deductible. The wording “before a choice between options, of locations and methods...” was used in paragraph 1 to ensure consistency with the general tests for deductible feasibility expenditure. Submitters consider that these words are unnecessarily vague and that it may be difficult in certain circumstances to determine exactly when a “choice between options, of locations and methods” is made. They also consider that the preferred wording “before a final decision or commitment is made” is consistent with the wording used in proposed section DB 37(4)(b)(ii). Officials’ key concern with the wording in paragraph 1 is that it is consistent with the general test for tax-deductible feasibility expenditure. In order to increase taxpayer certainty, officials consider that the wording (“decision has been made to commit” to a location or method for an activity) from the draft interpretation statement should be adopted. This will increase taxpayer certainty, thereby addressing submitters concerns, as there is specific Inland Revenue commentary on the meaning of this phrase. If the amending legislation is enacted, Inland Revenue will also publish a Tax Information Bulletin article on the changes. This will include examples illustrating how the definition of environmental feasibility and testing expenditure should be interpreted. Definition of environmental construction expenditure Paragraph 2 of part A deals with expenditure incurred in the construction of an improvement to avoid or mitigate the effects of a future discharge of contaminants. A number of submitters have suggested that the words “expenditure on the construction of an improvement to land...” in paragraph 2 should be replaced by “expenditure in the construction on land”. The suggested wording would be more consistent with that used in section DJ 10, which has been the subject of judicial interpretation. 3 Adopting, as closely as possible, the wording from the current provision would increase taxpayer certainty by ensuring that existing commentary and guidance remains applicable. 3 Waste Management Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,092, Waste Management NZ Limited v C of IR CA 55 /94. 141 Definition of expenditure The waste management industry has submitted that “expenditure” be defined to include those items anticipated to fall within the ambit of schedule 6B parts A and B. Schedule 6B sets out those categories of tax deductible environmental expenditure. The term “expenditure” is not defined for the purposes of the section. 4 Therefore, in determining the meaning of this term it is necessary to apply the rules of statutory interpretation. Section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 states that the “meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in light of its purposes”. Such an approach must be adopted unless the enactment provides otherwise or the context of the enactment requires otherwise (section 4(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999). CIR v Alcan New Zealand Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175 is the leading case on the principles of statutory interpretation. In Alcan, the Court of Appeal said it was fundamental that “words be given their ordinary meaning”. The court stated that there must be a strong reason before words can be given some other meaning which they are capable of bearing in a particular context. If words are capable of more than one meaning, and the object of the legislation is clear, then the words must be given “such fair, large and liberal construction” as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act. Given these principles and the significant amount of case law on the meaning of the term expenditure, 5 officials do not consider that it is necessary to include a definition as part of the proposed changes. It is clear that if an amount meets the conditions in section DB 37 and is listed in Parts A or B of the proposed schedule 6B, that a tax deduction will be available. Recommendations That the submission in relation to tax deductions for environmental dredging be accepted. Officials recommend that part C of schedule 6B be amended to exempt dredging other than environmental dredging. Environmental dredging could be defined as dredging principally incurred to avoid, remedy or mitigate the discharge of contaminants. That the submissions requesting a tax deduction for a loss on land be accepted for business taxpayers who acquire and use land for the purposes of constructing a landfill footprint. Officials also recommend that part C of schedule 6B be amended to make it clear that no deduction is permitted for the cost of land, other than in relation to landfills. Losses should also not be available in respect of related-party transactions, and associated parties should be required to adopt the same tax treatment. 4 There is a definition of expenditure in section OB 1. However, this is only defined for the purposes of section DD 2(7) (Limitation rule) and section DW 1(2) (Airport operators). 5 NZTBR Case 7, M of NR v Wrights’ Canadian Ropes Limited \[1947\] AC 109, C of IR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61, 236, Case E48 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,285. 142 That the submission on amendments to cater for retiring agricultural land be rejected as these costs are already tax deductible under other provisions of the tax legislation. That the submission that riparian and screen planting should be immediately deductible using a 100% amortisation rate should be rejected. That the submission requesting amendment of the definition of environmental feasibility expenditure should be accepted but that the wording in paragraph 1 of part A should be amended to be consistent with Inland Revenue’s draft interpretation statement on feasibility expenditure. That the submission requesting amendment of the definition of environmental construction expenditure should be accepted. The submission that “expenditure” be defined for the purposes of the environmental tax rules should be rejected. Tax deduction for dealing with by-products Officials also recommend that part B of schedule 6B should be amended to ensure that a deduction is available for dealing with by-products that would constitute a contaminant if discharged into the environment. In carrying on their business, taxpayers may create by-products which could constitute a contaminant if discharged into the environment. In order to prevent this and to ensure compliance with environmental legislation and local government regulations, taxpayers can either deal with these by-products as and when they occur, or if that is not feasible, store the by-products until they are able to deal with them. Regular expenditure incurred in dealing with by-products while a business is operating should fall within the general deductibility provisions. Similarly, capital expenditure incurred to construct depreciable assets for storing by-products (such as tanks) should receive a depreciation deduction. However, an issue over tax deductibility does arise where taxpayers store by-products until the cessation of a business and then incur expenditure to deal with these. It is our view that such costs fall within site restoration expenditure and should receive the same treatment. However, the definition of remediation expenditure relies on the words “discharge of a contaminant”. If stored and dealt with correctly, such by-products will never constitute a contaminant. Officials therefore recommend that part B of the proposed schedule 6B should be amended to ensure that a deduction is available for dealing with by-products that would constitute a contaminant if discharged into the environment. 143 LINKS TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AND PROJECTS Submission (19 – Environment Waikato) There should be a fully integrated review of legislation relating to environmental contamination and a tax deduction should only be available for restoration expenditure when the restoration has been carried out to a suitable standard. Comment Environmental review While there are links between the current proposals and the regulation of contamination generally, the issues being addressed through these changes are tax- specific. The current tax rules for environmental expenditure are narrow, uncertain and do not lead to a correct measurement of taxable income. These tax issues would not differ under any other form of environmental regulation. Therefore, officials consider that the current proposals should proceed and that any general review of environmental regulation is outside the scope of the current bill. Restoration to a suitable standard While Environment Waikato supports the extension of the existing environmental expenditure provision, it has submitted that a deduction for remediation of contaminated land should be available only when remediation works have been carried out to a suitable standard. The submission refers to the Ministry for the Environment’s guidelines for assessment and management of contaminated land. Site restoration and remediation is regulated by the Resource Management Act 1991 and other environmental legislation. It is not the purpose of the Income Tax Act 2004 to regulate environmental activities. As such, officials do not agree with the submission that tax deductions should only be available if the relevant environmental standards are met. However, while the issues being addressed by these proposals are tax-related, it is still desirable for the tax legislation in this area to be consistent with environmental regulation. To ensure this is the case, Inland Revenue officials have worked closely with the Ministry for the Environment and local government representatives. To obtain a tax deduction for environmental expenditure, taxpayers will need to meet the normal self-assessment obligations for obtaining and documenting a tax deduction. This will include maintaining evidence that they have incurred site restoration expenditure. Compliance with environmental standards would be part of this process. This will be stressed in the Tax Information Bulletin article which will follow enactment of any amending legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 144 LINKS TO THE DEPRECIATION REGIME Submissions (22 – KPMG, 25 – Foodstuffs (South Island) Limited, 26W – Waste Industry, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The relationship between section DB 37 and the tax depreciation regime should be clarified to: • allow “tied assets” to be amortised at the rate applicable to the environmental improvement to which they relate; • mean that additional expenditure on a depreciable asset incurred because of site restoration should qualify for immediate deduction; and • allow cell 6 construction costs to be amortised over the life of the cell, as determined pursuant to a special depreciation determination issued by the Commissioner. Comment Tied assets The waste management industry and KPMG have both submitted that section DB 37 should be amended to ensure that the write-off period for depreciable assets that are “tied” 7 to a landfill operation (such as roads and buildings) should be no longer than the period of the remaining resource consent period granted. In addition, if the landfill were to close earlier, the remaining tax book value of those tied assets should be written off in the year of closure. Both the current and proposed sections dealing with environmental expenditure are drafted as sections of last resort. This means that a deduction is only available under these provisions if it is not available under any other provision in the income tax legislation (for example, tax depreciation or as regular business expenditure). Therefore, depreciable assets which form part of a landfill (or other environmental expenditure) operation are tax deductible under the tax depreciation regime and not the environmental expenditure section. This meets the general policy objective of treating all capital expenditure consistently for tax purposes and ideally under the same (depreciation) regime. It is only in exceptional circumstances where the nature of the expenditure does not permit inclusion in the depreciation regime that a tax deduction will be available elsewhere. Therefore, officials recommend that the submission regarding the inclusion of tax deductions for tied depreciable assets under section DB 37 be rejected. Instead, the issue of tied assets is being dealt with as part of the depreciation review. 6 Landfills are often constructed in parts, called “cells”. 7 When the economic life of an asset is inextricably linked to the life of an income-earning process that is significantly shorter than the estimated useful life of the asset. 145 Changes are already included within the current bill to improve the tax treatment of tied assets (refer to clauses 93 and 94 of the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill). Taxpayers with tied assets can currently apply to Inland Revenue for a special (and generally faster) tax depreciation rate. However, a key requirement when applying for a special tax depreciation rate is that taxpayers be able to provide sufficient information to the Commissioner in support of an application. This includes identifying the actual economic life of an asset with a very high degree of certainty. If the actual economic life of an asset cannot be clearly ascertained, a special tax depreciation rate will generally not be allowed. Under the changes included in the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the requirement on the Commissioner to have a very high degree of certainty is to be relaxed to make it easier for taxpayers to obtain a special tax depreciation rate. This should make it easier for taxpayers to obtain a tax depreciation rate for tied assets to reflect actual economic life. Expenditure on depreciable assets as part of site restoration Similarly, officials do not support the submissions that section DB 37(4)(a) be amended to clarify that additional expenditure on a depreciable asset incurred because of site restoration should qualify for immediate deduction. As noted above, section DB 37 has been drafted as a section of last resort consistent with the current provision and policy that where possible deductions for capital expenditure should be handled under the depreciation regime. Therefore, where expenditure is incurred on a depreciable asset (even as part of a site restoration project) then the appropriate place for a tax deduction is through the tax depreciation regime. Where a project involves both the construction of a depreciable asset and site restoration it will be a matter of the particular facts and the taxpayers records as to which expenditure was incurred on site restoration (deductible under section DB 37) and which was incurred on the depreciable asset (deductible as tax depreciation). Deduction for cell construction costs KPMG and the waste management industry have submitted that all cell construction costs should be amortised over the life of the cell, as determined by CIR determination. Proposed section DB 37 allows a deduction for business environmental expenditure over the estimated life of that expenditure. Feasibility, monitoring and restoration costs are all immediately deductible. Environmental “construction” expenditure has a default estimated life of the lesser of 35 years or the applicable resource consent period. However, where this is not appropriate, taxpayers are able to apply for a category-specific rate issued by the Commissioner. 146 From discussions with the waste management industry, officials understand that cell construction costs are likely to meet the criteria for a special rate. However, as noted above, a deduction under proposed section DB 37 is only available for costs that fall outside the other sections of the income tax legislation. Therefore, any depreciable assets which form part of an environmental improvement will continue to be deductible under the tax depreciation regime. However, taxpayers will be able to apply for a special depreciation rate to match the write-off period for other cell construction costs where these constitute tied assets (as discussed above). Recommendations That the submissions regarding the inclusion of tax deductions for tied depreciable assets be rejected as the issue of tied assets is being dealt with as part of the depreciation review. That the submissions that additional expenditure on a depreciable asset incurred because of site restoration should qualify for a deduction under DB 37 be rejected. That the submission with respect to including depreciable assets as part of the proposed section DB 37 deduction be declined. 147 DRAFTING Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 25 – Foodstuffs (South Island) Limited, 26W – Waste Industry, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There are a number of drafting references and formulas that need to corrected, including: • the formula proposed in section DB 37(2); • the reference to section DB 37(3)(c) in section 91AL(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; • the lack of reference to aftercare costs in section DB 37(4)(a); • the formula in section DB 37(6); and • the reference to section CB 24B(6) contained in the section OB 1 definition of diminished value. Comment DB 37(2) It has been submitted that the formula in proposed section DB 37(2) needs to be corrected in relation to the definition of diminished value. As discussed above, officials support the submission to move from a diminishing value to straight line deduction for business environmental expenditure. In doing so, the above issues will also be addressed. DB 37(3)(c) This is a drafting error and officials agree that the reference in section 91AL(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be to section DB 37(4)(c). DB 37(4)(a) This is a drafting error and officials agree that the reference in section DB 37(4)(a) should be amended to include aftercare costs in part B of schedule 6B. A 100% rate of deduction should apply to expenditure specified in paragraph 1 of part A and part B of schedule 6B, provided it is not excluded expenditure as set out in part C of the schedule. DB 37(6) Submitters’ concerns with the assumed life formula in proposed section DB 37(6) related to its appropriateness for a diminished value deduction. As discussed above, officials support the submission to move from a diminishing value to a straight line deduction for business environmental expenditure. In doing so, the above issue will also be addressed. 148 Diminished value definition It has been submitted that the section reference in the section OB 1 definition of diminished value is incorrect. As discussed above, officials support the submission to move from a diminishing value to straight line deduction for business environmental expenditure. In doing so the above issues will also be addressed. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issues relating to the diminished value formula and definition will be resolved as the result of accepting other submissions on these points. 149 NEED FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION ACCOUNT Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 26W – Waste Industry) A payment should not be required to the environmental restoration account (ERA) before a tax deduction is allowed. Comment Deduction for accounting restoration provision A number of parties have submitted that a tax deduction for site restoration should be available without the need to make a payment to an ERA. In general this would mean allowing a tax deduction for the level of a taxpayer’s accounting restoration provision. While allowing a deduction for an accounting restoration provision would ensure matching of income and deductions, it would also open up the tax rules to manipulation through over-estimation and would contradict the established taxation treatment of accounting provisions. It would also introduce a mismatch between the tax treatment of those making and those receiving payments for restoration expenditure as the income tax legislation does not tax recipients on estimated income. While there are a small number of exceptions to the general policy position that accounting provisions are not tax deductible, these tend to be very industry-specific and do not have the across-the-board application of business environmental costs. Therefore, officials do not support the submission that a deduction should be available for a taxpayer’s accounting restoration provision. A tax deduction based on payments to an ERA (while still linked to the level of the accounting provision) solves the issue of matching income and expenditure while ensuring consistency with the general policy on provisions and providing protection for Inland Revenue against excess tax deductions for environmental expenditure. It also has the added benefit of setting aside a pool of money specifically dedicated to restoration of the environment. In addition, the ERA is a voluntary fund. Where taxpayers’ accounting provisions meet the incurred test they will still be able to claim a tax deduction based on the level of the accounting provision (as is the position under the current law). The ERA proposals do not alter this position but merely provide a solution for those taxpayers who are unable to meet the incurred test. Recommendation That the submissions should be rejected. 150 DESIGN OF THE ERA Submissions (16 – Federated Farmers, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The design of the ERA should be amended to: • cater for taxpayers with more than one site; • allow taxpayers in a loss or tax-neutral position to benefit from the proposal; • allow surplus funds, that cannot be matched by restoration expenditure because the restoration has been completed, to be withdrawn; • allow more than one payment and more than one refund in an income year; • accommodate amalgamating companies which made or received more than one payment during the year; • treat income from refunds as being derived in the year that the taxpayer receives the refund rather than the year of application; • make the transfer criteria in section EK 15(3) easier to satisfy; and • remove the time bar waiver in section EK 17. Comment Catering for taxpayers with multiple sites A number of taxpayers have submitted that the ERA proposals should be amended to cater for those taxpayers who have multiple sites. Taxpayers with multiple sites could be in a position to obtain a refund on one site while making payments on another site. Officials disagree with this view. The ERA is closely linked to a taxpayer’s accounting provision. Therefore, if a taxpayer’s accounting provision caters for more than one site on a net basis it is correct that the ERA operates on the same basis. Catering for taxpayers in a tax loss/neutral position At present taxpayers must be in a taxpaying position at the time they make payments to the ERA to benefit from the tax deductions obtained. It has been submitted that the ERA proposals should be amended to allow taxpayers in a tax-loss or tax-neutral position to benefit from the proposals. Officials do not agree with this view. The ERA proposals are a response to requests for tax deductions for accounting restoration provisions. Taxpayers in a tax-loss or tax-neutral position would be unable to benefit from a tax deduction for the level of their accounting provision. The ERA proposals are therefore consistent with the treatment taxpayers originally requested. 151 The ERA proposals also allow taxpayers to make deposits to the ERA over a long period and (other than the spreading provision) for any amount up to the level of their accounting provision. This provides considerable flexibility and limits the likelihood that a taxpayer would be in a tax-loss position when making deposits. Withdrawal of surplus funds Federated Farmers has submitted that taxpayers should be able to withdraw surplus funds that cannot be matched by restoration expenditure because restoration has been completed. Officials agree that this should be the case. The level of the ERA is driven by a taxpayer’s accounting restoration provision. Where the balance in a taxpayer’s ERA exceeds 33% of their accounting restoration provision, the Commissioner is required to refund the balance. If a taxpayer had completed site restoration then presumably their accounting restoration provision would be nil. Any balance left in the ERA would therefore be refunded. Multiple refunds and payments Officials had originally recommended that ERA refunds and payments be limited to one per year because of concerns regarding potential manipulation of the account, resulting in unintended policy outcomes. Officials were also keen to keep compliance and administration costs low by streamlining the account. However, a number of parties have submitted that only allowing one payment or one refund per income year is too restrictive and does not cater for a change in taxpayer circumstances. Officials acknowledge these concerns and would be willing to support a change to allow multiple payments and refunds. However, to reduce the risk of unintended policy outcomes, officials recommend that a purpose provision is introduced to make it clear that an ERA is only to be used by businesses for the purpose of matching business income with environmental expenditure. Amendments to EK 20 Proposed section EK 20 provides for the transfer of an environmental restoration account from an amalgamating company to an amalgamated company where the amalgamating company ceases to exist in an income year. A number of parties have submitted that the provision requires amendment to provide for the situation where both companies have either made payments to, or received refunds (including transfers) from their respective accounts during the income year. Officials agree that the provision should allow for multiple payments or refunds in the period prior to amalgamation. Derivation of income PricewaterhouseCoopers has submitted that income resulting from a refund from the ERA (proposed section EK 13) should be derived in the year that the taxpayer receives the refund rather than the year that the Commissioner receives the application for the refund. 152 The general principle for derivation of income is that an amount is derived even if it has not actually been received. However, there are exceptions to this rule – for example, compensation for loss of trading stock and loss of depreciable property. Officials agree that deeming income to be derived once a refund is received will increase taxpayer certainty and therefore we support the submission. Transfer criteria The design of the ERA provides for the transfer of balances in the account to another taxpayer where the restoration liability has also been transferred – for example, where contaminated land has been sold to another taxpayer. PricewaterhouseCoopers has submitted that there may be situations where it will be difficult for a taxpayer to satisfy the transfer conditions in proposed section EK 15(3) and that the wording of section EK 15 should be reconsidered. Under section EK 15(3), a taxpayer is able to treat a transfer as a payment to their ERA provided that the restoration obligation has been transferred to that person and the person would have been entitled to make an equivalent payment to the ERA. The ability to make a payment to an ERA is restricted by certain requirements (such as no multiple payments and the maximum payment amount). As previously discussed, officials support the submission to allow multiple payments. Therefore, this restriction will no longer apply. The maximum payment restriction is included as part of the ERA to ensure that tax deductions mirror the accounting treatment of restoration expenditure. However, after considering the issues in the submission, officials recommend that proposed section EK 15 be amended to clarify that taxpayers will only be able to apply for a transfer from their ERA where they have transferred the restoration liability to another taxpayer. The transferee will be able to treat a transfer as a payment up to the level of their maximum account balance. Where the transfer causes the transferee’s ERA to exceed the maximum account balance (as at the end of the income year) the Commissioner will be required to transfer the excess amount back to the transferor (effective as at the date of the original transfer). Time bar Proposed section EK 17 gives the Commissioner the power to alter an assessment at any time, despite the time bar, in order to allow a deduction for a payment or transfer, treat a refund as income, or transfer the balance of the fund on death, bankruptcy or liquidation. While this power is consistent with that available to the Commissioner under the IES regime, officials agree that the Commissioner should be able to achieve all of the above actions without the need to waive the time bar. 153 Recommendations That the submission with respect to multiple sites be rejected. That the submission on catering for taxpayers in a tax-loss or tax-neutral position be rejected. Officials agree with the submission on excess funds but consider that no amendment is required to deal with this issue. Officials support the submissions on multiple payments and refunds but recommend that a purpose provision is introduced to make it clear that an ERA is to be used only by businesses for the purpose of matching of business income and environmental expenditure. Officials agree with the submissions on accommodating amalgamating companies which made or received more than one payment during the year. Officials support the submission to treat income from refunds as being derived in the year that the taxpayer receives the refund rather than the year of application. That the submission requesting clarification of the transfer provisions be accepted. That the time bar submission be accepted. 154 INTEREST RULES Submissions (15W – Business NZ, 16 – Federated Farmers, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 26W – Waste Industry, 28W – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The ERA interest rules should be amended to: • revise the interest rate upwards to make it more commercially aligned, at least to the use-of-money interest (UOMI) rate for tax overpayments; • ensure consistency with the existing UOMI rules; • make interest payable from the date of payment by the taxpayer; • give taxpayers the option of having interest paid directly to them rather than automatically credited to the ERA; and • clarify when interest is deemed to be derived by the holder of an ERA. Comment Interest rate Taxpayers have requested a deduction for estimated site restoration expenditure. While officials agree that some form of deduction should be granted in order to correctly measure business income, it must be borne in mind that any deduction is likely to be claimed long before any money is actually spent on restoration. If officials granted a deduction for estimated expenditure and also allowed taxpayers a refund of the associated tax, taxpayers would be able to invest this cash at interest until such time as site restoration expenditure is actually incurred. The position is the same as if the government retains the cash but pays a market rate of interest on the account. The government should not be paying interest to reflect time value of money as taxpayers incur no such cost. While the theoretically correct answer is nil interest on ERA deposits, officials recommended that a small amount of interest (3% p.a.) be paid on deposits in order to compensate taxpayers for the compliance cost associated with maintaining an ERA. This is equivalent to the interest rate paid on the income equalisation scheme. Officials do not agree with the submission that a market value of interest should be paid on deposits. 155 Consistency with the UOMI rules Several parties have submitted that the interest rules applying to the ERA should be consistent with the UOMI rules. Officials agree that it is important that a consistent rationale should be applied by Inland Revenue with respect to interest. However, due to the specific nature of the ERA it is not appropriate to adopt the UOMI interest rules. For example, as discussed above, it is not appropriate to pay a market interest rate. Officials therefore do not agree with submissions that the UOMI rules be adopted for the purposes of the ERA. Date of commencement Under the proposed ERA interest rules, interest on deposits commences from the date that a deposit is acknowledged as received. A number of parties have submitted that this should be the date of payment. Under the UOMI regime, interest is calculated from the day after the tax is paid. Officials would he happy to accept a similar approach for the ERA. Interest paid directly to taxpayers The interest rules in proposed section EK 6 are based on those for the IES. IES interest included in any refund is gross income of the taxpayer. However, resident withholding tax (RWT) is deducted at the time that the interest is credited. A similar approach could be adopted for the ERA. However, ERAs have the added complication that any refund (including any interest) forms part of a taxpayer’s gross income at the grossed-up rate. Crediting interest to the ERA also raises questions about how the maximum deposit amount should be calculated (inclusive or exclusive of the interest) and the impact of transferring balances in the fund (whether accumulated interest is included in the transfer) to other taxpayers. To avoid complications with the treatment of interest paid on ERA deposits, officials recommend that interest is paid directly to the taxpayer rather than being credited to the ERA. 8 The interest would form part of gross income (and be subject to the normal non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and RWT rules at the date that it is paid). The Corporate Taxpayers Group has submitted that taxpayers should have the option of having interest paid directly to them rather than being credited to the ERA. Due to complications which arise with having interest credited to the ERA, officials support this submission. Date interest income derived The waste management industry has submitted that the proposed legislation should clarify when interest paid on ERA deposits is taxable. 8 Care will need to be taken in the drafting to avoid issues with circularity. 156 As discussed above, to avoid complications with the treatment of interest paid on ERA deposits, officials are supporting a submission to have interest paid directly to taxpayers on 31 March each year (or the date that the last refund is made form the ERA) rather than being credited to the account. The interest would form part of gross income (and be subject to the normal NRWT and RWT rules) at the date that it is paid. This is consistent with the UOMI regime. Recommendations That the submission to pay interest of more than 3% be rejected. That the submissions regarding adoption of the UOMI rules should be rejected. That the submissions calling for a change to the commencement date for interest should be accepted. That the submission regarding the payment of interest directly to taxpayers be accepted. That the submissions regarding clarification of interest derivation be accepted. This issue can be addressed as part of a change to annual payment of interest rather than crediting of interest to the ERA. 157 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The transitional spreading provisions should be extended to cater for those taxpayers who may be closing a site before the expiration of the five year period. Comment Under the ERA proposals taxpayers will be allowed to make payments into the ERA in respect of historic restoration liabilities. This is consistent with the objective of encouraging site restoration. However, in allowing this, the cost of the changes to the government rises significantly. In order to spread this cost, taxpayers will not be able to obtain an immediate deduction for these historic restoration liabilities but are required to spread the deduction over the first five years of the regime. While this spreading mechanism may possible disadvantage any taxpayer who ceases operations during the five year period, officials consider that it is necessary to spread the estimated $100 million cost of the proposals. The alternative would be to deny all deductions for historic site restoration liabilities. The spreading mechanism is also only a transitional measure and after the initial five year period taxpayers will be able to claim full deductions up to the level of their accounting restoration provision. Recommendation That the submission be rejected. 158 DRAFTING Submissions (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 26W – Waste Industry, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There are a number of drafting references which need to corrected or clarified, including: • the reference in proposed section EK 4(3)(c) to section EK 7; • the lack of reference to transfers pursuant to section EK 16 in proposed sections EK 4(6)(a) and EK 8(1); • the reference to section EK 15(3) in section EK 8(4); • the lack of reference to other forms of ERA transfer in section EK 12 (subsections (2)(b),(2)(a)(iii) and (8)) and the words “for the environmental restoration account” in section EK 12(8); and • clarification that section CB 24B sets out the gross up calculation for proposed section EK 13. Comment EK 4(3)(c) Officials agree that this is a drafting error and the reference should be to interest paid under section EK 6. However, if interest is no longer credited to the ERA (as discussed above) then this reference will not be required. EK 4(6)(a) and EK 8(1) It has been submitted that proposed sections EK 4(6)(a) and EK 8(1) should also refer to transfers pursuant to section 16. Officials agree that this is a drafting error and support the submission. EK 8(4) It has been submitted that proposed section EK 8(4) should be amended to refer to section EK 15(3) and that transfers under sections EK 16 and EK 20 should be treated as a transfer. Officials agree that this is a drafting error and that the correct reference is to section EK 15(3). Officials also agree that transfers to a persons ERA under section EK 16 and EK 20 should also be treated as payments. EK 12 It has been submitted that the wording of section EK 12(b) should be clarified by expanding the reference to transfers to include those transfers possible under sections EK 16 and EK 20. Officials agree with this submission. 159 Likewise officials agree that proposed sections EK 12(2)(a)(iii) and EK 12(8) should also refer to transfers under sections EK 16 and 20. PricewaterhouseCoopers have also submitted that the words “for the environmental restoration account” should be removed from section EK 12(8) as they are unnecessary. Officials agree that the term “maximum account balance” is adequately defined in section EK 24 and that the words “for the environmental restoration account” could be removed. EK 13 A number of parties submitted that for clarity the proposed section EK 13 should expressly state that the amount of the refund should be calculated pursuant to section CB 24B. Officials agree that this would increase taxpayer certainty and support the submission. Recommendation Officials agree that all the submissions should be accepted subject to a decision on whether interest will continue to be credited to the ERA. 160 REMOVAL OF THE WORD INDUSTRIAL Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That all taxpayers should be able to take advantage of the retrospective application of the proposed amended wording of section DJ 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment In setting categories of business environmental expenditure and deduction rates, the aim was to ensure tax deductions were available for all environmental expenditure (no matter what the source of the waste). Officials did not want to create incentives for taxpayers to select one environmental solution over another. The bill therefore includes a proposal to amend section DJ 10 to remove the word “industrial” so that a tax deduction is available for dealing with all forms of waste. This change is retrospective (to 1994) to protect taxpayers who have taken a wide interpretation of the term “industrial waste” (either in filing their tax returns or in raising a dispute with Inland Revenue). Taxpayers who have not taken a wide interpretation of the legislation are not able to take advantage of the retrospective change (in order to protect the tax base from opportunists). Officials consulted on the proposed application date to ensure that those taxpayers who had taken a position on the definition of industrial waste would be able to take advantage of the retrospective change. Officials are not aware of any taxpayer who took a position with respect to the definition of industrial waste or who would not be able to take advantage of the retrospective change. Recommendation That the submission should be declined. 161 Other policy matters 162 163 TAX EXEMPTION FOR PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT Issue: Extending the exemption to include income from related activities Clauses 8 and 66 Submission (11 – The Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand, 12W – Ernst & Young for Swire Pacific Offshore Holdings Limited, 15W – Business New Zealand, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The main thrust of the submissions is that additional activities should be included in the exemption because those activities form an integral part of the exploration and development of oil and gas. That the “183-day rule” causes persons who offer these services to leave New Zealand to avoid paying tax and that this causes significant compliance costs. In particular, that: • the exemption be extended to apply to income derived by support and supply vessels for offshore drilling rigs; • the exemption be extended to include suppliers of various related services; • other types of survey of the earth’s crust should be exempted; and • the exemption should also be extended to owners of the seismic survey vessels that are exempt, not just the operator. Comment The aim of the amendment is to remove a barrier in the tax system that caused offshore drilling rigs and seismic ships to enter and leave New Zealand for tax reasons. The concern was that the “183 day rule” was leading to a churning of rigs and seismic ships. The high mobilisation and demobilisation costs meant that the effect of churning was delaying or discouraging efficient exploration activities. It is important to note that the policy is not intended to give a blanket exemption to any activity that relates to gas exploration. If such an exemption was proposed it would be difficult to defend against calls for tax concessions for other sectors of the economy. The exemption has been deliberately targeted at specific activities where general principles of taxation were posing a huge barrier to particular exploration activity. 164 Support and supply vessels The industry is primarily concerned that the exemption advanced to offshore drilling rigs be extended to support and supply vessels. In short, their argument is that these vessels are integral to the operation of the drilling rigs. Typically an offshore drilling rig cannot operate without the services of two supply and support vessels before, during, and after the drilling of the well. These support and supply vessels are needed to supply services and to be on hand in case of an emergency. The main difficulty in recommending an extension of the exemption to support and supply vessels is that continuing to tax these vessels will not have a material (adverse) impact on the amount of drilling that takes place in New Zealand during the period of the incentives package. While these vessels may churn in response to tax, the costs of mobilising and demobilising are simply not of the same order as those costs associated with the churning of drilling rigs. At most, the absence of an exemption would create some logistical complexity and possibly some increased costs in relation to the execution of a drilling programme. In addition, while we accept the industry’s view that the prospect of a New Zealand firm becoming substantially involved in this activity is fairly remote – at least in the next few years, it can’t be ruled out altogether. We understand local firms have undertaken some work on drilling rig platforms in the past. If this is the case, the existence of an exemption would make a New Zealand supplier of services – even of just some services such as delivery of food and supplies – uncompetitive. Yet extending the exemption to include New Zealand residents would create significant efficiency and equity concerns for all New Zealanders. Finally, there will always be tax complexity and potential leakage around legislating and administering tax exemptions. These lead to increased compliance and administrative costs as well as risk to the tax base. Consequently, it is preferable to keep tax exemptions to an absolute minimum. Ancillary services Submissions sought extension of the exemption to all services that are ancillary to offshore petroleum exploration. The same arguments mentioned above in relation to supply and support services apply. That is, there is no case that is analogous to the problem of the churning of the rigs referred to above. Extending the exemption would create serious boundary problems for the administration of the tax system. Moreover, wider application of the exemption would raise competitive neutrality issues vis-à-vis resident providers of services. Other types of surveying One submission argued that the exemption should be amended to exempt the income derived by surveyors using any survey method to identify and develop petroleum deposits. While it is possible to use other surveying methods, seismic surveying is the primary exploration tool used in offshore exploration and is regarded as most effective method available. As with the other submissions, it is necessary to make distinctions to ensure that the exemption is properly targeted and not framed in too broad a fashion. 165 Owners of drilling rigs The aim of the reform is to remove a tax barrier to entities that actually perform the drilling rig/seismic operations – regardless of whether they own or lease the equipment they use. There is no basis for extending the exemption to offshore owners of drilling rigs that lease their equipment to operators. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Exemption should be automatically given Clauses 8 and 66 Submission (15W – Business New Zealand, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG) That the exemption be automatically given, rather than being applied for. That it be clarified whether a certificate of exemption from non-resident contractors’ withholding tax should be applied for when income derived by the non-resident is exempt from tax. Comment The submission raises the question whether the entities covered by the exemption should have to apply for a certificate of exemption from Non-resident Contractors’ Withholding Tax (NRCWT). The NRCWT regime requires a New Zealand employer who makes a contract payment to a non-resident contractor to withhold tax from that payment. In situations where the non-resident contractor does not have to pay tax, because of the operation of a double tax agreement or otherwise, the non-resident contractor can apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a certificate of exemption. Where a certificate of exemption is obtained, payments can be made to the non- resident contractor without any NRCWT being withheld. The submissions request a special rule removing this requirement for entities covered by the exemption. However, the reason for the certificate of exemption procedure is that it provides the Inland Revenue with important information needed to ensure the integrity of the tax system. In other situations where entities are not subject to income tax – for example, because of a double tax agreement exemption, they are still liable under the NRCWT rules and a certificate of exemption must be applied for. There would seem to be no reason why this requirement should be removed for entities covered by the present exemption. 166 The KPMG submission makes the point that it would appear to be ultra vires the regulation making power to require a person to apply for an exemption certificate when the income they derive would be exempt income under the Income Tax Act. They make this submission on the basis that the withholding regulations derive their authority from the regulation-making powers in the PAYE rules, specifically section NC 21. The PAYE rules are expressed to apply “For the purpose of enabling the collection of income tax ...”. Because no income tax is payable, the argument is that the regulations cannot apply. However, the regulation-making power in section NC 21 is very wide. It allows the regulations to be made to declare payments as withholding payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. These include a contract payment to a non-resident contractor. This treatment is not affected by whether or not the payments are exempt in the hands of the recipient. In addition, the PAYE rules provide, specifically in section NC 1, that the rules will apply notwithstanding anything in the Income Tax Act, other than part KD. An application for a certificate of exemption is therefore still required, even though the income is exempt income under the Act. Entities who qualify for the exemption should therefore still apply for a certificate of exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Note that because the amendment is retrospective Inland Revenue should amend affected assessments Clauses 8 and 66 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the Committee note an expectation that the Commissioner will amend the assessments of taxpayers affected by the exemption to reflect the retrospective application of the amendment. Comment Because the exemption is retrospective to 1 January 2004 taxpayers eligible for the exemption may have filed their tax returns for the 2004 and 2005 income years based on the current law, that is, before the bill is enacted. Officials agree that the assessments of taxpayers affected by the exemption will need amending. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 167 Issue: Application date in the Explanatory Note to the bill is erroneous Clauses 8 and 66 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission contends that the application date in the Explanatory Note to the bill is erroneous. The application date is currently 25 August 2004 but should refer to 1 January 2004. Comment Officials agree that the application date in the Explanatory Note to the bill is incorrect. It should refer to 1 January 2004. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Whether the exemption should apply to New Zealand-residents Clauses 8 and 66 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the exemption not be restricted to non-residents, but also apply to New Zealand residents. Comment The exemption, as currently framed, applies only to non-residents. The reason for targeting only non-residents is that only non-residents currently provide the types of services covered by the exemption. In addition, non-residents are generally more sensitive to New Zealand taxes than residents because of their inherent mobility. It is also important to maintain a distinction between residents and non-residents because exempting residents may raise competitive-neutrality issues with other residents performing similar or substitutable services. Moreover, to open the exemption to resident companies could give rise to resident companies gaining access to income-sheltering opportunities. We do not know at the outset precisely what form these could take, but it does, in general terms, pose a risk to the tax base. The exemption should therefore remain restricted to non-resident companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 168 Issue: It is not clear when exploration and development starts and finishes Clauses 8 and 66 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the amendment lacks clarity as to when exploration and development activities commence and cease. Comment The terms exploration and development are not technical terms of art, but they are terms which have a widely recognised meaning in the industry. However, it is possible for a myriad of situations to arise and whether a well is a development well or not can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. It is not possible to exhaustively define what these terms mean. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to the earth’s crust is confusing Clauses 8 and 66 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the reference to the earth’s crust should be removed as it causes confusion. Comment Officials agree that the reference to the earth’s crust may be confusing because it is not clear what the crust of the earth represents. The crust may represent different depths in different offshore permit areas. Therefore, the reference to the earth’s crust should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 169 COOK ISLAND NATIONAL SUPERANNUATION FUND Issue: Residual issues relating to New Zealand-sourced income Clause 9 and 65 Submission (22 – KPMG) The amendment to exclude the foreign-sourced income from the income of the Cook Island National Superannuation Fund (the Fund) is appreciated. However, the amendment still leaves some residual issues relating to the treatment of New Zealand- sourced income. Preference is that the Fund be deemed not to be resident in New Zealand. Comment The Cook Island National Superannuation Fund is a compulsory national superannuation fund established under Cook Island legislation. Under current New Zealand tax law, the current governance structure is likely to result in the Fund being treated as a unit trust and therefore a company for tax purposes. Due to the administration, management and investment functions of the Fund being carried out in New Zealand by the Public Trust, as trustee for the Fund, it is likely that the centre of management of the Fund is in New Zealand, meaning the Fund will be resident in New Zealand. The fund is therefore likely to be a New Zealand-resident company for tax purposes and subject to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income at the rate of 33%. If it were not for the Public Trust being the trustee of the Fund, the Fund would be treated as a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes and therefore taxable only on its New Zealand sourced income. The proposed amendment exempts its foreign- sourced income from income tax which means that the Fund will be subject to tax on its New Zealand sourced income. The submitter has expressed a preference that the Fund be deemed not to be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. By being treated as a non-resident, the Fund would be able to receive interest on which approved issuer levy or non-resident withholding tax has been paid. The policy intent of the proposed amendment is to ensure that the Fund is treated for tax purposes in a manner similar to that of a non-resident. Officials accept that the proposed amendment does not achieve the policy intent because the Fund can not receive interest on which approved issue levy or non- resident withholding tax has been paid. Recommendation That the Fund be treated for tax purposes in a manner similar to that of a non-resident. 170 TAX RECOVERY PROVISION: APPLICATION TO CIVIL PENALTIES AND INTEREST Issue: Amendment should not be made Clause 49 Submission (29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment to section HK 11 should not be made. The amendment extends the scope of the section and no policy justification for the extension has been provided. The submission notes that the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 all included provisions with similar effect to section HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The new penalties and use-of-money interest rules were introduced in 1996 with application from the 1997-98 income year. Given that the application of section HK 11 was not extended at the time the penalties and interest rules were introduced, it is difficult to accept the contention that the amendment is “in line with the policy intent of the tax recovery provision”. Comment Officials do not agree with the submission’s view that the proposed amendment is not in line with the policy intent of the tax recovery provision. The tax recovery provision in its current form was enacted in 1992 as section 276 of the Income Tax Act 1976, with application from the 1992-93 income year. Section 276(5)(d) referred to the “proportion of any additional tax or other impost arising under this Act for late payment, which comprises part of the tax liability”. Section 421 of the Income Tax Act 1976 stated that penal tax “shall for all purposes be deemed to be tax of the same nature as the deficient tax”. These references were carried through to the Income Tax Act 1994 until they were replaced by the new penalties and interest rules which were enacted in 1996. Current section HK 11(4)(d) refers to the “proportion of any late payment penalty or interest arising under this Act or the Tax Administration Act 1994 for late payment, which comprises part of the tax liability”. Section 156A(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that “for all purposes relating to the recovery of an unpaid civil penalty by the Commissioner, the civil penalty is deemed to be a tax of the same type as the tax in respect of which the penalty is imposed”. Therefore, there are significant statutory references which indicate a legislative intent to apply the tax recovery provisions in section HK 11 to civil penalties and use-of- money interest. However, there is some uncertainty that the current law achieves this policy intent. A clarifying amendment is therefore desirable to remove this uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 171 Issue: Consideration of overall level of penalties Clause 49 Submission (22 – KPMG) There is a need for further thought to be given to the overall level of penalties – in particular, their counterproductive nature in inducing taxpayer compliance. It is premature to effectively elevate penalties to the status of tax without further consideration being given to the broader issue of penalties and their overly-harsh impact on some taxpayers. Comment It is outside the scope of this amendment to consider a wider review of the penalty rules. Officials note that the current penalty rules that were originally enacted in 1996 have been subject to several reviews, including by the Committee of Experts in 1998, and the Finance and Expenditure Committee in 1999. The penalty rules were also the subject of a further discussion document in 2001 as part of a post-implementation review by the government. Substantial amendments have been made to these rules since their enactment in 1996. The amendment proposed to be made to section HK 11 to ensure that it applies to civil penalties and use-of-money interest is of a clarifying nature only. It is the policy intent of section HK 11 that it should apply to allow Inland Revenue to collect unpaid civil penalties and use-of-money interest imposed on companies from their directors and shareholders if the requirements of that provision are satisfied. This clarifying amendment is quite discrete and should not be dependent on a wider review of the penalty rules themselves. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of proposed amendment Clause 49 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The change to section HK 11 should come into force on the date that it receives the Royal assent and apply to arrangements entered into after that date. The amendments should therefore not apply to arrangements entered into before the legislation is enacted. 172 Comment The proposed amendments to section HK 11 are currently stated as coming into force on 1 April 2005. Given that officials consider the amendment to be of a clarifying nature only it is probably more appropriate for the amendment to come into force on the date of enactment (that is, the date of Royal assent). Officials agree with the submission to this extent. However, officials do not agree that the amendments to HK 11 should apply only to arrangements entered into after the date of enactment. Such an approach would not be consistent with the clarifying nature of this amendment, which should simply apply from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent that the amendments to section HK 11 should come into force on the date on which the bill is enacted. 173 EXCESS IMPUTATION CREDITS OF INDIVIDUALS Issue: Treatment of excess imputation credits of individuals Clause 51 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The rule should be changed to enable the refund of excess imputation credits to individuals. PricewaterhouseCoopers submit that, if this is rejected, consideration should be given to refunding excess imputation credits if they are less than say, $2,000. Comment The submitters acknowledge that the proposed rule would remedy a mismatch between the benefit that “individual” taxpayers receive from excess imputation credits and the amount of tax paid when the credits were created. The “carry-forward” proposal is designed to prevent the acquisition of disproportionate losses but also to be consistent with the overall framework of the imputation system. Although refunding imputation credits would remedy the problem of disproportionate losses, it would be a fundamental change to the current system and is therefore outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extinguishing of carried-forward imputation credits Clause 104 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) When writing-off an amount of irrecoverable outstanding tax, the Commissioner should not have the degree of discretion provided in clause 104 to determine the order in which any net losses or carried-forward imputation credits of the taxpayer are extinguished. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand submits that there should be a specific and certain rule. PricewaterhouseCoopers submit that there should be a default apportionment, and that the Commissioner should be required to 174 ask the taxpayer for their preferred apportionment between net losses and carried- forward imputation credits. Comment Whether net losses or carried-forward excess imputation credits are extinguished first when an amount of outstanding tax is written off will not generally have a significant impact on taxpayers. A simple rule with no discretion is likely to have lower compliance and administration costs than a rule that provides a choice. Under the core provisions of the Income Tax Act, available net losses are used before tax credits that are available in the same tax year. It would be consistent and simpler if this pattern were continued under section 177C of the Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the proposed rule be changed so that, when writing off an amount of irrecoverable outstanding tax, the Commissioner must extinguish any net loss before extinguishing any carried-forward excess imputation credits. Issue: Numbering of provision on use of imputation credits Clause 51 Submission (21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Since subparagraph (iv) of section LB 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 will be omitted by the bill, the current subparagraph (iiia) should be renumbered as (iv). Comment Renumbering current subparagraph (iiia) as subparagraph (iv) would risk creating unnecessary confusion between the new and old subparagraph (iv). This would be contrary to standard drafting practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 175 PUBLICATION OF TAX OFFENDERS’ NAMES Clause 103 Submission (15W – Business New Zealand) Business New Zealand fully supports the proposal that the Commissioner does not publish the names of serious tax offenders. Comment While the proposed amendment will repeal the current name publication provisions, some benefits are still seen in publishing the names of tax offenders. These benefits are greatest in cases where a court has imposed a sanction. As such, the Commissioner will, when appropriate, seek publicity after court-imposed sanctions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 176 GST AND THE FIRE SERVICE LEVY Issue: Support objective Clause 106 Submission (7W – Deloitte on behalf of the New Zealand Fire Service) The submission supports the proposed amendment, which is to provide certainty that GST is payable on the Fire Service levy (the levy) and confirm the New Zealand Fire Service’s past treatment of the levy. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Scope of the proposed amendment Clause 106 Submission (7W – Deloitte on behalf of the New Zealand Fire Service) As currently drafted, the proposed section 5(6AB) confirms the application of GST to the levy but does not specify who is the recipient of the services that are deemed to be supplied under the proposed amendment. As such, the submission notes that it is possible to reach several different conclusions as to the application of the proposed amendment. The Fire Service Act 1975 treats the amount of a levy that an insurer must pay to the New Zealand Fire Service as a debt due by the insured to the insurer. The treatment of these amounts should be better reflected in the GST Act by specifying that GST applies to payments from the insured to the insurer as well as the payments from the insurer to the New Zealand Fire Service. This clarification could be achieved by inserting a new subsection to ensure that the debt due by the insured is treated as subject to GST (with offsetting input tax credits). Comment Officials consider that section 5(6AB) does not affect insurers, because they are acting as collection agents for the New Zealand Fire Service. The purpose of section 5(6AB) is to clarify the application of GST to amounts collected under the levy by the New Zealand Fire Service under the Fire Service Act. This is achieved by deeming the payment of the levy to be consideration for the supply of goods and services by the New Zealand Fire Service. As such, section 5(6AB) does not have an effect on 177 insurers’ GST returns as they are neither required to charge GST on the levy (this is the responsibility of the New Zealand Fire Service under the amendment) nor able to claim input tax credits as they pass the levy directly on to insured persons. The amendment suggested the submission is not required. Under the Fire Service Act the levy is not legally imposed on the insured, but on the insurer offering the fire and general insurance. The imposition of the levy under the Fire Service Act therefore establishes a payment mechanism but does not attempt to define who receives the services. Proposed section 5(6AB) is consistent with this treatment. Its application is illustrated below. NZ Fire ServiceNZ insurerNZ insured consideration Fire Service levy consideration Fire Service levy & insurance premium service - deemed under proposed section 5(6AB) fire & general insurance In the illustration the insurer is treated as a collection agent for the New Zealand Fire Service as envisaged under the Fire Services Act. The GST consequences of this treatment are as follows: • the insurer will not be able to deduct the GST charged by the New Zealand Fire Service on the levy; • instead, the insurer will pass on the GST inclusive amount to the insured person – typically this is shown as a separate line item on the insurers invoice to the insured; • if the insured person is registered for GST, they will be able to deduct input tax in the usual manner. In the event of the insured defaulting on paying the levy, the GST Act provides the insurer with an avenue of GST relief under existing section 26(1A). The proposed treatment should not disturb existing practices by insurers. Officials note that an earlier guide on the application of GST prepared by the GST co- ordinating office in 1986 was clear that GST on the levy, like the levy itself, is collected by the insurer as agent. The guide notes that: “\[t\]he gross levy, inclusive of GST, should be paid over to the Fire Services Commission, and it will be Commission’s responsibility to account for the tax in its own GST return. The levy should be excluded from the insurer’s GST return.” 9 9 See The fire and general insurance industry, page 18; The GST Co-ordinating office, April 1986. 178 Officials also note that the analysis is consistent with New Zealand’s generally accepted accounting practice. Both Financial Reporting Standard 35 (FRS 35) and the New Zealand equivalent to International Reporting Standard 4 (NZ IFRS 4) require that levies, such as fire service levies, not be included in the amounts recognised as income as the insurer is acting simply as a collector. 10 We therefore do not consider that it is necessary to clarify the GST treatment of the levy between the insurer and the insured as suggested in this submission. Nevertheless the existing practices could be confirmed in the legislation by specifying that the services are received by the insured. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that proposed section 5(6AB) be redrafted to specify that the services are received by the insured. Issue: Treatment of penalties and interest Clause 106 Submission (7W – Deloitte on behalf of the New Zealand Fire Service) The treatment of penalties and interest imposed under the Fire Service Act should be specifically clarified in the legislation as consideration for exempt supplies. Comment Section 2 of the Fire Service Act includes in the definition of “levy” interest and penalties. This in effect ensures that penalties and interest are collectable in the event of an insurer not paying the appropriate amount to the New Zealand Fire Service. Interest and penalties imposed by the New Zealand Fire Service are not directly passed on to the insured. This compares to the proposed treatment of the levy itself which, following the recommendation on page 176 under the heading “Issue: Scope of the proposed amendment”, is deemed to be supplied to the insured (proposed section 5(6AB)). 10 See FRS 35: Financial Reporting of Insurance Activities, paragraph 5.3, July 1999, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand; NZ IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, paragraph 4.2.3 page 103, 2004, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand. 179 NZ Fire ServiceInsurerInsured service - deemed under proposed section 5(6AB) interest and penalty charges - supply under ordinary principles While both the levy and interest are treated under the Fire Service Act as the same payment, the elements are designed to achieve different objectives. The levy is imposed in the event of an insured person taking out fire insurance and represents consideration in return for the activities provided by the New Zealand Fire Service. The imposition of penalties and interest, on the other hand, is meant to ensure the correct and prompt payment of the funds collected by the insurer on behalf of the New Zealand Fire Service. The payments are therefore for different supplies by the New Zealand Fire Service. This difference is reflected in the proposed amendment as it excludes “penalty or default interest” from being deemed to be a supply to the insured under section 5(6AB). Excluding “penalty or default interest” from section 5(6AB) does not, however, preclude the existence of a supply by the New Zealand Fire Service to insurers under ordinary GST principles. Penalty interest or a charge in the nature of interest imposed under statute has, since 10 October 2000, been treated as consideration for an exempt supply under section 14(3)(a)(ii) of the GST Act. This was the result of an amendment made to the GST Act by the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 which sought to provide parity in exempting from GST the penalty interest for both supplies made under contract and supplies made as a result of an enactment. The purpose of section 14(3) is to ensure that charges that compensate for the time value of money, like other comparable supplies that are exempt from GST – such as financial services – remain outside the GST base. We note that the New Zealand Fire Service currently treats penalty interest as an exempt supply. Penalty charges under the Fire Service Act are not, however, specifically included within the scope of section 14(3)(a)(ii). As noted above, the purpose of section 14(3) is to remove payments which compensate for the time value of money from the scope of the GST base. However, penalty charges can be used to recover costs in addition to the time value of money – for example, administrative costs. To specifically exempt non-interest penalty charges imposed by the New Zealand Fire Service would extend the scope of section 14(3) and potentially exempt supplies that should otherwise be subject to GST. This outcome would not be consistent with the original policy intent and potentially create inconsistencies between penalties charged under contract or an enactment with those imposed under the Fire Service Act. 180 Officials note, however, that proposed section 5(6AB) as presently drafted is unclear. We recommend that penalties imposed under the Fire Service Act be excluded from the scope of proposed section 5(6AB). This change should allow the New Zealand Fire Service to determine the GST treatment of penalties imposed on insurers according to the application (or not) of the exemption for penalty interest under section 14(3)(a)(ii) and/or ordinary principles. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 106 should, however, be amended to remove penalty charges, in addition to interest penalties, from the ambit of proposed section 5(6AB). Issue: Deduction of input tax Clause 106 Submission (7W – Deloitte on behalf of the New Zealand Fire Service) The deduction of input tax for GST charged on the levy needs clarification. The drafting of the proposed amendment leaves open the question whether insurers are able to deduct input tax for GST paid on the levy. The amendment does not clearly specify who receives the services which are deemed to have been supplied when the levy is imposed. Without reference to a recipient, GST-registered persons that pay the levy may not be entitled to deduct that GST as “input tax”. Comment Following the recommendation on page 176 under the heading “Issue: Scope of the proposed amendment”, clause 106 should be redrafted to specify that the insured is the recipient of the services deemed to be supplied under proposed section 5(6AB). This should overcome the problem identified and allow GST-registered insured persons to deduct input tax in the usual manner for any GST paid in connection with the levy. As insurers are treated as agents (see comment on page 176) and the recommendation on page 178 will clarify this, no further change is required to allow insurers to deduct input tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 181 Issue: Zero-rating levies paid by non-residents Clause 106 Submission (7W – Deloitte on behalf of the New Zealand Fire Service) The GST Act should be clarified as to whether it is possible to zero-rate the Fire Service levy if it is charged to non-resident insurers. Comment Following the recommendation on page 176 under the heading “Issue: Scope of the proposed amendment”, proposed section 5(6AB) should specify that the insured is the recipient of the services deemed to be supplied for the levy. This removes arguments that non-resident insurers are the recipient of the services supplied by the New Zealand Fire Service. Instead, if a non-resident insurer agrees to insure property in New Zealand the non-resident should, like a New Zealand-resident insurer, pass the GST-inclusive value directly to the insured. As noted in the submission, the imposition of the levy is determined by reference to the location of the insured’s property. Therefore, liability for the levy arises when there is a connection to property in New Zealand. For the purposes of the GST zero-rating rules, services that are directly connected with property in New Zealand cannot be zero-rated as they are considered to be consumed in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Officials are planning to clarify the application of GST to statutory levies to ensure that such levies are properly included in the GST base. This will also cover the relationship of the zero-rating rules to statutory levies. This work is included in the tax policy work programme. 182 NON-RESIDENTS AND GST DEREGISTRATION Issue: Scope of the amendment is incorrect Clause 110 Submission (15 – Business New Zealand, 21 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 22 – KPMG, 28W – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submission contends that the scope of the amendment should be reconsidered because the current law does not raise a serious problem. The reasons cited are that the amendment is out of line with similar Australian provisions, and will cause additional business costs to businesses investing into New Zealand. This could result in entities choosing not to come to New Zealand, in favour of Australia as a more favourable destination. The KPMG submission considers the position in the European Union. Comment The first point raised by the submitters is that the current legislation does not raise a serious problem. However, experience suggests otherwise. For example, a non- resident company organises a conference in New Zealand for its agents. The company did not carry on any other activity in New Zealand and did not make any supplies in New Zealand except for supplies of entertainment and accommodation to their agents. The agents were not charged for this supply. However, the non-resident company still registered for GST and claimed a refund of tax on the inputs of an entertainment and accommodation nature it incurred while its agents attended the conference in New Zealand. The legislation, as it currently stands, allows this refund. Although the supplies are made for nil consideration, they still qualify as taxable supplies in terms of the legislation. The non-resident company in this situation is essentially the same as a final consumer, because it does not carry on any commercial activity in New Zealand. The company can register for GST in New Zealand because it carries on a taxable activity somewhere in the world. There is no requirement that it must carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand. There is therefore a real problem that is not remedied by the current legislation. That is, a company that acts like a final consumer is able to claim a refund of GST. The amendment will ensure that this is remedied. The argument that the amendment could cause entities to go to Australia or elsewhere, because it imposes additional business costs, is not necessarily correct. Persons generally do not select where they go solely for tax reasons. It is more likely that decisions to come to New Zealand are determined by reasons other than their GST treatment. For example, New Zealand levies GST on goods purchased in New Zealand by tourists even when those goods will be consumed outside the country, thereby imposing an extra cost on tourists. This cost is refunded in many other countries. However, this does not seem to have any adverse impact on our tourist industry. Whether tourists come to New Zealand is clearly driven by other reasons. 183 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The amendment is not required because provisions already exist to deal with the perceived mischief Clause 110 Submission (17W – Ernst & Young, 29W – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 33W – New Zealand Law Society) The submission states that the proposed amendments are unnecessary to combat the supposed abuse, as there are already existing provisions which will allow any input tax credits claimed in illegitimate circumstances by non-residents to be disallowed. Comment The main thrust of the submission is that there is already adequate legislative authority to prevent the problem the amendment is aimed at. The argument is that the input tax credit could be denied because the goods and services were not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Taxable supplies are defined to be those supplies charged with tax pursuant to section 8 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Section 8 imposes tax at the rate of 12.5% on the supply in New Zealand of goods or services by reference to the value of that supply. Section 10 of the Act defines the value of supply. In section 10(19) it states that where any supply is made for no consideration, the value of that supply is nil. The argument the submitters make is that, because the supply is for nil consideration, and the tax to be charged in relation to that consideration is nil, no taxable supplies have been made. (A registered person can only claim an input tax credit for its purchases of goods and services if it acquired them for the principal purpose of making a taxable supply.) However, this argument is incorrect. Even though the tax that is payable as a result of applying 12.5% to nil consideration is nil, this does not mean that the supply is not a taxable supply. The supply has been charged with tax at 12.5%, and that is the requirement for a taxable supply, not that some positive amount of tax should be payable as a result of the application of section 8. There is no requirement in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for consideration to be charged on supplies between unassociated persons. Supplies made for nil consideration may therefore qualify as taxable supplies, and an input tax credit is therefore allowed under the current law. The problem the amendment is aimed at therefore does exist and is not addressed under the current law. 184 The submitters also raise the point that the general anti-avoidance provisions could be used to deny an input tax credit. However, whether a particular situation amounts to avoidance has to be considered on a case-by-case basis. A more certain approach is needed to ensure that input tax credits are not available in this situation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The proposed amendment will result in commercial uncertainty for multi-national groups with New Zealand operations Clause 110 Submission (17W – Ernst & Young) The submission states that commercial uncertainty will be introduced by the proposed amendments for multi-national groups with New Zealand operations. Comment The submission contends that the amendment will create significant uncertainty for non-residents who are registering for GST for legitimate reasons. It will therefore become a determining factor when non-residents are considering how to structure their operations, resulting in the possible hindrance of commercial transactions. It is also submitted that the Commissioner’s intended guidelines on how the discretion will be applied will not solve this issue. This is so because the Commissioner’s guidelines are not binding, and this would leave it uncertain how the discretion should be applied. However, officials consider that guidelines will clarify and make sufficiently certain the application of the Commissioner’s discretion. This is an accepted way of setting out detail that is not appropriate for inclusion in the legislation and has worked well in other situations. A recent example is the Inland Revenue guidelines on the application of the zero rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services. The point raised by the submission in relation to grouping should be adequately dealt with by the guidelines to be published. Some guidelines have already been provided in the commentary to the bill by way of example. This guidance states the proposed discretion will not be exercised in the case of a non-resident registering in advance of starting business operations in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 185 RWT ON DIVIDENDS PAID TO NEW ZEALAND INVESTORS IN OFFSHORE UNIT TRUSTS Clauses 2, 52B, 57B to 57E, 60, 84B, 85 and 87 Overview In December last year legislation was enacted 11 that resulted in distributions from certain unit trusts previously treated as “non-taxable bonus issues” for New Zealand tax purposes being treated as dividends and taxed accordingly. This new legislation affects distributions from offshore unit trusts. As a consequence, individual investors in offshore unit trusts will derive a dividend, from which no foreign or New Zealand tax will have been withheld. These investors will have a New Zealand income tax liability and will be required to file an income tax return. The resident withholding tax (RWT) rules should allow fund managers to withhold tax on behalf of investors. The RWT rules require the deduction of withholding tax from interest and dividends paid to New Zealand residents. RWT is deducted at source at the time the interest or dividend income is paid, thus eliminating the need in many cases to file an income tax return as the correct amount of tax will have been withheld. The income tax legislation does not currently allow New Zealand fund managers, who are not agents, to elect to be subject to the RWT rules in relation to investments in offshore unit trusts by New Zealand residents. In many cases, the rules prevent a taxpayer helping another to meet their tax obligations. The proposed amendments will make it easier for individuals to accurately meet their tax obligations, while lowering compliance and administration costs. A key advantage of the proposal is that it is voluntary. The decision to offer the withholding facility is a matter for each fund manager to consider. It is proposed to amend the resident withholding tax rules to allow: • New Zealand fund managers to elect to offer a withholding tax facility (to be a RWT “proxy”); • the correct marginal tax rate to be nominated where an investor elects to use the withholding tax facility; and • the requirement that the investor files an annual income tax return to be removed. 11 Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. 186 Issue: Application date Submission (29WA – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 36W – New Zealand Funds Management Limited, Matter raised by officials) A number of clauses do not have an application date. The application date for all the amendments allowing persons to be a RWT proxy, should be 21 December 2004, including consequential amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment Officials agree that the application date for all the amendments should be 21 December. This was the date the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 was assented to and that was the offshore unit trust dividend amendment effective from. The application date is retrospective to ensure that taxpayers are not adversely affected by the timing difference between the enactment of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and the enactment of the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Officials also note that the amendments amend the Income Tax Act 2004 which comes into force on 1 April 2005. However, the amendments apply from 21 December 2004, and therefore the Income Tax Act 1994 should also be amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Type of recipient Submission (37W – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 29WA – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 36W – New Zealand Funds Management Limited) One of the conditions for the RWT proxy rules to apply is that the recipient is a natural person. There is no policy reason why the recipient cannot be a trustee of a qualifying trust. Comment The proposed amendment allows a person to elect to be a RWT proxy for a payer of resident withholding income. One of the conditions to be a proxy is that the recipient is a natural person. 187 Officials acknowledge that some unit holders will be trustees, as well as natural persons. There is no reason why trustees of qualifying trusts should not also be recipients. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Type of dividend subject to proxy treatment Submission (36W – New Zealand Funds Management Limited, 37W – Investment Savings and Insurance Association, 29WA – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 34W – ING (NZ) Limited) A RWT proxy should be entitled to treat all dividends distributed by the payer as resident withholding income. The RWT proxy rules should not be limited to taxable bonus issues. Comment As currently worded, the amendments allow a RWT proxy to pay resident withholding tax in respect of taxable bonus issues only. Officials agree that the ability for a RWT proxy to pay resident withholding tax should not be limited to taxable bonus issues. Therefore, the proxy will be able to pay resident withholding tax in respect of all dividends. Officials also note that it should be clarified that an RWT proxy pays resident withholding tax based on the recipient receiving the net amount of the dividend (that is, the post-tax amount). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 188 Issue: Taxable bonus issues not “dividends” for purposes of RWT proxy rules Submission (29WA – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 36W – New Zealand Funds Management)) The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 makes certain income and property of Australian unit trusts taxable. The amendments as contained in the supplementary order paper may create difficulties of interpretation in respect of the ability of a resident withholding tax proxy to pay RWT on certain distributions. There is concern that the bonus issue is not taxable because it is excluded from the definition of “dividend” (although taxable under the revised definition of “taxable bonus issue”), and therefore may not constitute “resident withholding income” for the purposes of the RWT proxy rules. Comment Extending the RWT proxy rules to apply to all dividends, as recommended above, addresses this concern. Recommendation Note that this submission is addressed by the previous recommendation. 189 Other amendments proposed by officials 190 191 OFFSHORE UNIT TRUST – CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 introduced various changes in relation to the taxation of offshore unit trusts by amending the Income Tax Act 1994. Various consequential amendments were required to the Income Tax Act 2004. However, one consequential amendment was not made because of oversight. The submission requests that the consequential amendment be made to the Income Tax Act 2004 and apply from the same date as the original amendments – that is, 21 December 2004. Comment The consequential amendment relates to section CF 3(2)(c)(ii) in the Income Tax Act 1994. No equivalent provision currently appears in the Income Tax Act 2004, and therefore should be included. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 192 SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR EMPLOYERS OF NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS Submission (Matter raised by officials) The new shortfall penalty currently found in section 141AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be included in the definition of a shortfall penalty. It should also be included in the listed sections to which section 141K of the Act can apply to ensure that the penalty can be increased where there is obstruction. These amendments should apply from the same date as the original amendments, that is, from 1 April 2005. Comment The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 introduced a new shortfall penalty for certain situations. The new penalty contains two errors. The first is that the new penalty is not included in the definition of “shortfall penalty” in section 3(1) of the Act. The definition of a “shortfall penalty” should be amended to include a reference to section 141AA. The second is that reference to the penalty was not included in section 141K(1). Section 141K provides that a penalty can be increased by the Commissioner where the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position in respect of the taxpayer’s tax liabilities. There is no reason why the Commissioner should not also have this power in relation to the shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 193 MINOR DRAFTING CHANGES Issue: Allocation deficit debit rules for life insurance companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definitions of “policyholder DWP ratio” and “reduced deficit debit” in new section MG 8B of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to correct some minor drafting errors with application from the 2005-06 income year. Comment The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 amended the allocation deficit debit rules for life insurance companies to prevent the inappropriate results that could arise under the previous rules. New section MG 8B of the Income Tax Act 2004 contains the definitions for the new allocation deficit debit rules. Two of these definitions contain minor drafting errors which should be corrected. First, in the definition of “policyholder DWP ratio”, the reference to “dividend withholding payment credit account” should be replaced with “dividend withholding payment account”. Secondly, in the definition of “reduced deficit debit”, the reference to “imputation credit account” should be replaced with “dividend withholding payment account”. These changes were made at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage of the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 to the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994, but were not carried through to the Income Tax Act 2004 as they should have been. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 194 Issue: Sale and leaseback of intangibles Submission (Matter raised by officials) The leasing terminology in the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 and in section FC 8B(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended so that it is consistent with the leasing terminology used in other provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. The amendments should apply from the 2005-06 income year. The definitions of “finance lease” in the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 also need to be amended to be made consistent. Comment The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 made amendments to the finance lease rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that taxpayers entering into transactions involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles do not receive deductions for what are, in effect, repayments of loan principal. Some of the amendments made to the finance lease rules in the Income Tax Act 2004 are not consistent with the leasing terminology used in that Act. Several minor changes should be made to ensure consistency of terminology. First, the various references to “lease term” in the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 and in section FC 8B(2) and (3) should be replaced with “term of the lease”. Secondly, the use of the term “personal property lease asset” in the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be standardised. Thirdly, the reference to the term “lease payments” in the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be replaced with “personal property lease payments”. Several features of the definitions of “finance lease” in the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 also need to be amended for consistency purposes. First, the requirement that the definition in the Income Tax Act 1994 applies to leases entered on or after 20 May 1999 should be reinstated. Secondly, the requirement that it be ascertained whether or not a leasing arrangement is a finance lease at the time the lease is entered into should apply to all limbs of the definition except an arrangement involving a lease term that is more than 75% of the lease asset’s estimated useful life. The exception is necessary because consecutive or successive leases may satisfy the 75% requirement only sometime after the commencement of the lease. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 195 Issue: Refund of excess tax Submission (Matter raised by officials) The terminology used in the new refund provision in section 45 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be aligned where appropriate with the terminology used in the new refund provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. Section 45(3) should be redrafted to deal with net refund situations only. The amendments should have the same application date as the new section 45 of the GST Act. Comment The Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 amended the timeframes within which tax refunds are allowed under the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 and section 45 of the GST Act. The terminology used in the refund provision in section 45 of the GST Act should be aligned where appropriate with the terminology used in the Income Tax Act refund provisions. First, the references to “amount properly assessed” in section 45 of the GST Act should be replaced with “amount properly payable”. Secondly, the references to “expired” should be replaced with “ended”. Section 45(3) should be redrafted to improve its comprehensibility. This would be achieved if the provision dealt with net refund situations only and applied if the original refund is less than the amount properly refundable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Research or development Submission (Matter raised by officials) The references to “tax year” in section DB 26 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (which relates to research and development expenditure) should be replaced with “income year”, with application from the 2005-06 income year. 196 Comment The meaning of the term “income year” in the Income Tax Act 2004 has been changed from its meaning in the Income Tax Act 1994 to now include non-standard income years. Under the Income Tax Act 1994, the term “income year” meant the year ending 31 March. Section DB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is intended to apply to taxpayers with non-standard income years as well as to those with standard income years (that is, the year ending 31 March). Accordingly, the references to “tax year” in section DB 26(5)(a) and (7) should be replaced with “income year”. Although all taxpayers with a non-standard balance date also have a tax year, the drafting approach generally taken in the Income Tax Act 2004 is to refer to expenditure incurred or income derived in a person’s income year and to refer to a tax year in relation to a person’s taxable income and income tax liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Months for payment of provisional tax Submission (Matter raised by officials) A drafting error in schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004 – which concerns the payment dates for provisional tax and terminal tax – should be corrected, with application from the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment Column C contained in the table in part A of schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004 concerns the month for payment of the third instalment of provisional tax. The provision currently refers to the “month preceding the balance date”. This reference should be changed to “month of the balance date” as this wording more accurately reflects how the provision is applied. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 197 Issue: Use-of-money interest for income statement recipients Submission (Matter raised by officials) Paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of “interest period” in section 120C(1) and the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be repealed, with application from the 2004-05 income year. Comment The provisions concerning the calculation of use-of-money interest in relation to income statement recipients can produce incorrect results. In particular, paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of “interest period” in section 120C(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not work properly in some cases and can result in an interest end-date that is before the interest start-date. The provision is also unnecessary as the general provisions cater adequately for income statement recipients. Accordingly, this provision should be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reduction of penalties for previous behaviour Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 141FB(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to apply to subsections (1) and (2). This amendment should have the same application date as the new section 141FB, that is, 21 December 2004. Comment Section 141FB(5) allows tax shortfalls to be grouped and effectively treated as one offence. This means that all of the grouped tax shortfalls qualify for the reduction for previous behaviour. This minor remedial amendment is necessary to ensure that the section applies where a shortfall penalty for evasion is imposed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 198 199 Remedial amendments for the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 200 201 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL – RETROSPECTIVE AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Corrections of unintended changes in legislative outcomes in the Income Tax Act 2004 should be included in the bill. The provisions affected are section DZ 13 (unamortised balances of expenditures in the farming and agricultural sector), sections EH 37 and EH 81 (income equalisation schemes), section LE 3(3) (section LE 3 holding companies), the definition of beneficiary income in section OB 1, and schedule 22A. Comment At the time of enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004 (2004 Act), the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) noted that there was a concern that the new legislation could contain adverse unintended policy changes. To alleviate that concern, FEC recommended that a panel of tax specialists be appointed to review submissions, stating that a provision of the 2004 Act contains an unintended policy change. In this context, an unintended policy change is one that gives rise to a different outcome from the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 1994 (1994 Act). The Rewrite Advisory Panel (the Panel) accepted this review role. The government also announced that it would consider promoting retrospective legislation to correct unintended changes in the legislative outcome of a provision in the 2004 Act. Recommendation That the amendments be included in the bill and that they apply from the beginning of the 2005-06 tax year, that being the commencement date for the 2004 Act. 202 Section DZ 13 Submission Section DZ 13 of the 2004 Act is unclear as to its outcome. Comment The Panel considers it should be amended to more clearly state the intended outcome of providing a transitional rule for unamortised balances of expenditures to which section DO 4 of the 1994 Act applied. Recommendation That section DZ 13 be amended to more clearly state its intended outcome. Schedule 22A Submission That section DZ 13 contains an unintended policy change and this should be noted in schedule 22A. Comment The Panel considers that section DZ 13 contains a minor policy change that simplifies the treatment of unamortised expenditures relating to the farming and agricultural sector in the transition from the 1994 to the 2004 Act. Recommendation That schedule 22A be amended to include section DZ 13. 203 Sections EH 37 and EH 81 Submission That the definition of “specified period” in section OB 1 contains an unintended policy change in its reference to the defined term tax year. Comment The Panel agreed that the definition in section OB 1 of “specified period” as it relates to the income equalisation scheme contained an inadvertent change in wording that would mean all deposits to the scheme must be made by 30 September of each year. The correct policy is that deposits to the income equalisation scheme should be made within six months of the end of the person’s balance date for income tax purposes. The Panel recommended that this definition be amended to restore the position under the 1994 Act. Recommendation That the definition of “specified period” be amended to ensure that it relates to the depositor’s approved balance date for income tax purposes (accounting year as defined in the 2004 Act). Section LE 3 holding companies Submission That section LE 3(3)(e) contains an unintended policy change in its reference to exempt dividends. Comment Section LE 3 ensures that foreign investment into New Zealand through a New Zealand holding company is able to take advantage of the foreign investor tax credit regime. In the 2004 Act, section LE 3(3)(e) is incorrectly referenced to sections CW 9 to CW 11, which has the effect of revoking the section LE 3 company status for most companies. The Panel agreed that this reference in section LE 3(3)(e) should be amended to restore the position existing under the 1994 Act. Recommendation That section LE 3(3)(e) be amended to restore the position existing under the 1994 Act. 204 Beneficiary income Submission That the definition of “beneficiary income” in paragraph (b)(ii), should cross-refer to section CC 3(2) of the 2004 Act. Comment The definition of “beneficiary income”, in paragraph (b)(ii), cross-refers to section CC 3. The Panel concluded that this cross-reference is too broad, as it leads to the result that no accrual income can be included in beneficiary income. The correct policy is that for taxation purposes, beneficiary income cannot include income derived by a trustee from the forgiveness of a debt owed by the trustee. Recommendation That the definition of beneficiary income be amended in paragraph (b)(ii) to cross- refer to section CC 3(2). 205 POST-ASSENT CHANGES TO INCOME TAX ACT 2004 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Income Tax Act 2004 was assented on 7 May 2004. After the Royal assent and in the course of preparing for print the version of the Act that is available for purchase, changes were made in 10 places to the text of the assented Act. The changes involved one correction to a “compare note”, one correction to the layout of a formula, three corrections to signs in formulae, removal of a surplus bracket, correction of the placement of a phrase in a definition, correction of a cross-reference in schedule 21, and the correction of three cross-references in schedule 23. The changes were necessary to ensure accurate rewriting of the former 1994 Act and one set of regulations made under it. Standing Order 310 authorises the making of “amendments of a verbal or formal nature” and the “correction of clerical or typographical errors”, both in the course of preparation of a bill for Royal assent. As the amendments were made after the Royal assent, they can be considered to lack authority. To remove that doubt, officials propose that the corrections be re-enacted as minor remedial amendments and included in the bill when reported back. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

The main roles that Inland Revenue undertakes include: • collecting tax, child support and student loan payments • making payments such as tax refunds and rebates, family assistance (including the Working for Families package), child support and paid parental leave • advising the government, together with the Treasury, on tax policy and social policy measures that interact with the tax system. Inland Revenue’s outcomes, set out below, describe our contribution to the government’s outcomes, and to the welfare of all New Zealanders. Primary outcome • Improve the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders. Intermediate outcomes • Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. • People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. Inland Revenue has been given responsibility for a number of government initiatives that have expanded the functions of the department. Inland Revenue is no longer just a tax collection agency; it is also a major player in the provision of the government’s social support programmes. Key points The New Zealand tax system is fundamentally sound. This was the conclusion of the Tax Review 2001, chaired by Rob McLeod, which reviewed the policy and administration of the tax system. The good health of the tax system is shown by strong revenue flows and high levels of public confidence in the department. There are still challenges to be addressed, and these should be an early focus for the incoming government. This briefing paper focuses on what we see as the most critical policy and operational challenges. Inland Revenue also has many important functions and other challenges in areas such as child support and student loans, which are not discussed in detail in this briefing paper. We will be reporting to you separately on these matters. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 7 Policy challenges • New Zealand’s substantial company tax base is at risk because of our relatively high reliance on corporate tax as a revenue source and the relatively high foreign ownership of companies. Many other countries have lowered their company tax rates over recent years and, as they do so, it becomes harder for New Zealand to retain its corporate tax base. • Of particular concern are Australia’s lower, 30% company tax rate and its full imputation system, both of which can act as incentives to stream profits abroad, thus eroding our company tax base. We also need to establish a response to Australia’s reduction of non-resident withholding rates on interest, dividends and royalties. This means that the future of the trans-Tasman tax relationship needs to be considered as a matter of priority. • Problems with our personal income tax structure are also emerging, particularly in relation to the 33% and 39% personal income tax rates. There is growing evidence of tax sheltering and income splitting, raising questions of how robust our tax system is. Operational challenges • The department is currently implementing a full programme of initiatives, which will need to be reprioritised to accommodate any new initiatives. • We are also considering how we can adjust our operating model to address current operating pressures, particularly if demand for our services and/or the number of people who are required to contact us continues to grow • Any legislative changes that require significant changes to our information technology systems will require sufficient lead time to make and test the changes. The introduction of more complexity into our information technology systems, caused through integrating new products and services, means that these lead times are steadily increasing. • We have reassessed our approach to providing electronic services. Internationally, tax administrations have led the introduction of electronic services, which highlights the importance of introducing new electronic services and expanding the use of the electronic channel. We have refocused our approach to take more of a leadership role in supporting the government’s 2010 e- government goals. Role of the Minister of Revenue The role of the Minister of Revenue is established by protocols between Ministers in the finance area; it is not a statutory role. On the basis of past experience, we would expect that you would need to focus on: • management of tax policy issues—through the management of the tax policy work programme. • overview of the administration of the department—through normal public service accountability mechanisms, such as our Statement of Intent, output plan, quarterly reports and annual report. The legislation rests responsibility for determining taxpayer-specific affairs with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Responsibility for protecting the integrity of the tax system falls to both officials and NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 8 any Minister having responsibility under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 6(1) of this Act states: Every Minister and every officer of any government agency having responsibilities under this Act ... are at all times to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. The Act defines the integrity of the tax system under section 6(2) as: Without limiting its meaning, “the integrity of the tax system” includes--- (a) Taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; and (b) The rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law; and (c) The rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential and treated with no greater or lesser favour than the tax affairs of other taxpayers; and (d) The responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; and (e) The responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of the affairs of taxpayers; and (f) The responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law. We can assist you in undertaking these functions by providing you with policy advice, providing revenue forecasting information, and briefings on administrative issues as they arise. We also provide you with specific assistance in a number of areas. Reports and briefings We will provide you with a number of regular briefings and reports—the timing and scope of these will be set to meet your requirements. • Briefings: I suggest that we discuss the type and frequency of our briefings with you in the near future. • Tax policy work programme updates: we will report to you periodically on the management of the tax policy work programme. • Quarterly reports: we will provide you quarterly reports on our progress against the performance expectations set out in our Output Plan. • Monthly status reports: we will provide you with a monthly report on management and other issues affecting the department. Departmental staff for your office The Policy Advice Division can provide you with suitable people to act as an interface between the department and Ministers. Over the last three years we have provided two full-time staff members in the office of the Minister of Revenue, and a part-time staff member in the office of the Associate Minister of Revenue. As well as assisting with the large volume of tax-specific queries Ministers’ offices receive, these people play a valuable coordination and advisory role for Ministers. At an early opportunity we need to discuss the Government’s requirements for the staffing of offices. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 9 Responding to ministerial and parliamentary questions As Minister of Revenue you can expect to receive taxpayer-specific queries and complaints. The department’s Ministerial Services unit coordinates the prompt drafting of responses for you (and other Ministers associated with the Revenue portfolio) to correspondence and parliamentary questions. In the past, Ministers have generally passed on taxpayer specific correspondence to the Commissioner’s Office to respond to directly. Enquiries from other Members of the Parliament and constituents There will also be occasions when you and other Members of Parliament may wish to contact us on behalf of a constituent, or advise them on the best way of contacting Inland Revenue. To assist with this process we will be sending all Members of Parliament our guide—Contacting Inland Revenue. Tax affairs of Members of Parliament—our Special Files unit Inland Revenue recognises that High Court judges, Members of Parliament, and its own staff face the additional responsibility of upholding the taxation law that we administer. To assist these people, we offer a centralised account management service for the taxation affairs of Members of Parliament. The Special Files Unit is located in Wellington and brings together the full range of our services for this customer group in one site. Using this service is optional for Members of Parliament and High Court judges. We will be writing to all Members of Parliament shortly to make sure they are aware of this service. Matters for immediate attention There are a number of tax policy and operational issues that you will need to consider in the very near future. Tax policy • Inland Revenue provides staff members (usually from our Policy Advice Division) to the offices of the Minister of Revenue and Associate Minister of Revenue. We will discuss the servicing of your office with you as soon as possible. • One of the first steps for the new government is the development of a three-year revenue strategy. We and the Treasury will be reporting to you on this issue shortly. • Another important issue is the development of a rolling 18-month tax policy work programme. Again, we will be reporting to you on this matter in the very near future. • There are a number of key policy proposals that will need to be either reviewed or advanced. They include the KiwiSaver initiative, the carbon tax, and those outlined in the recent discussion document Taxation of investment income. We will discuss these matters with you in the context of our report on a draft 18-month tax policy work programme. • The student loan repayment threshold for the 2006–07 income year needs to be made by Order in Council before the end of the calendar year, and the income threshold for the full-interest write-off is set as part of this process. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 10 • The incoming government will need to consider moving the reinstatement of two tax-related bills that were before Parliament when it rose for the general election: the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, introduced in May, and the Child Support Amendment Bill, introduced in July. The tax bill introduced in May includes confirmation of tax rates for 2005–06. Constitutionally, this measure must be enacted by 31 March 2006. We will report to you separately on the reinstatement issue. • We have a commitment to advise the Australian government before the end of the year on New Zealand’s willingness to consider reductions in withholding tax rates. Depending on the outcome of that consideration, a comprehensive re-negotiation of the double tax agreement between Australia and New Zealand may become necessary. We will be reporting to you on this issue. Operational • As outlined in this briefing paper, the operational work programme is fully committed to announced initiatives. We need to discuss with you whether these initiatives still reflect government’s priorities. • We will shortly begin planning for the 2006–07 Budget cycle. It would be desirable to discuss aspects of the department’s current funding position with you at an early opportunity. I look forward to discussing the issues raised in this briefing with you and the new Government in the near future. David Butler Commissioner of Inland Revenue Dated: 16 September 2005 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 11 Briefing NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 12 Tax policy New Zealand’s tax system, which relies for most of its revenue on a broadly based income tax and consumption tax, is fundamentally sound and well regarded internationally. Nevertheless, a number of pressures are emerging. There is mounting evidence that our personal tax structure is fragile and that income splitting and tax sheltering are on the increase. There is also reason to believe that our company tax base is at some risk, company taxation being an important source of revenue. Of particular concern are Australia’s lower company tax rate and full imputation system, which provide incentives for profits to be streamed abroad and can erode New Zealand’s corporate tax base. How New Zealand should best respond to these emerging pressures is a difficult problem to which there are no simple solutions. The tax policy section of this briefing explains New Zealand’s tax policy process, compares New Zealand’s taxes with those in other countries, discusses key challenges in tax policy and outlines what we believe should be key themes in future work. In examining key challenges, our focus is on income tax issues. This is not because our other main tax, GST, is unimportant – rather, it is because we believe there are fewer problems with New Zealand’s GST. It is our income tax base where most pressures are emerging, although GST fraud and avoidance schemes also pose a significant fiscal risk. These issues are raised in the administration section of this briefing paper. Throughout this briefing paper we work within the tax policy settings that existed at the time the general election was called. The tax policy process Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division, together with the Treasury, advises the government on all aspects of tax policy and on social policy measures that interact with the tax system. Its other roles include: • forecasting tax revenues • drafting tax legislation • negotiating and maintaining New Zealand’s network of double tax agreements with other countries • providing ministerial services. The Policy Advice Division has a relatively small staff. It includes about 50 policy analysts, forecasters and legislative drafters who are directly responsible for the management and delivery of the tax policy work programme. As part of its role, the Policy Advice Division manages the Generic Tax Policy Process, which covers a range of activities from initial identification of policy issues through to drafting the ensuing legislation NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 13 and post-implementation review of the legislation. Our tax policy website www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz plays a vital part in the process. Another important role of the Policy Advice Division is to service the Minister’s office. Over the previous government’s term Inland Revenue provided two full-time staff members to the Minister of Revenue’s Office and a part-time staff member to the Associate Minister of Revenue’s Office. We will discuss the servicing of your office with you shortly. Policy project management The stages of our project management are: • Identifying issues in tax and tax-related social policy through our links and communication with Ministers; the private sector; other parts of Inland Revenue, especially operational areas and adjudication and rulings; other government departments, such as the Treasury, Ministry of Economic Development, and Ministry of Social Development; and other tax authorities and international bodies such as the OECD. • Developing those issues into policy proposals, taking into account how they will be managed through to implementation and review. This involves early identification of potential problems and options and how these might be handled. • Managing the consultation process on major reforms. Consultation may range from the preparation of government discussion documents setting out proposed policy to less formal discussions with business sectors likely to be affected by policy proposals. • Managing proposed changes through the ministerial and Cabinet stages and the ensuing legislative stage, from drafting of taxation bills through to supporting their passage through Parliament. • Post-implementation review of major reforms when potential problems are identified, to ensure that new legislation is working as intended. No policy project is a success until it has been successfully implemented. And successful implementation of new measures depends not only on making the necessary information available to taxpayers and Inland Revenue staff alike, but also on integrating the changes into operational systems – for example, by way of form redesign and necessary changes to the computer system. That can take a great deal of time and resources for implementing major reforms such as Working for Families. See page 40 for a discussion of current operational restraints on introducing new measures. The policy development process Since 1994, tax policy has been developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. The process was introduced to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 14 compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives. Another key feature of the process is that it builds external consultation and feedback into the policy development process, providing opportunities for public comment at several stages. Consultation throughout the process contributes to greater transparency of policy-making, allowing the government to set out the policy objectives of proposals and the trade-offs it has made in developing them. Therefore it helps the public to understand the rationale behind government policy proposals. Major tax initiatives are now subject to much greater public scrutiny at key stages in their development – from broad proposal through to post-implementation review. As a result, we now have more opportunity to develop workable options for reform by drawing upon information provided to us by the private sector early in the process. The increased opportunity for consulting on tax policy has resulted in growing numbers of individuals and organisations making submissions on proposals, whether set out in a discussion document or introduced in a taxation bill. Submissions are becoming increasingly technical and detailed, which in turn makes the process lengthier and requires greater policy and parliamentary resources. Developing a new tax policy work programme One of the first steps for the new government in relation to the Generic Tax Policy Process is to develop a three-year revenue strategy that is effectively linked with the government’s economic strategy. The next stage is the development of a rolling tax policy work programme that gives effect to the revenue strategy. At present, the work programme covers an 18-month period. Developing the work programme involves scoping broad policy proposals and prioritising and sequencing the development of initiatives. We also look at budgeted resource requirements, the time needed to develop, legislate for and implement initiatives, and modes of consultation and communication to be employed throughout the process. This stage of the Generic Tax Policy Process culminates in a joint report by the Policy Advice Division and the Treasury to the Treasury Ministers and Minister of Revenue that suggests a policy work programme. Once approved, the work programme becomes a detailed tax policy agreement between the government and the two departments. When it is made public, as it usually is, the work programme is received with much interest by the tax and business communities, to whom it provides greater certainty and an understanding of the government’s direction in tax policy. As time passes and the work programme is updated and new policy initiatives are added to it, there is a risk that there will be more items on the programme than can be progressed during the 18-month period. That can place a major strain on finite tax policy resources and parliamentary resources, and result in slower progress for other priorities. It is therefore important that when items are added to the NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 15 work programme, existing priorities are reviewed to ensure that the government’s expectations across the work programme are met. The management of the work programme will be a key issue for both Ministers and officials in ensuring that priorities are delivered as agreed. There is a large set of issues on the current work programme, and these will need to be either reviewed or advanced. We will be reporting to you shortly on the work programme. The 2002-2005 tax policy work programme Major features of the 2002-05 tax policy work programme included tax-related measures to support growth and innovation. The work programme also included measures to simplify the tax system (especially for small businesses), reduce compliance costs, protect the revenue base and promote social cohesion. Recent highlights include: • Increasing New Zealand’s access to worldwide labour, skills and capital. Policy reforms included removing impediments to international recruitment through temporary relief of much of the offshore income of new migrants and returning New Zealanders, and changes to the tax treatment of trans-Tasman superannuation, stock lending, venture capital and foreign hybrids. Also contributing to this objective was an expansion in our network of double tax agreements with other countries. • The coherent taxation of savings and the entities through which people invest and save. A June discussion document on the taxation of investment income proposed reforms aimed at removing anomalies between the treatment of savings held through collective investment vehicles and savings held directly by individuals. We have also made a significant contribution in the design of the government’s work-based savings package announced in Budget 2005. • Improving the efficiency of capital allocation. Measures included changing the basis of depreciation deductions and giving companies that bring in new equity investors better access to Research and Development tax deductions. • Tax simplification and reduction of tax compliance costs. Examples of recent changes include some of the fringe benefit tax reforms and measures designed to make tax easier for small businesses – including the introduction of tax pooling, the alignment of provisional tax and GST payment dates, and raising the depreciation low-value asset threshold. A key part of our simplification work is the progressive rewrite of the Income Tax Act, begun in the 1990s, to make the Act easier to use and understand. • Social cohesion. Improving incentives for beneficiaries to enter paid employment and relieving child poverty were the objectives behind the Working for Families reform enacted last year. A bill before Parliament proposes further improvements to the way that child support is administered by giving liable parents who have defaulted on their payments an incentive to re-enter the system. • The environment. The key proposed reform is the introduction of a carbon tax aimed at ensuring that New Zealand plays its part in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Recently enacted legislation has also improved business access to deductions for repairing environmental damage. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 16 • Protecting the revenue base. Important recent reforms include changes relating to the tax treatment of deferred deductions, Australian unit trusts, foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand, and corporate migration. Setting priorities The work programme must balance the resource requirements of the Minister of Revenue’s main tax policy initiatives against those required for initiatives introduced by other Ministers – for example, in the areas of social policy or sector assistance – which can have substantial tax implications. It must also allow room to meet private sector concerns when tax legislation is identified as causing unintended practical problems. Finally, there is an increasing demand for tax policy resources to be allocated to international tax areas such as OECD work and trans-Tasman tax matters, a reflection of the increasing extent to which New Zealand must take into account international tax trends in setting its domestic rules. Given the many areas of government policy that have tax implications, the sheer complexity of tax issues and the limited resources available to deal with them, it is essential for Ministers to discuss and set out their tax policy priorities. Since many areas of government raise important tax policy issues, the allocation of tax policy resources is likely to affect the government’s ability to pursue non-tax policy objectives, especially in economic development and social policy. It is therefore desirable for Ministers in those areas to be clear about the implications for the tax policy work programme of policy developments in their portfolios. Budgetary fiscal rules The tax policy work programme can also be affected in very important ways by any budgetary fiscal rules the government decides to adopt. In setting fiscal rules, it is essential to ensure that fiscal discipline on expenditure applies in an equal way to initiatives that would reduce tax revenue – otherwise there is an incentive for expenditure initiatives to be packaged as tax initiatives. That being said, there are a number of ways that budgetary fiscal rules might work. One possibility is to focus solely on the size of the government deficit. In this case, other things being equal, tax reductions may be seen as bad and tax increases may be seen as good. As well as making judgements about the size of the government deficit, governments need to make decisions about whether or not they want to see taxes and government spending rise or fall over time, and these decisions should be incorporated into the budgetary fiscal rules. Questions also arise as to how flexible fiscal rules should be in trading off revenue gains against the costs of measures, legislative or administrative, which lead to these gains. For example, a government might consider that it is worth spending $1 million to gain $100 million of revenue but not worth spending $1 million to gain $1 million of revenue. The question arises of where the appropriate trade-offs are and whether budgetary fiscal rules should be flexible enough to accommodate trade-offs NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 17 of this nature. Similarly, expenditure can be incurred either to raise additional tax revenue or to avoid the loss of tax revenue in the future – so should the government be thinking in the same way about trade-offs in both instances? The tax policy implications of any fiscal rule proposals, therefore, must be considered before such rules are adopted. Tax concessions Those looking to reduce impediments to the growth of priority economic sectors often seek tax reductions or concessions for certain sectors. That can add to the strain on tax policy resources and, if implemented, could undermine the broad tax bases our tax system and moderate statutory rates rely upon. Inevitably, because tax collects a proportion of any business’s profits, it is a restraint on the development of all sectors of our economy. That, however, is the inevitable cost of raising revenue to meet government expenditure commitments. Sector-specific concessions will increase the impediments faced by other sectors and, therefore, need a high level of justification. Moreover, sector-specific concessions raise boundary problems and can be open to abuse. The legislative programme Two tax-related bills await consideration when Parliament reconvenes: the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was before the Finance and Expenditure Committee when the House rose for the General Election, and the Child Support Amendment Bill, which was introduced in August and awaits its first reading. Both bills lapsed on 11 August, when the previous Parliament was dissolved, and Ministers will need to consider moving their reinstatement by Parliament. The 2002-05 work programme also called for the introduction of a KiwiSaver bill in late November this year and a carbon tax bill in late February next year. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 18 Taxes, distortions and the New Zealand tax system Taxes are needed to finance government spending. At the same time, taxes distort economic behaviour, which can inhibit growth. When the tax system causes people to invest in particular assets or to structure their affairs in ways which are sensible only because of taxes, the tax system is said to be inefficient. A goal of good tax reform is to raise sufficient revenue to meet government requirements as efficiently as possible, consistent with a government’s equity objectives. Although most taxes can distort economic behaviour, it appears to be income taxes where most pressures are emerging. Income taxes can distort behaviour, harm economic growth and produce other undesirable effects in three different ways. The possible distortions can be grouped as follows: • those attributable to all marginal tax rates • those attributable to differences in marginal tax rates and • those primarily attributable to the top marginal tax rate. It should be noted at the outset that in listing these potential distortions we are not suggesting New Zealand’s tax system is poor relative to tax systems in other countries. On the contrary, we will see that in many ways New Zealand’s tax system is relatively well designed. Being aware of the three different possible sets of distortions, however, is helpful in examining how efficient New Zealand’s tax system is likely to be. First, high marginal tax rates can hinder individuals from working as long, as hard or in as difficult and demanding jobs as they would if marginal tax rates were lower. High marginal tax rates can also discourage individuals from saving when it would be desirable to do so if not for these tax rates, and encourage avoidance or evasion of taxes. The degree of distortion will depend on an individual’s marginal tax rate on any additional income, and different individuals will face different marginal tax rates on additional income. Thus these inefficiencies will depend on the levels of marginal tax rates facing all individuals. Second, differences in marginal tax rates can produce another set of distortions. If marginal tax rates rise with income, the high rates faced if a risky investment pays off and the low rates faced if the investment fails may discourage risk-taking behaviour. 1 Similarly, increasing marginal tax rates can discourage individuals from “investing in human capital” and acquiring new knowledge and skills. It is also differences in marginal tax rates that give rise to problems in taxing different forms of savings vehicles, including trusts and companies, on a consistent basis and lead to biases in the ways that individuals save. Moreover, differences in marginal rates provide scope for income splitting within a family. This leads to perceptions of unfairness. Third, some distortions may predominantly be affected by the highest marginal tax rates. If certain forms of investment are tax advantaged relative to others, those who have the biggest incentives to 1 Corporate risk-taking behaviour may also be discouraged at times because firms with insufficient other taxable income cannot utilise any losses immediately. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 19 invest are those on the highest tax rates. Provided these individuals have or can borrow sufficient capital, it may well be the tax rate of these individuals that determines the efficiency cost of the distortion. By international standards, New Zealand has broad bases for both its income tax and GST, and about 90 percent of total government tax revenue comes from these taxes. Both tax bases have relatively few concessions by international standards. This allows lower tax rates and a more efficient tax system than would otherwise be possible. The basic structure of our tax system was endorsed by the Tax Review 2001, which concluded that “. . . radical restructuring is not required. The broad architecture of the tax system is sound.” The Tax Review commissioned Professor Alan Auerbach, a leading international expert on the economics of taxation, to comment on its June 2001 Issues Paper. He prefaced his report by stating “New Zealand’s current tax system already conforms more closely to the standard objectives of taxation than do the tax systems of many other developed countries. Thus New Zealand’s tax system is not obviously in need of major overhaul.” 2 When comparing New Zealand’s tax system with those of other countries it is important to note that New Zealand already has a relatively well designed tax system. It should not be thought that any departure from norms in other countries is necessarily evidence of poor New Zealand policy. OECD data on tax rates and tax collections are shown in Table 1. The year chosen in each case is the most recent year for which internationally comparable data are available. 3 2 See page 2 of the Final Report of the Tax Review 2001. 3 All data are from the OECD website, mostly from the OECD Tax Database.

NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 21 These data suggest that: • New Zealand’s tax/GDP ratio is towards the middle of the range for OECD countries • New Zealand’s company tax rate is high relative to those of most OECD countries • New Zealand has a relatively high level of company tax as a proportion of GDP • New Zealand has a relatively low top statutory marginal tax rate on earned income, although this is attained at a relatively low income • There is a relatively small difference between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate. The absence of any tax-free threshold in New Zealand and the relatively low top personal marginal tax rates are likely to lead to relatively small differences in New Zealand’s statutory marginal tax rates. Although the top statutory marginal income tax rate in New Zealand is low, the abatement of family assistance can lead to very much higher effective marginal tax rates. Tax as a percentage of GDP As shown in Figure 1, New Zealand’s tax to GDP ratio of 34.9 percent in 2002 is towards the middle of the range for OECD countries. 8 It is slightly below the unweighted average of 36.3 percent but above the GDP-weighted average of 31.0 percent. The OECD-weighted average is less than the unweighted average because the two largest economies in the OECD – the US and Japan (with 54.4 percent of GDP in total in 2002) are relatively low-tax countries. It should be noted that comparing New Zealand’s ratio of tax/GDP with those of other OECD countries involves a comparison with relatively high-tax countries. Many non-OECD countries within our region have lower ratios. For example, ratios in Singapore and Hong Kong in 2002 were approximately 22 and 15 percent respectively. 8 Based on 2002 GDP at current prices and exchange rates from OECD data.

New Zealand’s company tax rate is now in the top third of tax rates for OECD countries but lower than the weighted average of 36.0%. The weighted average is substantially affected by the largest economies (US, Japan and Germany), which have the highest corporate tax rates. There appears to be a general tendency for smaller economies to have lower statutory company tax rates than those of larger economies.

The countries with the highest company tax rates, Japan, US, and Germany, have respectively the fourteenth lowest, the third lowest and the lowest ratios of corporate tax collections as a proportion of GDP. A key feature of the New Zealand tax system is the importance of the corporate tax base. In 2002, as shown in Figure 4, New Zealand had the sixth highest ratio of company tax as a proportion of GDP. In New Zealand this has risen from 4.2 percent, as reported in Figure 4, to an estimated 5.1 percent in the year to March 2005. 9 Companies in Australia and other countries may also be subject to taxes that do not exist in New Zealand – such as a comprehensive capital gains tax, payroll tax and stamp duties.

Personal tax rates As shown in Figure 5, New Zealand’s top marginal personal income tax rate of 39% 10 is low by OECD standards, with only Mexico and the Slovak Republic having lower rates, and the OECD-weighted average being 46.6%. While New Zealand has a relatively low top marginal tax rate, Table 1 indicates that it applies at a relatively low level of income (only 1.4 times the average production wage). The data reported in Figure 5 show the top marginal tax rate on wage income, inclusive of contributions to social security. Marginal tax rates on wage income do not tell the full story, however, since more than half of OECD countries have lower taxes on capital income such as interest. New Zealand’s top marginal tax rate may look relatively less favourable if compared with the top marginal tax on different forms of capital income. Other things being equal, New Zealand’s relatively low structure of marginal tax rates, the relatively small difference between marginal tax rates (varying between 15% on low incomes and 39% on high incomes) and its low top marginal tax rate are all likely to minimise economic inefficiencies. Even so, problems related to the 39% and 33% tax rates are emerging, as discussed later in “Key challenges in tax policy”. 10 Excludes ACC levy of 1.2%.

For families, effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) can be very much higher than their statutory tax rates. The EMTR measures the fraction of an additional dollar of an individual’s income that is lost by way of tax payments and the abatement of social assistance. The high EMTRs faced by many families are of policy concern, although how best to reduce them is a thorny issue. The Working for Families scheme was designed to make entering the workforce more attractive to families with dependent children and increase their incomes. Figure 6 shows the effects of these measures on disposable incomes after full implementation of Working for Families in 2008, under three different scenarios, all excluding the accommodation supplement. 11 The first scenario concerns a wage and salary earner with no dependent children. The second scenario shows a single-income couple with one child aged 0-12, and scenario 3 is for a single-income couple with three children (all 12-years-old or under). In all three scenarios it is assumed that the family is not a beneficiary, so abatement of social welfare benefits is not considered. 12 11 Disposable incomes are market income net of tax payments and inclusive of income assistance. 12 This is not necessarily completely realistic as people on low wages working less than 20 hours (30 for a couple) would be financially better off on a benefit if they qualified. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 26 Figure 6 – Disposable income (one earner family, non-beneficiaries) 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 45,000 50,000 55,000 60,000 0 4,5009,000 13,50018,00022,50027,00031,50036,00040,50045,00049,50054,00058,50063,00067,50072,00076,50081,000 Market income Disposable Income, $ scenario 3 = couple w ith 3 children scenario 2 = couple w ith one child scenario 1 = salary earner w ith no children The vertical differences between the graphs reported in Figure 6 for scenarios 2 and 3 and that for scenario 1 show the assistance provided to families. While these measures assist lower-income families with children, as family assistance abates, families may capture little benefit from increasing their market incomes. For households receiving the accommodation supplement, disposable incomes will be higher than reported in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows the EMTRs faced under the three scenarios outlined earlier. 13 13 Including ACC levy of 1.2%.

This rises to 101.2% once the sole income earner is working sufficient hours to be classified as a full-time employee. This is due to 79 percent abatement of the family tax credit, plus the 21% statutory rate and the ACC levy. At a salary of around $21,000 the family tax credit abates in full. EMTRs at higher incomes are affected by the abatement of family support and the in-work payment (at an abatement rate of 30 percent) and the ACC levy. The EMTRs reported in Figure 7 do not take account of the accommodation supplement, which abates at 25 percent from an income of about $24,500. Some households face the additional 25 percent abatement for the accommodation supplement in addition to the in-work payment abatement rate of 30 percent, giving them EMTRs of 77.2 % (52.2+25) or 89.2% (64.2+25). 14 However, there are few households that receive the accommodation supplement and have incomes above $38,000 and are therefore subject to EMTRs of 89.2%. Further, some households receive the accommodation supplement but not family support or the in-work payment. The EMTRs reported in Figure 7 do not take account of childcare subsidies, which also abate with income. In addition, some of those required to make child support payments or repay student loans may regard such payments as a tax. If they were included as taxes, EMTRs would be higher. High EMTRs may not be a source of substantial inefficiency if they apply over narrow bands of income and do not affect work or savings decisions for many taxpayers. Figure 7 suggests, however, that 14 In theory, it is possible for households to face an EMTR of 95.2% (70.2+25) but as far as we are aware there are no such households. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 28 families may face high EMTRs over very broad ranges of income. Figure 7 illustrates the EMTRs faced by sole income families, but high EMTRs can also be of concern for secondary income earners in two-income families. For households in income bands where these high EMTRs apply, additional income may not always be taxed at high EMTRs. If, for example, additional income is earned by way of fringe benefits or in superannuation funds, the income can be sheltered from abatement of family assistance. This may ameliorate work and savings disincentives but, at the same time, it will distort the way that people are remunerated and the way they save. There may also be scope for the self-employed to earn income through trusts and companies to shelter it from abatement of family assistance, which can lead to perceptions of unfairness. This is a difficult area in which there are no easy solutions. High EMTRs are a consequence of targeting income assistance. If income assistance were not targeted, fiscal costs would increase. The only ways of reducing EMTRs are either to deliver less in the way of family assistance or to make family assistance less closely targeted. Key challenges in tax policy New Zealand has relatively broad tax bases for both income and expenditure and relatively low statutory tax rates. This might be thought to imply that, at least for households without children or beyond the income levels at which family assistance is typically abated, the New Zealand tax system is likely to work well and efficiently. Nevertheless, there appear to be emerging and conflicting pressures. First, globalisation is placing downward pressure on the company tax rate, and many countries have reduced their company tax rates in recent years. New Zealand needs to decide whether it too should reduce its company tax rate. Second, there seems to be growing evidence of tax sheltering and income splitting, raising questions about the robustness of New Zealand’s tax system. This appears to be at least in part a consequence of New Zealand’s company and trustee tax rates being lower than the top marginal tax rate. By itself, any reduction in the company tax rate would add to the possibility of further tax sheltering. Globalisation and downward pressure on company and personal tax rates In an open economy like New Zealand’s the company tax rate has a dual function. First, for domestic shareholders it provides a withholding tax on income derived through companies. At present, the company tax rate is 33%, and the top marginal personal tax rate is 39%. So long as the company tax rate is less than the top personal tax rate, high-income individuals who wish to accumulate savings for a period before spending them on consumption will be better off if they hold their investments in a company than if they hold their investments directly. So long as profits are accumulating they are taxed at the company tax rate rather than the higher tax rates of shareholders. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 29 This can make companies a vehicle for sheltering income from higher rates of personal tax, even though when profits are eventually distributed they will be subject to tax at the tax rates of shareholders. Second, for foreign shareholders and for domestic tax-exempt entities, company tax acts as a final tax. As a result of New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit (FITC) system, there is normally no additional tax when profits are distributed to foreign shareholders. If not for international considerations, there would be a strong attraction to aligning the company tax rate and top personal rate, as was the case when New Zealand’s full imputation reform was initially introduced. This prevents companies from being used to shelter income. Income sheltering results in people in the same circumstances (one with a company and one without) paying significantly different levels of tax. Such sheltering undermines a progressive tax rate policy and creates unfairness, thereby eroding the overall integrity of the tax system. Nevertheless, the company tax rate also needs to be set taking into account international considerations. In particular: • Too high a rate may discourage efficient inbound equity investment. 15 • Higher rates than those of trading partners may create incentives for tax planning by transfer pricing and thin capitalisation to stream profits to lower-tax-rate countries. 16 • Too high a company tax rate may increase distortions to investment decisions and constrain economic growth. 17 An important phenomenon over the last 20 years has been a worldwide downward trend in company tax rates. Figure 8 shows the trend in the statutory corporate tax rates since 1985, excluding state taxes and surtaxes. 18 15 This consideration led the Tax Review 2001 to suggest options for reducing the New Zealand tax rate on companies to 18% to the extent the company is owned by non-residents. These options were considered by the government but ultimately rejected on the grounds of fiscal costs and administrative impracticality. 16 For evidence on transfer pricing and thin-capitalisation within OECD countries see Bartlesman and Beetsma, 2003, “Why pay more? Corporate tax avoidance through transfer pricing in OECD countries”, Journal of Public Economics, 87, 2225-2252. 17 A recent paper by Lee and Gordon (2005) suggests a strong negative relationship between the company tax rate and economic growth (see, Lee, Y., and R.H. Gordon (2005), “Tax Structure and Economic Growth”, Journal of Public Economics, 89, 1027 – 1043. 18 See James Kelly and Robert Graziani – “International trends in company tax rates – Implications for Australia’s company income tax”, and the OECD Tax Database. For countries with a progressive structure of company tax rates, the top marginal tax rate is recorded. Because these data do not include state taxes and surtaxes they will tend to understate total tax rates in some other countries. The data show the standard company tax rate and ignore the fact that some countries may have preferential tax rates for certain activities.

Over the same period the Australian company tax rate fell from 46% to 30%, and the New Zealand rate fell from 45% to 33%. At the beginning of the 1990s New Zealand’s corporate income tax rate was well below the OECD average and similar to the average of a group of ten ASEAN countries. 19 Since then, reductions in the company tax rate in other countries mean that New Zealand’s company tax rate is no longer relatively low. Our relatively high company tax rate, at present, may make New Zealand an unattractive place in which to establish a regional headquarters. The importance of this is difficult to measure, and other considerations – such as size of market, other taxes, labour costs and other regulatory considerations – may often be more important. A relatively high company tax rate also exposes New Zealand to transfer pricing and thin capitalisation pressures. Tax authorities in New Zealand and other countries endeavour to constrain transfer pricing and thin capitalisation but there is strong international evidence that such measures are less than perfectly effective. A particular area of vulnerability for New Zealand is Australia’s tax system, given the importance of Australian investment into New Zealand. (Forty-six percent of foreign direct investment into New Zealand in 2003–04 came from Australia.) In 2000 Australia had a higher 19 The ten ASEAN countries are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 31 company tax rate than New Zealand, 36% compared with our 33%. Since then Australia has lowered its tax rate to 30%. An additional consideration is that Australian shareholders in Australian firms gain imputation credits for Australian taxes, but not for New Zealand taxes. Even if the New Zealand and Australian company tax rate were aligned, there would be an incentive for New Zealand subsidiaries of Australian parent companies to stream profits to Australia. Stemming these incentives may require New Zealand to have a significantly lower company tax rate than Australia’s. At present, company tax contributes more than 15 percent of total tax collections and therefore contributes significantly to the government’s overall fiscal position. The possible erosion of this tax base is a material fiscal risk. It is of interest to note that none of the five countries with greater tax collections as a percentage of GDP than New Zealand have higher company tax rates. A key concern is whether we will be able to continue to collect as much company tax as we do at present if we do not lower the rate of company tax. On the other hand, in the absence of any changes in corporate behaviour, lowering the company tax rate clearly reduces revenue. Robustness of personal income tax system In any tax system with varying marginal tax rates and a company or trustee tax rate below the top personal marginal tax rate there will be incentives to split and shelter income. By international standards, New Zealand has relatively little variation in statutory marginal tax rates. The range of 19.5% to 39% (or 15% to 39%, including low income earners’ rebate) is relatively narrow. Nevertheless, a number of key methods are currently used to split or shelter income. There are a number of specific anti-avoidance rules targeted at income splitting or sheltering as well as a general anti-avoidance rule, although their effectiveness is limited. Companies The use of a company is often a part of an arrangement that results in lower effective tax rates for individuals. 20 The business is undertaken by the company. The company income is taxed at 33% and when distributed is taxed again at the recipient’s marginal tax rate, with an imputation credit for the company tax paid. If the company is owned by a shareholder whose marginal tax rate is 39%, the effect is one of deferral until the income is distributed. Trusts The income of a trust can be taxed as trustee income at a rate of 33% and later distributed to beneficiaries on a 39% marginal tax rate, with no further tax impost. Therefore the 39% marginal tax rate can be avoided by the use of trusts. Alternatively, the income can be directed to a beneficiary 20 There can also be non-tax reasons, such as asset protection, for using companies. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 32 (perhaps a spouse) whose income may be taxed at a rate below 33%. It seems reasonable to assume that little income passed through trusts is taxed at 39%. The use of a trust owning a trading company has become much more common recently, in which case the 33% company tax is often effectively a final tax, even though the beneficiaries of the trust may be taxed at a rate of 39%. Other assets are also frequently placed in a trust. 21 If the assets are income- earning (for example, as business premises can be) a 33% maximum tax rate is often achieved. Less commonly, but prevalent in some parts of rural New Zealand, trading trusts are being used for active business and achieve the same effect. Families and associated persons The personal income of a high marginal rate taxpayer can be split with an associated low marginal rate taxpayer to avoid tax. This might be achieved by transferring an income-producing asset to the low rate taxpayer. Business income might also be split by paying a wage to the low rate taxpayer, or by operating as a partnership and paying the low earning ‘partner’ a proportion of the profits. If such payments are not commensurate with the contribution of the low rate taxpayer the arrangement may be subject to general anti-avoidance provisions, although they will never prevent all income splitting. SSCWT and FBT “salary sacrifices” We have some evidence that “salary sacrifices” for employer superannuation contributions are being actively marketed. (A “salary sacrifice” is the forgoing of salary and wage income to get other benefits.) A salary sacrifice for employer superannuation contributions, which are taxed as SSCWT (specified superannuation contribution withholding tax), can result in salary income that would be taxed at 39% being taxed at a lesser rate. SSCWT involves contributions being taxed at 33% or even less. There are also incentives for salary sacrifice for fringe benefits because of the non-abatement of family assistance against fringe benefits. As charities are not taxed on fringe benefits, there are likely to be particularly strong incentives for charities to remunerate their employees by way of fringe benefits rather than salary and wages. Empirical evidence Figure 9 shows aggregate income of individuals for the years 1999, 2002 and 2004. It shows three large peaks. The first is around the $9,000 to $18,000 area and relates to recipients of government transfer payments. The second and third peaks are around the marginal income tax thresholds of $38,000 and $60,000. From 1989–90 to 1999–00 the top personal marginal tax rate was aligned with the company tax rate and trustee tax rate. From 2000–01 the top personal marginal tax rate was raised to 39%, while the 21 Asset protection can also be a non-tax reason for using trusts. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 33 company tax rate and the trustee tax rate were left unchanged. Since then there has been substantial growth in the number of taxpayers earning income around the 33% and 39% thresholds of $38,000 and $60,000, which is likely, at least in part, to be evidence of tax sheltering or income splitting. Figure 9 – Aggregate taxable income of individuals by $1,000 bands of taxable income 22 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 0 5,000 10,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,00050,00055,00060,00065,00070,00075,00080,00085,00090,00095,000 100,000 Aggregate taxable income, $ million 2004 2002 1999 Figure 10 shows the growth in numbers of individuals with incomes in different income bands between 1998–99 and 2003–04. 23 In the absence of tax considerations, it might reasonably have been expected that there would be negligible or negative growth in the lowest income bands and strongest growth rates in the highest income bands as income growth shifts individuals up the income spectrum. However, numbers of taxpayers with incomes below $38,000 grew by 1.0 percent, those with incomes between $38,000 and $60,000 grew by 48.4 percent, those with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 grew by 71.8 percent, those with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 grew by 32.1 per cent, those with incomes between $150,000 and $500,000 grew by 24.7 percent, those with incomes between $500,000 and $1 million grew by 8.2 percent and those with incomes above $1 million fell by 6.3 percent. While there is no obvious evidence of people sheltering from the top 39% marginal tax rate in the $60,000 to $100,000 range, the slower or negative growth rates for higher income individuals is likely 22 Up to $100,000. 23 The figures for higher income individuals are less reliable because they are based on a sample of incomes, meaning the margin of error is higher for them because fewer taxpayers are involved. The year 1998–99 is used as the base year because businesses paid quite unusually high levels of dividends in 1999–00. This was likely to have been influenced by the increase in the top marginal tax rate from 33% to 39% in the following year. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 34 evidence that significant numbers of those with substantial amounts to gain through income splitting and tax sheltering are availing themselves of these opportunities. Between 1998–99 and 2003–04 the proportion of shareholder/employees reporting salaries of exactly $60,000 (to the nearest dollar) rose from 0.45 percent to 4 percent of such individuals. The number of individuals deriving over $100,000 from shareholder salaries almost halved over the same period, to 3,600. Figure 10 – Growth in numbers of taxpayers 1998–99 to 2003–04 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 <$38K$38-60K$60-100K100-150K$150-500K $500K-1M>$1M % Increase In the absence of tax considerations, there would be no a priori reason for there to be different growth rates for tax paid by companies, trusts and other persons. In the absence of any changes in behaviour, it might perhaps be expected that the increase in the top personal marginal tax rate would increase tax collections from other persons relative to trusts and companies. However, between 1998–99 and 2003–04 tax paid by trusts grew by more than 105 percent, to $480 million, while company tax grew by 71 percent, to $6,581 million, and tax paid by individual other persons rose only 16 percent, to $3,858 million. Similarly, and in the absence of tax considerations, there would be no reason to expect different growth rates in the fraction of the income of trusts that is taxed as trustee income and the fraction taxed as beneficiary income. However, the increase in the top personal marginal tax rate to 39% means that those on the highest marginal tax rate can shelter income in trusts by having it taxed at a rate of 33% as trustee income. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 35 Figure 11 shows trust income between 1998–99 and 2003–04, split by trustee income and beneficiary income. Over the five years from 1998–99 to 2003–04 24 trustee income grew by 256 percent and beneficiaries’ income by 28 percent. Practically all of this income growth is in the form of imputed dividends. Figure 11 – Income from trusts (IR 6) 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 199920002001200220032004 Income, $ million trustee beneficiary This difference in growth rates may not all be an indication of people sheltering from the top personal marginal tax rate. Part of the reason for the difference may be changes to the minor beneficiary rule in the Income Tax Act, which resulted in income distributed by a trust to a minor beneficiary being taxed as trustee income in 2002 and subsequent years. Although there is no hard evidence yet of significant increases in salary sacrifice, there is strong anecdotal evidence that schemes using SSCWT to lower tax payments aggressively are on the rise. The cumulative evidence suggests that, in practice, our tax system may be much less progressive than the statutory tax rates would suggest, which raises concerns about the possible corrosion of the tax system. In a self-assessment system such as New Zealand’s, it is critical for taxpayers to accept that the tax rules are broadly fair and even-handed. There is a danger that the emerging pressures we have identified may undermine the willingness of individuals to comply voluntarily. This needs to be taken into account when considering future changes. A key consideration when examining future possible tax changes is whether they increase or decrease the robustness of the tax system. 24 Some trust returns remain outstanding for 2003–04, so the increases are likely to be a little higher once all the returns are completed. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 36 International comparisons The income splitting and tax sheltering opportunities we have highlighted are not unique to New Zealand and, at least on the surface, there would appear to be greater problems in many other countries that have greater differences between the top and the bottom personal marginal tax rates or between the top personal tax rate and the company rate. In particular, New Zealand’s gap between its company tax rate and top personal rate looks small when compared with Australia’s (a six percentage point gap as opposed to Australia’s 18.5 percentage point gap). 25 However, New Zealand may be less able to sustain a major difference because of the absence of a capital gains tax. The absence of a capital gains tax allows those on the top marginal tax rate to realise profits from a company as a tax-free capital gain rather than income. This can lead to the 33% company tax rate being very similar to a final tax when profits can be accumulated for a sufficiently long time before eventual distribution. We are not advocating the introduction of a capital gains tax. The question of whether to introduce a capital gains tax was examined by the Tax Review 2001, which concluded that “the disadvantages of taxing capital gains on a realisation basis outweighed any theoretical benefits from extending the base in this way”. However, if the company tax were reduced significantly, relative to the top personal marginal rate, this issue might need to be reconsidered. For example, in Ireland a capital gains tax is considered essential to maintain the large difference between its company tax rate of 12.5%, and the top marginal personal income tax rate of 48%. 26 Measures to deal with income splitting and tax sheltering Perhaps because of greater differences in tax rates, other countries have done more than New Zealand in directly targeting income splitting and tax sheltering. Measures that deal with income splitting and sheltering are likely to be more administratively complex than aligning rates. Effectively, people’s incentives to avoid tax increase the less rates are aligned, and preventing avoidance necessarily gets more difficult and necessitates more complex rules. Unless the government is willing to move to closer alignment of rates, we may need to consider some of these more complex rules. When looking at countries with tax systems similar to New Zealand’s (Australia, Canada, the UK, the US and Ireland), the most common measures have been: • the alignment of trust and top personal tax rates • income attribution rules • rules to prevent the sheltering of personal services income through a company and • excess retention taxes on the undistributed income of a company. The most common approach taken in these countries has been the alignment of trustee and top personal rates, thus removing the incentive to use a trust to shelter income. In Australia, the UK, Canada and the US, the trustee rate is generally aligned with the top personal rate. Ireland also 25 Of course, Australia’s larger gap may also be problematic. 26 “All in rate” including social security and regional taxes. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 37 largely aligns rates by imposing a penalty tax on the undistributed income of discretionary and accumulation trusts, effectively equating the trustee rate with the top personal rate. Income attribution rules are in place in Canada and the United Kingdom. These “attribution” (Canada) or “settlement” (UK) rules are aimed at preventing income splitting with a taxpayer (including via a trust) subject to a lower tax rate. Transferred income can be attributed to income of the person making the transfer. These rules can be both complex and costly to administer, and are subject to a number of exceptions limiting their effectiveness. More recent reforms attempting to plug these gaps in Canada have added another layer of complexity yet still result in exploitable gaps. Similar rules apply specifically to trusts in the US. Rules are in place in Australia, the UK, the US and Canada to prevent the sheltering of personal services income through a company. These rules, generally termed “personal services company” rules, have been implemented in two ways. Company income can be attributed to the owner(s) of the company, as happens in Australia, the UK and the US. Alternatively, the company can be denied deductions and any other benefits that an individual would not be entitled to, as occurs in Canada. Although other measures implemented overseas have had mixed success, there appears to be some consensus as to the benefit of personal service company rules. While also somewhat complex, these rules appear very successful in countering the sheltering of income from personal exertion in companies. New Zealand already has rules that cover the most blatant forms of sheltering personal exertion income. However, as long as the top personal and company rate are not aligned there appears to be a case for more comprehensive reform such as that in place in Australia. The US and Ireland both charge a penalty tax on excess retentions of income to prevent sheltering within a company. In some cases, Canada imposes a tax on investment income to promote distribution. The tax is then refunded on distribution. These rules appear to be complex, and have potential repercussions on companies’ incentives to reinvest retained earnings. Considering such measures requires some caution. Possible directions for reform There are a number of possible future directions for reform. First, if there were sufficient fiscal headroom, one possibility would be to lower the top personal marginal tax rate to reduce discrepancies between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal rate. This option becomes more difficult if a substantial reduction in the company tax rate is being contemplated. A second alternative is to increase the company and trustee tax rate to the top personal marginal tax rate. However, there are obvious problems with this direction of reform, given the increased incentives it would provide for transfer pricing and thin capitalisation. It is also likely to discourage inbound NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 38 investment and hinder growth. Moreover, moves in this direction would not affect incentives for income splitting within a family, which largely depends on differences in rates of personal income tax. A third option might involve some intermediate approach such as reducing the top personal marginal tax rate to 36%, increasing the trustee tax rate to 36% and reducing the company tax rate to 30%. This would maintain a six percentage point difference between the company tax rate and top personal rate and thereby not increase corporate tax sheltering opportunities for those on the top personal marginal rate relative to the status quo. At the same time it would remove the opportunity for trusts to be used to shelter income from the top personal marginal rate of tax. The fourth possible direction of reform is to consider introducing some of the measures that other countries have adopted to directly confront income splitting and tax sheltering. This would, however, be likely to complicate the tax system. Even if there were to be greater tax rate alignment under one of the first three options, some move in this direction may be necessary. This is because tax sheltering schemes may be used not only to shelter income from higher rates of personal tax but also to shelter income from the very much higher effective marginal tax rates which arise when family assistance is being abated or child support is being assessed. Key themes in future work Base maintenance and remedial legislation will always be key features of the tax policy work programme. In addition, a key theme over the next three years should be to consider measures to make the personal income tax system more robust. This could involve tax rate changes or strengthening anti- avoidance measures aimed at countering income splitting and tax sheltering – or a combination of the two. An important goal is to ensure that as much as possible of a person’s tax liability is independent of how he or she structures the vehicle through which income is earned. A second key theme is to increase the robustness of our tax rules on foreign investment in New Zealand. This theme stems from the importance of company tax as a revenue source for New Zealand. There are strong international pressures on the company tax base, and any major reduction in this base is likely to place upward pressure on other tax rates. One way of increasing robustness is to lower the company tax rate; another is to step up measures that counter tax avoidance and international arbitrage by companies operating in New Zealand. When New Zealand introduced its full imputation system, in 1989, it decided that it would not provide imputation credits to foreign investors. The aim was to tax profits earned by foreign-owned firms that are sourced within New Zealand. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 39 At present, however, some strong pressures are tending to erode source-basis taxation when companies are wholly or partly foreign owned. These include: • streaming of imputation credits which would normally be received by foreign residents back to New Zealand residents and • diversion of New Zealand profits to foreign countries and then streaming them back to foreign parties without full New Zealand tax being paid, as a result of our conduit or dividend withholding payment provisions. Australia is a very important foreign investor into New Zealand, and when Australian firms invest into New Zealand through branches or subsidiaries the Australian full imputation system provides incentives for profits to be streamed to Australia to avoid New Zealand tax. The incoming government will also need to consider other important international issues. For example, concerns have been expressed that New Zealand’s relatively high rates of withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties can provide an impediment to international investment. Australia has raised the issue of withholding tax in relation to our double tax agreement, to which we need to respond by the end of the year. There can be reasons to be cautious about reducing rates of withholding taxes. Withholding taxes on interest and royalties can be important in helping sustain source basis taxation, which is especially important if New Zealand wants to maintain a significant company tax base. In our view, progressing both these international taxation concerns and measures to make the personal tax rate system more robust are key priorities for the next three years. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 40 Administration of tax and social support programmes Introduction Through our people we deliver the services that the community needs to meet their obligations and receive their entitlements. We are a large employer, with 4,762 full-time equivalents in 17 cities and towns around New Zealand. Over the past three years we have worked hard to develop the skills of our people, particularly their tax technical and leadership skills. In the 2004 staff climate survey, our people showed strong support for our strategic direction and our approach. The tax administration continues to enjoy high levels of community confidence, as shown by strong revenue flows and high levels of customer satisfaction with our services. As at 30 June 2005, 85% of customers rated our services as good or very good. We have maintained this level of confidence in the face of a continually changing environment, which includes a continued growth in the customer base. However, there are a number of challenges that we still need to address. The key issues We have four challenges: • The department is currently implementing a full programme of initiatives, which would need to be reprioritised if we were required to implement any new initiatives • The continuing growth in the customer base and community expectations is putting pressure on our ability to manage the annual workloads • Pressures on the department’s infrastructure, particularly our information technology systems and people capability needs to address changes to policy or new business. • Addressing compliance issues, arising from the growth in customer base and demonstrable shifts in customer behaviour in response to current policy setting. Status of the operational work programme Before this year’s general election, we had a full operational work programme which included the proposals announced in Budget 2005. 27 In the medium term, this puts considerable pressure on our ability to develop and implement the operational work programme in an integrated way. Table 2 sets out the major features 28 of the operational work programme in terms of the development of the administrative processes required to implement announced policy initiatives. This programme needs to be revised in accordance with any changes in government policy or priorities. For example, any new initiatives would require reprioritising the current operational work programme. 27 KiwiSaver and the carbon tax. 28 This table does not include the design and implementation of the myriad of initiatives that form our business-as-usual improvement programme. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 41 Table 2– Major features of the operational design work programme to June 2007 Period Major work and initiatives to be implemented June 2005 to December 2005 • Initiate project for the design and development of the proposed KiwiSaver programme • Initiate project for the design and implementation of the proposed treatment of the collective investment vehicles • Implementation of the extended paid parental leave for self- employed people. December 2005 to June 2006 • Introduction of In-work Payment (IWP) • Initiate project for the design and development of the proposed carbon tax • Implement discount for early payment of tax in first year for small- and medium-sized enterprises • Develop a B2B solution to improve Companies’ Registration information • Implement imaging technology to reduce manual processing, including an electronic document storage and retrieval (EDSR) system June 2006 to December 2006 • Plan for the proposed alignment of the provisional tax for GST and provisional tax for small- and medium-sized enterprises (subject to legislation) • Design and implement initiatives for the reviewed IRD number evidential requirements • Implement B2B solution to improve companies’ registration information December 2006 to June 2007 • Implement proposed carbon tax (1 April 2007) • Implement proposed KiwiSaver programme (1 April 2007) • Implement changes to policy for the treatment of the collective investment vehicles Through to June 2007, the department has a very busy schedule in designing and implementing the operational and technology-based systems for planned legislative changes. The ongoing implementation of the Working for Families package of reforms (particularly the development of the In- work Payment), and the design of administrative processes and systems for the proposed KiwiSaver and the carbon tax are set out below. Working for Families Phase two of the implementation of the Working for Families package of reform is currently under way, with the largest component being the introduction of the In-work payment to replace the current child tax credit. The In-work payment will become operational from 1 April 2006. The ongoing work effort required to implement the Working for Families reforms is considerable, requiring: NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 42 • significant system changes needed to support the various programmes • considerable growth in customer contacts across the department’s functions • working closely with the Ministry of Social Development to ensure that customers receive a seamless service across both agencies. This work will continue through to 1 April 2007, with the introduction of further increases in family support rates (as part of phase three of Working for Families package). Paid parental leave We are continuing to implement the changes to extend the paid parental leave scheme to cover people who are self-employed. The changes are effective from December 2005. KiwiSaver The proposed KiwiSaver was announced in Budget 2005 to encourage a change in the savings behaviour of individuals. As it was envisaged, Inland Revenue is to be the central administrator of KiwiSaver. The fundamentals of the design of KiwiSaver were approved by the former government. However, we (and other agencies) are conducting an ongoing process of detailed design and consultation with key stakeholders. As such, the final detailed design of the KiwiSaver scheme is yet to be established. Carbon tax The department has started work on the design of the proposed carbon tax (as announced in Budget 2005). The proposed carbon tax is expected to become operational on 1 April 2007. Growth in customer base The department is facing pressures from the continued growth in revenue assessed (Table 3) and the customer base 29 (Table 4), which are causing workload management issues across all of our service- based functions. Table 3– Growth in revenue assessed Tax type 30 June 2002 $ billion 30 June 2003 $ billion 30 June 2004 $ billion 30 June 2005 $ billion Direct taxation $24.557 $27.251 $29.178 $32.826 Indirect taxation $6.822 $7.720 $8.819 $9.220 Total taxation $31.379 $34.971 $37.997 $42.046 Table 4 – Growth in customer base 29 Note that the number of active entities is greater than New Zealand’s population. The reasons for this include: taxpayers remain in our system even if they are not currently resident in New Zealand (for example, the taxpayer may have an active student loan repayment obligation), and taxpayers may not have been deregistered after their deaths. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 43 Customer type June 2001 million June 2004 million % growth Social support 0.737 0.872 18% Taxpayers 5.303 5.769 9% The growth in the customer base is the result of: • social support programme changes that broadened eligibility for entitlements (such as Working for Families) and the increasing number of student loan borrowers. There is also significant fluidity in the base, with people moving in and out of work and changing family circumstances. • economic activity, which is supporting the growing number of businesses. Illustrating this growth, Figure 12 shows the increase in the number of small and medium sized enterprises over the past five years. These businesses generate considerable numbers of contacts in any given year. Figure 12 – Growth in small and medium sized enterprises 240,000 250,000 260,000 270,000 280,000 290,000 300,000 310,000 320,000 330,000 20002001200220032004 Enterprises Source: Statistics New Zealand Generally speaking, the growth in our customer base is generating an increased number of interactions that we have with our customers and this is putting considerable pressure on our ability to deliver our services. The drivers of these pressures include: • the generation of approximately 7.7 million forms and statements per year, which create, sometimes unnecessary, customer contacts. We need to redesign some of our processes to get benefits for government and taxpayers but, in doing this, this will incur costs in information technology and implementation. • the wide range of interactions we have with various customer groups, for example: - the nature and complexity of the query, and the frequency of contacts NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 44 - the range of channels available for customers to contact us, including traditional and electronic delivery channels • our ability to manage seasonal workloads, especially the peak period for telephone contacts, which is generally the last quarter of the financial year. Table 5 shows the number of peak and non-peak days 30 planned for the last quarter of 2004–05. Table 5 – Peak and non-peak days planned for last quarter 2004–05 Days planned Days actual Days with more than 17,500 calls accepted 40 54 Days with less than 17,500 calls accepted 36 22 In addressing the growth pressures, we have taken a broad-based approach by: • managing workloads through our business-as-usual processes with the appropriate reprioritisation of resources when required (particularly around peak periods for customer contacts) • seeking more cost-efficient options for the processing of information and the delivery of our services that make it easier for people to interact with us electronically. • training our people, and recruiting people with the right skills and knowledge required to deliver our services. Infrastructure In this section, we look at three broad areas: • our information technology systems • developing our people capability • accommodation issues. Ability to make information technology system changes The department operates a large information technology infrastructure to support the department’s various functions. The main component of our technology infrastructure is FIRST (Future Inland Revenue System Technology), which was introduced in 1992. At that time, the department’s role was purely tax administration and FIRST was designed accordingly. Since then the department’s responsibilities have been significantly expanded to include many social policy activities including family assistance, child support, and student loans. The technology support for these activities has been integrated into FIRST, creating a more complex system than was originally designed. This complexity continues to increase as our systems are modified to incorporate policy changes, resulting in both increased cost and time to implement further changes. 30 On a peak day we expect to accept more than 17,500 calls per day and on non-peak days we expect to accept less than 17,500 calls per day. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 45 Over the past 12 months there have been indications that our systems are reaching a “tipping point”, where consideration will need to be given to replace systems rather than make further changes to existing systems. This is a particular concern for the administration of the student loans system. We also have a full development programme implementing business-as-usual changes required to maintain the integrity of business processes, as well as development work to implement already initiated policy initiatives. Therefore, making significant changes to the systems will require Inland Revenue to reprioritise its development programme to ensure that priority changes can be made in a timely manner. Benchmarking (completed in 2003–04) against a number of international tax authorities found that we have a highly-educated, stable technology workforce, and that we efficiently use our hardware and processing power and storage. However, it also confirmed that our “time to market” for new products and services was at the high-end of industry standards. Delivering efficient electronic products and services We are recognised nationally as being a leading example in the delivery of online services. Our focus on designing and delivering services through electronic channels is consistent with the goals of the e- Government programme. The provision of services electronically provides people with easy and convenient access to our services and, therefore, reduces the need for people to contact us unnecessarily. Over the past three years there has been an increase in the range of services we offer electronically as shown in Table 6. Table 6 – Comparison of electronic services available from 2002 to 2005 Service 2002 2005 Authentication using a user ID with passwords and/or PIN 9 9 Use of third party filing software and vendors 9 9 Tax agents: client filing facilities 9 9 Tax agents: Look at Account Information service 9 Businesses: PAYE filing 9 9 Businesses: GST filing 9 Businesses: Income tax filing 9 Individuals: Income tax filing 9 Individuals: Look at Account Information service 9 Payment by internet banking 9 9 Payment by credit card 9 Online correspondence 9 35 interactive online forms 9 15 online calculators 9 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 46 The key driver of this development has been our e-enablement strategy. Launched in 2002, this strategy initially focused on providing the most easily implemented services through electronic channels. This approach was intended to support the E-government strategy goal for 2004 of the internet being the dominant means of enabling ready access to government services. We are currently refreshing our 2002 e-enablement strategy to assess our current position and to realign it in accordance with the E-government goal of: “by June 2010, the operation of government will have been transformed through its use of the Internet”. Many international revenue authorities have highlighted the importance of introducing new electronic services and transforming their business through the use of the e-channel. One of the key challenges in this area is realising efficiency gains through the introduction of these new services. The experience of other similar organisations suggests that new electronic services can increase operating costs. This is because these services are in addition to, rather than replacements for, existing services. It is not until there is significant uptake of the new services that the cost efficiencies are gained. An OECD assessment 31 suggested that we are still relatively immature in terms of our uptake and marketing strategies. We are experiencing slow but steady increases in the level of uptake, which shows that there is more scope for us to improve our marketing of these services. However, we are experiencing an increasing number of tax agents and individuals using our Look at Account Information service to access account information. Illustrating the extent of this growth, Table 7 shows the number of accounts accessed during three months of 2004–05. Table 7 – Accounts accessed through our Look at Account Information service for the month July 2004 January 2005 July 2005 Accounts accessed by tax agents 4,677 83,578 294,783 Accounts accessed by individuals 460 17,659 57,087 Service contracts In addition to the delivery of electronic services, during the 2004–05 year we took important steps to establish forward-looking contracts with some of our key service providers. During 2004–05, we signed a new seven-year mainframe services contract with EDS, which has increased our processing capacity and takes advantage of improved technology. This provides us with a more cost-efficient service. This is vital for our ability to meet the growing demand for our services and to secure our future business needs. 31 In 2004, the OECD Forum on Tax Administration Taxpayer Services sub-group surveyed the trends in revenue authorities use of new technology to deliver services. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 47 In April 2005, we signed a six-year telecommunications services outsourcing agreement with TelstraClear. Under this agreement, TelstraClear will provide a managed service for our telecommunications needs. The modernisation of our telecommunication network increases its business usefulness (making it flexible, cost-effective and scaleable) and provides a platform from which we can improve productivity. The advanced functionality has the potential to allow staff to respond more quickly to customer queries and reduce call waiting times. This will translate to improvements in our interactions with taxpayers and within Inland Revenue. People capability Our biggest asset is our people and we continue to make a large investment in their development. This is vital for the department’s ability to ensure the sustainability of the tax system, deliver our services today and to prepare for future challenges and service requirements. Given the diverse nature of our tax and social support programme work, we need to have a wide range of skills and knowledge to help us deliver our services and achieve our outcomes. Some of the key drivers for our continued development include: • an increasing complexity in the business environment and in the types of issues that people are asking us. This is particularly the case in the compliance improvement areas around audit and debt collection, but also in terms of the increasing complexity being faced in our customer contacts and rulings requests. This means that we need to continue to develop our people’s technical expertise. • the addition of new functions, such as the proposed KiwiSaver and the carbon tax, also means that we need to develop a wider range of new skills that are not primarily based on taxation knowledge. We are addressing these requirements through ongoing training (for example our technical development programmes) but often the only response is to recruit new people who have the required skills. However, we are facing pressure in our ability to recruit people with the appropriate skills, particularly given the tight labour market that is seeking the same skills across the public and private sectors. We also face challenges in funding the level of remuneration required to attract and retain people with the skills we need. This issue is particularly relevant because: • although there is a low turnover rate of 10.2% across the department, we are concern about particular areas (predominantly tax technical areas) where turnover is higher than average and it is harder to recruit and train people in these areas • the level of competition in the labour market for specialist staff (for example tax professionals and information technology specialists). NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 48 Part of our approach to addressing this issue includes providing a competitive level of remuneration (commensurate with the public sector), access to appropriate training and a stimulating work environment to secure the long-term sustainability of our workforce. Accommodation issues We are facing pressure in our ability to accommodate our people. Key drivers of this pressure arise from recruitment of staff to address the growth in the customer base and recruitment to address new business. We are also likely to experience increases in rental expenditure as currently leases reach maturity and will need to be renegotiated. Addressing compliance issues We are guided in our compliance activities by the compliance model that promotes a tailored, responsive approach to taxpayers and social support customers (see Figure 13). It takes account of the external factors that influence taxpayers’ attitudes and behaviours. Our risk analysis recognises these differences in attitude and helps us develop appropriate ways of improving compliance. Figure 13 – Compliance model A key concept behind the model is that the majority of taxpayers comply voluntarily or aim to comply. For these taxpayers our response to a compliance concern is to make it easy for people to meet their obligations by tailoring our services to meet people’s individual needs. At the same time suitable sanctions are needed for cases where people deliberately do not comply. Enforcing the law in such cases helps to maintain overall taxpayer confidence in the tax system and encourages ongoing compliance. However, when we are undertaking work to enforce the law our approach needs to be designed to move taxpayers to a position where they are likely to comply voluntarily in the future. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 49 This means that we need to use an integrated mix of activities and skills to address non-compliance areas, such as: • compliance issues that have been identified by our enforcement activities (note that some of these issues are also discussed under “Tax policy” particularly tax sheltering and income splitting) • effects of growth in the customer base (for example increasing levels of debt). Compliance issues identified through enforcement activity We continue to focus our audit activity on high-risk areas such as avoidance and evasion. Recent legal challenges to major avoidance schemes were successful and these send a strong message to promoters of such schemes and to potential investors. Legislation enacted in 2003 reinforced the message by including a new penalty on promoters of certain tax schemes. A high priority was also given to tax evasion, particularly as a follow-up to the Industry Partnership initiatives to educate and promote compliance among taxpayers who were willing to do so. In auditing small- and medium-sized enterprises, our primary areas of focus included: • real estate property where tax issues arise from timing of claims on property purchases and undeclared profits relating to GST and income tax for speculative transactions • tax evasion and income suppression associated with taxpayers working outside of the tax system, failing to meet employer obligations and fraud cases (for example claiming false GST credits) • tax avoidance associated with various schemes that are intended to reduce a taxpayer’s tax liability. In many cases, these schemes are highly complex and often involve international arrangements or sophisticated structures that require lengthy audit work. Arising from this complexity, our auditors need to have highly developed technical knowledge and the skills to deal with these cases. The Courts are also taking a serious view in the sentencing of people convicted of tax evasion and avoidance offences. During 2004–05, we took prosecution action under the Crimes Act in five cases and prosecuted 41 people under the Revenue Acts. For the 2005–06 year we have 20 pending prosecutions under the Crimes Act, 75% for evasion and 110 pending prosecutions under the Revenue Acts of which 73% are for evasion offences. In addition, many of the concerns discussed under “Tax policy” are addressed in our audit activity, particularly: • the use of trusts owning a trading company is becoming more common. We have evidence that taxpayers are using trading trusts to alienate personal service income to reduce the tax rate they would pay on their incomes. The policy issues surrounding income splitting, tax sheltering and discussions on tax rates are discussed in the tax policy section. • New Zealand sourced-based income being artificially re-characterised as foreign income and taxed at the 15% withholding tax rate rather than the company tax rate of 33%. Issues around international tax are covered in the tax policy section. This highlights the fiscal risk posed by our NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 50 relatively high reliance on company tax collections. Administratively, this means we need to maintain, if not enhance, our audit and litigation capability in dealing with corporate taxpayers. • our audit activity has uncovered a number of GST fraud and avoidance schemes that revolve around input tax credit schemes to obtain tax refunds. Some of these schemes have involved identity fraud. GST schemes pose a high fiscal risk because if input credits are available with no offsetting output tax the result is a net government fiscal cost. International experience has demonstrated the high fiscal risks with GST-type taxes. The main response is likely to be audit and litigation but this may need to be backed by policy changes. • Finally, the high effective marginal tax rates for many individual taxpayers as a result of the abatement of family assistance and related measures is likely to require increasing focus on various forms of income sheltering. Debt management Over recent years, the rising level of collectable debt 32 has become a concern (Figure 14). Over the years, revenue has continued to grow significantly, while resources to collect overdue debt have remained static. At 30 June 2005, collectable debt was $1,553 million, compared to $1,296 million in 2004. 32 Collectable debt includes debt for all tax types and ages. The newer debt is the easier it is to collect, however, as debt ages it becomes harder to collect. Collectable debt also includes debt that is currently under an active repayment arrangement, which accounts for 41% of collectable debt as at 30 June 2005. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 51 Figure 14 – Collectable debt 2003–04 and 2004–05 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 JulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprMayJune Month $ billion 2004–05 2003–04 The main issues with debt include: • the increase in the level of debt • the older debt becomes the harder it is to collect, there is also the potential for more debt to be written off • complex business structures used to frustrate the collection of debt, for example “phoenix” companies 33 • the steady increase in the level of outstanding student loan debt. Addressing outstanding debt requires us to focus on maximising the amount of debt paid on-time and also improving taxpayer compliance behaviour. Our current debt management focus is on high-value debt, industry partnership debt (predominantly owed by small and medium sized enterprises), old debt (debt older than two years old) and debt assessed through our auditing activity. We have been making good progress in these areas and will continue this focus in the coming year. Child support Total child support debt has now passed $1billion. As at 30 June 2005, the level of child support debt had grown to $987 million, 16% more than in 2003–04 (see Figure 15). Of the total debt, 43% is assessment arrears and 57% is penalties. 34 33 A “phoenix” company is a company that has been “reborn” soon after (and in some cases before) its failure. The new company takes on the failed company’s business, often using a similar name, the same managers and directors, and the same assets, but without the previous company’s tax liabilities. 34 Currently there is no legislative flexibility to deal with the escalation in the level of child support penalties, which adds considerably to the level of total debt outstanding. Also, the incremental nature of the penalties can act as a disincentive to paying parents, which can result in them disengaging with the child support system. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 52 Figure 15 – Child support debt 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1,000 1999200020012002200320042005 $ million year as at 30 June Penalty debt Assessment debt Over time we have made good progress in managing our child support responsibilities. As at 30 June 2005, we have collected 86.3% of all child support assessed since the programme began in 1992. However, the present level of debt presents a significant risk to public perception in regard to the effectiveness of the child support programme. Funding has been provided in the 2004 and 2005 budgets to address the debt issue through administrative initiatives and these are now gaining traction. Child support legislative change Legislative changes crucial to supplement administrative improvements were proposed in the Child Support Amendment Bill (No. 4). The Bill has lapsed and public confidence in the child support programme will continue to erode unless you reinstate the Bill. A key component of the Bill is intended to bring non-compliant parents back into the child support system by providing incentives for them to reduce their outstanding child support debt through pro-rata write-off of incremental penalties for parents who meet their current liability and keep to their arrangement to repay arrears. Child support - international relationships We have a close working relationship with the Australian Child Support Agency and operate a reciprocal agreement 35 with them. In Budget 2005, we received an appropriation to pay for Australia to initiate the collection of payments from an additional 6,629 New Zealand cases where the parent has recently been identified as living in Australia. We are also considering similar agreements with other countries where there are known to be child support debtors. 35 This agreement provides for the collection of child support payments from New Zealanders living in Australia and Australians living in New Zealand. NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE – Briefing for the incoming Minister of Revenue – 2005 www.ird.govt.nz 53 As part of our international relationships, we keep a watching brief on developments in other jurisdictions, for example, the Australian Government recently commissioned a Ministerial task force to review the Australian child support programme. Recommendations in the report dated May 2005 are presently being considered by the Australian Government. Given the close nature of our relationship with Australia, we will need to consider making changes to the New Zealand system once the Australian Government have made final decisions.

Minister on tax reform
======================

In a speech today to the Financial Planners and Insurance Advisors Association, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne discussed the government’s business tax review and progress in policy areas such as reform of the tax rules on investment income.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Financial planners' and Insurance advisors' Association, Ellerslie Convention Centre, Auckland

Tax reform is like rust – it never sleeps.

As a result of the confidence and supply agreement between Labour and United Future, the term of this Parliament will be marked by a number of major tax initiatives, in addition to those measures already underway, and the ongoing programme of base maintenance through the various tax reform Bills each year.

We will have:

*   A major review of business tax arrangements, with changes taking effect from the start of the 2008 tax year;
*   A new regime for the tax treatment of charities and charitable donations;
*   A government discussion paper released on the merits of income splitting for families.

We have already seen the cancellation of the proposed carbon tax.

All these moves were key United Future policy objectives.

In addition, from the start of April this year, under the extension of the Working for Families package passed through Parliament at the end of last year, a further 60,000 families will become eligible for Family Assistance tax credits.

They range from a family with two children with an income of $45,000 a year receiving $277 a fortnight, through to a similar family earning $60,000, receiving $161 a fortnight.

This morning, I will talk about the business tax review, as well as some other specific issues of particular interest to your sector.

### Business Tax Review

No-one now doubts the need for a thorough review of business taxation to ensure our tax arrangements remain at the very least competitive with major trading partners like Australia, encourage investment and promote productivity.

But, pressing as the demand is, simple quick fixes will not work.

The lazy "just cut the rate now, and worry about the details later" approach some have taken to promoting is at best a short-term solution only, whereas the real need is for far more substantive reform.

Chanting simple slogans are not going to be enough – the challenges we face in the international market place are far more comprehensive than that.

Our major trading partner, Australia, is already looking at significant tax cuts to both business and private incomes in next year's Budget and we simply cannot afford to ignore what Canberra is planning.

Against that background, we have to do much better than simply gain a brief, temporary advantage – we have to be far bolder.

The Minister of Finance and I are working actively with Treasury and IRD officials on a range of options along these lines.

We plan to release a discussion paper in the middle of the year setting out these options, to focus debate and invite stakeholder engagement.

Then, we will take decisions in time for legislation to be passed through Parliament next year, so that the new regime can take effect in 2008.

This is precisely the timetable that would be followed for any major tax reform.

Now, let me turn to some specific issues that are before us at the present time, which will be the subject of action this year.

### Taxation of investment

In mid-2005 the government released a discussion document proposing comprehensive reform of the tax rules for investment income. Proposals concerned the:

*   taxation of domestic investment through managed funds; and
*   taxation of offshore portfolio investment in shares

Over 800 submissions were received. Broadly, the domestic proposals were supported by submissions, while the offshore proposals were overwhelmingly not supported

#### Domestic proposals

The government is concerned that people saving through NZ managed funds (such as superannuation funds and unit trusts) are taxed more heavily than people investing directly. The reasons for the overtaxation are:

*   A managed fund is in the business of investing so is generally taxed on its realised share profits.
*   The fund is generally taxed at 33% while many investors’ tax rates are below 33%.

Proposal – investment through collective investment vehicles (CIVs) that elect into the new rules would be taxed as follows:

*   Realised gains on shares in NZ companies would not be taxed.
*   Taxable income would flow through to investors in the fund and be taxed at investors’ personal tax rates.

Links to KiwiSaver:

*   CIV rules are necessary to prevent low income earners investing through KiwiSaver funds from being over-taxed. Therefore it is important to align the start date for CIV rules with the start date for KiwiSaver – so both will start on 1 April 2007.

#### Offshore tax proposals

*   The proposal is to apply consistent tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. This would mean that investments into the seven 'grey list' countries would no longer receive a tax preference.
*   Investments into offshore shares through collective investment vehicles would be taxed each year on the investment’s change in value (referred to as the comparative value approach). This would not significantly increase the level of tax paid on such investments (as realised share gains are generally already taxable to such vehicles).
*   Investments into offshore shares by individuals would be taxed on a similar basis, but with significant concessions – namely:
    *   Taxable income would be capped at the greater of 6% of the investment's value and the cashflow from the investment.
*   Gains above 6% would be taxed when the investor sells the offshore shares and does not purchase additional offshore shares. (In other words, an investor could switch offshore investments without triggering the additional tax.)
*   Individuals with offshore investments valued below NZD$50,000 would continue to pay tax only on dividends.

#### Submissions

*   Almost all submissions concerned the offshore proposals and were overwhelmingly negative. Key concerns of submitters are that:
    *   The proposed changes would tax capital gains (when there is no such tax on domestic investments).
    *   They would increase tax on investments into Australia – so would be anti-CER.
    *   They would penalise those who have a diversified portfolio.
    *   The rules would be too complex for individuals to comply with.
*   The government is listening to concerns and consulting on a modified proposal for offshore investment that takes account of submitters’ key concerns, while retaining the key policy aims of the original proposals.

#### Next steps

*   Officials are currently consulting with stakeholders on:
    *   modifications to the offshore proposals;
    *   various issues raised with the flow-through proposals for collective investment vehicles.
*   The government hopes to be in a position to make some announcements on modified proposals in March this year.
*   We are working towards introducing domestic and offshore proposals in a tax Bill in May this year, with application from 1 April 2007.

### Salary sacrifice – specified superannuation contribution withholding tax

*   The government is concerned about increased tax planning through salary sacrifice and tax planning schemes using the substitution of salary or wages for employer contributions to a superannuation fund. Under present law, the tax rate on employer contributions is based on the marginal tax rate of the employee's salary or wages paid by that employer.
*   An officials' issues paper released on 1 February outlined suggested legislative changes to minimise such tax planning schemes.
*   The preferred option is to tax employer superannuation contributions at the marginal tax rate of the employee, based on sum of the employee's salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions. The personal tax rate thresholds would be increased by 15% to prevent over-taxation when an employee moves across a threshold as a result of the employer’s contribution.
*   Submissions close 15 March. Based on the feedback they receive, officials will report to the government with formal recommendations for change.
*   The government intends to include resulting legislative changes in a tax bill to be introduced in May.

### KiwiSaver

*   Details of the KiwiSaver scheme were announced in Budget 2005. Broadly,  
      
    KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based saving scheme, due to start in April 2007, to help New Zealanders save. Inland Revenue will generally administer the scheme using the existing PAYE (pay as you earn) tax system.  
      
    Savings will be primarily for retirement and will be locked in until age of eligibility for NZ superannuation, although exceptions will be made in certain cases such as financial hardship and withdrawals after a minimum of three years, to contribute towards a deposit on a first home.  
      
    One of the key features of KiwiSaver is the portability of a saver’s funds. The scheme will provide the mechanism for the transfer of funds to a foreign superannuation scheme when a saver emigrates.  
      
    The government will make an upfront contribution of $1000 per person, to be locked in until the recipient reaches retirement age or for five years – whichever is the greater.  
      
    After three years of savings, the government will offer the saver a first home deposit subsidy of $1000 per year of membership, to a maximum of five years.

*   Officials have continued working with employers/employer association/providers/and others on the policy design and implementation.
*   A KiwiSaver bill is planned for introduction at the end of the month.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt tax policy work programme announced

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today announced the contents of the government's tax policy work programme over the next few months.

High on the list are the business tax review, measures to increase productivity and growth, and fundamental changes to savings policy and New Zealand’s international tax rules.

The work programme will be an interim one until the resource and policy requirements of the business tax review are clearer, Mr Dunne told the annual conference of the International Fiscal Association.

"The business tax review was one of several key projects that emerged from the confidence and supply agreements signed after the election," Mr Dunne said. "The others were a new system of tax rebates for charities, a discussion document on income splitting, and a review of racing industry rules.

"The aim of the business tax review is to ensure that the tax system provides better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

"Related measures include reviews of the level of withholding rates in our double tax agreements and of the tax rules that govern outbound investment from New Zealand into foreign subsidiaries.

"The other major focus of the work programme is to encourage savings and improve the way they are used. Work here involves the introduction of KiwiSaver, relieving the over-taxation of people who save through New Zealand-managed funds, and applying consistent tax rules to offshore portfolio investments in shares.

"Work programme measures to ensure that the tax rules operate smoothly, fairly and efficiently include reviews of the tax implications of the new International Financial Reporting Standards, new tax rules for both limited and ordinary partnerships, and completion of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act.

"In a similar vein, the government is considering changes to the operation of the shortfall penalty for having an 'unacceptable tax position', details of which I hope to announce over the next few weeks.

"Revenue base maintenance is always an essential feature of the work programme, to counter tax avoidance and ensure the reliable flow of revenue to government. To this end, the interim work programme includes a timely review of the use of imputation credits", Mr Dunne said.

Minister of Revenue

### Address to the 2006 Conference of the International Fiscal Association

_Millennium Hotel, Rotorua_  
_Friday 3 March 2006 at 10:15 am_

I am very pleased to have been invited to open your conference today.

The tax policy work programme that I am announcing today includes three important items that were part of the post-election confidence and supply agreement that I signed on behalf of United Future with Labour.

They are:

*   a major review of business tax rules, with a view to ensuring the system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia,
*   the development of a new tax rebate regime for charities, and
*   the preparation of a government discussion document on the merits of income splitting for families.

We also agreed that no legislation for the proposed carbon tax would be introduced in the absence of new analysis.

We have since seen the cancellation of the proposed tax.

A review of racing industry taxes also features on the work programme as a result of the confidence and supply agreement between New Zealand First and Labour.

All these matters represent significant new lines of work in the work programme.

The government's wider policy goals for the next three years include savings, productivity and growth, education and skills, science and innovation, and export growth.

Tax policy, which can have substantial and wide-ranging effects on the economy, has an important role to play in several of those areas – especially by encouraging productivity and growth, and encouraging savings and ensuring that they flow to where they are most valuable.

The government's tax policy work programme is usually developed at the beginning of the electoral cycle and then reviewed and updated half-way through.

New and updated work programmes are made public, for purposes of transparency and to ensure there are as few "surprises" as possible.

That is all part of the widely praised generic tax policy process.

This work programme is an interim one that covers work that is under way, or soon will be, including matters that have been carried over from the previous work programme, but does not extend much beyond the middle of the year.

The reason is simple.

The business tax review will involve a substantial commitment of tax policy resources and may include consideration of a variety of tax policy issues that may overtake the items on this interim work programme.

A finalised tax policy work programme to June 2007 will be announced after the resource and policy implications of the business tax review become clearer.

The taxation bill introduced in May last year is under consideration by the Finance and Expenditure Committee, which is expected to report back to Parliament in time for passage of the bill by the end of March.

That wide-ranging bill introduces a number of major reforms.

They include major changes to the tax depreciation, fringe benefit tax and securities lending rules.

They also include the introduction of measures to make tax easier for small businesses and measures to improve our access to worldwide capital, skills and labour.

May 2006 will see the introduction of another taxation bill, the first of the year.

I will be describing some of its contents shortly.

The tax measures presented on the work programme have a number of key objectives.

They include:

*   encouraging productivity, growth and international competitiveness,
*   encouraging savings and improving the way they are used, and
*   ensuring that the tax system operates smoothly, fairly and efficiently.

It is critical that the tax system does not stand in the way of businesses growing and thriving in New Zealand.

Therefore we need to make sure that our tax rules are internationally competitive.

**Business tax review**

The business tax review is the major new item on the tax policy work programme.

It was a critical part of the agreement between United Future and Labour, and I am personally strongly committed to ensuring the outcome is both significant and beneficial.

The goal is to ensure that the tax system provides better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

Policy officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury are working intensively on this issue with the Minister of Finance and me.

Proposals for consultation will be released in the middle of the year.

We intend that the new regime take effect from 1 April 2008.

**NRWT treaty rates**

As announced late last year, we are reviewing the level of withholding tax rates covered in our double tax agreements, including our very important agreement with Australia.

Australia has reduced withholding rates on interest, dividends and royalties in its double tax agreements with the United Kingdom and the United States.

In view of these developments, New Zealand is reviewing its own policy on withholding rates, and we hope to come to a decision on the matter in the course of the year.

**Outbound CFC investment**

Also under review are the tax rules that govern outbound investment from New Zealand into foreign subsidiaries.

The review has the potential to affect the rules on controlled foreign companies, foreign dividend withholding payments and conduit relief.

The main matter under consideration is whether there should be an active-passive distinction in the tax treatment of these subsidiaries – in other words, whether substantive economic activity such as manufacturing should be treated differently from passive income such as dividends, interest and royalties.

Other options for relief that do not threaten New Zealand's tax base are also under consideration.

**Australian super funds**

The next taxation bill is likely to include legislation to exempt job-related superannuation schemes in Australia from New Zealand's foreign investment fund rules.

This will mean that Australians and returning New Zealanders who come here for long-term employment will no longer have to pay tax in New Zealand on their interests in those Australian super schemes – thus removing a disincentive to coming to work in New Zealand.

It is also important that the tax system does not stand in the way of capital flowing to its most productive use.

**Depreciation issues**

As I mentioned earlier, changes to the depreciation rules are a major item in the taxation bill that is currently before Parliament.

These proposed changes will reduce government revenue by an estimated $1 billion over the next four years, but offsetting that is our ongoing commitment to ensuring that the tax depreciation rules work well and minimise distortions.

Work will continue on a range of further tax depreciation issues.

They include examining whether depreciation loading should apply to long-lived infrastructure assets such as roads, bridges and wharves, and the case for allowing losses arising from the disposal or scrapping of buildings.

**Geothermal exploration issues**

The government is looking at tax issues relating to exploration and development of geothermal energy, in response to concerns raised by companies involved in power generation.

The goal is to ensure that the tax rules do not deny tax deductions for true business costs.

I understand there has been a good response to an issues paper released late last year suggesting changes to the tax treatment of expenditure on geothermal wells.

It seems that submissions agree with the thrust of the suggested changes but – once again – the devil is in the detail.

Officials are working through matters raised in submissions and will be reporting to Ministers within the next few weeks.

**Gas exploration**

Work also continues on a range of tax issues raised by the petroleum industry, which has already resulted in one significant legislative change.

Early last year, a law change exempting offshore oil rigs from New Zealand income tax came into effect, as part of a package of measures designed to encourage more gas exploration in New Zealand.

That change was made in response to industry concern that our tax law was creating perverse incentives that meant that oil rigs would not stay in New Zealand for more than six months in any 12-month period.

Further work will include a review of boundaries between the tax treatments of onshore and offshore gas exploration.

Another major focus of the work programme is work to encourage savings and improve how they are used.

This includes making the tax rules consistent between the different types of entities with which people save.

**KiwiSaver**

The KiwiSaver Bill, which was tabled in Parliament this week, introduces a voluntary work-based savings scheme designed to encourage long-term savings habits.

Inland Revenue will be the central administrator of the scheme.

Its role will include:

*   preparing information packs to employers for distribution to employees,
*   allocating default schemes to participants who do not choose their own and giving them investment statements about the schemes,
*   receiving contributions from employers and others and on-paying them, with interest, to providers,
*   paying the $1000 contribution the government will make to each participant, and administering contribution "holidays" for those who want them.

KiwiSaver has been designed to make use of existing resources such the as PAYE system, as far as possible.

### Collective Investment Vehicles

Related changes to be part of the May 2006 tax bill will relieve the over-taxation of people saving through New Zealand-managed funds such as superannuation funds and unit trusts.

The current tax treatment of these vehicles discourages people from investing in them, though they can provide an efficient way for smaller investors to spread their investment risk.

People who invest through CIVs that elect into the new rules will benefit in two ways: – realised gains on shares in New Zealand companies will not be taxed, and taxable income will flow through to investors and be taxed at their personal tax rate.

One of the things the new CIV rules will do is to prevent low-income people who invest through KiwiSaver funds from being over-taxed, so it is important that the start date for that element of the new rules be the same as for KiwiSaver – 1 April 2007.

### Outbound portfolio investment

The government's proposals for applying consistent tax rules to offshore portfolio investments in shares have attracted a lot of media and industry comment of late.

The most recent flurry of interest has undoubtedly been stimulated in part by the extensive consultation that has taken place with interested parties over the last few weeks – with funds, investment advisors, professional associations, tax advisors – the lot.

I was naturally drawn to sympathetic comments by Jo Doolan in her column in the Independent – and here I quote:

> "The government and officials have bent over backwards to reach an equitable solution acceptable to all interested parties. Resolving this complex and fraught issue should result in an Oscar nomination."

We can only wonder which Oscar category she had in mind.

Consultation continues on possible modifications to the original proposals.

Any proposed solutions will face challenges, but changing the current rules is important for a number of reasons, not least of which is to prevent investors through KiwiSaver funds from being taxed more heavily than direct investors.

As has been reported, one of the modifications officials are consulting on is treating that portfolio investment in Australian-resident companies as if it were investment within New Zealand, given our very important economic relationship with Australia.

I look forward to hearing about the feedback on the modifications.

**Salary sacrifice**

Also likely to be included in the next tax bill are changes to counter extreme "salary sacrifice" by some employees to lower the amount of tax they pay.

It is all a matter of degree.

The government obviously wants to encourage people to save for retirement.

However, it is against the spirit of the law – and unfair to other taxpayers – for people who already have substantial income or assets to be able to reduce salary in return for increased employer superannuation contributions, merely to reduce tax.

Changes to the rules on employer superannuation contributions have been suggested in an issues paper released last month for public comment, and I look forward to hearing about what you think of the suggested changes.

Ensuring that the tax rules operate smoothly, fairly and efficiently is also a key concern of the work programme.

**IFRS**

For this reason, the tax implications of the new International Financial Reporting Standards have been included in the work programme.

As you know, the Income Tax Act regularly relies on financial reporting and generally accepted accounting practice – or GAAP.

Once adopted, the new standards will change reporting outcomes significantly in some cases, and there will be potential tax consequences.

Therefore officials are reviewing the interrelationship of the new standards, existing GAAP and income tax law and plan to release within the next two or three months an issues paper that looks at necessary legislative changes.

**Partnership income**

The review of partnerships continues, following on from the development by the Ministry of Economic Development of new limited partnership rules.

Officials will continue to consult with stakeholders, and the government may be in a position later in the year to issue a discussion document setting out proposals for tax rules to apply to both limited and ordinary partnerships.

**Compliance and penalties**

A particular concern in the area of ensuring that the tax laws work well, and one that I know is of interest to many people here today, relates to the operation of one of the shortfall penalties in the Tax Administration Act.

Practitioners have highlighted circumstances where the law seems to be wrong.

In particular, penalties for taking an "unacceptable tax position" are being applied to a wider range of shortfalls than was envisaged by Parliament when it passed the legislation.

Obviously, this is having an adverse effect on voluntary compliance.

When it was developed, the penalty in question was aimed at ensuring that taxpayers take extra care when there is potential for significant shortfalls, and was originally a penalty for "unacceptable interpretations".

However, that wording was changed in 2003 because it was too easy for taxpayers to argue that they had not "interpreted" the law.

We are considering allowing taxpayers who have incurred this penalty to have their positions reviewed in cases where there has been a clear mistake or simple oversight and the taxpayers concerned had sought to rectify that position.

I am treating this measure as a matter of urgency, and looking at a short-term solution while a longer term solution is developed.

I hope to be able to make an announcement on the matter over the next few weeks.

**Rewrite**

This will be an important year for the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, which began back in the early 1990s.

Later in the year I hope that it will be possible to introduce another income tax bill that brings into effect the rewrite of all the parts that remained when new parts A to E were enacted in 2004.

In the meantime, exposure drafts of further parts in rewritten form will continue to be released progressively for comment.

I will be particularly pleased to introduce the final rewrite bill since I was Minister of Revenue when, as part of the rewrite, the new core provisions were enacted, in 1996.

As I said at the time, they represented a very important development in the history of our tax laws.

I want to pay a particular tribute to Sir Ivor Richardson for his patience and dedication over a long period of time in seeing to near fruition a mammoth task that other jurisdictions have found far too complicated.

Revenue base maintenance has always been an important part of the tax policy work programme, with each taxation bill containing measures to counter tax avoidance and ensure the reliable flow of revenue to government.

**Imputation credits**

The interim work programme includes a review of the use of imputation credits.

This item has arisen because the government has recently had to address three separate base maintenance problems involving imputation credits.

It is therefore timely that we review the matter of which shareholders should be able to use imputation credits and then, depending on the answer, consider what rules are necessary to reinforce that.

Officials are likely to start work on the project about mid-year.

**Integrity issues**

Inland Revenue's Briefing to Incoming Ministers raised concerns about the continued integrity of the tax system.

It graphically highlighted the extent to which people are using trusts and the like to lower the level of tax they pay.

We have yet to consider the matter in detail or make any policy decisions.

We shall, however, be looking at whether there are any policy issues that need to be addressed and, if so, how.

Obviously, we will want to ensure that anything emerging from this is consistent with the direction taken by the business tax review.

**Conclusion**

To conclude, I am looking forward to working with you once more as Minister of Revenue.

This is a portfolio I like and have known well for years – from being Opposition spokesperson in the early 1990s, through to being Minister and then select committee chair, and now Minister again.

When I was first Minister of Revenue in 1996 we had the enactment of the then new compliance and penalties legislation, the introduction of new disputes procedures, and the enactment of the core provisions – as I mentioned earlier.

And we also had the last round of substantive cuts in taxation.

Those were only some of the developments in what was an extremely busy time on the tax front.

As Minister again a decade later, I am solely responsible for all revenue areas except tax policy.

Dr Cullen and I work together on that, we have a regular meeting once a week to go through policy issues, and all policy decisions are jointly made.

There will be limits, of course, to the number of tax changes that can be put into effect immediately.

Dr Cullen has indicated that this year's budget will be tight, and there is little leeway for new expenditure.

Those constraints also apply to tax policy.

Any tax changes that reduce revenue have to be seen in the same light as expenditure proposals.

And any tax changes that have a revenue cost – even if, for example, they reduce compliance costs or increase fairness – must be prioritised along with increases in areas such as health and roads.

In my other role as Associate Minister of Health, I am naturally concerned about funding for hospitals and medicines, and as one who has long been interested in Wellington's roading problems, I would of course like to see money go to building Transmission Gully as soon as possible, and forgetting about the nonsense of building a new highway out into the sea.

But in the end, it is a matter of trade-offs that will affect what can be done.

We have always to aim for the best policy outcome – whether it be a business friendly, and internationally competitive tax regime, or an infrastructure necessity like Transmission Gully, or the best schools in the world – but we also have to be able to pay for our dreams.

Nevertheless, the work programme I have announced today is comprehensive and ambitious.

It includes putting in place the foundations of fundamental changes to savings policy, the business tax review, a review of almost all aspects of international tax rules, further changes to depreciation, and completion of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act.

It is an exciting time to be Minister of Revenue, and I look forward to the ensuing dialogue with you and the associations you represent, and I wish you all the best for a successful conference.

SPEECH NOTES

### Financial Planners and Insurance Advisors Association

_Wellington, 14 March 2006_

Tax reform is like rust – it never sleeps.

As a result of the confidence and supply agreement between Labour and United Future, the term of this Parliament will be marked by a number of major tax initiatives, in addition to those measures already underway, and the ongoing programme of base maintenance through the various tax reform Bills each year.

We will have:

*   A major review of business tax arrangements, with changes taking effect from the start of the 2008 tax year;
*   A new regime for the tax treatment of charities and charitable donations, with work under way later this year;
*   A government discussion paper released on the merits of income splitting for families, probably in early 2008.

We have already seen the cancellation of the proposed carbon tax.

All these moves were key United Future policy objectives.

In addition, from the start of April this year, under the extension of the Working for Families package passed through Parliament at the end of last year, a further 60,000 families will become eligible for Family Assistance tax credits.

They range from a family with two children with an income of $45,000 a year receiving $277 a fortnight, through to a similar family earning $60,000, receiving $161 a fortnight.

And last week, the Minister for Racing announced the proposed changes to racing industry taxation, in line with the Labour/New Zealand First confidence and supply agreement.

No wonder the commentators describe our tax reform agenda as "Herculean".

This morning, I will talk about the business tax review, as well as some other specific issues of particular interest to your sector.

**Business Tax Review**

The government is undertaking a thorough review of business taxation to ensure our tax arrangements remain, at the very least, competitive with major trading partners like Australia, and to encourage investment and promote productivity.

The Minister of Finance and I are working actively with Inland Revenue and Treasury officials on a range of options.

We plan to release a discussion paper in the middle of the year setting out these options, to focus debate and invite stakeholder engagement.

Then we will take decisions in time for legislation to be passed through Parliament next year, so that the new regime can take effect in 2008.

This is precisely the timetable that would be followed for any major tax reform.

Now, let me turn to some specific issues that are before us at the present time, which will be the subject of action this year.

**Current tax policy projects**

_Taxation of investment_

In mid-2005 the government released a discussion document proposing comprehensive reform of the tax rules for investment income. Proposals concerned the:

*   taxation of domestic investment through managed funds; and
*   taxation of offshore portfolio investment in shares

Over 800 submissions were received. Broadly, the domestic proposals were supported by submissions, while the offshore proposals were overwhelmingly not supported.

_Domestic proposals_

*   The government is concerned that people saving through NZ managed funds (such as superannuation funds and unit trusts) are taxed more heavily than people investing directly. The reasons for the overtaxation are:
    *   A managed fund is in the business of investing so is generally taxed on its realised share profits.
    *   The fund is generally taxed at 33% while many investors' tax rates are below 33%.
*   Proposal – investment through collective investment vehicles (CIVs) that elect into the new rules would be taxed as follows:
    *   Realised gains on shares in NZ companies would not be taxed.
    *   Taxable income would flow through to investors in the fund and be taxed at investors' personal tax rates.
*   Links to KiwiSaver:
    *   CIV rules are necessary to prevent low income earners investing through KiwiSaver funds from being over-taxed. Therefore it is important to align the start date for CIV rules with the start date for KiwiSaver – so both will start on 1 April 2007.

_Offshore tax proposals_

*   The proposal is to apply consistent tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. This would mean that investments into the seven 'grey list' countries would no longer receive a tax preference.
*   Investments into offshore shares through collective investment vehicles would be taxed each year on the investment's change in value (referred to as the comparative value approach). This would not significantly increase the level of tax paid on such investments (as realised share gains are generally already taxable to such vehicles).
*   Investments into offshore shares by individuals would be taxed using a 6% capped approach:
    *   Taxable income for a year would generally be a maximum of 6% of the investment's value.
        *   Gains above 6% would be taxed when the investor sells the offshore shares and does not purchase additional offshore shares. (In other words, an investor could switch offshore investments without triggering the additional tax.)
    *   Individuals with offshore investments valued below NZD$50,000 would continue to pay tax only on dividends.

_Submissions_

*   Almost all submissions concerned the offshore proposals and were overwhelmingly negative. Key concerns of submitters are that:
    *   The proposed changes would tax capital gains (when there is no such tax on domestic investments).
    *   They would increase tax on investments into Australia – so would be anti-CER.
    *   They would penalise those who have a diversified portfolio.
    *   The rules would be too complex for individuals to comply with.
*   The government is listening to concerns and consulting on a modified proposal for offshore investment that takes account of submitters' key concerns, while retaining the key policy aims of the original proposals.

_Next steps_

*   Officials are currently consulting with stakeholders on modifications to the offshore proposals, and various issues raised in relation to the flow-through proposals for collective investment vehicles.
*   The government hopes to be in a position to make some announcements on modified proposals next month.
*   One proposal that has been mooted would see the removal from the rules of constraints on Australian-resident listed companies.
*   We are working towards introducing domestic and offshore proposals in a tax Bill in May this year, with application from 1 April 2007.

**Salary sacrifice – specified superannuation contribution withholding tax**

*   The government is concerned about increased tax planning through salary sacrifice and tax planning schemes using the substitution of salary or wages for employer contributions to a superannuation fund. Under present law, the tax rate on employer contributions is based on the marginal tax rate of the employee's salary or wages paid by that employer.
*   An officials' issues paper released on 1 February outlined suggested legislative changes to minimise such tax planning schemes.
*   The preferred option is to tax employer superannuation contributions at the marginal tax rate of the employee, based on the sum of the employee's salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions. Specified superannuation contribution withholding tax thresholds would be raised by 15% over the equivalent personal tax thresholds. This would minimise the possibility of over-taxation when an employee moves across a threshold as a result of the employer's contribution.
*   Submissions close this week. Based on the feedback they receive, officials will report to the government with formal recommendations for change.
*   The government intends to include resulting legislative changes in the tax bill to be introduced in May.

**KiwiSaver**

*   Details of the KiwiSaver scheme were announced in Budget 2005, and the resulting legislation was introduced into Parliament on 27 February.
    *   KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based saving scheme, due to start in April 2007, to help New Zealanders save. Inland Revenue will generally administer the scheme using the existing PAYE (pay as you earn) tax system.
    *   Savings will be primarily for retirement and will be locked in until age of eligibility for NZ superannuation, although exceptions will be made in certain cases such as financial hardship and withdrawals after a minimum of three years, to contribute towards a deposit on a first home.
    *   One of the key features of KiwiSaver is the portability of a saver's funds. The scheme will provide the mechanism for the transfer of funds to a foreign superannuation scheme when a saver emigrates.
    *   The government will make an upfront contribution of $1000 per person, to be locked in until the recipient reaches retirement age or for five years – whichever is the greater.
    *   After three years of savings, the government will offer the saver a first home deposit subsidy of $1000 per year of membership, to a maximum of five years.
*   Officials have worked with employers/employer association/providers/and others on the policy design and implementation.
*   The KiwiSaver Bill has been referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration.

**Other measures on government's tax policy work programme**

On 3 March I announced the contents of the government's new tax policy work programme.

The work programme is an interim one until the resource and policy requirements of the business tax review are clearer. The review will involve a substantial commitment of resources.

A major objective of the work programme is to encourage savings and improve the way they are used. In this category are measures relating to taxation of investment, the KiwiSaver legislation, and extreme salary sacrifice – which I discussed earlier.

Other key objectives of the work programme are as follows.

_Work programme measures to encourage productivity, growth and international competitiveness include:_

*   Review of level of withholding tax rates covered in our double tax agreements, including the very important DTA with Australia.
*   Review of the tax rules that govern outbound investment from New Zealand into foreign subsidiaries. It has the potential to affect the tax rules on controlled foreign companies, foreign dividend withholding payments and conduit relief.
*   Legislation to exempt job-related superannuation schemes in Australia from New Zealand's foreign investment fund rules – to remove a disincentive to Australians and returning New Zealanders who want to come here for long-term employment.
*   Continued work on a range of further tax depreciation issues.
*   Work on tax issues relating to exploration and development of geothermal energy and issues raised by the petroleum industry.

_Work programme measures to ensure the tax system operates smoothly, fairly and efficiently include:_

*   Review of the tax implications of the new International Financial Reporting Standards.
*   Continued review of partnerships, following on from the development by the Ministry of Economic Development of new limited partnership rules.
*   Completion of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, with the introduction of the final rewrite bill planned for later in the year.

_Taxation bills:_

*   The bill introduced in May last year is before Parliament and is expected to pass by the end of the month. Major reforms in the bill include changes to the tax depreciation rules, fringe benefit tax and securities lending rules.
*   The first taxation bill for 2006 is expected to be introduced in May.

Major tax bill passes
=====================

The Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill passed through its final stages in Parliament yesterday. Introduced on 19 May, the omnibus bill includes several tax reforms announced in Budget 2005. For more information on the changes see the [media statement](/news/2006/2006-03-23-major-tax-bill-passes#statement)
 from the Minister of Revenue.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Dunne acclaims business tax cuts of $1.1 billion

Tax cuts for New Zealand business of $1.1 billion over four years.

That's Revenue Minister Peter Dunne's analysis of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was passed without opposition by Parliament last night.

"The bill brings into effect the most comprehensive business tax cuts for nearly two decades, and proves that those who claim the Government is not serious about significant tax reform are simply not paying attention

"The main feature of this major, wide-ranging legislation is a package of business-friendly tax measures designed to promote economic growth," Mr Dunne said.

**Depreciation, R&D, venture capital**

"The tax depreciation rules have been changed to encourage more productive use of capital by reducing biases in the rules that distort investment decisions. Most of the changes to the depreciation rules will apply from the 2005-06 income year.

"To reduce biases, depreciation rates for buildings have been lowered and the rates for short-life plant and equipment have been raised.

"The cost threshold that determines which assets must be accounted for on fixed asset registers has been raised from $200 to $500, which will reduce both the number of assets that must be accounted for and the number of tax adjustments required when a business disposes of an asset. The new threshold is effective from 19 May 2005, the date of the bill's introduction.

"From the 2005-06 year, companies that bring in new equity investors will have better access to tax deductions for research and development expenditure, a change that will suit technology companies in particular.

"In a similar vein, non-resident investors will be exempt from tax on gains on the sale of shares in companies they have invested in alongside the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund. The change will apply from the date of enactment.

**Small business changes**

"A number of the changes are designed to make tax easier for the many small businesses that operate in New Zealand. Some of the most important of these changes reduce the number of different tax payment dates that businesses must cope with.

"From 1 April 2007, the GST due date will become the 28th of the month, in preparation for the later alignment of GST and provisional tax payments, which will take effect from the 2008-09 income year. From that date businesses will also be able to choose to base their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their annual GST turnover.

"The new subsidy to encourage small businesses to take advantage of the help that payroll agents can give them will come into effect on 1 October 2006.

**Fringe benefit tax**

"The fringe benefit tax rules have been amended to reduce compliance costs and remove anomalies in the rules that had built up over a number of years. The changes apply from 1 April 2006 or, for employers who pay FBT on an income year basis, from the income year beginning on or after that date.

"Many of the FBT changes relate to motor vehicles. To reflect the decline in real motoring costs over the past 20 years, the valuation rate on motor vehicle fringe benefits will drop from 24% to 20%. This has real benefits – for example, companies can save over $1000 in fringe benefit tax on a $40,000 vehicle.

"There are several new exemptions from FBT. For example, employees' private use of day-to-day work tools such as cell phones and laptops will be exempt from FBT if the tool costs less than $5000 and is used primarily for business.

"The thresholds in relation to unclassified fringe benefits are being raised significantly. Overall, there should be a lot fewer minor benefits that are subject to FBT.

**New migrants and returning New Zealanders**

"To reduce tax barriers to the recruitment of highly skilled people to New Zealand, a four-year tax exemption on foreign income will be available to new migrants or returning New Zealanders who have been non-resident for tax purposes for at least 10 years. It will apply to people who arrive from 1 April 2006.

"A complementary change will improve the New Zealand tax treatment of new migrants and returning residents who hold interests in foreign, employment-related superannuation schemes. It will apply to people arriving in New Zealand from 1 April 2006.

**Share-lending**

"The rules on share-lending have been updated to bring them into line with the rules on other commercial transactions and with those of countries such as Australia. The changes also include a measure designed to prevent the use of share-lending for tax avoidance. The changes apply from 1 July 2006.

**Other changes**

"Amongst the other changes introduced are new information and record-keeping requirements for New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts. They come into effect on 1 October 2006.

"The tax deductibility of the re-grassing and fertilising costs associated with farm conversions has been clarified, and the changes will apply to expenditure incurred from 1 July 2004.

"Certain types of payouts from co-operatives to their members can be excluded from treatment as dividends, allowing a deduction to the co-operative. The changes remove uncertainty in the tax treatment of these payouts and apply to payments made after enactment.

"The new legislation also includes several changes designed to protect the revenue base. Changes ensuring that companies that migrate from New Zealand pay tax on worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand will generally apply from 21 March 2005.

"Further base maintenance changes are designed to prevent avoidance of GST by using third parties to import goods, such as luxury cars, that were offshore at the time of supply. They will apply from 19 May 2005.

"Changes giving Inland Revenue greater flexibility in the application of shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position will apply from 1 April 2003.

"Finally, 1 August 2006 will be the application of racing industry tax changes that include a reduction in gaming duty for racing and accelerated write-down for bloodstock.

"These are only some of the tax changes to emerge from this massive taxation bill. They will become law once the new legislation has received Royal assent, which is expected to occur within a few days' time," Mr Dunne said.

Interest exemption for charity workers
======================================

The government has named the 48 charitable organisations whose volunteers may be exempted from interest on their student loans while working for those organisations overseas. The list was approved by Order in Council today. For more information see the government's [media statement](/news/2006/2006-03-27-interest-exemption-charity-workers#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Interest-free student loans for overseas charity workers

The government has named the 48 charitable organisations whose volunteers may be exempted from interest on their student loans while working for those organisations overseas.

Borrowers living overseas for more than six months will generally not qualify for the new interest free student loan policy which comes into effect on 1 April," Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"However, the law gives Inland Revenue the discretion to grant an exemption for certain borrowers who are overseas, including post-graduate students, government employees and people who work for free or for a token payment for a charitable organisation operating overseas.

"The regulation signed today specifies the 48 charitable organisations that are covered by the exemption. It will still be up to Inland Revenue to decide if individuals working for those organisations qualify for the full interest write-off under the policy," Dr Cullen said.

The write-off will apply for a maximum of two years.

Charitable organisations not on the list can still apply to Inland Revenue for exemption status.

Under the new policy students who borrow from 1 April will only have to repay what they borrow. Students and graduates with existing loans will not be charged any further interest. The policy only applies to those remaining in New Zealand.

Investment tax changes in May bill
==================================

A tax bill scheduled for introduction in May is expected to introduce changes relating domestic investment through collective investment vehicles and to offshore portfolio investment in shares, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today. The government will announce details of the proposed changes over the next few weeks, the Minister told the SuperFunds Summit in Wellington today.

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Speech to Summit of Superannuation Funds

_Hotel Intercontinental, Wellington_

I am very pleased to have been invited to speak to your summit today.

I have been asked to update the summit on three matters:

*   the government's proposed changes to the tax rules and how they will affect investment through collective investment vehicles,
*   the status of the review of the taxation of investment,
*   and whether tax changes are required for a level playing ground for investments.

Over the last three or four years you will have heard a lot about proposals for reforming the rules on the taxation of domestic investment through managed funds and the taxation of offshore portfolio investment in shares.

The arguments and counter arguments for change can be highly technical – with talk of things like collective investment vehicles, flow-through, the foreign investment fund rules, the grey list, deemed rates of return and so on, and can generate much heat. The result is a debate that can be difficult for people outside the savings and investment industries to follow.

It is these people, however, who are central to the reform of the tax rules on retirement savings.

They are often ordinary, middle-class people with a family, a house in the suburbs, a mortgage and a hundred competing demands on their discretionary income. They often must struggle to save for retirement, and when they do they probably invest through managed funds rather than invest directly in overseas shares, for which they probably lack experience and confidence.

For all of them, whatever their savings and however they are structured, there is a sense of pride at what they have been able to achieve. They feel they have heeded the message about prudent planning for the future, and they become angry and frustrated if they sense the rules are being changed in a way that disadvantages their decisions.

For many others, though, saving for retirement is still too often put into the "do it tomorrow" basket.

The new KiwiSaver scheme has the potential to turn that mindset around. It will provide a mechanism for ordinary people to save automatically, without having to think too much about it. The aim is to make it as easy to save in the future as it is now not to save at all.

It is obviously essential that the tax rules do not disadvantage investors through KiwiSaver funds over other kinds of investors. More generally, it is also important that the tax rules themselves do not become the driver of particular forms of saving.

At present, however, the rules do create distortions.

People who save through New Zealand managed funds such as superannuation funds and unit trusts are taxed more heavily than people who invest directly.

The reasons for the over-taxation are that managed funds are generally taxed on their realised share profits, and are generally taxed at 33%, although their tax rates could be below 33%.

As you know, the government has proposed new rules to resolve the problem, using the concept of a qualifying collective investment vehicle.

Under the new rules, realised gains on shares in New Zealand companies would not be taxed, and taxable income would flow through to investors in the fund and be taxed at their personal tax rates.

These new rules are necessary if KiwiSaver is to work as intended – and reverse that non-savings mindset. They will prevent low-income people investing through KiwiSaver funds from being over-taxed.

For this reason it will be essential for the CIV rules to come into effect in tandem with the start-up of KiwiSaver, which is 1 April next year.

A basic principle of taxing investment income is that the tax rules themselves should not create investment distortions. Investments should be taxed the same regardless of where the investment is located, and those who invest through intermediaries such as managed funds should be taxed in the same way as those who invest directly.

The current tax rules on investment operate very unevenly. They over-tax some investors, they favour direct investment by individuals over investment through funds, and they favour investment in some countries over others.

What any reform of the rules must do is to right the imbalance, which is very difficult to do because of the competing interests involved. Therefore the government is trying to achieve a reasonable balance between those competing interests.

In achieving a reasonable balance, it is inevitable that there will be winners and losers – the many winners will be those who lose disadvantages, and the losers will be those who lose their advantages.

It most certainly will not be a money grab by the government.

Striking the balance will be expensive and is estimated to cost more than $100 million in lost revenue. That is a cost that the government has chosen to bear – over competing priorities – because it is essential to get the investment rules right.

That is only fair. As I said earlier, in order to save for their retirement, the ordinary couple with a family must find some room in the family budget to give priority to retirement savings.

It is reasonable, therefore, to expect the government to make some room in its Budget to make the taxation of retirement savings fairer. I am completely confident that this will be done.

The government has consulted extensively on its proposals to apply consistent tax rules to different types of investment, including offshore portfolio investments in shares. For the latter, consistency would mean that under the proposals released last year investments into the seven 'grey list countries' would no longer receive a tax preference but would be taxable under more consistent rules.

On the other hand, investment outside those countries, including some of New Zealand's high-growth Asian trading partners, would receive a more reasonable tax treatment than at present.

On the whole, those changes would affect higher wealth direct investors, who at present have a tax advantage over managed funds. The changes would have little effect on managed funds, which are already taxed on their business gains.

Submissions on the discussion document which set out the proposals broadly supported the proposals relating to domestic investment through the collective investment vehicles that I mentioned earlier. All was more or less well with that side of the proposed reform.

The vast majority of submissions, however, and over 800 were received, focused on the offshore proposals and were almost unanimously opposed to changing the tax rules for offshore investment.

Some of the main concerns expressed in submissions were that the changes would tax unrealised capital gains, would advantage funds, would increase tax on investments into Australia, and the rules would be too complex for individuals to comply with.

I will not go into the details of the proposals relating to offshore investment – the next speaker, David Carrigan, will do that. But I do want to assure you that the government is listening to the concerns and has consulted widely, once again, on modified proposals that take account of some of the key concerns that have been raised, while retaining the key policy aim of the original proposals.

One approach would be to treat investments in Australian companies in a similar manner to New Zealand investments. That would result in tax being paid broadly on dividends.

A different approach for Australia could be justified on the basis that, as in New Zealand, Australian dividend yields are reasonable. It could also be justified on the grounds of the Closer Economic Relationship between the two countries.

Officials have now reported to Ministers and we hope to be in a position to announce policy decisions over the next few weeks. A tax bill scheduled for introduction in May is expected to introduce changes relating to domestic investment and CIVs, as well as some relating to the taxation of offshore portfolio investment in shares.

As Minister of Revenue, I am looking for a reasonable, pragmatic solution that produces a fairer result for ordinary families struggling to put that little bit aside to supplement their retirement income.

I accept that although the final package will have many winners, there will also be some losers. That is the inevitable result of bringing more balance to a tax system that is heavily skewed against family retirement savings.

I look forward to being able to be able to give your more information in the near future.

Thank you.

Business tax changes from 1 April
=================================

Important changes to the fringe benefit tax rules will apply from 1 April, as will the new exemption on overseas income for new migrants and returning New Zealanders. For information on these and other changes ushered in by the passage of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, see the [media statement](/news/2006/2006-03-30-business-tax-changes-1-april#statement)
 from the Minister of Finance.

Minister of Finance

MEDIA STATEMENT

### 1 April tax changes positive for business

From 1 April thousands of businesses will enjoy significant reductions in compliance costs and find it easier to recruit skilled labour from overseas, Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen said today.

"This government wants to make sure tax policy is not a barrier to economic growth and these measures continue the progress we are making."

Many businesses see fringe benefit tax as complex and time-consuming especially in relation to motor vehicles.

To reflect the decline in real motoring costs over the past 20 years, the valuation rate on motor vehicle fringe benefits reduces from 24% to 20% of the vehicle's cost price.

For example; a small company employing a couple of staff that provides its chief executive with a car for his unlimited private use in addition to his salary of $60,000. The car costs $40,000. Under the proposed change, the fringe benefit tax payable on the vehicle will be reduced from $6144 to $5120, a saving of over $1000 for the business.

Day-to-day work tools such as cell phones and laptops will be exempt from fringe benefit tax, provided they cost less than $5000 each and are to be primarily used for business.

"Overall, these and related changes will mean that fewer small businesses will need to file fringe benefit tax returns on minor benefits that are part of their day-to-day business activities. That means lower compliance costs and more time to spend on the business," said Dr Cullen.

The government is also improving access to highly skilled people by reducing the tax costs associated with international recruitment.

Tax on offshore income is an important issue for those in demand internationally. It is also an important issue for the New Zealand businesses that recruit them, which often end up bearing the tax costs themselves in the form of higher pay.

After 1 April new migrants and returning New Zealanders who have not been tax-resident for at least ten years will be exempted from tax for four years on foreign income such as dividends, interest, royalties and rental income.

The ten year requirement is designed to ensure that New Zealand residents do not leave the country just to become eligible for the exemption.

The changes are part of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill whose provisions usher in the most comprehensive business tax cuts since the late 1980s.

Together with significant changes to depreciation rules, the measures have a four year fiscal cost of $1.1 billion.

Depreciation rules have been changed so they better reflect how assets decline in value. There has also been an increase in the threshold for which assets must be accounted for. These measures will encourage a more productive use of capital and reduce compliance costs for businesses.

New rules to align GST payments with provisional tax payments have been delayed a year to allow more time for IRD and taxpayers to adjust their systems.

"These measures first signalled in Budget 2005 will help soften the burden of the tax system so businesses can spend more time improving their productivity and so help lift the performance of the economy," Dr Cullen concluded.

Page 1 Taxation of investment income 1. Savers in New Zealand managed funds From 1 April 2007, New Zealanders investing in New Zealand-based managed funds and other collective investment vehicles will see greater fairness in the taxation of their investment income. The new rules are aimed at removing a number of tax disadvantages for investors using managed funds, many of whom are ordinary, middle-income savers. Benefits of the new tax rules for saving through collective investment vehicles A key benefit of the new rules is that lower-income savers investing in vehicles that adopt the new rules will be taxed at their correct tax rate. Currently, lower-income savers are taxed at 33% on their savings even though their correct rate may be 19.5%. This creates a significant tax disincentive for lower-income savers to use managed funds in order to have access to a diversified range of investments. The investment income of higher-income savers will continue to be taxed at 33%. Another benefit is that capital gains on New Zealand and Australian shares held via a vehicle that adopts the new rules will no longer be taxed. Currently, these gains are generally taxed if held through a collective investment vehicle, even though these savers would generally not be taxed on capital gains if they held New Zealand and Australian shares directly. This has serious implications for investors who use managed funds to have access to a diversified range of investments. What savers need to do under the new rules Savers will need to know whether their collective investment vehicle has adopted the new rules, as the benefits outlined above arise only for investment via qualifying vehicles. Savers in qualifying vehicles will have to elect a tax rate and provide it to their fund at the start of a year. Their tax rate will be based on their total income for the previous year (salary and wages, interest and any other investment income). There will be special rules for electing a tax rate. Savers whose total income in the previous year is $48,000 or less will need to elect a 19.5% tax rate. Other savers will be taxed at a 33% tax rate. The qualifying vehicle will then pay tax on investment income, on behalf of the saver, at the saver’s tax rate. Investors will not generally need to report this investment income in their tax returns. This means that individuals who are not currently required to file a tax return will not have to file a return under the new rules. If a qualifying vehicle makes an investment loss, it will generally be available to savers without their having to file a tax return. Page 2 The tax paid by a qualifying vehicle on behalf of its investors will not affect savers’ entitlements to family assistance such as Working for Families. This investment income will not be counted when working out entitlements, nor will it affect savers’ student loan repayment and child support payment obligations. Example – Difference in tax result under the new rules Gary invests $20,000 in a defined contribution superannuation fund on 1 April 2007. His marginal tax rate is 19.5%. The fund actively invests Gary’s money in a conservative portfolio with the following weightings: 50% in cash ($10,000), 35% in New Zealand and Australian-resident listed companies ($7,000), and 15% in companies resident in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan ($3,000). The investments have the following returns: • Cash – interest of $500 • New Zealand and Australian shares – dividend of $350 (no imputation credits or credits for foreign non-resident withholding tax) and shares sold for $7,350 at year end • Other offshore shares – no dividend and shares sold for $3,600 at year end • Total return on assets – $1,800 His investment in a vehicle that does not adopt the new rules If Gary’s fund chooses to operate under the current tax rules instead of the new tax rules, Gary’s return income would be taxable at a flat 33% rate and would include realised gains in New Zealand and Australian shares. The fund would still be subject to the new offshore tax rules, so it elects to use the “85% comparative value” method. Taxable income: $500 (interest) + $350 (dividends on New Zealand and Australian shares) + $350 (realised gain on New Zealand and Australian shares) + $510 (85% of the gain on offshore shares) = $1,710 Tax liability: $1,710 x 33% = $564 Total net return: $1,800 – $564 = $1,236 His investment in a vehicle that adopts the new rules If the fund adopted the new tax rules, the taxable income earned via the fund would be taxable at Gary’s tax rate and he would receive the benefit of the New Zealand and Australian share gains exclusion. Taxable income: $500 (interest) + $350 (dividends on New Zealand and Australian shares) + $510 (85% of the gain on offshore shares) = $1,360 Tax liability: $1,360 x 19.5% = $265 Total net return: $1,800 – $265 = $1,535 Page 3 Gary’s net return, in the example, has increased by nearly $300 under the new tax rules for collective investment vehicles.
Page 1 Taxation of investment income 2. Overseas share investments by individual direct investors Under the new rules, different types of investment income will be taxed consistently, whether direct investment by individuals or through managed funds. For direct investors in overseas shares, the changes also mean that investments into certain countries will no longer be disadvantaged. The new tax rules will apply to people who hold less than a 10% interest in a foreign company. These rules remove the full accrued capital gains tax currently levied by the foreign investment fund tax rules. For these individuals, the special tax exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for investments in “grey list” countries will be abolished. The “grey list” consists of Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. At present, most individual investors who invest directly in companies resident in “grey list” countries pay tax only on dividends. Investment in Australian-resident listed companies People who invest directly in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange who do not actively trade their shares will continue to be taxed only on their dividends. NZD$50,000–$100,000 minimum threshold Individuals holding shares outside Australian-resident listed companies will, in most cases, be able to hold a portfolio that the new rules will not apply to. If the original cost of the shares purchased totals less than NZD$50,000, the new tax rules will not apply. These investors will continue to pay tax on dividends. A couple could hold offshore shares outside Australia costing NZD$100,000 or less before the new rules would apply. The threshold would apply to investments in offshore listed companies that are resident in countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement. Individual investors would also have the option of applying a NZD$100,000 minimum threshold (based on market value on 1 April 2007) for interests acquired before 1 January 2000. This should help investors who cannot remember the cost of investments that they have held for a number of years. The amount calculated under this threshold would be halved and added to the cost of investments purchased on or after 1 January 2000 to determine whether the NZD$50,000 minimum threshold has been breached. Page 2 Taxing substantial share portfolios outside Australasia For individuals whose direct offshore share investments are outside Australia and cost over $50,000 a simple two-step calculation will be required. This calculation is designed to provide a certain and reasonable level of tax on offshore investments each year and is capped at 5%. For investors to calculate their tax under the 5% cap, the two steps required are: Step 1: Investors measure the change in the value of their offshore portfolio over the year. If the value has increased, 85% of this increase is the maximum amount that would be taxable. This brings the amount that is taxed for individual investors into line with that of managed funds. Step 2: Investors calculate what portion of 85% of the increase in value should be taxed in that year. If they have dividends or repatriated income of at least 5% then that is their total taxable income. If an investor receives less than 5% in cash, but has positive share gains, then up to 5% of those gains are taxable after reducing those gains to 85%. If 85% of the increase in value is more than the 5% deemed return (or cash), the remainder is carried forward to the next year. The tax paid on a 5% deemed return will be less than 2% of the investment’s value. The following simple example illustrates how the 5% cap method works: Mary is an offshore investor and her tax rate is 39%. At the beginning of year 1 Mary's investment is worth NZD$100,000. At the end of year 1 the investment is worth NZD$110,000. She does not receive any dividends from the investment. How does she calculate her tax for year 1 under the 5% cap method? Step 1 What is 85% of the change in value in the year? $8,500 ($110,000 - $100,000 = $10,000; $10,000 x 85%) Step 2 What portion of the $8,500 increase in value is taxable in year 1? $5,000 Greater of $5,000 (5% return on $100,000 investment) and $0 (cash received) = $5,000 Only $5,000 of the $8,500 is taxable in year 1. The tax payable is $1,950. This is 19.5% of her total return. The additional $3,500 is carried forward to year 2. Page 3 Offshore portfolio treated as a pool One of the key features of the 5% cap method is that it applies to an investor’s total pool of offshore assets. In other words, investors apply the two-step approach described above to their total portfolio of offshore assets and not on each offshore investment. This is designed to keep compliance costs to a minimum. Rollover relief with no tax payable on death The new rules will also allow investors to sell one offshore asset and purchase another without being taxed in that year on any carried forward gains. This means that cash received from selling offshore assets will not trigger a tax liability unless the proceeds are brought back to New Zealand. In addition, there will be no taxation of carried forward gains on the death of an investor. The overall effect of the 5% cap and rollover relief provisions is that investors will generally pay tax on a maximum 5% return, with gains in excess of this deferred indefinitely. Underperforming offshore investments Investors will not have to pay tax on a 5% return unless the offshore portfolio makes an average 5% return. Returns of less than 5% on offshore portfolios will be taxed at 85% of their actual return. A corollary of this is that negative returns will be recognised as a loss for tax purposes in the same way as any gains are recognised as income. This means that the investor will typically be allowed to recognise losses in a year up to 5% of the offshore portfolio’s value. These losses could be offset against the investor’s other taxable income. How complex is it? The 5% cap method is more complex than the current tax rules, which typically tax individuals’ “grey list” investments only on dividends. The additional complexity results from investors or their advisors being required to value their portfolio each year and keep a record of any carried forward amounts. However, the ability of investors to treat their offshore assets as a total pool reduces some of this complexity. The proposal will allow people to use average exchange rates, which is less complex than the current dividend tax rules (which require savers to use the spot exchange rate on the date the dividend was derived). The 5% cap method will apply only if a person’s offshore investments (outside Australia) cost more than a total of $50,000 ($100,000 for a couple), or have a value of over $100,000 for investments purchased before 2000 ($200,000 for a couple). Assuming reasonable diversification, a person’s investment portfolio will obviously be fairly substantial before these thresholds were breached. Page 4 Example – Difference in tax result under current rules and new rules Jane has a 39% tax rate. At the beginning of the tax year Jane invests in an Australian-resident listed company (Oz Co), a company resident in the United States (US Corp), and a company resident in Singapore (Sing Co). Jane spends $60,000 on each of these investments and does not hold more than 10% of each of the corresponding entities. At the end of the year, each of the investments is worth $70,000. Jane has also received dividends of $1,000 from each of the companies. No foreign non-resident withholding tax is deducted on the dividends (and hence there are no foreign tax credits). Current rules Under the current rules, Australia and the United States are “grey list” countries. This means that interests in companies that are resident in these countries are taxed only on any dividends received if held on capital account (which is how Jane holds these shares). Therefore Jane will pay tax of $390 on each of the dividends received from OZ Co and US Corp ($1,000 x 39%). Note: Currently, there are eight grey list countries – Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom and United States of America. Singapore is not one of the grey list countries, so Jane’s interest in Sing Co is subject to special tax rules – the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. There are a number of methods available to calculate taxable income under the FIF rules, with the “comparative value method” being the most commonly used. If Jane elects to use the comparative value method, her taxable income will be $11,000. This is equal to the gain in share value ($70,000 – $60,000) and the dividend derived ($1,000). Jane’s tax liability on this investment is $4,290 ($11,000 x 39%). Under the current rules, Jane’s total tax liability on her offshore portfolio share investments is $5,070 ($390 tax paid on OZ Co investment + $390 tax paid on US Corp investment + $4,290 tax paid on Sing Co investment). New rules Investors who own 10% or less of an offshore company will not be able to use the grey list. There will, however, be special rules for investments in certain Australian companies. Under these rules, interests that individuals hold in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange will be taxed under the same rules as they are taxed now. Therefore Jane will continue to be taxed only on the dividend that she received from Oz Co ($1,000 x 39% = $390). Since Jane owns less than 10% of US Corp and Sing Co, she cannot use the “grey list” for those investments. Jane elects to use the “5% cap” method to calculate her tax liability for US Corp and Sing Co. Under this method, Jane must pool her investments. First, Jane will have to calculate the maximum amount that can be taxed in the year. This is 85% of the change in value of her interests in US Corp and Sing Co, plus the Page 5 full amount of dividends received. For Jane, this maximum taxable amount is $19,000 (85% of ($140,000 – $120,000) + $2,000 dividends). The amount that is actually taxable in that income tax year is the greater of any net receipts from the pool (dividends of $2,000) or 5% of the opening market value of the pool (5% x $120,000 = $6,000). As 5% of the opening market value is higher than net cashflow (but less than the maximum taxable amount of $19,000), Jane pays tax of $2,340 on these investments ($6,000 x 39%). Jane carries forward the difference between the maximum taxable amount and the actual taxable amount ($19,000 – $6,000), on which tax may have to paid in the future. Under the new rules, Jane’s total tax liability on her offshore portfolio share investments is $2,730 ($390 tax paid on OZ Co investment + $2,340 tax paid on US Corp and Sing Co investment). It is important to note, however, that Jane has a carried forward gain of $13,000, which may be taxed in future years resulting in a potential tax liability in the future of $5,070. Summary In the example above, Jane would pay less tax in the year under the new rules than she pays under the current rules. This does not take account of the carried forward gain of $13,000 – which may or may not be taxed, depending on the performance of the portfolio in future and Jane’s circumstances. The “5% cap” method allows Jane to spread her tax liability over a number of years, which should help with cashflow. There will be situations, however, when an investor’s tax burden would increase – for example, for investors whose offshore share portfolio is heavily weighted towards investments in companies resident in grey list countries (other than Australia). If these investments have low dividend yields the current tax impost is likely to be significantly less than the impost under the new rules (even with the “5% cap”). The new rules will, however, provide opportunities for these investors to explore investment opportunities outside countries such as the United States and United Kingdom. At present, there is a barrier to do so because of the way the FIF rules treat investments outside the grey list. Other methods available While the 5% cap method is likely to be the most common method that individuals will use for calculating tax on substantial non-Australasian share portfolios, they can choose between three additional methods. 85% comparative value method Under this method, 85% of the change in share value (plus full dividends) will be taxable each year. This method will also apply to an investor’s total portfolio of offshore shares that the investor elects to treat under this method. Branch equivalent method The “branch equivalent” income calculation method, which currently taxes interests in offshore companies as if the company were a New Zealand branch, will continue to be available for those investors with the relevant information. A simplified branch equivalent calculation method will be available for investors in early stage companies. Page 6 Standard rate of return method Under this method, offshore investments will be taxed each year on 5% of cost, with the cost base increased each year by deemed income of 5%. On realisation of an investment, and repatriation of funds, there will be a wash-up to ensure that 85% of excess gains and losses, respectively, are taxed or allowed as deductions.
Page 1 Taxation of investment income 3. New tax rules for New Zealand managed funds A new set of tax rules will treat investment through intermediaries such as managed funds (collective investment vehicles) in the same way same as direct investment by individuals, thus removing long-standing disadvantages of saving through funds. The new rules will prevent over-taxation of lower income savers, and eliminate the taxation of capital gains on New Zealand and Australian shares held through a fund. From 1 April 2007, collective investment vehicles that meet certain qualifying criteria will be able to choose to use the new rules. They will be compulsory for KiwiSaver default funds, so will come into effect in tandem with the start-up of KiwiSaver. Qualification criteria for the new rules To qualify for the new rules a collective investment vehicle would need: • to have as its principal activity the provision of investment and savings services (as defined by the proportion of its underlying assets that are used to derive specified investment income); • to have at least 20 investors, with no individual investor holding more than a 10% ownership interest in the vehicle – the “investment in” test. There will be some exceptions from these requirements – for example, when a qualifying vehicle invests in another qualifying vehicle; • to own not more than 10% of any underlying entity (or 25% in certain circumstances) – the “investment out” test. There would be exceptions from this requirement for investments in other qualifying vehicles, real property and when the total of investments greater than 10% (or 25%) is not a significant portion (greater than 10%) of the value of the qualifying vehicle’s total portfolio; • not to issue separate classes of unit that stream different categories of income from the same asset to different unit holders; and • to meet the New Zealand tax residence rules (or be liable for tax in New Zealand on its worldwide income if not for the fact it is a qualifying vehicle). Deliberate breaches of the “investment in” and “investment out” criteria (or failure to comply with the requirements outlined below) would result in forfeiture of qualifying status, with no ability for a vehicle to re-enter the rules. Temporary breaches of the “investment in” and “investment out” criteria would be allowed on start-up or wind-down of a qualifying vehicle or due to inadvertent errors or factors outside the vehicle’s control. Page 2 Definition of “income” for a QCIV Qualifying vehicles would not be taxable on realised gains on domestic shares (investments in New Zealand-resident companies) and Australian shares (investments in Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange). This non-taxation of realised domestic and Australian share gains would not extend to situations where a qualifying vehicle does not have full equity risk associated with an investment. For offshore shares held outside Australia, taxable income would generally be 85% of accrued changes in share value plus dividends (taxable in full) – the “85% comparative value” method. The definition of taxable income would otherwise remain the same as it is under the Income Tax Act 2004. Fees incurred by investors investing via a qualifying vehicle would continue to be deductible against taxable income derived via that vehicle. Requirements of a qualifying vehicle and investors in qualifying vehicles A qualifying vehicle would be required to pay tax on investment income, on behalf of investors. Lower-income investors could elect a 19.5% tax rate if their total income in the previous year is $48,000 or less. Others would be taxed at 33%. A qualifying vehicle would have the option to pay tax on investment income (called an “attribution”): • quarterly (or more frequently), with tax paid at the tax rates of all investors who were present on the attribution date; • each time an investor exits the vehicle with a general attribution for investors who remain. Losses made, and tax credits derived, by a qualifying vehicle that are in excess of the investment income of the vehicle would generally be able to be accessed by individual investors. The tax paid by a qualifying vehicle on behalf of its investors would generally be a final tax. This means that individual investors would not need to return this income in their tax returns. This income would not affect individuals’ entitlements to family assistance (under the Working for Families package) or their student loan repayment and child support payment obligations. Defined benefit superannuation schemes A defined benefit superannuation scheme is a scheme where investors’ entitlements are not linked to their contributions. Defined benefit superannuation schemes can also elect into the new rules and receive the exclusion for realised New Zealand and Australian shares gains. These vehicles would be required to pay tax at a flat 33% tax rate, rather than at investors’ tax rates. Page 3 Transitional rules On entry into new tax rules, a qualifying vehicle would need to undertake a “notional windup” (a deemed disposal and reacquisition of the vehicle’s underlying assets) under which any underlying assets held on revenue account would be brought to tax and spread forward over three years. Any losses arising on transition would be available to offset investment income derived via the qualifying vehicle in future years.
Page 1 Taxation of investment income Questions and answers New tax rules for people who save through qualifying collective investment vehicles Q. Why is the government changing the tax rules for investment through managed funds? A. The current tax rules on investment income operate very unevenly. They over- tax some investors, they favour direct investment by individuals over investment through funds, and they favour investment in some countries over others. They have a disproportionately negative effect on ordinary middle-income savers who invest via managed funds and are often over-taxed as a result. The government is changing the rules to right the imbalance. Q. How will the changes affect me as an individual investor in a qualifying vehicle? A. Savers in qualifying vehicles will be taxed on investment income at their tax rate (capped at 33%). This means that people who have a 19.5% tax rate will be taxed on their savings at this rate, instead of 33% (which is the tax rate, at present, for most of those who invest in managed funds). Savers will also benefit from not being taxed on capital gains made on New Zealand and Australian companies, if they invest in them through a qualifying vehicle. Currently, these gains are usually taxed if shares are held via a managed fund but are not generally taxed if held directly. This creates a significant disadvantage to using managed funds and other collective investment vehicles to invest in New Zealand and Australian companies. Q. Do the new rules apply to all managed funds and investment vehicles? A. No. The new rules are limited to managed funds and collective investment vehicles that meet certain criteria. To qualify, a vehicle must be a genuine savings and investment entity because the purpose of these changes is to put investment through intermediaries on a similar tax footing to that of direct investment. It is therefore important to distinguish genuine investment and savings vehicles from other entities. The new rules will be optional, meaning that all savings vehicles do not have to adopt them. However, those that do will be able to offer their lower-income investors the benefits of being taxed at their correct tax rate, and the benefit of tax-free capital gains on shares in New Zealand and Australian companies to all their investors. Savings vehicles that do not adopt the new rules will continue to be taxed as they are at present. Page 2 Q. Why will the tax rate on investment income derived via a qualifying vehicle be capped at 33%? A. The 33% cap is designed to encourage existing savers to continue to save and to encourage collective investment vehicles to adopt the new rules. Currently, investments in certain collective investment vehicles, such as superannuation funds, are taxed at a flat tax rate of 33%. This means that 39% tax rate investors are taxed at 33% on their investment income. Taxing them at 39% might discourage them from investing through intermediaries. Capping the tax rate on investment income earned through a qualifying vehicle at 33% should also make it easier for funds with a wide range of investors to adopt the new rules, without advantaging some and disadvantaging others. Q. What will investors through qualifying vehicles have to do under the new rules? A. Savers on a 19.5% tax rate should provide this rate at the start of the year to the qualifying vehicle. Other savers will generally not need to do anything. No individual savers will need to do anything else, such as file a tax return for any investment income from a qualifying vehicle. Q. How do savers determine their correct tax rate? A. Lower-income savers will be able to elect a 19.5% tax rate if their total income (including income from collective investment vehicles) in the previous year is $48,000 or less. Other savers will be taxed at 33%. Q. Will the changes have any effect on savers’ entitlements to family assistance or on their student loan and child support payment obligations? A. No. New tax rules for people who invest in offshore portfolio investment in shares Q. Why do the offshore tax rules for portfolio investment in shares need to be changed? A. There are a number of problems with the current tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. Currently, individuals who invest directly in a company resident in one of the eight so-called “grey list” countries will generally pay tax only on dividends. On the other hand, if they invest in a “grey list” country via a New Zealand managed fund they will typically be taxed on any realised capital gains on these investments. This tax treatment advantages direct investors over other savers, such as ordinary lower and middle-income people who use a managed fund and who may lack the wealth, financial sophistication, and confidence to invest offshore directly. The new rules will resolve the problem by requiring a reasonable level of tax to be paid by direct investors who have substantial share portfolios outside Australia. The current rules are also too harsh for investment outside the grey list, discouraging investment in other important destinations. Page 3 Q. What will be the tax impact of the rules on individual direct investors? A. Under the new rules, investors in Australian-resident listed companies will generally pay tax only on their dividends (the same treatment that will be accorded to investors in qualifying collective investment vehicles). Investors will be able to have investments outside Australia that cost NZD$50,000 or less in total ($100,000 per couple) and continue to pay tax on dividends. For substantial share portfolios outside Australia, the “5% cap” method will generally apply. This will mean that in most years, taxable income is limited to 5% of the investment’s value. (In most cases less than 2% of the value of the investment would be payable in tax.) For substantial portfolios that are now heavily weighted towards the “grey list”, individual direct investors are likely to pay more tax under the new rules. For investments in non-“grey list” countries, investors will pay significantly less tax than they do under the current foreign investment fund rules. This should encourage savers to look beyond New Zealand’s traditional investment destinations to high-growth economies in Asia, Latin America and Europe. Q. Why is a special case being made for investment in Australian companies? A. There are three main reasons for treating investment in Australian-resident listed companies differently. First, Australian companies pay out a high proportion of their earnings as dividends. (Dividend distribution is encouraged by the Australian tax system.) Second, New Zealand has a closer economic relationship with Australia. Making a special case for Australia will help to move the two countries closer towards a single market for the purposes of investment and is therefore consistent with this relationship. Third, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department has close contact with the Australian Tax Office and the Australian Treasury, which should allow the tax authorities to close down any tax loopholes that might arise. The proposed treatment for Australian companies reflects a simplification benefit – taxation on dividends – rather than a tax advantage. Q. Will my compliance costs increase as a result of the new tax rules for offshore investments? A. For most ordinary direct investors in offshore shares, the changes should not result in an increase in tax compliance costs. For example, an investor with some Australian shares and a portfolio costing NZD$50,000 or less outside Australia would continue to pay tax just on dividends. Investors with significant share portfolios outside Australia would face some extra compliance costs under the “5% cap” method. The additional costs will arise because investors will have to value their portfolio each year and keep track of carried forward amounts. It should be noted, however, that many will already use an accountant to assist with their tax obligations. A. What is the 5% cap? Page 4 Q. The 5% cap is the main income calculation method that individuals will use under the new tax rules if they have a substantial portfolio in shares in companies outside Australasia. It will ensure that in most years the maximum income that tax will be paid on is 5% of the investment’s value – it is not a 5% tax rate. In most years, the actual tax that is paid will be no more than 2% of the investment’s value. Q. Will any excess capital gains be taxed under the 5% cap method? A. Yes. When the portfolio is sold and the proceeds brought back to New Zealand, 85% of the excess gains will be taxed. This treatment brings the taxation of direct investment income closer to that of income from investments in managed funds. Q. Is this an offshore tax grab? A. No. The government is giving up tax on Australian and non-grey list investments, and this broadly equals the increased tax on grey list investments outside Australia. The offshore tax changes are therefore roughly revenue neutral. Q. Why is the government decreasing taxes onshore and increasing taxes offshore? A. The government is not doing that. The new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares raise no more revenue than the current rules. Onshore, the government collects tax on New Zealand companies under comprehensive company tax rules. The laws do not discourage payment of dividends meaning a reasonable dividend is usually paid. The proposed rules attempt to collect a reasonable level of tax offshore, as the government already does from onshore investments in New Zealand companies.

### $110 million of tax cuts to improve fairness of investment tax regime

The government is to introduce a fairer regime for taxing New Zealanders who invest in New Zealand and overseas which will mean a tax cut of $110 million a year from next April, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"We want a system that doesn't encourage investors to favour investing overseas over investing in New Zealand.

"We are removing distortions which favour sophisticated direct investors over those who choose to invest through managed funds and unit trusts," the two Ministers said.

"This is no money grab by the government. In fact it will cost about $110 million a year in foregone tax revenue. But if we are to improve the savings culture in this country the government considers this to be a valuable investment to make," said the Ministers.

Their comments follow the release today of changes to the investment tax regime.

"There has been extensive consultation following the Stobo Report. We have listened to the concerns of the investment community and we think we have the balance right now," they said.

"As always there will be winners and losers. The losers in this case will tend to be sophisticated direct investors who have enjoyed considerable tax advantages under the old regime and who have the ability to easily adjust their investment arrangements.

"The winners will be thousands of ordinary, hard working New Zealanders who the government is helping to achieve long term financial security."

The changes are in three areas:

1.  The new rules will remove a number of tax disadvantages for investors using managed funds, many of whom are ordinary, middle-income savers.  
    Lower-income savers investing in vehicles that adopt the new rules will in future be taxed at their correct tax rate. Currently, lower-income savers are taxed at 33 percent on their savings even though their correct rate may be 19.5 percent. This creates a significant tax disincentive for lower-income savers to use managed funds in order to have access to a diversified range of investments. Those whose tax rate is 39 percent will continue to have their savings taxed at 33 percent.
2.  Capital gains on New Zealand and Australian shares held via a vehicle like a managed fund will no longer be taxed. This will increase the gains for those who choose to invest in these types of vehicles and offset the advantage of those who invest directly in NZ and Australian shares because they are only taxed on dividends. Both these measures put managed funds on an equal footing with direct investors. It is especially important for encouraging people to save through KiwiSaver.
3.  Offshore investment. Currently, individuals who invest directly in one of the eight so-called "grey list" countries will generally pay tax only on dividends. The problem is that many companies in "grey list" countries pay very little by way of dividends so these investors are not paying a reasonable amount of tax.

This tax treatment advantages direct investors over other savers, such as ordinary lower and middle-income people who use a managed fund and who may lack the wealth, financial sophistication, and confidence to invest offshore directly. Managed funds are taxed on the funds' earnings.

The new rules will resolve the problem by requiring a reasonable level of tax to be paid by direct investors who have substantial share portfolios outside Australia. This is not a full capital gains tax. The amount to be taxed will be capped at 5 percent of the increase in value of the investment in any one year, not the full unrealised capital gain. The increase in value will be limited to only 85 percent of the actual increase in value.

The current rules are also too harsh for investment outside the grey list, discouraging investment in other important destinations such as many high growth Asian countries.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax bill delivers greater fairness in taxing investment income

Wide-ranging reform of the taxation of investment income is the focus of a bill introduced into Parliament today.

"This long overdue reform puts the tax treatment of different types of share investment on an equal footing, introducing greater fairness and reducing distortions in investment decisions," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"It will cost the government about $110 million a year in forgone tax revenue to realign the system, but the cost is worth it to resolve the problems and foster a savings culture in New Zealand.

"The current tax rules on investment income operate very unevenly. They overtax some investors, they favour direct investment by individuals over investment through funds, and they favour investment in some countries over investment in others.

"For people who invest through New Zealand-based managed funds, the new rules will remove several tax disadvantages that discourage saving through funds. One of the key improvements is that lower income investors, whose investment income is currently over-taxed at 33%, will be taxed at their correct rate.

"The other big improvement is that managed funds will no longer be taxed on their share gains from New Zealand and Australian companies, which puts them on an equal tax footing with direct investors.

"Changes to the taxation of investment in offshore shares are based on the principle that if you live in New Zealand you are expected to contribute to New Zealand by paying New Zealand tax on all your income, whether it comes from New Zealand or overseas.

"That is not happening at present. The current tax rules allow individuals who invest directly in offshore shares in eight countries – such as the US and UK – to pay little or no tax in New Zealand on their investment income, since companies in those countries often pay low or no taxable dividends. In the meantime, investors in shares in other countries – such as Singapore and Korea - are fully taxed in New Zealand on their income.

"Nearly all of the protest over the proposed changes is coming from a group of investors who have investments in countries that are favoured by the current tax rules, and who will now have to pay the same level of New Zealand tax on their income as all other direct investors in overseas shares.

"What the changes do is equalise the New Zealand tax treatment of shares in traditional and emerging markets.

"Under the new rules, offshore portfolio investment in shares will be taxed more consistently, whether made by individuals directly or through managed funds, and regardless of the country invested into.

"Most individuals holding overseas shares outside Australia will not be affected by the changes because those whose shares cost less than $50,000 will be exempted. It means that, for all practical purposes, a couple could hold, between them, shares costing up to $100,000. However, direct investors with substantial share portfolios in countries favoured by the current rules will generally pay more tax, which is only fair.

"The reform aims to achieve a coherent and balanced tax treatment of New Zealanders' investment income," they said.

Other changes in the bill include:

*   **"Salary sacrifice":** changes to the employer superannuation contribution rules to minimise the use of excessive salary sacrifice as a means of paying less tax
*   **Australian superannuation schemes:** changes to resolve compliance problems for people in New Zealand who have interests in Australian super schemes, and to remove a potential disincentive for skilled migrants coming to work in New Zealand.
*   **Geothermal wells:** changes to the tax treatment of expenditure on geothermal wells, to remove uncertainty about the deductibility of capital losses arising from failed wells drilled in New Zealand.
*   **Sale of patent rights:** changes allowing vendors to spread income from sales of patent rights evenly over three years, to alleviate potential cashflow problems that may constitute a barrier to investment in research and technology.
*   **Investigation of tax evasion and avoidance:** changes allowing Inland Revenue to remove documents for inspection.
*   **Tax rates:** confirmation of the income tax rates that will apply for the 2006-07 tax year.
*   **Fringe benefit tax:** clarification that motor vehicles acquired before 1 April 2006 should be valued at cost after that date.

### Taxation of investment income: questions and answers

### Investment through New Zealand-based managed funds

**Q. How will the changes benefit individual investors?**

A. Investors who have a 19.5% tax rate will be taxed on their savings at this rate, instead of 33% (which is the tax rate, at present, for most of those who invest in managed funds).

Investors will also benefit from not being taxed on capital gains made on New Zealand and Australian companies if they invest in them through a portfolio investment entity. Currently, these gains are usually taxed if shares are held via a managed fund but are not generally taxed if held directly. This creates a significant disadvantage to using managed funds and other collective investment vehicles to invest in New Zealand and Australian companies.

All investors in managed funds that elect into the new rules and trade in New Zealand and Australian shares will be better off.

**Q. Will investors on the 39% rate have to pay more tax on their investment income?**

A. No, the maximum tax rate will be 33%, to encourage existing savers to continue to save and to encourage collective investment vehicles to adopt the new rules.

**Q. Will the new rules apply to all managed funds and investment vehicles?**

A. No. The new rules are limited to managed funds and collective investment vehicles that meet certain criteria. To qualify, a vehicle must be a genuine savings and investment entity because the purpose of these changes is to put investment through intermediaries on a similar tax footing to that of direct investment. It is therefore important to distinguish genuine investment and savings vehicles from other entities.

The new rules will be optional, meaning that all savings vehicles do not have to adopt them. However, those that do will be able to offer their lower income investors the benefits of being taxed at their correct tax rate, and the benefit of tax-free capital gains on shares in New Zealand and Australian companies to all their investors. Savings vehicles that do not adopt the new rules will continue to be taxed as they are at present.

### Investment in offshore portfolio shares

**Q. What's wrong with the present rules on taxing offshore investment in shares?**

A. The current tax rules are riddled with inconsistency and biases, and some investors pay less tax than others on similar investments. Individuals who invest directly in a company resident in one of the eight so-called "grey list" countries generally pay tax only on dividends. On the other hand, if they invest in a "grey list" country via a New Zealand managed fund they will typically be taxed on 100% of realised capital gains on these investments. The new rules will generally align the tax treatment of investment directly and via managed funds in those countries.

Direct investors in shares in the remaining countries have a much higher tax burden, since they pay tax on 100% of the increase in the value of their shares each year. They will be significantly better off under the new rules because, unless dividends are higher, they will pay tax on 5% of the opening value of their shares each year, limited to 85% of any gain they make. This will remove biases to investing in emerging destinations such as high-growth countries in Asia.

The changes to the taxation of investment in offshore shares are based on the principle that if you live in New Zealand you are expected to contribute to New Zealand by paying New Zealand tax on all your income, whether it comes from New Zealand or overseas. They balance the need for direct investors in "grey list" countries to pay their fair share of tax against the significant tax barriers facing investors who wish to invest outside New Zealand's traditional investment destinations.

**Q. How will the changes affect GPG investors, who have been encouraged to write to the government in protest?**

A. Most won't be affected. A quick glance at the share register shows that most have shares costing less than $50,000, so are below the threshold where the changes kick in. It means that a couple could hold shares costing up to $100,000, if each individual was below the threshold, without being affected by the new rules.

**Q. What will be the effect of the rules on other individual direct investors?**

A. Most will not be affected. Investors in Australian-resident listed companies will generally pay tax only on their dividends (the same treatment that will be accorded to investors in New Zealand-resident investment vehicles). Investors will be able to have investments outside Australia that cost NZD$50,000 or less in total ($100,000 per couple) and continue to pay tax only on dividends.

For substantial share portfolios outside Australia, taxable income in most years will be limited to 5% of the investment's value. (In most cases less than 2% of the value of the investment will be payable in tax.)

For substantial portfolios that are now heavily weighted towards the "grey list", individual direct investors are likely to pay more tax under the new rules.

For investments in non-"grey list" countries, investors will pay significantly less tax than they do under the current foreign investment fund rules. This should encourage savers to look beyond New Zealand's traditional investment destinations to high-growth economies in Asia, Latin America and Europe.

**Q. Will any excess capital gains be taxed under the 5% cap method?**

A. Yes. When the portfolio is sold and the proceeds not reinvested in other offshore shares, 85% of the excess gains will be taxed. This treatment brings the taxation of direct investment income closer to that of income from investments in managed funds.

**Q. Why is a special case being made for investment in Australian companies?**

A. Australian-resident listed companies are treated differently because they pay out a high proportion of their earnings as dividends. (Dividend distribution is encouraged by the Australian tax system.) It should result in a reasonable level of tax being collected from such investments.

Second, New Zealand has a closer economic relationship with Australia. Making a special case for Australia will help to move the two countries closer towards a single market for the purposes of investment and is therefore consistent with this relationship.

For these reasons, taxing only dividends received from Australian companies is a reasonable approach, while being a simpler approach as well.

**Q. Will compliance costs increase as a result of the new tax rules for offshore investments?**

A. For most ordinary direct investors in offshore shares, the changes should not result in an increase in tax compliance costs. For example, an investor with some Australian shares and a portfolio costing NZD$50,000 or less outside Australia would continue to pay tax just on dividends. Investors with significant share portfolios outside Australia will face some extra compliance costs under the "5% cap" method. The additional costs will arise because investors will have to value their portfolio each year and keep track of carried forward amounts. Many already use an accountant to assist with their tax obligations so this should not be a big problem.

**Q. Why do the changes discriminate against individuals who invest directly in offshore shares?**

A. They don't. They simply correct the imbalance in the current rules, which give favourable treatment to investments into certain countries and require more tax from investments made into others. Investors into the eight "grey-list" countries will lose their favoured tax treatment and be treated equally to investors in other countries.

Investors into companies resident outside the "grey list" currently pay tax on 100% of their gains. The new rules will significantly benefit them because they will generally pay tax on 5% of the opening value of their shares each year, limited to 85% of any gain they make.

Under the new rules, offshore portfolio investments in shares will be taxed more consistently, whether individuals make them directly or through managed funds.

**Q. So if I have investments in a managed fund will I be better off or worse off?**

A. Generally, if you invest in a fund you will be better off under the new rules. For example, if your fund invests in Australian and New Zealand shares the capital gains on these investments will no longer be taxed. In many cases funds investing outside Australia and New Zealand will only be taxed at 85% of their gains, instead of the current 100%. You may also get a better return because your income will be taxed at your marginal tax rate, capped at 33%.

Ministerial policy update
=========================

In a speech today to KPMG, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne described the impact of MMP on tax policy development and legislation and updated the audience on policy matters. For more information see the Minister's [speech](/news/2006/2006-05-31-ministerial-policy-update#statement)

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### KPMG client seminar 31 May 2006 (Auckland) and 1 June (Wellington)

Thank you for the invitation to speak to your seminar today.

You have asked me to update you on tax policy matters and to comment on future developments.

**The MMP environment**

I will begin by making a few observations on aspects of the political and parliamentary environment that influence tax policy and legislation under MMP.

Gone are the days of majority governments so strong that tax policy proposals could be expected to move quickly and relatively unchanged through to legislation.

There were times when that did not happen, of course, but they were not common.

Dead of night tax legislation is now but a memory of the distant past.

Policy development and law-making are more complicated now than they were before MMP, and they take more time.

At present we have a Labour-led minority government that has entered into confidence and supply agreements with two other parties, one of them United Future, in order to be able to govern.

That adds complexity to the policy development process, and slows it down, because of the number of views, perspectives and priorities that must now be taken into account and managed.

And we have a Minister of Revenue from outside not only the major party of government, but also the government itself.

As Minister of Revenue, I am solely responsible for all revenue areas except tax policy.

Responsibility for tax policy rests jointly with the Minister of Finance, Dr Cullen, and me.

We exercise that through a regular weekly meeting where all policy issues are discussed and policy decisions made.

**Select committee work**

Also, under MMP, bills cannot be rushed through select committees, since their composition generally reflects the proportionality of Parliament.

The powerful Finance and Expenditure Committee, which scrutinises taxation bills on behalf of Parliament, is made up of four Labour MPs, four National MPs, and one each from United Future, Act, the Green Party, Maori Party and New Zealand First.

There is no majority, and no party has control of the committee, so proposed legislation must be carefully managed through the select committee process.

It takes time, patience and a certain degree of compromise to arrive at majority agreements.

As Minister, I cannot be certain when bill a is referred to a select committee what shape it will be in when it emerges, which means that the power of submissions to the select committee to influence the outcome is much greater than ever before.

**GTPP**

The acclaimed generic tax policy process, which was established in 1994, constitutes an excellent framework for working under MMP.

It, too, slows down policy-making by requiring consultation with affected taxpayers at key points in the process, well before proposed changes appear in a bill.

I think all agree that the delay is worth it, however.

Early consultation results in better policy proposals and, ultimately, better legislation.

Potential problems with proposed changes tend to be exposed early in the policy process, and many have been worked through before the changes appear in a bill to be considered by a select committee.

I am aware that taking part in the generic tax policy process takes up a lot of private sector time and resources, and I am greatly appreciative of those efforts.

I know that a lot of work goes into your lengthy submissions on various government discussion documents and issues papers, as well as consultation directly with officials.

The alternative, however, is not to seek your views on proposed policy, or to seek them to a lesser degree – and I do not think that would be acceptable to most tax professionals these days.

**Business tax review**

The post-election confidence and supply agreement signed between United Future and Labour resulted in the addition of three important items to the government's tax policy programme.

Chief of these was the major business tax review that is under way now.

Its purpose is to ensure the tax system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

We are making good progress and are well on track to issue in July a discussion document outlining a number of possible initiatives.

When pushing in our post-election negotiations for some commitments on tax from the government, United Future laid particular emphasis on business tax reform because of what we regarded as the more pressing need, especially since the advent of the Working for Families package had enhanced the situation of nearly 350,000 New Zealand families.

However, it is also true that business tax rates cannot be considered in isolation from their impact on personal tax rates, and that any significant cut in business tax rates will raise questions about personal tax rates.

But they are questions that will be answered on another day, not today.

The two other tax elements of United Future's agreement with the government include a review of the charitable donations rebate regime which will be getting underway later this year, and the preparation of a government discussion paper on income splitting, due for publication early the following year.

This latter document assumes greater significance given the increasing debate about ways in which household income can be boosted, and also the increasing use of income splitting today as a tax avoidance mechanism to offset the incidence of high marginal tax rates, something the IRD highlighted in its Briefing to me as the Incoming Minister.

**The work programme**

The tax policy work programme that we released in March is an interim one that carried over projects from the previous work programme, or that had been previously announced, but does not extend much beyond the middle of the year.

The definitive work programme to June 2007 will be announced once the resource and policy implications of the business tax review are clearer.

**May bill**

In the meantime, work on a number of other policy projects continues at a vigorous pace.

The first tax bill of the year was introduced in mid-May, passed its first reading last week and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration and hearing of submissions.

**Investment proposals**

The main feature of the bill is a wide-ranging reform of the taxation of income from share investments, whether through managed funds or direct investment by individuals.

You will all have heard of the proposed changes, if nothing else from the full-page newspaper advertisements paid for by an interested party.

The proposed changes on investment income were the subject of extensive consultation for over two years before being included, in modified form, in the recent tax bill.

The select committee submission process will allow a further opportunity for the public to air its views.

The current rules operate very unevenly and are riddled with inconsistencies.

They favour direct investment over investment through funds, and they favour higher income investors through funds over lower income investors.

They favour investment overseas over investment in New Zealand, and they favour overseas investments in some countries over investment in others.

The reform places the tax rules on different types of share investment on an equal footing, introducing greater fairness and reducing distortions in investment decisions.

Levelling the field means that some will lose their disadvantages and some will lose their tax-favoured treatment.

On the whole, more people will be better off under the changes.

One half of the reform package is removing the disadvantages facing people who invest through managed funds, which many people do.

More people, especially lower income and middle income people, are expected to invest through funds after the work-based KiwiSaver scheme is in place.

The most notorious of the disadvantages of investing through funds is, of course, the flat 33% tax rate on share gains, which overtaxes those on a lower income tax rate.

Under the proposed changes, lower income investors through funds will be taxed at their correct rate.

Most commentators appear to support that part of the equation.

It is the other half of the reform that is arousing controversy – the half relating to overseas investment, especially direct investment in offshore shares.

I do not have time today to go into the detail of the proposed offshore changes but, briefly, they do three things:

*   They remove the tax advantages enjoyed by individuals who invest directly in shares in the eight "grey list" countries.
*   They reduce the tax disadvantages of investors into countries that are not on the grey list, the non-traditional investment destinations.
*   And they ensure that direct investment is not tax-favoured over investment through funds.

Much of the concern about these proposals appears to be coming from small investors in offshore shares, many of whom are unlikely to be adversely affected by the changes to the offshore rules.

People with significant investments into grey list countries, however, will be expected to pay a reasonable level of tax on their investment income.

Select committee scrutiny of the bill will be invaluable to fine-tuning the proposed changes and will undoubtedly throw light on any unintended effects.

Given what I said a little earlier about the enhanced role of select committees in the current political environment, I am looking forward to the select committee process on this bill.

I am encouraging all those with a view on the bill, whether it be that they do not like what has been proposed, or that they think we have got it wrong, or have not gone far enough in some cases to come along and have their say.

But let me make this point.

Telling the select committee that one is for or against a particular measure is of limited value.

I for one am much more interested in hearing specific, practical proposals on how the legislation can be improved, and I would urge all those making submissions to focus on that aspect, rather than just whether they like the bill or not.

**What's coming up**

To turn to other forthcoming events, a discussion document outlining proposed changes to the tax treatment of general and limited partnerships should be ready for release in a few weeks' time.

The main impetus for the tax changes is the forthcoming introduction of updated rules on limited partnerships, which are separate legal entities, to facilitate venture capital investment.

That will require the parallel updating of the tax rules on general and limited partnerships.

Another discussion document to be released later in the year will deal with a range of concerns about tax shortfall penalties.

In particular, it will look at the interaction between the penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position and the penalty for lack of reasonable care.

The discussion document will also look at ways of more closely aligning penalties with Inland Revenue's graduated "compliance model", which tailors departmental responses to taxpayer behaviour.

It takes into account gradations of offending, which means being helpful to taxpayers who try to comply with the rules but don't always succeed, but using the full force of the law on those who have decided not to comply.

In July or August I expect to see a flurry of Orders in Council that will complete the legislative procedures in New Zealand relating to two new double tax agreements and amending two existing ones.

The new DTA with Spain is waiting in the wings.

Spain has completed its legislative requirements, so when New Zealand's are complete and diplomatic exchanges have taken place, the new DTA will come into effect.

The new DTA with Poland is making progress.

We will soon have completed our domestic procedures but Poland has a way to go yet, I am told.

Amending protocols to our DTAs with Australia and Singapore will also have completed the legislative process in New Zealand but must await corresponding developments in the two countries.

The rewrite of the Income Tax Act is drawing to a close this year, and the final exposure drafts of rewritten legislation are being released this week for consultation.

The next step will be the development of the rewrite bill for introduction into Parliament.

The rewrite of our income tax legislation began back in the 1990s, at about the time the United Kingdom and Australia began to rewrite their own Acts.

Its completion will be an historic achievement for the people who have worked on it over all those years.

To conclude, it is obviously an extremely busy time on the tax policy front.

The major event of the year is, of course, the business tax review, with the publication of a resulting discussion document planned for mid-July.

I look forward to hearing your views on the proposals.

I wish you a very successful seminar. Thank you.

Cullen on superannuation, investment

He also discussed tax-related initiatives, including proposed changes to the taxation of income from direct portfolio investment in overseas shares.

SPEECH

### Address to Superannuation and Investment Conference, Intercontinental Hotel, Grey St, Wellington

Governments and the superannuation industry have a number of things in common. One of them is the perennial problem of getting people to plan for the long term, and then to remain focused on those objectives. In this regard, we both face the challenge of what might be called 'prudence fatigue'.

Prudence fatigue is the condition that sets in five or six years into a sensible plan for achieving financial security, once a few initial milestones have been passed. It is the temptation to splurge, or to take an extended savings holiday, as soon as one starts to feel that financial security could be within one's grasp.

I am sure individual savers enter these danger zones from time to time. It is particularly tempting after a period in which investments have shown good returns for Mom and Pop investors to cash in their gains, on the assumption that good times are here to stay and they can always resume their savings habits later on. That leaves professional advisors having to remind them of what they would rather forget: that the economy is subject to cyclical changes, and that if one spends all the gains on the upswing one will be left with limited options on the downswing.

It is a hard discipline to leave windfall gains where they lie, and to realise that markets and economies go through predictable cycles. And it is a hard discipline to appreciate that if a long term plan is abandoned it is ver difficult to regain the lost ground.

The same problem exists at a national level. Six years of sustained economic growth have increased the size of our economy by around 20 per cent, and enabled us to achieve some important milestones in terms of the stability of our public finances.

We have succeeded in reducing gross sovereign-issued debt from 35 per cent of GDP in 1999, to slightly over 20 per cent today. Added to that, shortly before this year's Budget the Crown achieved a positive net financial asset position for the first time since the 1850s.

An important element in this has been the strong performance of the Crown Financial Institutions, such as the Earthquake Commission and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. These institutions made investment gains (unrealised, of course) that contributed $2.5 billion towards this year's operating balance, notably the 19.5 per cent return on assets achieved by the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, which netted $1.1 billion for the Crown's balance sheet during the nine months to March this year.

The Fund now holds assets of around $10 billion, and that is forecast to rise to $23 billion by the end of the decade.

What is also clear from the Budget forecasts, is that conditions will not be so propitious for the Crown’s accounts for the next few years. Treasury is forecasting that GDP growth will fall from 3.7 percent in the year to March 2005 to 2.1 per cent in the year to March 2006, and will bottom out at 1.0 per cent in the year to March 2007.

This will impact on the government's finances starting from next year. The current year will be the last for some time to see a cash surplus. Instead, cash deficits are forecast totalling $7.4 billion for the forecast period. The deficit will be $1.5 billion for 2006/07, rising to a peak of $2.7 billion in 2008/09, before falling back to $1.1 billion in 2009/10.

What that means is that for that period it will be difficult to maintain our programme of investing in infrastructure, and difficult to maintain the health, education, policing, and other services that New Zealanders expect as an essential part of their quality of life. Difficult, but not impossible, as the Budget demonstrated.

One might have thought that, given the state of the Crown's finances going forward, we might not have had the chorus of cries for immediate tax cuts. The outlook for the next few years shows that, whatever position one takes on the question of tax cuts, one cannot pretend that there are no trade offs involved. To cut tax at a point when the country is heading into a deficit situation surely means cuts to expenditure are the inevitable tradeoff. Less tax means less health care, fewer roads, fewer tertiary education places and so on.

Similarly, with an economy running to full capacity, with a tight labour market and a large current account deficit, tax cuts involve tradeoffs in terms of economic stability. One has to be prepared for tax cuts to flow on to higher inflation and pressure to tighten monetary policy.

There is no free lunch, either in fiscal or in economic terms. And it is certainly frustrating that some portions of the media happily dumb down their coverage of the issue to give the impression that tradeoffs do not exist.

This is the context in which I would like to discuss the government's overall superannuation and investment strategy. The truth is that long term savings, like prudent fiscal management, can be a hard sell. The end point sounds attractive, but the short term sacrifices required are not.

The overall objectives of the government's strategy are things that I believe have almost universal support.

*   We want to increase the overall rate of domestic savings.
*   We want to see a larger proportion of ordinary New Zealand families making realistic savings plans for their retirement.
*   As much as is possible, we want a level playing field for different types of investment and for different types of investor.
*   And we want a regime where investment decisions are made on the basis of the merits of the investment proposal, rather than extraneous questions such as taxation.

These are objectives the government has pursued for the last six years, with some success.

We are forming a platform of long term stability for New Zealand Superannuation. This platform comprises two elements. First, a strong political consensus around New Zealand Superannuation as a guaranteed basic income for those in retirement. The days when superannuation was a political football are over, and any differences between the major parties are nuances rather than matters of great substance.

The second element is the Superannuation Fund, which now has multi party support and is showing good returns from its investment strategy. The additional stability that the fund gives to the long term financing of New Zealand Superannuation will increasingly become a source of competitive advantage for the country, as other developed nations with similar issues around population ageing are forced to make hard fiscal choices in the next few decades.

We are moving to foster a stronger savings culture through the establishment of the KiwiSaver scheme. As you will be aware, the Bill which gives effect to the scheme has been examined by Select Committee. As I understand the general tenor of the submissions was one of cautious optimism.

Only a few submissions were opposed to the concept; and most were broadly supportive with concerns about particular design features and about whether the incentives in the scheme would in fact be sufficient to create a shift in the savings culture of ordinary Kiwis.

I can only say at this point that I look forward to seeing what the Select Committee recommends. I believe the scheme has many basic strengths, and provides ample scope for fine tuning at a later date, should that become desirable.

The development of KiwiSaver turned a spotlight on a number of taxation issues which needed addressing. Chief among these was the fact that investment through New Zealand collective investment vehicles is generally overtaxed relative to direct investment.

Under the current rules, effective tax planning has a significant impact on investment returns for direct investors. Collective investment vehicles, however, while having the greatest mainstream appeal, often suffer the worst tax result. As a result, many less sophisticated investors have been discouraged from investing, or have invested primarily in property. On the one hand, they see collective investment vehicles as being less tax efficient than other options; but on the other hand, they do not back themselves to choose and understand the most tax efficient method of making financial investments.

This is an inequitable result and has arguably caused a bias against financial intermediation, which is a key part of the KiwiSaver initiative.

The new rules seek to remedy these problems, with one of the key improvements being that lower income investors, whose investment income is currently over-taxed at 33 per cent, will be taxed at their correct rate.

Managed funds will no longer be taxed on their share gains from New Zealand and Australian companies, which puts them on an equal tax footing with direct investors.

The other major change will impact upon offshore investment.

I think it is important to focus on the harm we are trying to fix. It is currently quite easy to achieve a low tax or no tax result for direct portfolio investment in shares outside New Zealand. Overseas tax regimes generally discourage companies in their jurisdiction from paying dividends, while the New Zealand tax rules currently rely on dividend payment for taxing most such investments.

Additionally, dividend paying and non-paying offshore investments are often substitutable. This has three harmful effects:

*   First, it can leave higher income or more sophisticated taxpayers with significant ability to minimise their tax burden by investing offshore. That is unfair on other taxpayers, and goes against the principle that if you live in New Zealand you are expected to contribute to New Zealand by paying New Zealand tax on all your income, whether it comes from New Zealand or overseas.
*   Second, it discourages investment in New Zealand companies. As New Zealand cannot rely on a limitless supply of foreign capital, nor can such capital always replace domestic capital, the current system has the potential to artificially lower the amount of capital available to New Zealand businesses.
*   And third, investment in some high growth and lower tax countries including trading partners in Asia and Latin America can currently be over-taxed relative to investment in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. In particular, direct investors currently face tax barriers to overseas investment as a result of currency fluctuation and share price volatility outside a few countries in the so-called "grey list" (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and United States).

Hence, the current tax rules steer New Zealand investors towards investing directly in offshore shares in the eight "grey list" countries, so that they pay little or no tax in New Zealand on their investment income, since companies in those countries often pay low or no taxable dividends.

However, investors in shares in other countries – such as Singapore and Korea – are fully taxed in New Zealand on their income. As a result, the current rules can steer New Zealand investors away from newer investment destinations., such as Asia and Latin America where most economists see ongoing high rates of growth.

Because New Zealand cannot adopt dividend-only taxation for direct offshore portfolio investment in shares, without the risk of undermining its domestic tax base, a more coherent and comprehensive set of tax rules is needed. We need to ensure that historical investment destinations do not continue to receive undue benefit relative to new destinations, and effectively lock New Zealand investors out of some of the more promising new opportunities.

This issue has long been something of a Gordian Knot and any way that one might attempt to cut through it is bound to create winners and losers. As is always the case, the winners are a broad group including low income earners and people who invest through managed funds; and the losers are a clearly defined group of high net worth individuals and their sharebrokers, who are easily spurred into action and ready to take out full page advertisements in the major dailies.

However, I would point out that the major loser in the current changes is the government, which will forgo about $110 million a year in tax revenue with this reform. Nevertheless, we believe it is important to remove distortions in investment decision making and we are willing to bear that loss.

To sum up, I think if one takes a longer view it is clear that we are part way through a process of building a sustainable institutional structure to support and promote savings and investment in New Zealand. We are eliminating the confusion and uncertainty regarding state provision, which made it difficult for a generation of New Zealanders to be sure exactly what was the basis of their planning.

We are establishing a vehicle which enables the savings industry and the government to work in partnership to bring a new generation of savers on board. And we are clearing away anomalies in the investment tax regime that skewed decisions and limited options for New Zealand investors.

The job is not done, by any means. All of these instruments need to be implemented, tested, and refined over the next decade. And most importantly both the government and the savings industry need to work to keep New Zealanders focussed on the long game.

Thank you.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Proposed tax changes for general and limited partnerships

A government discussion document released today proposes codifying the tax rules on general partnerships and introducing new rules on limited partnerships.

"The changes are designed to bring clarity and certainty to New Zealand's tax rules on partnership income and bring them into line with world's best practice," said Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

"A key impetus of the tax reform for limited partnerships is the planned introduction of modern limited partnership regulatory rules, to be the subject of a future bill.

"Limited partnerships are an internationally preferred vehicle for venture capital investment into foreign countries. Given the importance of attracting venture capital into New Zealand, it makes sense to have tax rules that facilitate this kind of investment by recognising the separate legal entity status of limited partnerships, while ensuring flow-through treatment for tax purposes.

"Having clear tax rules for general partnerships will provide greater certainty for all partnerships, large or small," they said.

"The new limited partnership rules are investment-friendly and will enable New Zealand to be more competitive with Australia in attracting venture capital," they said.

The main proposals are:

**All partnerships**

*   Partners will derive income or expenses from each source, in proportion to their profit share (flow-through treatment).
*   The entry and exit of partners will not result in the dissolution of the partnership for income tax purposes.
*   Exiting partners may recognise gains or losses attributable to underlying partnership assets on disposition subject to a minimum threshold rule. The minimum threshold simplifies tax consequences for exiting or new partners when tax is not an issue.
*   New rules will reduce the likelihood of under-taxation and over-taxation of both exiting and incoming partners.

**Limited partnerships**

*   New rules will allow the same flow-through tax treatment for limited partnerships that have separate legal entity status.
*   New loss limitation rules will ensure the tax losses deducted by limited partners reflect the actual level of any economic loss.
*   A simple transition from a special partnership to a limited partnership would not generally result in the triggering of income tax provisions for the partners.

The discussion document, "General and limited partnerships – proposed tax changes", is available at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](/publications/2006/2006-dd-limited-partnerships)
. Submissions close on 11 August 2006.

### Questions and answers

**What's behind the proposed changes?**

The government has agreed to the introduction of modern limited partnership rules, with separate legal entity status and partnership tax treatment, in order to encourage the flow of venture capital investment into New Zealand. This discussion document sets out a clear set of tax rules that will apply to the proposed limited partnership form. In addition, the problems associated with the taxation of partnerships generally (as highlighted by the Valabh Committee) may become more acute as the use of limited partnership structures increases. Therefore the discussion document proposes to clarify and improve the tax rules for partnerships generally.

**What is the extent of the proposals?**

The changes proposed are two-fold. First, the discussion document outlines rules that will apply to all partnership and partners (such as general and limited partners/partnerships). Second, it proposes specific rules for limited partners.

**Will the current rules for allocating partnership income and expenditure to partners be changed?**

No. The discussion document proposes to clarify and codify the existing law and practice in legislation.

**What tax changes are proposed for the entry and exit of partners?**

There is currently a great deal of uncertainty about the applicable tax treatment on the entry and exit of partners. Technically, under current law the entry or exit of partners may result in dissolution of the partnership and the creation of a new partnership. This may trigger the operation of tax provisions relating to the disposal of an interest in property of the partnership for all of the partners in the partnership.

The proposals aim to clarify the treatment in future by making it clear that a partnership will continue and will not dissolve for tax purposes. The discussion document proposes that only the exiting partner may be taxed on the taxable gain attributable to the underlying partnership assets. This is subject to a minimum threshold rule – for example, there would be tax consequences for the exiting partner only if the sale proceeds exceed the tax book value of assets by $20,000 or more. These proposed rules will reduce the complexity of the tax rules applying to partnerships and the compliance costs associated with the entry and exit of partners.

**General partnerships**

**How will the proposed changes affect small partnerships (such as family and farming partnerships)?**

The discussion document does not propose any real changes for small partnerships. The proposals contained in the discussion document merely clarify and codify the existing law and practice. The discussion document also proposes that partnerships of fewer than six members may elect to follow the proposed rules for the entry and exit of partners or continue as they are.

**How will the proposed changes affect professional partnerships?**

The discussion document does not propose any real change to the allocation of income and expenditure to the partners. In relation to the exit and entry of partners, a minimum threshold has been developed, with professional partnerships in mind. Therefore exiting partners of partnerships with few assets will not be taxed on the taxable gain attributable to the underlying partnership assets on disposal.

**Limited partnerships**

**What is a limited partnership?**

A limited partnership is composed of "general" partners who are liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership and one or more "limited" partners, whose liability is limited to the amount of their investment, provided that they do not engage in the management of the partnership.

Standard features of the proposed limited partnership include: flow-through tax status; limited liability for investing partners; separate legal personality; and the ability for limited partners to participate in management only in prescribed circumstances.

**How will limited partners be taxed differently from general partners?**

All of the rules proposed for general partnerships in the discussion document will also apply to limited partners. In addition, the discussion document proposes the introduction of loss limitation rules for limited partners. This means that a loss available to a limited partner in any given income year will be limited to the tax value of their investment. This ensures that the net tax losses claimed by a limited partner in relation to a limited partnership interest reflect the actual level of that limited partner's economic loss. These rules are consistent with international practise.

**How will the new rules affect the venture capital industry?**

The new limited partnership rules (with partnership tax treatment) will help encourage the flow of venture capital investment into New Zealand. The limited partnership is the preferred business structure internationally for investing in venture capital.

**Miscellaneous**

**What are the compliance cost implications associated with the new rules?**

Many of the proposed rules aim to reduce the compliance costs associated with partnerships by providing greater certainty about tax treatment. However, a cost may be associated with the proposed introduction of the "partner's basis" (basis tracking), which will be required to determine the extent of the application of the loss limitation rules for limited partners.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Business Tax Review Discussion Document released

Improving the ability of business to grow and compete in the global economy is the driving force behind the range of options identified in the business tax review discussion document released today.

"The government's goal, in line with its confidence and supply agreements with United Future and New Zealand First, is to help transform the New Zealand economy through internationally competitive business tax rules," said Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne.

"If we are to build a high wage, high skill, knowledge-based economy we need business tax rules that encourage innovation, support business investment, encourage exporters to break in to new markets and help to build a more skilled workforce.

"The discussion document, therefore, suggests options including a reduction in the company tax rate, tax base changes and measures to reduce the cost of complying with tax rules. These are designed to increase competitiveness, improve productivity and so the potential for the economy to grow.

"As it will not be possible to go ahead with all of the options, we need businesses to tell us what they see as their priorities in relation to the options identified. We also welcome suggestions for other changes as well. This will help the government make informed decisions based on the obvious fiscal constraints we face.

"The business tax review aims to build on progress we have already made in fostering a supportive business environment. We are recognised internationally by the World Bank for the ease of doing business.

"But we can do better and we hope the document provokes meaningful debate. It is the first step in engaging with the public on how best to reform the business tax rules to achieve our economic goals.

"We have attempted, where possible, to estimate the annual cost of each option, being mindful of the fact that whatever mix is finally agreed upon, there will be a fiscal cost which could impact on government spending programmes.

Possible initiatives in the discussion document are:

| Tax Rate | Estimated annual cost |
| --- | --- |
| Dropping the company tax rate from 33% to 30% | $540m |
| Tax Base | Estimated annual cost |
| Targeted tax credits for:<br><br>R&D  <br>Export market development  <br>Skills improvement | $45m  <br>Uncertain\*  <br>Uncertain\* |
| Deferring losses from significant upfront expenditure | Uncertain\* |
| Deduction for "black hole" expenditure, such as losses on buildings | $150m-300m |
| Increased depreciation loading on new assets to:<br><br>30%  <br>40% | $120m  <br>$230m |
| Decreased depreciation loading on new assets to:<br><br>10%  <br>0% | ($120m)  <br>($250m) |
| Aligning decpreciation loading at 20% on new and secondhand assets | $90m |
| Tax Compliance | Estimated annual cost |
| Increasing low-value asset write-off thresholds (e.g. from $500 to $1000) | $170m |
| Reducing compliance costs for assets with low depreciated values | Uncertain\* |
| Increasing the threshold for taxpayers allowed to submit and annual FBT return | Nil |

\*Until the detail of these initiatives has been designed it is not possible to give accurate costings.

"We acknowledge that company tax rate changes may have implications for the design of the wider income tax system. Changes to the system of personal income taxation are outside the scope of the Business Tax Review. Any changes in those areas will need to be considered within the context of the overall personal tax regime.

"We want to emphasise that, in changing the tax structure, the government is not interested in an ill-thought out, politically driven lolly scramble.

"Our concern is to lift the performance of the economy for the benefit of all New Zealanders," the Ministers said.

Submissions must be made by 8 September this year.

"We realise that the submission time is tight, but would point out that there is an extensive consultative and legislative process to be gone through. Tax law can take up to a year to pass. Best practice also suggests changes should apply from the start of a tax year, in this case, from 1 April 2008."

### Business Tax Review – Questions and Answers

**What is the objective of the Business Tax Review?**

The objective of the Business Tax Review is to provide better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia. The release of the discussion document is a first step towards engaging with the public on business tax reforms that are aimed at continuing to transform the New Zealand economy into one that has higher levels of productivity, business investment, innovation and skills.

The discussion document outlines a range of possible initiatives involving a reduction in the company tax rate, tax base measures and compliance cost reduction measures.

**How would a reduction in the company tax rate raise productivity and improve competitiveness with Australia?**

A reduction in the company tax rate would encourage more investment into New Zealand by businesses that have decided to locate here. This would tend to increase New Zealand's stock of plant, equipment and buildings, which would boost labour productivity.

A lower rate would reduce biases between different investments that companies undertake, which would tend to boost capital productivity.

Any reduction in the company tax rate would tend to encourage New Zealand companies to stay here, rather than shift to Australia or elsewhere. It would increase the after-tax profits of companies, which means more funds available for reinvestment.

**How would the tax base measures raise productivity and improve competitiveness with Australia?**

Firms undertake R&D to improve their products and processes, which directly contributes to productivity and competitiveness. At the moment, businesses are likely to under invest in R&D because they do not capture all of the benefits from that investment – the investment results in wider benefits that boost productivity and competitiveness for other firms as well. R&D tax credits should help to address this underinvestment, resulting in businesses developing more new products and processes.

Tax credits for export market development aim to raise productivity by encouraging businesses to seek new markets for their existing products, and to introduce new products to existing markets. As with R&D, businesses may not invest enough in developing new markets, and other New Zealand business can lose as a result.

When a New Zealand firm successfully launches its products overseas, other businesses are likely to benefit from knowledge of comparative advantage and networks developed by that firm. Tax credits for skills enhancement in the workplace aim to encourage employers to spend more on developing the skills of their employees. They may be reluctant to do this at the moment because these skills are easily transferred to other businesses and the benefits would be lost to the employer. Increasing skill levels should improve labour productivity.

Accelerated depreciation reduces the cost of investing in assets, encouraging more businesses to upgrade their plant and equipment. If businesses use more up-to-date plant and equipment this will make labour more productive and so increase economic output, adding to GDP growth.

**How would reduced compliance costs raise productivity and improve competitiveness with Australia?**

Complying with the tax systems costs companies money and valuable time. The less time a business spends complying the more time and money a business has to expand and reinvest. Even though the World Bank has recognised New Zealand as business friendly, the more we can do to free up management time, the better. This is especially true for small businesses where the burden is often higher.

**How does the tax burden on New Zealand companies compare with that in Australia?**

A 30 per cent company tax rate would be the same as Australia's. Moreover, New Zealand companies do not pay payroll taxes (up to 6 per cent in some Australian states) or compulsory superannuation. Australia also has a comprehensive capital gains tax, and stamp duties on property sales, mortgage registration and the transfer of securities.

These options build on our already competitive tax and compliance system. The World Bank says New Zealand is the easiest place in the world to do business (Australia is sixth). We have the third lowest tax wedge in the OECD (Australia is sixth) – the OECD measures this as the difference between what it costs to employ a single production worker on an average wage and their take home pay.

Moreover, if adopted, the tax changes would increase New Zealand's competitiveness with the rest of the world. Latest OECD tax data shows New Zealand's total tax burden is not out of line with the rest of the developed world and is indeed lower than most rich industrial nations such as France and Italy.

**Why not consider deep company tax cuts?**

Deep cuts to the company tax rate are expensive, and without alternative revenue sources (such as a payroll tax) the government could not afford the high quality services it now provides. Competing countries with much lower company tax rates usually have other business taxes to boost revenue.

Even if a deep rate cut was affordable, by itself, it would increase further the gap between the company rate and the top personal rate of income tax. People would then have a greater incentive to use companies to avoid tax.

Deep company tax reductions would benefit only companies and not all those businesses engaged in productive investment. Some businesses such as sole traders are not incorporated as companies.

Finally, much of the benefit would flow to large, foreign owned companies and might do relatively little to promote productivity and competitiveness.

**Why reject a payroll tax?**

Imposing payroll taxes to fund deep company tax cuts creates a number of problems and is unlikely to promote productivity and growth.

It could be costly and complex to administer especially if there are thresholds and exemptions. It would increase compliance costs for companies and create incentives for companies to construct ways to avoid it increasing inefficiency and undermining the integrity of the payroll tax.

For example, companies could outsource labour to unincorporated entities and so avoid the tax. Therefore the rate might have to be higher on those paying the tax.

New companies that are rapidly expanding would be particularly hard hit. They could well be losing money as they reinvest for future expansion (and therefore not benefit from deep tax reductions), but would still be required to pay payroll tax.

**Why are tax concessions being considered?**

It is generally accepted that government support for certain business activities which result in wider benefits to society is justified when investment in those activities is less than is desirable because a business cannot secure all the benefits from its investment. On this basis, the government already provides assistance by way of discretionary grants for business R&D, export market development and increasing skill levels.

The discussion document raises the possibility of further support by way of tax concessions as the government considers that this can be a more effective way of supporting these activities than discretionary assistance alone.

**Could tax concessions for exporters breach World Trade Organisation rules?**

Many countries provide market development assistance of this sort to businesses, as the recent New Zealand Institute report acknowledges, without being challenged in the WTO. The current market development assistance provided as part of the Enterprise Development Grant scheme closely follows the design of the Australian scheme.

**Does a reduction in the company tax rate cause problems with a much higher top personal rate?**

The government acknowledges that company tax rate changes may have implications for the design of the wider income tax system. Changes to the system of personal income taxation are outside the scope of the Business Tax Review. Any changes in those areas will need to be considered within the context of the overall personal tax regime and have regard to revenue constraints and tax policy principles.

**What does this all mean for indexing thresholds? Will that still go ahead?**

The indexation policy is separate from the Business Tax Review. Final decisions on its affordability have yet to be made.

**What will be affordable?**

As indicated in Budget 2006, the government faces tight fiscal constraints over the next four years. How much fiscal headroom is available for tax changes will depend on careful management of the other pressures in the Budget and will be clearer closer to next year's Budget: when final decisions on the Business Tax Review will be made.

It is important to note that not all options will be progressed, and trade-offs will have to be made once consultation has identified what the business community regards as most effective.

**Why are you doing this now and not years ago?**

The review is a key part of the support agreement with United Future and New Zealand First. It is a natural next step building on past successes. In particular, the Labour-led government has already been actively engaged in reducing the tax burden on business and providing a more supportive environment. Budget 2005 introduced over $1 billion of changes relating to provisional tax, depreciation and other simplification measures.

Moving beyond taxes, the government's investment in research, science and technology has increased 65 per cent since 1999. There has also been considerable market development assistance for exporters, funding for venture capital and a major investment in skills training.

**Why is there not a fiscal cost for all options?**

Fiscal costs are provided when these can be estimated with some degree of reliability.

In the case of tax credits for export market development and skills enhancement, it is not possible to estimate a fiscal cost until it is clearer what the scope of the credit would be.

In the case of measures proposed to reduce compliance costs in relation to assets that reach a low depreciated value, Inland Revenue and the Treasury do not at present have sufficient data on asset schedules to cost the initiatives with any certainty.

**How will the government decide which initiatives to proceed with?**

The government will consider the costs and benefits of all initiatives raised in the Business Tax Review, including those put forward in submissions. Subject to fiscal restraints, it will progress those that represent the best value in terms of increasing productivity and competitiveness with Australia.

**What's the timeframe for changes?**

Submissions are due by 8 September. The timeframe allowed for submissions is tight as the government is committed to action by 1 April 2008. Tax law is complicated and changes take time. We want to give those providing input an opportunity to see details of the final package before legislation is introduced.

Final decisions will be made early in 2007 with a view to introducing legislation by May 2007.

Speech: Business Tax Review
===========================

In a speech today to PricewaterhouseCoopers, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne outlined the background to the government’s choice of options presented in the Business Tax Review discussion document, which was released last week for public consultation. For more information see the Minister's [speech](/news/2006/2006-08-01-speech-business-tax-review#statement)

Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Speech to PricewaterhouseCoopers, Wellington

Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today on the ideas put forward in the Business Tax Review discussion document, which was released for public consultation last week.

The confidence and supply agreement signed between United Future and Labour resulted in the addition of three important items to the government's tax policy work programme.

They were:

*   the preparation and release of a government discussion paper on the merits of income splitting for families;
*   introduction of a new regime for the tax treatment of charities and charitable donations; and
*   the Business Tax Review.

Chief of these was the Business Tax Review.

The stated purpose of the Review was to ensure the tax system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

In the course of the post-election negotiations, United Future laid particular emphasis on business tax reform because of what we regarded as the more pressing need – especially since the advent of Working for Families.

That package has enhanced the financial situation of nearly 350,000 New Zealand families.

But that does not mean that we have closed the door on personal tax reductions – it simply means that because of Working for Families United Future saw business tax reform as the priority at this time.

The discussion document describes a range of possible business tax initiatives that will help to increase productivity and boost New Zealand's international competitiveness.

It also seeks the public's views on other ideas.

One of the most critical challenges facing any New Zealand Government is boosting incomes.

New Zealand's wage rates currently lag behind those in many OECD countries including Australia.

The only way that New Zealand can obtain a sustained growth in wage rates is for labour to become more productive.

Greater labour productivity means that the same amount of labour will provide more GDP.

Labour productivity can be increased in a number of ways.

A forestry worker with an axe is less productive than a worker with a chainsaw.

Increased investment in plant, equipment and buildings can boost productivity.

Similarly, a better educated workforce or more innovative technologies will boost labour productivity.

A critical issue for the government is whether there are ways that New Zealand's tax system impedes growth in labour productivity.

It is also important that New Zealand's capital ends up going to those firms which will use it to generate the best returns for New Zealand as a whole.

Other things being equal, a broad income base and low tax rates encourage capital being acquired by firms that will use it most productively.

If, however, firms cannot capture all of the benefits of their investment, they may undertake too little investment from the point of view of New Zealand as a whole.

In this case, there may be grounds for providing tax incentives to encourage more productive investment from the point of view of New Zealand as a whole.

Our tax system also needs to be internationally competitive, especially in relation to Australia's.

There are many ways in which our tax system is better for business than the Australian tax system is.

For example, New Zealand does not have Australia's general capital gains tax, payroll taxes or stamp duties.

However, we currently have a higher statutory company rate of 33 percent compared with Australia's rate of 30 percent.

In a fundamental review of business taxation, there are many different changes that could conceivably boost productivity and competitiveness.

One option that was considered but rejected was that of deep company rate cuts.

That option has a number of potential problems that are described in more detail in the discussion document.

Deep company tax rate cuts have attractions as a means of enhancing productivity and competitiveness.

However, they can also be very expensive and, if implemented, would require a major replacement source of revenue if New Zealand is to be able to continue to maintain its current level of government services.

Deep company tax rate cuts would also widen the gap between personal and company tax rates, which would increase the benefits of people using companies to shelter income from higher personal tax rates.

The fact that New Zealand has a full imputation system means that deep company rate cuts would provide a permanent benefit to non-resident and non-taxpayer shareholders, but only a timing benefit to domestic taxpayers.

They would also be of benefit only to businesses operating as companies.

There was also the question of a replacement source of revenue.

We considered a payroll tax, possibly in the form of a compulsory superannuation and savings levy, as a possible candidate.

In principle, a payroll tax on all employers as well as the income of the self-employed may be a relatively neutral form of tax. By itself, it would not distort decisions over where labour is used.

It would be costly, however, for smaller firms to comply with such a tax.

Excluding the self-employed and providing thresholds for smaller firms would reduce compliance costs.

At the same time, it would require a higher rate on taxpaying firms, which would bias labour into non-taxed firms.

This would not promote labour productivity.

In the end, we decided that this was an unattractive direction for us to pursue.

These, then, are some the considerations that have led to the range of possible options outlined in the discussion document.

Obviously, tax policy by itself cannot build a high wage, high skill, knowledge-based economy.

But what it can do is to remove tax obstacles to achieving that, and ensure that our business tax rules support innovation, business investment and the development of a highly skilled workforce, and that they encourage exporters to break into new markets.

The discussion document suggests a range of tax options for doing just that.

It also invites further suggestions on other options that meet the objectives of the Review.

It will not be possible to progress the full range of options, so informed trade-offs will need to be made.

One of the aims for the discussion document is to generate an informed debate and feedback on the relative merits of the different options.

The first option described in the discussion document is reducing the company tax rate from 33 percent to 30 percent, which would align it with Australia's corporate tax rate.

That would have an estimated cost of $540 million a year.

Reducing the company tax rate to 30 percent would raise our productivity and growth in a number of ways.

It would boost the competitiveness of New Zealand-based companies, and encourage inbound investment by firms that had decided to move to New Zealand.

In turn, that would tend to increase our stock of plant, equipment and building, which would boost labour productivity and wage rates.

On the other hand, there are disadvantages to reducing the company tax rate by itself, and they have to be weighed against the benefits of doing so.

The disadvantages include the problems arising from widening the gap between the company tax rate and the top personal tax rate, and between the company tax rate and the 33 percent tax rate for trusts.

As the discussion document points out, the current gap provides incentives for companies and trusts to be used to shelter income from higher personal tax rates.

Therefore reducing it would increase those incentives.

Clearly, reducing the company tax rate has implications for personal taxation, which we have acknowledged in the discussion document.

We are moving one step at a time, however.

The emphasis in the Review is on business tax because this is the most pressing need and because business tax reforms are more complex and therefore take more time to design and develop.

Once we have made decisions on the matters raised in the Review, we will look at the wider implications in other areas of the tax system.

Decisions on personal taxation will be made within the fiscal confines at that time.

It remains our intention that all the changes arising from this review take effect on 1 April 2008.

The discussion document also suggests a number of tax base initiatives that would improve productivity, business investment and competitiveness.

It raises the possibility of introducing targeted tax credits for R & D activities, export market development and skills improvement in the workforce.

When businesses invest in these areas there are wider benefits to the country as a whole.

The government already provides support for this type of investment by means of various grant programmes, and thinks it worth considering the provision of further support by way of tax concessions.

Businesses invest in R & D to improve their products and processes, and that contributes to productivity and competitiveness.

At present, many businesses under-invest in R & D because they do not capture all the benefits.

R & D tax credits should help to resolve the problem of under-investment in this area.

Tax credits for export market development are another possibility.

They could be a solution to businesses under-investing in developing new markets, which has wider implications for other businesses and for the economy as a whole.

Similarly, raising skill levels should also help to increase productivity.

Employers may be reluctant, at present, to spend more on developing the skills of their employees because they are easily lost to the business when employees change jobs, though the skills are not necessarily lost to New Zealand.

Tax credits for skills enhancement should help to reduce under-investment in skills development as well.

Also on the list of possibilities are adjustments to the depreciation tax rules.

Accelerated depreciation would reduce the cost of investing in assets, which would encourage more businesses to upgrade their plant and equipment.

Using more efficient plant and equipment can make labour more productive and so increase economic output.

The discussion document also outlines further compliance cost reduction measures aimed at raising productivity and improving competitiveness.

The rationale is that the less time and money businesses have to spend on complying with their tax requirements the more they have to expand and invest.

The release of the discussion document is the first step in engaging with business and with the public on how the tax system can contribute most effectively to improving productivity and our ability to compete internationally.

It seeks your views on the possible options, asking you to rank them in order of preference, and welcomes your alternative suggestions.

The significance of this Review should not be under-estimated.

It is the first major look at our business tax system since 1988.

The total cost of the suite of measures outlined in the discussion document is in the order of $2 billion – heading towards $3 billion if consequential adjustments are factored in.

While we will not be able to implement all the proposed measures, the outcome will nevertheless be one of significant change.

That is why we are seeking your input now.

I urge you to take part in the process. Submissions close on 8 September.

Once we have received and analysed your feedback, we will decide on the matters raised in the review and in the feed-back, probably early next year.

I anticipate introducing legislation in May 2007, so that resulting changes can come into force on 1 April 2008.

Thank you.

KiwiSaver, tax changes announced
================================

The government today announced changes to the proposed KiwiSaver work-based savings scheme and to associated tax rules, to increase the scheme's appeal to employers and workers. Employer contributions will be exempt from SSCWT up to 4% of an employee's gross salary or wages, and part of a saver's contribution can go towards paying off a home mortgage. The start date of KiwiSaver will be delayed from 1 April 2007 to 1 July 2007. For more information see the [media release](/news/2006/2006-08-24-kiwisaver-tax-changes-announced#statement)
 and [www.treasury.govt.nz/kiwisaver](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/topics/kiwisaver)
.

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Finance

MEDIA STATEMENT

### KiwiSaver enhanced to benefit workers & employers

Changes to KiwiSaver are designed to make the scheme even more attractive for workers and employers, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"KiwiSaver aims to improve the long term savings habits of New Zealanders and builds on our efforts to better prepare the country for the challenges of an ageing population.

"The changes to the bill I am announcing today and the other measures recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee will make it easier for hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders to embrace KiwiSaver as a first step to securing their financial futures."

The changes are:

*   employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes will be exempt from tax (SSCWT – specified superannuation contribution withholding tax), subject to a cap of the lesser of the employee's contribution or 4 per cent of their gross salary or wages.
*   a delay in the starting date from 1 April 2007 to 1 July 2007.
*   mortgage diversion: part of a person's KiwiSaver contribution can go towards paying off the mortgage on their home. The rest of the contribution goes into their KiwiSaver account (based on a United Future proposal).

Changes to KiwiSaver recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee include:

*   allowing the 4 per cent minimum contribution to be made up of both an employee's and their employer's contribution.
*   lengthening the time allowed for opting out from 2-6 weeks to 2-8 weeks, with deductions starting immediately
*   improving the criteria for current employer superannuation schemes to be exempted from KiwiSaver's automatic enrolment provisions.

KiwiSaver is a voluntary scheme where employees elect to contribute 4 or 8 per cent of their gross salary. They will be automatically enrolled and will have eight weeks to opt out. To kick start the scheme the government is providing a $1000 contribution and paying some scheme fees in order to improve the returns for savers.

"We are making it easy for people to save for their retirement by building up financial assets through KiwiSaver and by helping them buy a home. The government is providing up to $5000 for each KiwiSaver wanting to buy their first home.

"We are also designing a scheme that can be easily supported by employers," said Dr Cullen. "The changes and new measures will ease the transition to KiwiSaver and ensure costs and compliance are kept to a minimum.

"I am also hopeful employers will now see KiwiSaver as a valuable way of contributing to the long term financial well being of their workers. By making employer contributions tax free, we are making it even more attractive for workers to save as their balances will grow much quicker with an employer subsidy.

"We are giving employers more choices when it comes to remunerating their workers. By allowing an employer contribution to count towards the minimum contribution we are also making it easier for workers, who may struggle to contribute 4 per cent, to join KiwiSaver.

"I hope employers will now see the benefits of KiwiSaver. Helping their workers to save will improve job satisfaction, loyalty and retention so it's a win-win for workers and employers," said Dr Cullen.

"I commend Fletcher Building for being the first employer to offer a subsidised KiwiSaver workplace-based scheme for some of its workers and I hope many more follow its example. (Fletcher Building is providing a conditional 2 per cent contribution as part of KiwiSaver).

Dr Cullen said delaying the start of KiwiSaver would give providers more time to get their KiwiSaver products ready, responding to concerns voiced at select committee hearings.

"It is also being recommended that tax changes to portfolio investments also be delayed to 1 October 2007. These important changes allow investors' earnings to be taxed at their individual rates and are designed to ensure KiwiSavers and other investors are not disadvantaged compared to direct investors. The delay will give providers more to time to prepare.

"I am grateful for the work of the select committee in ensuring KiwiSaver will be a hugely beneficial savings vehicle. I also thank United Future's Gordon Copeland for his valuable contribution over the mortgage diversion addition to the scheme.

"The changes recommended by the select committee and the other measures we are taking will further enhance a scheme that has already been praised by leading pension experts overseas and the Economist magazine. Britain's independent Pensions Commission has also hailed automatic enrolment as a feature that country should adopt.

Dr Cullen also unveiled the KiwiSaver logo. "The elongated Kiwi beak is a fitting symbol as KiwiSaver is all about looking more confidently to the future.

"KiwiSaver will give New Zealanders more choices for securing their financial futures. It is essential New Zealanders develop better long-term savings habits so they can look forward with more confidence to a retirement that meets their aspirations."

SPEECH

### Ernst and Young Tax Conference

### Hotel Inter-Continental, Wellington

Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today on the Business Tax Review and other tax policy matters that I think should be raised.

The confidence and supply agreement signed between United Future and Labour resulted in the addition of three important items to the government's tax policy work programme. They were:

*   the preparation and release of a government discussion paper on the merits of income splitting for families;
*   introduction of a new regime for the tax treatment of charities and charitable donations; and
*   the Business Tax Review.

Chief of these was the Business Tax Review. The stated purpose of the Review was to ensure the tax system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

In the course of the post-election negotiations, we laid particular emphasis on business tax reform because of what we regarded as the more pressing need – especially since the advent of Working for Families. That package has enhanced the financial situation of nearly 350,000 New Zealand families.

The discussion document was released a month ago, the culmination of several months' work in considering a wide range of possibilities, including many practices from other countries, for changes to the New Zealand tax system.

It describes a range of possible business tax initiatives that will help to increase productivity and boost New Zealand's international competitiveness. It also seeks the public's views on other ideas that should be considered.

New Zealand's wage rates currently lag behind those in many OECD countries including Australia. The only way that New Zealand can obtain a sustained growth in wage rates is for labour to become more productive. Greater labour productivity means that the same amount of labour will provide more GDP.

Labour productivity can be increased in a number of ways. A forestry worker with an axe is less productive than a worker with a chainsaw. Increased investment in plant, equipment and buildings can boost productivity.

Similarly, a better-educated workforce or more innovative technologies will boost labour productivity. A critical issue for the government is whether there are ways that New Zealand's tax system impedes growth in labour productivity.

It is also important that New Zealand's capital ends up going to those firms which will use it to generate the best returns for New Zealand as a whole.

Other things being equal, a broad income base and low tax rates encourage capital being acquired by firms that will use it most productively.

If, however, firms cannot capture all of the benefits of their investment, they may undertake too little investment from the point of view of New Zealand as a whole. In this case, there may be grounds for providing tax incentives to encourage more productive investment from the point of view of New Zealand as a whole.

Our tax system also needs to be internationally competitive, especially in relation to Australia's. There are many ways in which our tax system is better for business than the Australian tax system is. For example, New Zealand does not have Australia's general capital gains tax, payroll taxes or stamp duties. However, we currently have a higher statutory company rate of 33 percent compared with Australia's rate of 30 percent.

In a fundamental review of business taxation, there are many different changes that could conceivably boost productivity and competitiveness.

One option that was considered but rejected was that of deep company rate cuts. That option has a number of potential problems that are described in more detail in the discussion document.

Deep company tax rate cuts have attractions as a means of enhancing productivity and competitiveness. However, they can also be very expensive and, if implemented, would require a major replacement source of revenue if New Zealand is to be able to continue to maintain its current level of government services.

Deep company tax rate cuts would also widen the gap between personal and company tax rates, which would increase the benefits of people using companies to shelter income from higher personal tax rates.

The fact that New Zealand has a full imputation system means that deep company rate cuts would provide a permanent benefit to non-resident and non-taxpayer shareholders, but only a timing benefit to domestic taxpayers. They would also be of benefit only to businesses operating as companies.

There was also the question of a replacement source of revenue. We considered a payroll tax as a possible candidate. In principle, a payroll tax on all employers as well as the income of the self-employed may be a relatively neutral form of tax for funding deep company rate cuts.

It would be costly, however, for smaller firms to comply with such a tax. Excluding the self-employed and providing thresholds for smaller firms would reduce compliance costs. At the same time, it would require a higher rate on taxpaying firms, which would bias labour into non-taxed firms. This would not promote labour productivity. In the end, we decided that this was an unattractive direction for us to pursue.

These, then, are some the considerations that have led to the range of possible options outlined in the discussion document.

Obviously, tax policy by itself cannot build a high wage, high skill, knowledge-based economy. But what it can do is to remove tax obstacles to achieving that, and ensure that our business tax rules support innovation, business investment and the development of a highly skilled workforce, and that they encourage exporters to break into new markets.

The discussion document suggests a range of tax options for doing just that.

It also invites further suggestions on other options that meet the objectives of the Review. It would not be possible to progress the full range of options, so informed trade-offs will need to be made. One of the aims for the discussion document is to generate an informed debate and feedback on the relative merits of the different options.

The first option described in the discussion document is reducing the company tax rate from 33 percent to 30 percent, which would align it with Australia's corporate tax rate. That would have an estimated cost of $540 million a year.

Reducing the company tax rate to 30 percent would raise our productivity and growth in a number of ways.

It would boost the competitiveness of New Zealand-based companies, and encourage inbound investment by firms that had decided to move to New Zealand. In turn, that would tend to increase our stock of plant, equipment and building, which would boost labour productivity and wage rates.

On the other hand, there are disadvantages to reducing the company tax rate by itself, and they have to be weighed against the benefits of doing so.

The disadvantages include the problems arising from widening the gap between the company tax rate and the top personal tax rate, and between the company tax rate and the 33 percent tax rate for trusts.

As the discussion document points out, the current gap provides incentives for companies and trusts to be used to shelter income from higher personal tax rates. Therefore reducing it would increase those incentives.

Clearly, reducing the company tax rate has implications for personal taxation, which is acknowledged in the discussion document.

We are moving one step at a time, however. The emphasis in the Review is on business tax because this is the most pressing need, and because business tax reforms are more complex and therefore take more time to design and develop.

Once we have made decisions on the matters raised in the Review, we will look at the wider implications in other areas of the tax system. Decisions on personal taxation will be made within the fiscal confines at that time.

The discussion document also suggests a number of tax base initiatives that would improve productivity, business investment and competitiveness.

It raises the possibility of introducing targeted tax credits for R & D activities, export market development and skills improvement in the workforce. When businesses invest in these areas there are wider benefits to the country as a whole.

The government already provides support for this type of investment by means of various grant programmes, and thinks it worth considering the provision of further support by way of tax concessions.

Businesses invest in R & D to improve their products and processes, and that contributes to productivity and competitiveness. At present, many businesses under-invest in R & D because they do not capture all the benefits. R & D tax credits should help to resolve the problem of under-investment in this area.

Tax credits for export market development are another possibility. They could be a solution to businesses under-investing in developing new markets, which has wider implications for other businesses and for the economy as a whole.

Similarly, raising skill levels should also help to increase productivity. Employers may be reluctant, at present, to spend more on developing the skills of their employees because they are easily lost to the business when employees change jobs, though the skills are not necessarily lost to New Zealand.

Tax credits for skills enhancement should help to reduce under-investment in skills development as well.

Also on the list of possibilities are adjustments to the depreciation tax rules. Accelerated depreciation would reduce the cost of investing in assets, which would encourage more businesses to upgrade their plant and equipment. Using more efficient plant and equipment can make labour more productive and so increase economic output.

The discussion document also outlines further compliance cost reduction measures aimed at raising productivity and improving competitiveness. The rationale is that the less time and money businesses have to spend on complying with their tax requirements the more they have to expand and invest.

The release of the discussion document is the first step in engaging with business and with the public on how the tax system can contribute most effectively to improving productivity and our ability to compete internationally.

It seeks your views on the possible options, asking you to rank them in order of preference, and welcomes your alternative suggestions. I urge you to take part in the process.

Submissions close on 8 September and – owing to time constraints – any submissions received after the closing date are unlikely to be considered. I'm told that several submissions have already been received.

Once we have received and analysed your feedback, we will decide on the matters raised in the review and in the feedback, probably early next year. I anticipate introducing legislation in May 2007, so that resulting changes can come into force on 1 April 2008.

To turn briefly to other matters, the taxation bill currently before Parliament has attracted over 3000 submissions, I'm told, which must be a record for a taxation bill.

Many of the submissions relate to the proposed reform of the tax treatment of income from different types of share investments.

The current rules contain many anomalies that must be addressed – for example, taxing income earned in some countries more favourably than in other countries, and taxing income earned by individuals more favourably than income earned through managed funds.

Obviously, the most controversial aspect of the Bill is the proposed change to the tax treatment of investments into grey-list countries in particular, which has raised the spectre of an effective capital gains tax on unrealised gains.

The select committee will undoubtedly focus a fair amount of its attention on this issue, and whether there are other ways to address the anomalies I have referred to, bearing in mind that both United Future and the government have ruled out moving to a comprehensive capital gains tax.

One-half of the reform, the portfolio investment entity rules, removes the disadvantages facing people who invest through managed funds, which is especially pertinent to KiwiSaver.

As you may know, the Finance and Expenditure Committee has reported back to Parliament on the KiwiSaver Bill, recommending that the start-up date of the scheme be delayed for three months.

It is therefore desirable to delay the implementation date of the portfolio entity rules, to fit in with the timing of KiwiSaver, since the two are closely linked. I'll be making an announcement to this effect shortly.

The Finance and Expenditure Committee will be hearing oral submissions on the bill over the next few weeks.

I think it likely that the select committee will recommend some changes to the proposed legislation because, in my experience, taxation bills nearly always change as a result of select committee scrutiny. I await the committee's report with interest.

As the Minister of Finance and I announced last week, the government is to carry out a comprehensive review of the life insurance tax rules.

The review has been welcomed by the life insurance industry, which over the years has raised a number of anomalies in the tax rules. The rules date back to 1990, though in the ensuing sixteen years there have been a number of changes in the commercial, regulatory and saving environment – which probably means that the rules need to be updated.

Although the scope of the review is to be established in consultation with the industry, it is certain to consider the question of whether life insurance should be included within the scope of the proposed rules for taxing portfolio investment entities.

Not to include life insurance would be to disadvantage it relative to other savings vehicles. And life insurance constitutes a major sector of the savings industry, with life funds under management totalling about $9 billion. To put that figure into perspective, unit trust assets total about $18 billion, superannuation assets nearly $20 billion, and those of other funds close to $14 billion.

The aim of the review is to create a robust and flexible environment that is favourable to all – policyholders, life insurers and government alike. It is not possible at this stage to determine the fiscal impact of the review, though integrating life insurance within the portfolio investment entity rules would likely reduce the amount of tax being raised from life insurance in the short term.

Life insurance is a technically complex area and so, for purposes of consultation, policy officials will be releasing a series of targeted, technical issues papers for comment by the industry and stakeholders.

As many of the issues to be discussed have already been raised by the industry, it is reasonable to expect a vigorous and constructive response.

The Business Tax Review discussion document mentioned our intention to release a discussion document on international tax by the end of this year.

The re examination of our international tax rules will be based on several objectives familiar from the Business Tax Review. They are:

*   improving the productivity and competitiveness of New Zealand businesses;
*   progressing economic transformation, which includes promoting a vibrant export sector and globally competitive businesses;
*   upholding the tax policy principles of fairness, efficiency, simplicity and integrity; and
*   ensuring consistency between tax policy and other government initiatives.

In practice, that means the main focus of the review is the taxation of outbound, non-portfolio investment. In particular, the government is committed to taking a fresh look at whether we should continue with our current controlled foreign company rules.

The review will canvass options for changing those rules, as well as any associated changes to the conduit and thin capitalisation rules that might stem from the adoption of those options for reform.

As far as inbound investment is concerned, the government plans to look at whether any adjustments should be made to New Zealand's longstanding treaty policy on non-resident withholding tax rates on dividends, interest and royalties.

This is a question that needs to be resolved before any renegotiation of the Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement occurs.

It is important to note, however, and this is an important point, that decisions to reduce treaty rates are critical ones because, once implemented through a treaty, they cannot be increased by any government unilaterally without terminating or renegotiating that treaty.

So, including the Business Tax Review, changes to the investment rules and the international tax review, there is a very full tax reform agenda.

I believe that a critical part of good tax reform in New Zealand is the open consultation process, and I value your contribution to these issues.

I wish you the very best for the remainder of your conference.

Change to offshore tax proposals
================================

The government has proposed a "fair dividend rate" approach to calculating tax on income from offshore shares, to replace the method proposed in the taxation bill currently before Parliament. It would tax individual investors on a maximum of 5% of the market value of their offshore shares at the beginning of the year, with returns of less than 5% attracting proportionately less tax. No tax would be payable when losses are made. For more information see the [media statement](/news/2006/2006-09-15-change-offshore-tax-proposals#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax compromise on offshore investment issue

Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne have today unveiled a proposed way forward on offshore investment tax changes.

The changes are part of the tax bill now before the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee.

"Like the committee, we have both received considerable correspondence on this issue. We will be writing to the committee outlining a suggested solution that builds on alternatives raised in submissions. We are proposing to apply a "fair dividend rate" to calculate tax earned on overseas shares," said the Ministers.

"This would tax individuals on a maximum of 5 per cent of the value of their offshore shares in a given year. However, unlike the proposal in the bill, where their shares have made a gain in excess of 5 per cent, there would be no amount to carry forward as an excess gain (to be taxed in a later year). The fair dividend rate approach would not target capital gains, but rather something approximating a reasonable dividend yield.

"Individual investors would be able to pay tax on a fair rate lower than 5 per cent if they can show that their offshore portfolio share investments made a return of less than 5 per cent. Where an individual investor's shares make a negative return, no tax would be payable.

"Any dividends derived would be counted for the purposes of calculating the investor's overall return. However, the maximum amount taxable in a year would be limited to 5 per cent of the opening value of an investor's shares (including situations where a dividend in excess of 5 per cent has been derived).

"Our intention all along has been to ensure greater fairness in the taxing of overseas investment income. The current rules create unfair tax advantages for direct investors over other savers, such as ordinary lower and middle-income people, who use managed funds that are taxed on the funds' earnings.

"We want to eliminate the tax advantages some investors have enjoyed for many years. A number of offshore investment vehicles pay no or very low dividends so that their investors avoid paying tax. They should be paying their fair share of tax. That is only reasonable if all of us are to fairly share the cost of providing hospitals, schools, roads and other government services.

"We also want to encourage greater diversification so investment decisions are driven by returns, not tax advantages. The new rules try to put all those investing outside New Zealand and Australia – individuals and managed funds – on a similar footing. The tax changes we are suggesting preserve these aims.

"It is important to remember too that this is not a tax grab. The government is lowering the tax burden on many lower income savers and eliminating taxation of capital gains on New Zealand and Australian equities for savers using managed funds. All up the government will be foregoing around $140 million a year in revenue to ensure greater fairness. We believe this is a price worth paying to remove distortions in investment markets.

"We have certainly listened to the concerns of the many submitters and are pleased there is an emerging consensus around the fair dividend rate as a way forward.

"We hope the select committee will now work with this proposal as a basis for ensuring fairness in the tax treatment of investment income."

### Questions and answers

**How would the fair dividend rate work?**

Individuals would apply the "fair dividend rate" based on the market value of shares held at the start of the year. That is, if an investor holds $100,000 of offshore shares at the start of the year, their taxable income would be $5,000 (unless they are able to show that their investment has returned less than 5 per cent or has made a negative return).

**Examples**

_Where an individual makes a total return of more than 5 per cent_

John holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year. These shares are worth $115,000 at the end of the year. John also derives a $10,000 dividend.

Under the fair dividend rate approach, John would either pay tax on 5 per cent of $100,000 or a lower amount if his return for the year is less than 5 per cent. No tax would be payable if he made a negative return.

John's total return for the year is the $15,000 capital gain on his shares and the dividend of $10,000. His total return is therefore $25,000. However, his taxable income for the year would be limited to 5 per cent of the opening value of his shares. This would result in taxable income of $5,000. (Note: under the fair dividend rate method dividends would not be separately taxed)

_Where an individual makes a total return of less than 5 per cent_

Mary also holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year. These shares increase in value to $102,000 at the end of the year. Mary also receives a $1,000 dividend.

As in the previous example, Mary would pay tax on 5 per cent of $100,000 (her opening value) unless she can show that she made a return of less than this.

Mary's total return for the year is $3,000 (comprised of a capital gain of $2,000 and a dividend of $1,000), which is less than 5 per cent of her opening value of $100,000. Therefore, Mary would only be taxable on $3,000.

_Where an individual makes a negative return_

Judy holds offshore shares that have a market value of $100,000 at the start of the year, which decrease in value to $75,000 at the end of the year. She also receives a $10,000 dividend.

As in the previous examples, Judy would be taxable on 5 per cent of the opening value of her shares unless she can show that her total return for the year is less than 5 per cent.

Judy's total return for the year comprises a capital loss of $25,000 and the dividend of $10,000. Her net return is therefore a loss of $15,000. Because Judy has made a negative return on her offshore shares, no tax would be payable under the fair dividend rate approach.

**Why set a 5 per cent rate?**

This represents a realistic rate based on historical returns on equity investments. These have averaged around 8 per cent over the latter half of the last century.

**Isn't this still a capital gains tax?**

This is not a tax on capital gains. A capital gains tax taxes the difference between the purchase and sale price of an investment. The proposal does not do this. Instead it is designed to tax income derived from investment. In New Zealand we tax income from investments by taxing the dividends. A number of offshore investment vehicles pay no or very low dividends so that their investors avoid paying tax. This creates unfairness and gives these companies a tax advantage over New Zealand companies and their investors.

Indeed the proposal also removes the existing capital gains tax on investments into non-grey list countries. Currently they are subject to 100 per cent taxation of capital gains. Under this proposal they will be taxed on a reasonable dividend rate instead of capital gains.

**Why not allow losses to be claimed against income?**

The method does not target capital gains; therefore capital losses should not be allowed as a deduction.

**What happens to the GPG exemption?**

There are a number of details the committee will have to decide on, including this.

**Will the $50,000 threshold still apply for individuals?**

We are not proposing to change this.

**How much will this cost the government compared to the last proposal?**

IRD estimates the fair dividend rate approach will mean the government gains $30 million a year less than under the current proposals. The current proposals will cost the government $110 million a year in foregone revenue. If adopted, the new proposals will cost $140 million a year.

**How would the fair dividend rate apply to managed funds?**

In order for managed funds to apply the new rules simply it is necessary that they know what the fair rate of return is at the beginning of a period. Therefore, managed funds could use a version of the fair dividend rate method that would tax 5 per cent of the value of their offshore portfolio share investments each year. There would be no variation to this rate, to provide certainty, and also to limit the potential fiscal cost.

Minister of Revenue

SPEECH

### Speech to ASFONZ National Conference, Sky City convention centre

I'm very pleased to have been invited to speak to your conference today on the tax side of a number of issues affecting the superannuation fund industry.

The title of this section of the conference, I see, is "Tax – it never sleeps", a sentiment with which many of us here today undoubtedly agree.

To extend the metaphor, I think it's fair to say this has been a particularly wakeful year for tax policy in relation to savings, investment and superannuation.

The tax treatment of savings and investment income is of vital importance to the success of plans to increase the overall rate of domestic savings and encourage people to save for retirement.

I think we all agree with those objectives, which underlie many of the changes that are affecting your industry – whether through the recently enacted KiwiSaver scheme or through the taxation bill currently before Parliament.

It is essential to achieve an even-handed tax treatment of income from the various ways of saving and investing, so that tax is not the deciding factor in making decisions about how to save or invest.

Several people have already spoken at this conference on the merits of the recently enacted KiwiSaver scheme, which I think can be regarded as the flagship of the savings reform.

KiwiSaver has the potential to improve New Zealanders' long-term saving habits and improve their financial security in retirement.

One of its main attractions is that it will make saving easier by making it necessary for new employees to opt out rather than opt in. Saving becomes easier when it is the "default option".

By making employer contributions to KiwiSaver tax-free up to a certain amount we are also making it more attractive to employees – and to their employers.

The proposed tax rules on portfolio investment entities – or PIEs – in the taxation bill currently before Parliament are driven by the desire to remove tax biases, as far as possible, from investment decisions.

That bill attempts to put the tax treatment of different types of share investment on an equal footing, introducing greater fairness and reducing distortions in investment decisions.

Once enacted, the new legislation will remove several tax disadvantages that discourage saving through funds.

The new tax rules will have the potential to change the landscape significantly for managed funds in New Zealand.

A portfolio investment entity will, in many situations, become the favoured vehicle for people to invest through.

Ideally, this brave new world would be achieved with a minimum of complexity.

However, as always, there are a number of constraints that we have had to work with when designing the PIE tax rules. They include:

*   How to tax savers at their correct tax rate while not requiring investors to file tax returns.
*   How to deal with savers who leave the fund part-way through the year.
*   And how to define accurately what a managed fund is.

While these constraints have inevitably resulted in complex rules, I hope that various types of managed funds – from unit trusts to employer-based superannuation schemes – will be able to use the PIE tax rules and, indeed, will want to use them.

The key to achieving that is to ensure there is sufficient flexibility for different types of funds to calculate their tax under the PIE rules.

In other words, the rules should recognise that the way a unit trust will want to calculate its PIE tax is likely to be different from the way a non-unitised, employer-based superannuation scheme will want to do it.

I am very hopeful that the final form of the PIE rules that are passed by Parliament will provide this flexibility.

I also am very aware of the pressure that the savings industry is under in gearing up for all the changes.

You are being asked to change your systems in a very short period of time. Indeed, sometimes you may have to start work before there is absolute certainty on what the final rules will look like.

This is clearly not ideal. It has been caused by a number of things – including an ambitious timeline and enormous focus having been put on the controversial changes to the proposed offshore tax rules.

The delayed implementation of the PIE rules until 1 October is in recognition of this time pressure and, while the deadline is still tight, I hope it will make application of the new PIE tax rules possible.

The Minister of Finance and I announced last month that we were writing to the chairman of the Finance and Expenditure Committee outlining a suggested solution to problems raised in submissions on the offshore investment tax changes proposed in the bill.

In response to concerns, we have suggested a "fair dividend rate" approach to calculating tax on income from offshore shares, to replace the method proposed in the bill.

It would tax individual investors on a maximum of 5 percent of the market value of their offshore shares at the beginning of the year, with returns of less than 5 percent attracting proportionately less tax.

The fair dividend rate approach would not target capital gains but, rather, something approximating a reasonable dividend yield.

We believe the 5 percent rate, though higher than some have suggested, is a realistic rate based on historic returns on equity investments – offshore shares having yielded in excess of 9 percent, on average, over the last 20 years.

The basis of our decision to suggest adoption of the fair dividend rate is as follows.

The tax rate on income from offshore shares earned by managed funds on behalf of their 39 percent rate investors is capped at 33 percent. In contrast, income from offshore shares earned by individuals investing directly in them is not capped at 33 percent and can be subject to a 39 percent tax rate.

Some people have also conveniently forgotten that the cornerstone of the investment tax proposals is that low-income earners will now be taxed at their personal marginal tax rate, making an investment in a managed fund unambiguously more attractive.

Managed funds also have a complete exemption from income tax on their Australasian share gains, regardless of how often they trade. Individuals who regularly trade in Australasian shares will be deemed to be traders and taxed on all their share gains.

Funds have an additional advantage over individuals in that the proposed exemption from SSCWT for employer contributions to KiwiSaver funds would make investing in funds particularly attractive.

There is no equivalent tax concession for individuals who invest directly.

Overall, the funds' tax position will be highly competitive with other ways of investing that are available to individuals.

The whole issue of the fair dividend rate is likely to be a key one for the Finance and Expenditure Committee and one that the Committee will no doubt consider carefully.

What happens to the proposed legislation at this stage is in the hands of the Committee, and not up to Ministers.

We of course would like to see as much consultation as possible on suggested changes to the proposals in the bill – keeping in mind however, the constraints imposed by the need for the bill to be reported back to Parliament by 24 November, without leave of the House to report later, and for the legislation to be enacted by 1 April next year.

To conclude my remarks today, we are working hard to achieve flexibility and neutrality in the tax treatment of investment income.

I am sympathetic to the pressures your industry faces in preparation for the implementation of the PIE rules, and we are also working hard to make the transition as smooth as possible.

There will be criticisms of details of the package, yes, and some later fine-tuning will probably be required.

It is very important, however, not to lose sight of the larger picture and the aims of the wider tax reforms – which include achieving a reasonable balance in taxing income from different types of investment, so that tax is not the deciding factor in how New Zealanders choose to save.

SPEECH

### New Zealand superannuation: building for the future

_Speech to the National Conference of the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand, Sky City Convention Centre, Auckland_

_Delivered on behalf of Dr Cullen by Hon Clayton Cosgrove, Associate Minister of Finance_

It is a pleasure to be here this morning. I convey greetings from Dr Cullen who apologises for not being able to speak to you on account of a busy schedule back in Wellington. Politics, as you know, is an unpredictable business. I suppose it is a bit like your industry – we are all planning for the future, but just as your days can be easily upset by the vagaries of the sharemarket, Cabinet Ministers must deal with the unpredictable machinations of government.

However, Dr Cullen's door is always open to the association and I know you have met recently. He is certainly keen to convey his thoughts on superannuation today as it has been an issue close to his heart for the seven years he has been Finance Minister. In fact, he has actually been the Labour spokesman on superannuation since the late 1980s.

This year in particular marks significant progress in helping New Zealanders to embrace a savings culture. The passing into law of the KiwiSaver Bill in late August is the final plank in our strategy of building a framework to provide greater financial security for all New Zealanders.

It is an issue that has been a high priority for the Labour-led government. Indeed your industry is often peppered with discussion around savings vehicles. If you will allow me a little licence, can I say this government has engineered a stylish savings vehicle with enough grunt under the bonnet to make a real difference to the journey during the bumpy decades ahead as a greater proportion of our population reaches retirement age.

The first move on the super sedan assembly line in 2000 was to reverse National's cuts and restore the floor to National Super to 65 per cent of the average ordinary time weekly wage. In line with our support agreement with New Zealand First this has risen to 66 per cent. I like to think of this as the robust chassis of the savings sedan.

Building on that, we established the New Zealand Superannuation Fund to pre-fund the future cost of National Super – a fine piece of engineering, the solid suspension if you like that will help cushion future governments from the potholes ahead.

The State Sector Retirement Savings Scheme with its employer subsidy is perhaps one of the beautifully upholstered passenger seats – much admired by those outside the state sector as the kind of comfort they would like to travel in.

Finally, there is KiwiSaver – shall we say this is the shiny exterior whose elegant styling we hope will lure many working New Zealanders to start making down payments next year so their travels in their retirement years can be as comfortable as possible.

And of course I like to think of the addition of a tax exemption for employer contributions to KiwiSaver as a kind of fifth gear, giving the savings machine a little more pep.

Dr Cullen has just returned from three weeks overseas, including several days in London and wants to share some of his experiences with you this morning. The UK is a few years behind New Zealand, but a White Paper was released earlier this year on a proposed savings scheme not dissimilar to KiwiSaver. While in London, he met with representatives from a range of relevant pensions agencies to discuss and was struck by two differences in approach:

*   First, the proposed scheme has a contribution rate of 8 per cent, including a 3 per cent compulsory employer contribution – a sixth gear, if you will. Interestingly, there hasn't been the outcry by UK businesses that I'm sure would have ensued had we proposed something similar in New Zealand. So when we talk about developing a savings culture that probably applies to employers as well as employees, but without the element of compulsion.
*   And second, there is discussion about whether the scheme would be provided by any savings provider, as in KiwiSaver, or by a single monopoly provider. On this point, we think we've got it right: New Zealand has a number of good savings providers, many of whom are present here today and there seems little reason to construct a bypass round the healthy existing market.

The last few weeks have certainly given us plenty of reminders about the critical importance of fostering a savings culture.

The Reserve Bank's recent research paper entitled "Household Savings and Wealth in New Zealand" was a sobering insight into the problem. It found that the household savings rate has declined sharply in the last thirty years. Savings as a percentage of household income has fallen from 3.6 per cent in the 1970s to minus 14.8 per cent in 2005. Consuming more than you earn is of course no recipe for long term financial security.

While undoubtedly there are problems in measuring savings and household income, the Reserve Bank found evidence that the sharp rise in household net worth in recent years triggered largely by the housing boom may be aggravating the problem.

For one, households may see this increase in wealth as a given so reduce savings even though we know house prices can fall. The wealth effect has also encouraged households to borrow more. The bank estimates this draw down in household equity may have totalled about $7 billion over the past four years. A significant proportion of this has most likely been spent. In a nutshell the report finds New Zealanders rely too heavily on capital appreciation to accumulate wealth. That's why this government through its savings policies has been trying to encourage a more diversified strategy.

The recent current account figures certainly underscore the problem. We are spending well beyond our means with the annual deficit now totalling $15.2 billion or an estimated 9.7 per cent of GDP. Rising interest rates and a slowing economy should hopefully put the brakes on the big increase in overseas borrowing that has financed the housing boom and other consumption. Indeed, a slight slowdown in consumption in the latest GDP figures and the prospect of exports picking up on the back of a lower dollar provide some scope for the deficit to narrow in the year ahead.

I note Standard & Poor's points out yet again that the government's strong fiscal position continues to mitigate against any damage to our credit rating from the deficit blow-out. The government has certainly tried to lead by example. We are one of just seven nations in the OECD to be a net saver thanks to our commitment to prudent fiscal management and the build-up of assets in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.

New Zealand is now recognised as one of the best prepared to deal with the fiscal challenges of an ageing population. That will increasingly become a source of competitive advantage for us as some of the world's large economies struggle with the economic, social and political consequences of demographic change.

The New Zealand Superannuation Fund has had another outstanding year.  
For the June financial year the fund earned a return of 19.2 per cent with funds under management climbing to $10.1 billion – it's a result many of you have no doubt noted.

The fund's expectation is to exceed the risk free rate of return (the return on Treasury bills) by at least 2.5 per cent over the long term. The risk free rate of return is currently 6.77 per cent so the result is excellent.

Indeed, the fund has performed extremely well since inception in 2003 with annual returns averaging 14.9 per cent. This is pleasing, as good returns will ease pressure on future governments to fund New Zealand Superannuation though I am mindful equity markets will not always treat the fund so kindly.

It is also heartening that over 33,000 civil servants are now members of the State Sector Retirement Savings Scheme, an increase of 17 per cent for the June year.  
I firmly believe the message is getting through that all of us - government, workers and employers - must do more to secure our futures.

I am hoping that KiwiSaver which is set to take flight from July next year will be just the catalyst for a significant change in savings habits.

The KiwiSaver Bill was reported back to Parliament with a number of improvements. These include:

*   allowing the 4 per cent minimum contribution to be made up of both an employee's and their employer's contribution;
*   lengthening the time allowed for opting out from 2-6 weeks to 2-8 weeks, with deductions starting immediately; and
*   exempting employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes from tax (that is, the specified superannuation contribution withholding tax), subject to a cap of the lesser of the employee's contribution or 4 per cent of their gross salary or wages.

There will also be a mortgage diversion option, whereby part of a person's KiwiSaver contribution can go towards paying off the mortgage on their home. The rest of the contribution goes into their KiwiSaver account.

This would be on top of the provisions in the legislation under which the government would provide up to $5000 for each KiwiSaver wanting to buy their first home.

We are recognising the reality that most New Zealanders see saving for their retirement as having two elements: the purchase of a freehold home and the building up of financial assets. KiwiSaver helps them do both.

The other changes reflect our desire to create a scheme that can be easily supported by employers. The changes and new measures will ease the transition to KiwiSaver and ensure costs and compliance are kept to a minimum.

I am very hopeful employers will now see KiwiSaver as a valuable way of contributing to the long term financial well being of their workers. By making employer contributions tax free, we are making it even more attractive for workers to save, as their balances will grow much quicker with an employer subsidy. We are giving employers more choices when it comes to remunerating their workers. By allowing an employer contribution to count towards the minimum contribution we are also making it easier for workers, who may struggle to contribute 4 per cent, to join KiwiSaver.

Employers who embrace this opportunity, I believe, will see greater job satisfaction, loyalty and retention. I am heartened that some of our toughest critics in the business world have applauded the changes to the scheme as a win win for workers and employers. Indeed, one of the country's biggest employers, Fletcher Building, announced before the latest changes that it would be introducing a KiwiSaver scheme for many of its workers, chipping in a 2 per cent contribution.

Even the DominionPost, no fan of this government, said the souped up scheme "delivers what the country needs".

Of course I am mindful that your association, while supporters of KiwiSaver in principle, have some concerns about the application of the SSCWT exemption. You believe there is a real risk some employer-subsidised schemes will be forced to wind up as members switch to KiwiSaver schemes.

I have asked officials to undertake further work on the consequences of extending SSCWT to other workplace-based schemes. Clearly, any extension will have a significant cost. That will have to be balanced against competing demands on the fiscal purse and the impact an extension would have in encouraging greater savings.

Any decision to extend the exemption would most likely be on the condition that those schemes meet the same criteria as KiwiSaver schemes, notably portability, full vesting and lock-in until retirement.

Aligned to KiwiSaver have been the changes to the tax treatment of investment income, an issue that sadly rarely seems to be out of the media spotlight. We had hoped the new fair dividend rate method proposed by Dr Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne that has been suggested to the finance and expenditure select committee would be a circuit breaker to the problem.

Our intention all along has been to ensure individuals who invest through managed funds are not disadvantaged compared to direct investors who have been able to be taxed at their marginal rate of income tax and who can exploit tax advantages in grey list countries.

What we are only requiring is that all investors pay their fair share of tax and that their investment decisions are driven by returns, not tax advantages. This is especially important if we are to encourage more hard working New Zealanders, particularly those on lower incomes, to put aside something each week for their futures by investing in KiwiSaver schemes.

However, I acknowledge, as you do too, that the fair dividend rate method is complex for managed funds. Some in the industry claim this will disadvantage funds compared to individuals who will have the advantage of a variable rate and pay no tax in years they make a loss. We are certainly aware of your concerns and the select committee is working on this. My colleague Peter Dunne will expand on the basis for our decisions on this later today and as this is Peter's bill I would be grateful if you could save any questions on this for him.

Getting the balance right in all of these decisions is never easy. Of course I note the National Party while critical of our moves, offers very few of its own solutions to these complex problems. It voted against KiwiSaver and only belatedly endorsed the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. Tax cuts seem to be its only real policy.

National exists in a dream world where multi-billion dollar tax cuts are the panacea for all our problems from economic growth to savings while painting this government as a tax grabbing ogre. However, I note that National on Friday appeared to be softening its position on tax and now talks about incremental tax reform, not big bang tax cuts. Dr Brash vaguely talks about not sacrificing "valuable public services" which sounds much like our policies. I am flattered.

Compared to National we have a rather more sophisticated suite of policies aimed at transforming this economy and of course we are not opposed to reducing the tax burden on individuals and businesses. Budget 2005 provided for over a billion dollars in tax cuts for businesses. Further, the investment tax changes amount to a $140 million annual tax cut and we are introducing significant tax cuts for employers under KiwiSaver – some $160 million a year when fully implemented. Why National voted against that cut is baffling when John Key has expressed admiration for the Singapore savings scheme which also has tax breaks.

We are determined to transform the economy by fostering a business environment that encourages greater investment in innovation and exporting. To that end the current review of business tax rules is likely to produce an attractive mix of a lower corporate tax rate and tax credits, particularly helping those businesses focused on tackling overseas markets. This may also have implications for personal tax rates.

However, everything comes with a price tag and a risk. Standard and Poor's constantly reminds us that any weakening in the government's fiscal position could endanger our credit rating. National's election bribe, big bang, tax cuts would have done just that. No wonder it has flip-flopped on this.

We must also balance significant claims on the fiscal purse from hospitals, schools and other sectors while also having to make major investments in transport and other infrastructure. Indeed, it is very difficult to get through the first section of the Herald without reading several new claims for more government spending before turning to the business section and getting hit with demands for more tax cuts.

As members of the savings industry you will appreciate the Labour-led government's determination to be careful managers of the Crown's bank balance.

We have got our finances in order so we can meet the challenges of an ageing population. We are putting aside considerable funds each year to take the pressure off future governments to fund national superannuation and we have put in place a structure through KiwiSaver to encourage the development of a long term savings culture.

We believe we have got the balance right by maintaining a stable fiscal platform to allow us to weather long term pressures while also putting in place economic policies today that ensure we can enjoy greater prosperity in the future.

Thank you.

Liberalisation of penalties proposed
====================================

A government discussion document released today proposes liberalising a range of tax penalties and associated legislation, to encourage voluntary compliance. Proposals include options for relaxing penalties in some circumstances; amending the rules relating to tax agents; and, in certain circumstances, not imposing penalties for lack of reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position on taxpayers who make a voluntary disclosure.

MEDIA RELEASE

### Liberalisation of tax penalties proposed

A discussion document released today by Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne proposes liberalising a range of tax penalties and associated legislation.

"The idea behind the proposed changes is to encourage voluntary compliance by having tax penalties that reflect the seriousness of the offence," Mr Dunne said.

"People comply with the law more willingly when they see it as reasonable, and see that compliance is the norm and non-compliance is punished.

"Tax penalties vary according to the level of offence. Those for having a tax shortfall, for example, can range from 20% for not taking reasonable care, to 150% for evasion.

"The discussion document examines the current rules on tax penalties and identifies several areas where the rules could be clearer, more consistent and better targeted at promoting voluntary compliance.

"It looks at options for relaxing penalties when people have genuinely tried to do the right thing but failed, while using the full force of the law on people who have made no attempt to comply.

"Given the importance of tax agents in upholding voluntary compliance, the discussion document proposes updating the definition of 'tax agent' to exclude people who do not meet defined standards of behaviour – such as those who have been convicted of a crime of dishonesty.

"As a result, Inland Revenue would be able to withhold recognition of someone as a tax agent if it considered that necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system. Such a measure would have benefits for both the tax administration and relevant professional associations, which have their own integrity standards.

"The discussion document argues for prescribing a limited number of circumstances when a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care is imposed on taxpayers who use a tax agent.

"The penalty for having an unacceptable tax position would apply only to income tax, thus excluding GST and withholding taxes from its scope.

"As an incentive to comply, the law would be amended to require Inland Revenue to alert late payers if it is their first offence, rather than automatically penalising them for being late.

"As a further incentive, shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position would not be imposed if the taxpayer concerned made a voluntary disclosure of the shortfall before being notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. That would have to occur within two years of the taxpayer taking the position.

"The shortfall penalty for underpayments of PAYE would be graduated for employers who filed an employer monthly schedule but did not pay the associated PAYE on time.

"Other proposed changes include replacing automatic default assessments with a potential $250 penalty on GST returns that are filed late, repeal of the threshold for having an abusive tax position, and a number of clarifications of the law.

"The major reform of the penalty rules in 1997 made them more consistent across all types of tax. Now the aim is to build on that reform, ensuring that we have penalties that match the seriousness of the offence," Mr Dunne said.

Tax incentives for charitable giving
====================================

A government discussion document released today canvasses views on possible tax incentives to encourage charitable giving of money, skills and time. It looks at increasing current rebates and deductions for donations, introducing a rebate in recognition of the value of volunteers' time, and the desirability of adopting tax incentives offered in the UK and Australia.

MEDIA RELEASE

### Further tax incentives for charitable giving proposed

A government discussion document released today outlines possible tax incentives to encourage charitable giving of money, skills and time.

The discussion document, released by Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne, results from the post-election confidence and supply agreement between United Future and the Labour-led government.

"New Zealanders are a generous people," Mr Dunne said. "An estimated 1.3 million people take part in voluntary activities, and donations last year to charities and other non-profit organisations amounted to at least $356 million – and that's just from the people who claimed tax rebates for their donations.

"In turn, the charitable, community and voluntary sectors make an invaluable contribution to New Zealand’s social, cultural, environmental and economic well-being," Mr Dunne said.

"The discussion document looks at ways of improving on existing tax incentives, which consist of a donation rebate for individuals and a tax deduction for company donations and Maori authority donations.

"One way of doing that is to increase rebates and deductions for donations made by individuals, companies and Maori authorities. At present, people can claim a rebate on donations of up to $1,890. Companies and Maori authorities can claim deductions for donations they make, although the deductions cannot exceed 5 percent of the net income of the company or Maori authority.

"Another way to improve incentives is to introduce tax relief for volunteers in the form of a modest tax rebate in recognition of the value of the time they give to charities registered with the Charities Commission.

"The discussion document also canvasses views on incentives employed in Australia and the United Kingdom, which include "workplace giving" in the form of payroll deductions, a system of private charitable trusts, and making non-cash donations tax deductible.

"It seeks the views of individuals and organisations on the merits of these and other possibilities, asking them to rank the measures in order of importance to them.

"To ensure we get as much feedback as possible, representatives from the charitable, community and voluntary sectors and policy officials will be holding public meetings in five centres - Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

"I urge all those who are interested to send in a submission by 28 November," Mr Dunne said.

EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 1 GST EXEMPT SUPPLY: SUPPLY OF ACCOMMODATION IN A DWELLING Please quote reference IS0049. This interpretation statement is broadly consistent with previous, similar, statements made by the Commissioner in respect of the supply of accommodation in a dwelling or in a commercial dwelling. However, all previous statements issued by the Commissioner relating to the matters covered should now be read subject to this interpretation statement. This interpretation statement concludes that, in general, a homestay will not usually be a commercial dwelling and the supply of accommodation will be an exempt supply. This conclusion modifies the applicability of the previous policy statement “Homestays—GST Treatment”, published in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 7, No. 13 (May 1996), that proceeds on the basis that taxpayers supplying accommodation in a homestay are making taxable supplies. Accordingly, the policy statement will apply only where it is established that a homestay is a commercial dwelling in accordance with this interpretation statement. The Commissioner’s statements in Public Information Bulletin 158 (November 1986, question 60), Public Information Bulletin 160 (March 1987, question 116) and Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 6, No. 3 (September 1994), being a Question We’ve Been Asked concerning GST and homestay businesses, are considered consistent with this interpretation statement. However, the Commissioner’s statement concerning the GST treatment of time-share apartments, in Public Information Bulletin 179 (May 1989), is potentially inconsistent with the conclusions reached in this interpretation statement in that it states that where a person “buys a time-share to rent out, that person is renting out a commercial dwelling which is similar in all respects to a motel”. It is recommended that any person relying on that statement in Public Information Bulletin 179 review their tax position in light of this interpretation statement. INTRODUCTION \[1\] All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GST Act”) unless otherwise stated. \[2\] Supplies of accommodation in any dwelling by way of hire, service occupancy agreement, or licence to occupy are exempt from GST under section 14(1)(c). Commercial dwellings are excluded from the definition of dwelling and thus supplies of accommodation in commercial dwellings are taxable, although there is a concessionary rate for certain supplies of accommodation exceeding 4 weeks. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 2 \[3\] This interpretation statement considers the application of the exemption from GST of the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. Some uncertainty exists as to the scope of both the definition of “dwelling” and the exclusion from that term of “commercial dwellings”. \[4\] First, the definition of “dwelling” is considered in some detail and the characteristics of a “dwelling” are identified. Secondly, the exclusion from the definition of “dwelling” of a “commercial dwelling” is considered. The definition of “commercial dwelling” is also considered in some detail and characteristics common to commercial dwellings are identified. In particular, factors relevant in determining whether an establishment is similar to any of the listed kinds of commercial dwelling are considered. Finally, this statement considers the impact of the conclusions reached on a number of common supplies of accommodation: holiday homes, homestays and farmstays, and serviced apartments. SUMMARY \[5\] The supply of accommodation in a dwelling by way of hire, service occupancy agreement, or licence to occupy is an exempt supply under section 14(1)(c). The focus of the exemption is on the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”. Characteristics of dwellings \[6\] The key characteristics of a dwelling are as follows. • A dwelling is defined broadly and with increasing degrees of generality: buildings, premises, structure, or other part thereof. • The definition is concerned with the functional aspects of the structure. Is the structure being predominantly used as a place for the supply of accommodation? • A dwelling is not limited to someone’s home. Rather, a dwelling need only be a building, premises, structure, or other place for humans to live or abide in. Typically (but not exclusively) a house is such a place. • The main function of the structure will be as a place of residence or abode. • The words “of any individual” in the definition do not imply that a particular individual must be housed in the premises. Use by any individual will suffice. • There is no requirement for any degree of permanency of occupation in order for particular premises to be held to be a residence or an abode. • The concern is with the function of the building, premises, structure, or place rather than with any person who may occupy it. The issue is whether the EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 3 main purpose or function of the structure in which accommodation is supplied is a place of residence or abode. • Actual use may have ceased or may not have commenced. Further, a break in the use or period of inactivity will not prevent premises from being a dwelling. • A commercial dwelling is excluded from the definition of “dwelling” so that the exemption in section 14(1)(c) does not apply to commercial dwellings. Characteristics of commercial dwellings \[7\] The definition of “commercial dwelling” in section 2 provides that the following are included within that term: (a) any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse; or (b) any camping ground; or (c) any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; or (d) any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition. \[8\] The listed commercial dwellings bear their ordinary meaning. However, to determine whether any establishment is similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a)–(c), and therefore falls within paragraph (d), the following questions should be asked. • Does the establishment have any of the characteristics possessed by the commercial dwellings listed in paragraphs (a)–(c)? • Does the establishment lack any characteristics which are fundamental to the nature of the relevant listed establishments? • Are any differences such that the establishment is different in kind, or are they differences which are little more than differences in degree? \[9\] Some common general characteristics of those types of “commercial dwelling” listed in paragraphs (a)–(c) are: • they are operated on a commercial basis, possessing the characteristics expected of a business supplying accommodation to the public, although they may be operated by a non-profit body; • they provide accommodation to a number of people simultaneously (i.e. multiple units, rooms, or beds are available); EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 4 • accommodation is generally provided by way of a licence to occupy, not by a tenancy; • a degree of control, is exercised by the owner/operator, generally varying with the level of service provided and the cost of the accommodation; • servicing of the units, rooms, or common areas is usually provided as an aspect of the supply; • the accommodation is furnished; • there may be communal facilities available for the use of all guests; • the guests are not part of the owner’s, or owner’s family’s, household during the stay; • the guests receive professional, formal, or commercial hospitality. \[10\] Some of the general differences between the listed kinds of establishments are the: • degree to which the accommodation is self-contained; • quality of furnishings provided; • extent of services provided; and • average duration of stays by guests. \[11\] These general characteristics are a useful starting point, but determining whether an establishment is similar to any of the listed kinds will be a question of fact and degree in any particular case. LEGISLATION \[12\] Section 8 charges GST on the supply (excluding exempt supplies) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1 st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. \[13\] To be a taxable activity, the essential requirements of section 6 include that an activity is carried on continuously or regularly, involving the supply of goods or services for a consideration (excluding making exempt supplies). Section 6(1)(a) and (3)(d) states: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 5 (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: ... (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person,— ... (d) Any activity to the extent to which the activity involves the making of exempt supplies. \[14\] Supplies of accommodation in any dwelling by way of hire, service occupancy agreement or licence to occupy are exempt from GST under section 14(1)(c): (1) The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: ... (c) The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of— (i) Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii) A licence to occupy: \[15\] Section 2(1) provides: In this Act, ... unless the context otherwise requires,— ... Dwelling means any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: ... Hire, in relation to goods, includes a letting on any terms, including a lease: ... Licence to occupy means the right to exclusive personal occupancy: ... Service occupancy agreement means a licence whereby a person occupies a dwelling for no consideration: \[16\] Commercial dwellings are excluded from the definition of dwelling, and so supplies of accommodation in commercial dwellings are taxable. Section 2(1) provides: In this Act, ... unless the context otherwise requires, - ... Commercial dwelling means— (a) Any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse; or (b) Any camping ground; or (c) Any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; or (d) Any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition;— but does not include— (e) A hospital except to the extent that that hospital is a residential establishment: (f) A dwelling situated within a retirement village or within a rest home, where the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy that dwelling: ... EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 6 Residential establishment means any commercial dwelling in which not less than 70 percent of the individuals to whom domestic goods and services are supplied reside, or are expected to reside, for a period of, or in excess of, 4 weeks; and also includes any hospital to the extent that it is used to provide domestic goods and services in a way similar to any such residential establishment: \[17\] There is a concessionary rate for supplies of accommodation in a commercial dwelling exceeding 4 weeks (section 10(6)): Where and to the extent that any supply of goods and services consists of the supply, to any individual, of domestic goods and services in a commercial dwelling, the value attributable to that part of that supply of domestic goods and services that is for a period in excess of 4 weeks shall be deemed to be reduced to an amount equal to 60 percent of the amount that would, if that part of that supply were chargeable with tax at the rate of 7.5 percent, be the value of that part of that supply of domestic goods and services: Provided that to the extent that any supply is a supply of domestic goods and services, and where that commercial dwelling is a residential establishment, and where the supplier and the recipient have agreed that that supply shall be for a period of or in excess of 4 weeks, or for a number of periods which in the aggregate will exceed 4 weeks, the value attributable to that supply of domestic goods and services shall, from the commencement of that supply, be deemed to be reduced to an amount equal to 60 percent of the amount that would, if that supply were chargeable with tax at the rate of 7.5 percent, be the value of that supply of domestic goods and services. ACCOMMODATION IN A DWELLING \[18\] Section 14(1)(c) provides that the supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of: • hire (which includes a letting on any terms including a lease); or • a service occupancy agreement (which means a licence to occupy a dwelling for no consideration); or • a licence to occupy (the right to exclusive personal occupancy); shall be an exempt supply for GST purposes. As such, GST is not imposed on the supply pursuant to section 8, and input tax is unable to be claimed. \[19\] Critical to the application of the exemption is the requirement that there must be a supply of “accommodation in any dwelling”. \[20\] “Accommodation” is not defined in the GST Act but the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.) provides the following definitions: accommodation n 1 (in sing. or US in pl.) room for receiving people, esp. a place to live or lodgings. accommodate v.tr. 1 provide lodging or room for (the flat accommodates three people). \[21\] Thus “accommodation” has a broad meaning, simply requiring the provision of room, lodgings, or living premises for receiving people. However, the exemption in section 14(1)(c) requires that the supply of the accommodation is in a “dwelling”. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 7 \[22\] “Dwelling” is defined in section 2 as meaning: any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: \[23\] The definition of “dwelling” can be broken into four parts: • “any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof” describes the physical structure very broadly and includes a part thereof; • “used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual” prescribes the use of the premises; • “together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it” includes appurtenances; • “but does not include a commercial dwelling” excludes commercial dwellings. \[24\] Each part of the definition is considered below. “Any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof” \[25\] The definition begins by outlining the place in very broad terms. The definition extends the concept of a dwelling from a building to other structures and places and thereby allows for the possibility of almost any place constituting a “dwelling”, including a part thereof. For example, a part of a commercial office complex may comprise a dwelling. “Used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual” \[26\] The wording of the second part of the definition of “dwelling”—“used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual”—is critical to the meaning of the definition. It is these words which prescribe the type of place capable of being a “dwelling” and provide the crucial criteria for determining whether a place is a “dwelling”. It is also these words which may support an alternative argument that a “dwelling” is a place used mainly by an individual as their residence or home. In the Commissioner’s opinion, however, the alternative view places too narrow an interpretation on these words and accordingly the definition of “dwelling” is not restricted simply to individuals’ homes. The reasons for this are set out below. \[27\] This part of the definition is made up of a variety of sub-phrases, each is considered in more detail below. “Used predominantly as” \[28\] This part of the definition commences by providing that the building or other place must be “used predominantly as” a place of residence or abode. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 8 \[29\] “Predominantly” is not defined in the GST Act. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.) defines “predominant” as “being the strongest or main element”. The word “predominant” has appeared often in judgments in income tax cases where a court has had to assess the purposes of a taxpayer—with the predominant purpose being held to be synonymous with the “main” or “principal” purpose: see, for example, Case L77 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,443, Case M131 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,850 and Case S16 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,123. \[30\] In the Commissioner’s opinion, in the current context the use of the word “predominantly” simply requires that the place, or part thereof, where the accommodation is supplied be used mainly or principally as a place of residence or abode. \[31\] This raises the issue of exactly what is meant by the particular premises being “used ... as”. Does this require actual physical use or is the definition concerned with the function or purpose of the premises? \[32\] Relevant definitions of “use” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.) are: use v.tr. 1 cause to act or serve for a purpose; bring into service; avail oneself of (rarely uses the car; use your discretion). 2 treat (a person) in a specified manner (they used him shamefully). \[33\] Significant case law can be found debating the various meanings which may be ascribed to the word “used” in differing contexts; see, for example, Ryde Municipal Council v Macquarie University (1978) 139 CLR 633, Ready Mixed Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v F C of T (1969) 69 ATC 4,038, Council of the City of Newcastle v Royal Newcastle Hospital 96 CLR 493 and Te Awamutu Dairy Cooperative Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7,267. However, the majority of cases agree that the correct meaning of “used” will depend upon the particular context in which the word appears. \[34\] In general terms the usual meaning of “used” requires actual physical use; that is, to read a book, to inhabit a house and to write with a pen is to use those things. Obviously a house which is being lived in as the family home is being used as a place of residence. However, physically employing a thing is not the only meaning which may be ascribed to “used”. “Used” may also refer to the function or purpose of a thing. \[35\] In Hawkins v Edwards \[1901\] 2 KB 169 it was held that “used” in the phrase “used in standing or plying for hire” indicated the purpose for which a Hackney carriage was to be used rather than meaning “when being used”. \[36\] In Blackdown Properties v Ministry of Housing and Local Government \[1967\] Ch 115 the issue was whether a disused part of a sewer that was sealed off was still a “sewer”. Stamp J stated (at page 122): It may be said that the part of the sewer with which I am concerned is not now used for anything, and so not used for the drainage of buildings and yards appurtenant to buildings and not to be included in the description of a sewer. But it seems to me, and Mr. Seward hardly urged to the contrary, that the phrase “used for the drainage of buildings and yards appurtenant to buildings” is susceptible of more than one meaning. The word “used” may mean “being used” or “in use”, which I think is perhaps the EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 9 more obvious meaning; or it may connote not the actual user but the purpose or function which the thing spoken of serves, and it will I think take its colour by reference to the phrase in which it is used. If in a statute the expression “scientific book” was defined to mean “a book used by scientists”, actual user would seem to be requisite to satisfy the definition. But if the definition of scientific book was “a book used for scientific study”, the expression “used for” might connote not actual user but the purpose or function of the book. If one goes further, and defines a “book” simpliciter as “a book used for scientific study”, it is apparent that the words “used for” are introduced to distinguish scientific books from all other books; the words “used for” merely in such a case describe the functions of the book. A mowing machine does not cease to be a machine used for mowing because it is in a museum. So here, in my judgment, the words “used for the drainage of buildings and yards” are really susceptible of a meaning which draws a distinction between sewers used for the drainage of buildings, and sewers used for the drainage of land or roads or other things, and so it is descriptive of the sewer’s function and not its actual use at any given time. \[Emphasis added\] \[37\] In Re 1-4, White Row Cottages, Bewerley \[1991\] Ch 441 concerned whether four stone cottages that were built on a village green and were derelict and condemned in 1970 and vacant from 1972 were dwelling houses. If they were dwelling houses (which was not a defined term in the relevant Act), the registration of them and the land on which they stood as part of the village green could be rectified, and they could be sold and renovated. If they were not dwelling houses they were “rendered sterile”, would remain derelict, and might be occupied by squatters. Mummery J made the following comments: After they were vacated the cottages did not cease to exist; they were not demolished; they were not converted to other uses, such as use as a shop or warehouse or office. The physical structure, character and nature of the cottages remained the same, save that they were empty and neglected and became tumbledown. I do not think that they ceased to be dwelling houses simply because they were not dwelt in. They became dilapidated dwelling houses, but were still dwelling houses, as distinct from other sorts of houses such as public houses or warehouses. \[38\] In the Commissioner’s opinion the meaning of “used ... as” in the definition of “dwelling” should be read as a reference to the function or purpose of the premises. The context of the definition suggests that “used ... as” is equivalent to a building or place used for residing, rather than a building or place used by residents. The context in which the phrase appears (i.e. “used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual”) focuses on the use of the premises as a particular type of place, not on the actual physical use of the premises by a particular person. Thus, provided the main or principal function or purpose of a building is to be a place of residence or abode of any individual, the second part of the definition of “dwelling” will be satisfied regardless of whether or not it is actually being so used. While in many cases actual physical use will coincide with the function or purpose of the premises, it is not essential. Thus, as it is the function or purpose of the premises which is important, rather than actual use, periods of vacancy of the premises are not significant. It is only where the function or purpose of the premises changes to something other than being a place of residence or abode that the premises will cease to be a dwelling. “A place of residence or abode” \[39\] This part of the definition focuses on the function of the physical premises. The main or principal function of the premises must be as a place of residence or abode. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 10 \[40\] “Residence” has two primary meanings, as seen in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.), which provides: residence n 1 the act or an instance of residing. 2 a the place where a person resides; an abode. reside v.intr. 1 (often foll. by at, in, abroad, etc.) (of person) have one’s home, dwell permanently. \[41\] The first meaning emphasises the individual and is typified by the inquiry into where a person has their residence. This may be important in relation to the person’s political rights (e.g. to vote or work in a country) or obligations (e.g. to pay tax). \[42\] The second meaning of residence is more concerned with the nature of the premises rather than the individual (i.e. is it a residence or house; is it a residential as opposed to a business address). \[43\] It is this second meaning of residence which is relevant here. This part of the definition of “dwelling” is concerned with the function of a particular physical structure or place, rather than determining the place of residence of a particular individual. \[44\] “Abode” is defined as follows in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.): abode n 1 habitual residence; a house or home. \[45\] “Habitual”, “house” and “home” are defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.) as: habitual adj 1 done constantly or as a habit. 2 regular, usual. house n 1 a building for human habitation, a dwelling, a home. ...5 gen a place of abode or rest. home n ...2 a the place where one lives permanently, esp. as a member of a family or household; a fixed place of residence. d a private house, a dwelling house. \[46\] Thus the meaning of “abode” is simply that it is a regular or usual residence; a house or home. \[47\] The definitions of both “residence” and “abode” use the other term in their definitions. This suggests that the relevant meanings of “residence” and “abode” are often used as synonyms. Indeed, in discussing some of the meanings of “place of abode” Northrop J in FC of T v Applegate 79 ATC 4,307 stated (at page 4,313): The phrase “place of abode” may have many meanings, it can refer to the building or place where a person sleeps and it can refer to the building or place where he is usually found, for instance, “his place of business”, see Price v. West London Investment Building Society (1964) 2 All E.R. 318 per Danckwerts L.J. at p. 321. The phrase is often used as being synonymous with the word “residence”, see, for example, Levene v I.R. Commrs. (1928) A.C. 217 and I.R. Commrs. v Lysaght (1928) A.C. 234. \[48\] However, in terms of a distinction to be drawn between a place of residence and a place of abode, the consideration of a place as a residence generally looks more EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 11 to the connection that a person may have with a particular place (i.e. a place where one or more individuals reside, sleep, and carry on their lives from). On the other hand, “abode”, in its broadest sense, can simply be referring to a physical structure that is or can be used for humans to live or abide in irrespective of whether or not any people are actually living or abiding there. In a general sense, this is similar to the distinction which is sometimes drawn between a house and a home. The former is often used in a broad sense to simply mean a building for human habitation (i.e. similar to abode); whereas the latter is often seen as suggesting an emotional connection between an occupant and a particular house (i.e. similar to residence). \[49\] In R v Bundy \[1977\] 2 All ER 382 Bundy was “living rough” in his car. He and two other men followed, in the car, a woman who was collecting money from public houses. When the police searched the car they found piping, a hammer, a pipe threader, and three pieces of stocking. Bundy was convicted of having with him articles for use in the course of or in connection with theft, when not at his place of abode. He appealed, stating that his car was his place of abode. Lawton LJ stated that the phrase “place of abode” had to be considered in the context of the particular legislation and continued: The phrase “place of abode”, in our judgment, connotes, first of all, a site. That is the ordinary meaning of the word “place”. It is a site at which the occupier intends to abide. So there are two elements in the phrase “place of abode”, the element of site and the element of intention. When the appellant took the motor car to a site with the intention of abiding there, then his motor car could be said to be his “place of abode”, but when he took it from that site to move it to another site where he intended to abide, the motor car could not be said to be his “place of abode” during transit. When he was arrested by the police he was not intending to abide on the site where he was arrested. It follows that he was not then at his “place of abode”. He may have had a “place of abode” the previous night, but he was away from it at the time of his arrest. \[50\] The tie to a particular person that is suggested more by “residence” contrasts with the broad term “abode” and its connotation of simply a place where anyone may live. “Abode” goes beyond “habitual residence” and includes any place of or for habitation (e.g. a bare house or, in the broad terms of the “dwelling” definition, any other building, premises, structure, or other place predominantly used for habitation). \[51\] In addition, it is to be noted that the definition uses the indefinite article in the phrase “a place of residence or abode”. It does not say “used predominantly as the place of residence or abode of an individual”, as would most clearly fit with the interpretation that to be a dwelling it must be a home or residence of a particular person. \[52\] At first glance much of the case law considering “residence” and “abode” seems to indicate that a degree of permanence is required to satisfy both these terms. However, the requirement of permanency invariably arises as a result of the particular legislation under consideration. The legislation uses words such as “permanent”, “principal”, or “usual” to colour the meaning of abode and residence. Cases considering these phrases are generally concerned with determining a person’s primary place of residence or abode in order to attach some privilege or obligation, e.g. the right to vote in an electorate or the requirement to pay tax. Where this legislative requirement for permanency is absent, there is nothing in the contextually relevant ordinary meaning of the words “residence” or “abode” which requires it. Indeed, the case law itself indicates that a temporary or transitory place of abode is EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 12 still a place of abode, even if it may not satisfy the requirements for a person’s permanent or usual place of abode. See, for example, the following extract from Re Wairarapa Election Petition \[1988\] 2 NZLR 74 (at page 81): It is thus a question of physical occupation of living quarters in circumstances which render those quarters a place of abode for the time being. The question of whether that place of abode for the time being is of such a temporary or transitory nature as not to qualify as “usual” is a further question of fact to be determined by the regularity or frequency of occupation thereof. \[53\] Thus, on the basis of the ordinary meaning of the words “residence or abode” there is no requirement for any specific degree of permanency of occupation. This is particularly the case in the current context, where section 14(1)(c) is concerned with exempting the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. The legislation is not considering the relationship of a particular individual with a particular dwelling (e.g. whether a particular place is a particular person’s place of residence or place of abode). The exemption focuses on the supply of the accommodation and the definition of “dwelling” in this context is concerned solely with describing the premises in which the exempt supply may be made. There is no mention of the person to whom the supply is made. The “dwelling” definition emphasises the building and its use or function, rather than any particular person in it. \[54\] While far from conclusive, it can also be noted that the existence of the exclusion for “commercial dwelling” from the definition of dwelling is supportive of the view that a broad meaning should be given to dwelling. If a narrow interpretation of “dwelling” was intended, such that it effectively only meant a specific person’s usual home, then it is unlikely that those places listed in paragraphs (a)–(c) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” would be regarded as being a “dwelling”, and therefore would not need to be excluded from the scope of the exemption in section 14(1)(c). “Of any individual” \[55\] The impact of the words “of any individual” following “a place of residence or abode” must also be considered. The view set out above is that the definition of dwelling is concerned with describing the premises in which the exempt supply may be made. The alternative view (i.e. that a dwelling requires that a particular person is resident in the premises) tends to focus on the words “residence ... of any individual”. \[56\] In general terms, “any” means one, no matter which, of several or some, no matter how much or many or of what sort. Where the subject is singular, e.g. “any individual”, it would usually mean any individual, no matter which one. “Individual” as seen in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.) may be defined as “a single member of a class or a single human being as distinct from a family or group” or, more colloquially, as “a person”. While the words “of any individual” may have the sense of “of any single (or particular) person”, in most cases there would be no connotation that a specific individual is to be considered. \[57\] In the definition of “dwelling”, if “of any individual” is given the limited meaning of one person then the definition would only be satisfied if a single person resided at the relevant premises. This would lead to the absurd conclusion that only single-occupier residences would be dwellings. It is notable that the definition does EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 13 not say “of any single individual” or “of one individual” or even “of an individual”. In addition, it can be noted that section 33 of the Interpretation Act 1999 provides that “Words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular”. Therefore, it is arguably acceptable to interpret the words “of any individual” as also including “any individuals”. \[58\] Therefore, a building will not be excluded from being a “dwelling” because more than one individual may use it as a place of residence or abode at the same time. The better view is that “of any individual” should be taken to mean “of at least one person” or “of any person or people”. \[59\] Use of the word “individual” rather than “person” in the definition reflects the fact that “person” is a statutorily defined term. Within the GST Act, “person” is a fundamental term or concept as the consequences or implications of the GST Act largely arise on the registration of a person. “Person” is defined in the GST Act to include a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local authority. The target of the exemption in section 14(1)(c) is ordinary residential accommodation which is not of a commercial nature. In these circumstances “person” (with its inclusion of non-natural persons) is not an appropriate term. Thus “individual” is used to signify natural persons and not to emphasise singularity. The words “of any individual” emphasise the residential flavour of “dwelling” and make it clear that business uses do not come within “dwelling”. \[60\] The definition of “dwelling” is concerned with the use of premises and the words “of any individual” do not require that a particular individual be housed in the premises. In addition, as stated above, the definition uses the indefinite article in “a place of residence or abode”. It does not say “used predominantly as the place of residence of an individual”, as would most clearly fit with the interpretation that to be a dwelling it must be a home or residence of a particular person. “Together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it” \[61\] As stated above, this part of the definition includes appurtenances. Appurtenances to a property are those rights, interests, or privileges which are also transferred when the title to the property is transferred. What is meant by the words “together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it” has been considered by the courts. In Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,212, the Court of Appeal held that the common areas, and facilities upon them, within a retirement village complex and available for the use and enjoyment of the residents, were appurtenances to the individual dwellings within the complex. The whole of the land surrounding the apartments was laid out in driveway, paths, gardens, and landscaped grounds for the use and enjoyment of residents. All of the land was integral to and within the curtilage of the apartments. \[62\] It will be a question of fact in any particular case to determine what constitutes the appurtenances integral to and enjoyed in conjunction with a particular dwelling. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 14 “But does not include a commercial dwelling” \[63\] The definition of “dwelling” excludes a “commercial dwelling”. A “commercial dwelling” is defined extensively in section 2 and requires separate detailed consideration. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that a commercial dwelling is excluded from the exemption in section 14(1)(c), by virtue of being excluded from the definition of dwelling. Summary—characteristics of dwellings \[64\] The characteristics of a dwelling can be summarised as follows. • A dwelling is defined broadly and with increasing degrees of generality: buildings, premises, structure, or other part thereof. • The definition is concerned with the functional aspects of the structure. Is the structure being predominantly used as a place for the supply of accommodation? • A dwelling is not limited to someone’s home. Rather, a dwelling need only be a building, premises, structure, or other place for humans to live or abide in. Typically (but not exclusively) a house is such a place. • The main function of the structure will be as a place of residence or abode. • The words “of any individual” in the definition do not imply that a particular individual must be housed in the premises. Use by any individual will suffice. • There is no requirement for any degree of permanency of occupation in order for particular premises to be held to be a residence or an abode. • The concern is with the function of the building, premises, structure, or place rather than with any individual who may occupy it. The issue is whether the main purpose or function of the structure in which accommodation is supplied is a place of residence or abode. • Actual use may have ceased or may not have commenced. Further, a break in the use or period of inactivity will not prevent premises from being a dwelling. • A commercial dwelling is excluded from the definition of “dwelling” so that the exemption in section 14(1)(c) does not apply to commercial dwellings. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 15 COMMERCIAL DWELLING Introduction \[65\] The definition of “dwelling” in the GST Act excludes a “commercial dwelling”. “Commercial dwelling” is defined in section 2 and, like the definition of “dwelling”, its scope and extent is not clear. This part of this statement considers the meaning, and scope, of “commercial dwelling”, and establishes a checklist to assist in determining whether or not any given premises are a commercial dwelling. \[66\] “Commercial dwelling” is defined in section 2 as follows: Commercial dwelling means— (a) Any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse; or (b) Any camping ground; or (c) Any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; or (d) Any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition;— but does not include— (e) A hospital except to the extent that that hospital is a residential establishment: (f) A dwelling situated within a retirement village or within a rest home, where the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy that dwelling: \[67\] This definition can also be broken down into three parts. • Paragraphs (a)–(c) list specific dwellings that are commercial dwellings, namely any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, boardinghouse, camping ground, convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; • Paragraph (d) provides that “any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a)–(c)” is also a commercial dwelling; • But paragraphs (e) and (f) provide that the term “does not include ... \[a\] hospital except to the extent that that hospital is a residential establishment: ... \[a\] dwelling situated within a retirement village or within a rest home, where the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy that dwelling”. \[68\] It is considered that most uncertainty concerns paragraph (d) (i.e. determining whether an establishment is similar to those listed in paragraphs (a)– (c)). Each part of the definition is considered in detail below. Paragraphs (a)–(c)—any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, boardinghouse, camping ground, convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice \[69\] Paragraphs (a)–(c) of the definition list specific dwellings (or establishments) which fall within the definition of “commercial dwelling”. It is considered that what is meant by each of these named types of commercial dwellings is generally understood. However, as paragraph (d) of the definition includes as “commercial dwellings” any establishments similar to those named types, it is important to clarify the nature of each listed commercial dwelling. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 16 \[70\] It can be noted that none of these terms is defined in the GST Act. Paragraph (a)—any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse \[71\] Hotels, motels, inns, hostels, and boardinghouses are typically run as businesses providing varying degrees of serviced accommodation, for varying lengths of time, in permanent structures. The reason for staying at any of these establishments varies. It could be business, holiday, or, particularly in the case of boardinghouses and some types of hostels, for longer term residential accommodation. Usually there will be a number of beds, rooms or units available, and some additional services, particularly cleaning, will be provided. Each of these types of establishment is considered in turn. Hotel \[72\] The relevant definition of “hotel” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.) is: hotel n 1 an establishment providing accommodation and meals for payment. \[73\] Lord Thankerton in Railway Assessment Authority v Great Western Railway \[1948\] LJR 244 described a hotel as premises available to the public for accommodation and refreshment: A hotel ... connotes a building in which a hotel business is carried on, to which the public are entitled to resort for accommodation and refreshment ... A hotel, so defined, is often contrasted with a lodging- house, sometimes dubbed a guest-house or a private hotel, in which control may be retained over the choice of lodgers to be admitted, and in which there is no obligation to the public generally. \[74\] A hotel typically comprises furnished rooms within a building, where those rooms usually fall short of being self-contained (i.e. no or minimal kitchen facilities are provided, and no laundry facilities are provided). Rooms are usually let on a short- term or temporary basis (although it may be longer) to members of the public. Hotels also provide some level of service (such as the provision of meals, linen supplies, and cleaning), although the degree to which this is done may vary. Access to hotel rooms will usually be via a central reception area within the building, rather than there being independent access direct to the street. Motel \[75\] The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed) defines “motel” as: motel n a roadside hotel providing accommodation for motorists and parking for their vehicles. \[76\] A motel is generally understood to comprise units for self-contained accommodation (i.e. with their own kitchen to some degree) and bathroom facilities. Units are generally let on a short-term casual basis to members of the public (especially travellers). Parking facilities are also normally available. In addition, each unit typically has independent access. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 17 Inn \[77\] “Inn” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed) as: inn n 1 a public house providing alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises, and sometimes accommodation etc. 2 hist. a house providing accommodation, esp. for travellers. \[78\] Some old English cases discuss the meaning of “inn” at a time and place where the term was widely used and understood. For example, Thompson v Lacy (1820) 3 B & Ald 283 concerned “a house of public entertainment, called the Globe Tavern and Coffee House” in London, in which the owner provided lodging and entertainment for travellers and others. A guest argued it was not an inn and therefore the rule allowing innkeepers a lien over travellers’ goods for payment of the bill would not apply. His arguments were rejected, and the comments of the judges included: Now this house was used for the purpose of giving accommodation to travellers, who, in London, reside either in lodgings or inns. The defendant ... provided lodgings, and that in the way they are provided at inns: for the charge was at so much per night ... And I take the true definition of an inn to be, a house where the traveller is furnished with every thing which he has occasion for whilst upon his way. And: An inn is a house, the owner of which holds out that he will receive all travellers and sojourners who are willing to pay a price adequate to the sort of accommodation provided, and who come in a situation in which they are fit to be received. In this case, the defendant does not charge as a mere lodging-house keeper, by the week or month, but for the number of nights. A lodging-house keeper, on the other hand, makes a contract with every man that comes; whereas an innkeeper is bound, without making any special contract, to provide lodging and entertainment for all, at a reasonable price. \[79\] Thus the old cases suggest that an inn is a house in which lodging, and often meals, is provided on a casual basis for a nightly charge. On that basis all hotels would be inns, most motels would be, and hostels and boardinghouses that charge for accommodation on a nightly basis (or to the extent that they charge on a nightly basis) rather than at a weekly or monthly rate, would be inns. \[80\] However, since the old English cases, the modes of accommodation available have broadened and changed. The meaning of the term “inn” has changed along with its decline in use. \[81\] In New Zealand the term “inn” is rarely used. For example, the Automobile Association lists the range of accommodation available in New Zealand as: • hotels, boutique hotels, luxury lodges, motor lodges and motor inns with restaurant and bar facilities; • motels, motor lodges, apartments and self-catering accommodation; • hosted accommodation, exclusive lodges, bed and breakfast establishments (“B&Bs”), guest houses, homestays and farmstays; EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 18 • holiday accommodation parks, camping grounds, hostels and backpacker lodges. \[82\] In the New Zealand accommodation market, the term “inn” is used more for marketing purposes than in any technical or legal sense. For example, some accommodation providers use the term “inn” in their promotional material, such as Heritage and Character Inns, and Superior Inns. However, the range of accommodation provided may be anything from a select hotel to a B&B. \[83\] An inn has features similar to that of a hotel in that rooms in a building are let to the public on a casual basis. \[84\] It is notable that the establishments that “inn” is grouped with in paragraph (a) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” are all potentially, or usually, capable of accommodating a reasonably significant number of people. In the Commissioner’s opinion an inn is also a reasonably sized establishment and able to accommodate a number of people simultaneously. Hostel \[85\] The word “hostel” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed) as: hostel n 1 a house of residence or lodging for students, nurses, etc. 2 = YOUTH HOSTEL. 3 archaic an inn. \[86\] “Youth hostel” is defined as: youth hostel n a place where (esp. young) holidaymakers can put up cheaply for the night. \[87\] While the dictionary definition acknowledges the archaic meaning of “hostel” as “an inn”, in ordinary parlance a hostel is now almost exclusively thought of in terms of either a form of hotel offering budget accommodation for holidaymakers, or longer term accommodation for a particular group of people (e.g. students or nurses). \[88\] Longer-term stays by occupants are envisaged for some types of hostels, such as nurses and students hostels, while others, like backpackers and youth hostels, will usually be shorter. In all of them, there maybe some element of shared facilities or common areas, and typically they accommodate a large number of people. Hostels may also, for example, offer shared accommodation, such as bunkrooms or dormitories. \[89\] It is considered that in many cases an establishment may describe itself as a hostel for marketing or market differentiation purposes. It is noted, however, that the style of accommodation offered by many establishments that style themselves as “hostels” is also akin to that offered by a hotel. Boardinghouse \[90\] The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed) defines “boardinghouse” as: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 19 boardinghouse n an establishment providing board and lodging, esp. Brit to holidaymakers. \[91\] The relevant definitions of “board” and “lodging” include: board n ... 2 the provision of regular meals, usu. with accommodation, for payment. lodging n 1 temporary accommodation (a lodging for the night). 2 (in pl) a room or rooms (other than in a hotel) rented for lodging in. 3 a dwelling place. \[92\] There have been two Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decisions which have considered the meaning of “boardinghouse” in the current context. \[93\] Case L75 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,435 concerned a company that purchased a 13- bedroom house and let each of the rooms out individually. Ten rooms shared communal kitchen, toilets, showers, lounge, and laundry. There is no mention of meals being provided. Three rooms were self-contained. There was also a swimming pool and garden for occupants’ use. All occupants had keys to their rooms. There was a shared entrance, and the three ground floor units also had their own outside doors. Although no supervisor lived on the premises, the taxpayer’s employees visited the premises at least three times a week to carry out cleaning and maintenance and collect rent. Occupants usually stayed at the premises for 2 or 3 months. A significant number stayed for longer periods of up to a year. The taxpayer contended that the building was a commercial dwelling by virtue of being a boardinghouse or an establishment similar to a boardinghouse. The Commissioner argued that it was neither, rather that each separate room was a dwelling and that the taxpayer made exempt supplies under, what was then, section 14(c). \[94\] Keane DJ began by comparing the premises with what the taxpayer claimed was their closest parallel, a boardinghouse, taking account of what that term commonly connotes at common law. He stated that board appeared to be a frequent feature of a boardinghouse and lodging an invariable feature. \[95\] Keane DJ noted the distinction between people lodging in a boardinghouse and people being tenants in a house or flat. He referred to the following words of Lord Goddard CJ in Honig v Redfern \[1949\] 2 All ER 15 (at page 17): The general test, which has been laid down for many years, is that if the owner of a house who allows other people to live in it lives on the premises and manages the premises himself, or if the owner has a servant resident on the premises to manage them on his behalf, the other people living in the house are lodgers, whereas if he does not live in the house but lets the whole house out to various people it is a letting out of the house in tenements and the persons occupying the tenements are not lodgers but tenants. \[96\] Keane DJ also referred to the decision in Thompson v Ward LR 6 CP 360, where it was noted that it was not necessary for a landlord in a boardinghouse arrangement to actually reside in the premises, provided the landlord retained sufficient control over the house such that the house was in the possession of the landlord and that the control was exercised with some system and constancy. This may be contrasted with a tenancy situation where a tenant possesses undisturbed rights to the premises. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 20 \[97\] Keane DJ confirmed the view that: tenants are autonomous because they do not share possession of the property with the landlord and are entitled to quiet enjoyment. A lodger, in contrast, is one permitted to share premises actually occupied by or on behalf of the owner; is subject, potentially at least, to close oversight; and depends on the owner’s good will. \[98\] Keane DJ concluded that the premises in that case comprised a commercial dwelling on the basis that it was an establishment similar to the other listed kinds of establishment. This aspect of the decision is discussed below. \[99\] In Case Q46 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,227 there was no dispute that the property in question was a boardinghouse: Barber DJ recorded that the villa, as a boardinghouse, came within the section 2 definition of “commercial dwelling” and was therefore excluded from the definition of “dwelling” (at page 5,231). However, the TRA did make some observations regarding the characteristics of the premises (at pages 5,229- 5,230): For some years prior to the sale, the vendor had been operating a boardinghouse or guesthouse business at the property. Boarders or tenants rented a room and basic facilities for varying periods. Sometimes for days, but mainly for weeks or months on a weekly rental. There seemed to be 10 bedrooms providing accommodation for a maximum of 22 guests. ... ... the building on the front of the property was being operated by the vendor as a guesthouse with tenants renting rooms of the owner for a weekly rental. The vendor did not appear to be supplying any other services to those tenants. ... There is no dispute that at the time of sale there were 10 bedrooms in the property and that many of them were in use by guests paying a weekly or overnight rental for their room. I accept that the vendor did not provide any guarantee to the purchaser as to the continued occupation of the various guests. Most furniture and effects in the rooms belonged to the guests. It appears that, in particular, they owned any bed linen, towels, and cooking utensils, and that only a relatively small amount of furniture belonged to the vendor. \[100\] In that case, therefore, only lodging, with no board, was supplied and it was accepted by all parties that the establishment was a boardinghouse. \[101\] It is the Commissioner’s view that the notion of what a boardinghouse is has evolved over time. In substance, a boardinghouse is a form of hotel (commonly referred to as a private hotel), but where the expectation is that the guests will stay or reside for a longer period than may usually be expected in a hotel. It is not considered necessary for a boardinghouse to now provide meals or “board”. \[102\] Size may be another relevant factor in determining whether an establishment is a boardinghouse. \[103\] In Case L75, Keane DJ stated that the larger the number of occupants catered for the more likely it is that the premises are a commercial dwelling. In Case L75 the premises had 13 bedrooms and in Case Q46 the premises had 10 bedrooms providing accommodation for a maximum of 22 guests. \[104\] Some form of communal facilities is generally considered usual in a boardinghouse. Some examples of this are shared living, dining, or service facilities. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 21 Such communal facilities are available exclusively, or essentially exclusively, to the guests staying at the premises (although they are generally not precluded from inviting visitors). The public are generally not able to access these communal facilities. This may be contrasted with the public’s ability to access the common facilities of a large hotel (e.g. a restaurant or gym). \[105\] The communal occupation in a boardinghouse is generally communal only amongst the guests—the owner or manager will usually have separate facilities. Boarders in a boardinghouse all have equal rights with each other to be in and use the communal facilities. \[106\] Thus, while the dictionary definition of the term “boardinghouse” potentially ranges from the classic large house accommodating lots of boarders, through B&Bs which may have only one spare room, to a flat which the owner occupies with his or her lodgers, or the situation where a homeowner takes a lodger in to live with the owner’s family, in the context of the definition of “commercial dwelling” and on the basis of the TRA decisions, in the Commissioner’s opinion an operation of some size is contemplated. \[107\] In order to be a boardinghouse, the premises must be capable of accommodating a number of guests simultaneously. In addition, any occupancy agreements must be between the owner (or owner’s agent) and each of the occupants individually. The owner (or owner’s agent) must reside in, or at least exercise control over, the premises. The predominant purpose of the premises must be to provide lodging, and in many cases board, for payment. Communal facilities must be shared by the guests, but not be accessible, generally, to the public. Residents would tend to stay for longer periods rather than simply overnight. Small B&B owner-occupied flats, and home lodger situations will not be boardinghouses within the terms of the “commercial dwelling” definition. Paragraph (b)—any camping ground \[108\] The term “camping ground” is not defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary (9 th ed.), but the terms “camp” and “campsite” are defined as: Camp n. a place with temporary accommodation used by soldiers, refugees, or travelling people. – a complex of buildings for holiday accommodation. campsite n. a place used for camping, especially one equipped for holiday makers. \[109\] In New Zealand, the meaning of a camping ground is widely understood, and can encompass a simple designated area through to a “holiday park”. The services provided range from the provision of tent or caravan sites (without or without the provision of electricity) to cabins, self-contained motel units and backpacker lodges. Some camping grounds may have long-term or even permanent residents. Service areas are usually provided for cooking, laundry, ablutions and entertainment. Camping grounds are subject to a degree of onsite management, usually consistent with the level of service provided. \[110\] In some areas there are more basic camping grounds where there may be only tent sites and limited facilities. Where there are no facilities or extremely basic EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 22 facilities, like a single long-drop toilet, this is unlikely to constitute a camping ground, but will usually be regarded as merely a “camp site”. The level of control in these circumstances is likely to be less than that for a camping ground, and may consist of only periodic visits by the owner or Department of Conservation personnel to collect fees, remove rubbish and carry out some service of the facilities (if any). \[111\] Where the supply being made is only of a tent or caravan site (i.e. in substance a supply of a right to use an area of land for the purpose of camping), whether in a camping ground or a camp site, there will not be a supply of accommodation in a dwelling. As such, the supply will not be subject to the exemption in section 14(1)(c). \[112\] However, as noted a camping ground may make a supply of accommodation in a “dwelling” where it supplies the use of cabins, motels, or the like. Paragraph (c)—any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice \[113\] Convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes, and hospices are generally for the care of the elderly, sick, or incapacitated. A high level of service and high standard of accommodation is generally provided. The accommodation provided in paragraph (c) establishments is usually in beds or rooms within a closely organised, supervised, and serviced complex. Paragraph (f) of the “commercial dwelling” definition excludes hospitals, except to the extent the hospital is a residential establishment, and dwellings in retirement villages or rest homes. Paragraph (d)—any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition \[114\] Paragraph (d) includes in the definition of “commercial dwelling” establishments which are similar to those listed in paragraphs (a)–(c). This part of this statement considers what is meant by “any establishment similar to any of” the listed kinds. Both the physical characteristics of the premises and the nature of the operations carried on will be important in considering what is a similar establishment. General characteristics of the listed types of commercial dwellings \[115\] Some of the common general characteristics of those types of establishments listed in paragraphs (a)–(c), and which have been identified in the discussion above, are: • they are operated on a commercial basis, possessing the characteristics expected of a business supplying accommodation to the public, although they may be operated by a non-profit body; • they provide accommodation to a number of, potentially unrelated, people simultaneously (i.e. multiple units, rooms, or beds are available); • accommodation is generally provided by way of a licence to occupy, not by a tenancy; EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 23 • a degree of on-site control, generally varying with the level of service provided and the cost of the accommodation, is exercised by the operator; • some servicing of the units, rooms, or common areas is provided by the operator during the term of the occupation; • the accommodation provides at least basic furnishing; • there are often facilities available for the communal use of all guests; • the guests are not part of the operator’s household during the stay; • professional, formal, or commercial hospitality is provided. \[116\] Some of the general differences between the listed kinds of establishments are the: • degree to which the units or rooms are self-contained; • quality of furnishings provided; • extent of services provided; and • average duration of stays by guests. \[117\] When determining whether an establishment is similar to the listed kinds, these general characteristics, common to the listed kinds of establishment, are useful as a starting point. However, these characteristics do not provide the final answer. It is necessary to consider the application of paragraph (d) in more detail. Establishment \[118\] Paragraph (d) includes in the definition of “commercial dwelling” any establishment similar to any of those listed in paragraphs (a)–(c). \[119\] The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed.) defines “establishment” as: establishment n ... 2 a a business organisation or public institution. b a place of business. c a residence. 3 a the staff or equipment of an organisation. b a household. \[120\] These definitions indicate that an “establishment” may involve a place of business, the actual business itself, and may also have a domestic residential connotation. In the context of the definition of “commercial dwelling” and relating as paragraph (d) does to the establishments specified in paragraphs (a)–(c), the most appropriate meaning of the term is one that has a business, rather than residential, flavour. \[121\] Under paragraph (d), therefore, in order to determine whether particular premises are an establishment similar to the listed kinds of establishment, the physical EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 24 characteristics of the premises as well as the nature of the business activity carried on will be important. Similar \[122\] “Similar” is a word in common usage and is not defined in the GST Act. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (9 th ed) definition includes: similar adj ...1 (often foll. by to) like, alike; of the same kind, nature, or amount; having a resemblance. \[123\] It is readily understood as meaning something which resembles another thing, but is not quite the same. It is a matter of degree and the context in which the comparison is being made as to whether the resemblance is close enough that the things in question may properly be said to be similar. It is a matter of opinion, judgement and often fine distinctions. Use of this comparative term in paragraph (d) means that a decision must be made on the facts of each case as to whether the particular establishment in question is similar to any of those listed. \[124\] The definition provides that an establishment need only be similar to any of the kinds of commercial dwellings listed; it does not have to be similar to all of them. Keane DJ in Case L75 said (at page 1,437): Premises do not have to come within one of the primary examples in order to be a commercial dwelling. They need only be similar to one or more of those examples. \[125\] Case L75, which has been discussed earlier, is the only New Zealand GST case which has dealt specifically with the issue of whether an establishment is similar to a hotel, a motel, an inn, a hostel or a boardinghouse. \[126\] In Case L75 the taxpayer contended that the building was a commercial dwelling by virtue of being a boardinghouse or an establishment similar to a boardinghouse. The Commissioner argued that it was neither: each separate room was a dwelling and the taxpayer made exempt supplies. \[127\] Keane DJ felt the issue should be approached in a “broad and common sense way”. He stated (at page 1,437): The supply of commercial accommodation, like that of any other commodity, turns on such issues as demand and cost. Yesterday’s patterns may not serve for today. Variations may prove worthwhile, or essential. The primary examples given in the definition may be well understood, and the place to start. The definition does not require that they be treated as exhaustive. \[128\] The TRA began by considering the characteristics of a boardinghouse (see the discussion above in relation to boardinghouses). It considered several earlier cases and concluded that: • general control and dominion of the whole house was the critical right; EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 25 • this could be achieved whether or not the owner or a proxy lived on the premises; and • the control must not merely be claimed, but must be exercised with some system and constancy. \[129\] Although the owner did not live on the premises in this case, the TRA concluded (at page 1,440): The level of management control exercised, and cleaning and maintenance undertaken for occupants seems broadly within the boundaries expected in commercial premises. \[130\] Keane DJ emphasised the scale of the operation and the level of management control exercised. He stated (at page 1,440): How then are the premises to be classified? There is no stated line of demarcation between a “commercial dwelling”, and a “dwelling” for hire. So the distinction must be achieved by the broadest comparison. It must depend partly on scale: the larger the number of occupants catered for the more likely it is that the premises are a “commercial dwelling”. It must also depend on the level of control exercised: the less the owner intervenes in the daily management of the premises, the more likely it is that even larger premises comprise a number of individual “dwellings”. The answer must turn on the facts of the case. In this case, I think that the premises are more plausibly understood as a “commercial dwelling”. Their size suggests it: 13 rooms accommodating 17 people. They cannot then be equated exactly with any of the primary examples, but neither can those examples be equated with each other. They do share with the primary examples however, some significant defining features. The period occupants remain is similar to that prevailing in boardinghouses. The facilities offered in rooms, even the shared facilities, are also similar. The rooms could equally well be compared with those in hotels, especially older ones. The three rooms with more facilities, and independent access, are more similar to motels. The level of management control exercised, and cleaning and maintenance undertaken for occupants seems broadly within the boundaries expected in commercial premises. I have much greater difficulty thinking of the premises as a collection of small, independent dwellings. On this view the entire premises comprise a commercial dwelling. Summary \[131\] Keane DJ acknowledged in Case L75 that the answer in any particular case will depend upon the facts of that case. While noting that the premises in question “cannot be equated exactly with any of the primary examples”, they nevertheless share “some significant defining features”. Keane DJ then listed those features that the premises shared with the listed commercial dwellings. Those features included the: • scale of the operations, • number of occupants, • level of control and management, • period of occupancy, EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 26 • facilities offered, • access available, and • cleaning and maintenance services provided. \[132\] However, the point that can be taken from Case L75 is that it was acknowledged that the premises in question were not “the same” as any of the listed examples, but that when considered overall they were more “similar” to a commercial dwelling. He noted that some aspects were similar to a motel, while others were similar to a hotel. Other features were similar to those found in a boardinghouse. Thus a broad consideration can be given to whether an establishment is similar. United Kingdom Value Added Tax cases \[133\] The United Kingdom (UK) Value Added Tax Act 1994 (VAT Act) provides that “the provision of accommodation in a hotel, inn, boardinghouse or similar establishment” is excluded from an exemption from Value Added Tax (VAT) if it comprises: (a) sleeping accommodation; (b) accommodation in rooms provided in conjunction therewith (i.e. a bathroom); or (c) accommodation for the purposes of a supply of catering. \[134\] The VAT Act then defines the term “similar establishment” as including: (a) premises used by visitors or travellers where sleeping accommodation is provided with or without board or facilities for preparing food; and (b) premises held out as being suitable for use by visitors or travellers where sleeping accommodation is provided with or without board or facilities for preparing food. \[135\] Several UK cases concerning the VAT exemption have considered the requirements for a “similar establishment”. Namecourt Ltd v The Commissioners (1984) VATTR 22 \[136\] Namecourt Ltd operated Princes Lodge to accommodate up to 260 people in its 199 rooms. Most occupants were suffering from some sort of social problem and had their lodgings paid for by the Department of Health and Social Security. Each occupant was provided a room with a bed, together with the use of bathrooms and toilets. They were provided with breakfast if they wished it, and cooking facilities were available. Occupants were given a key and could come and go as they pleased. They were responsible for laundering their linen and cleaning their rooms. A communal room and facilities were provided, and the company cleaned those. \[137\] The Tribunal stated that “\[i\]t is in the end a pure question of fact” and noted that both parties agreed: EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 27 that in considering whether on those facts the establishment fits into the statutory definition of ‘hotel, inn, boardinghouse or similar establishment’, we have got to give those words their ordinary meaning and we have got to look at the situation of the establishment in the light of the evidence we have heard as a whole rather than looking too closely at individual details. \[Emphasis added\] \[138\] It was submitted for the Commissioners that Princes Lodge had most of the characteristics normally attributed to a hotel or boardinghouse: sleeping accommodation in individual rooms, normal bed and breakfast, some catering facilities, bed linen, and a common room. In addition, the company provided a licence to occupy, not a tenancy. \[139\] The company argued that the accommodation was much closer to bed-sitting room accommodation in a multiple occupied home rather than accommodation in a boardinghouse. Overnight accommodation for the public was not provided and the stays were usually longer term (over 6 months). In addition, guests did not pay their own way, and the company screened guests to avoid arsonists and child molesters. \[140\] The Tribunal did not consider these to be significant differences and stated: It does seem to us to come quite near the borderline, but in the end we have come to the conclusion that, looking at the situation as a whole, Princes Lodge is in essence a similar establishment to a boardinghouse. It is, if we may say so, much easier to reach that conclusion than to say exactly how one has reached it, but it seems to us that this exception ... is really directed to the sort of establishment which provides accommodation for a transient or floating, though not necessarily short-stay, class of resident. It may be long-term or may be short-term, but it is accommodation which you go to with a view to moving on from in due course; and it will be accommodation which carries with it some element of service. Again the level of service which you would get in a small boardinghouse is very much less than the level of service you would get in a five star hotel, but some element of service would be involved. It seems to us that that is exactly what Princes Lodge provides. The Lord Mayor and Citizens of the City of Westminster (1988) 3 BVC 847 \[141\] One of the four issues in this case was whether a lodge for homeless men was a similar establishment to a hotel, an inn, or a boardinghouse. If so, the accommodation supplied would be standard-rated. \[142\] The case involved a council-run lodging house, Bruce House, which provided accommodation for as many as 600-700 homeless men. Each man had a cubicle containing a bed and a chair, and a door that could not be locked. Conditions were poor with too few washrooms, showers, and toilets. There were wooden chairs in a television room and a number of hot plates for cooking. The canteen had been removed by the time of the hearing. There were crude laundry facilities and bed linen, often left soiled, was provided. There was a staff consisting of a principal, three assistants, and 40 manual workers. Although a nominal accommodation charge was made (mostly paid by Social Services) Bruce House was not run as a profit-making institution, and it consistently showed a loss. Counsel for the parties agreed that the accommodation was supplied by way of licences to occupy the premises. \[143\] The Tribunal looked at characteristics which distinguished hotels, inns, and boardinghouses from other establishments which provide accommodation. The Tribunal observed (at pages 851-852): EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 28 The issue, therefore, that we have to decide on this point is – is Bruce House a ‘similar’ establishment to an hotel, inn or boardinghouse within the meaning of item 1(a)? To answer this question one must first be clear what is meant in this context by the word ‘similar’. We get some help on this from the judgment of Lawton J. in C. & E. Commrs. v. Clark’s Cereal Products Ltd. \[1969\] 1 Q.B. 755 at p.759. In that case he was concerned with the meaning of the word ‘similar’ in the expression ‘chocolates, sweets and similar confectionery’ and he said: “The first problem I have to ask myself is what do the relevant words ... mean? It is clear that Parliament had in mind by use of the phrase ‘similar confectionery’ ... products which would not normally be regarded as chocolates or sweets but which had some of the characteristics of chocolates and sweets.” Applying that explanation of the meaning of the word ‘similar’ to the problem with which we are faced it seems to us that we should ask ourselves this question: ‘is Bruce House, though it would not normally be regarded as an hotel, inn or boardinghouse, an establishment which has some of the characteristics of an hotel, inn or boardinghouse?’ When posed in that way the answer to the first part of the question seems to us simple. No one would call Bruce House an hotel, nor would they call it an inn, we do not think they would call it a boardinghouse either. So one must then go on to consider whether Bruce House has some of the characteristics possessed by hotels, inns and boardinghouses and this we think is more difficult. The characteristics for which one is looking must be, we consider, the characteristics which distinguish these three types of establishment all of which provide accommodation, from other establishments which also provide accommodation. One such characteristic is to be found in the purpose for which the accommodation is provided. Thus a school, or a prison provides accommodation, but we would not regard either as a similar establishment to an hotel or inn or boardinghouse because the accommodation they provide is for a purpose subsidiary to the main purpose of the establishment. An hotel, inn or boardinghouse on the other hand provides accommodation as its main purpose. The accommodation provided by Bruce House is likewise provided as its main purpose – it is not provided for a subsidiary purpose such as housing people while they are being educated or detained in the building. Likewise hotels, inns and boardinghouses commonly provide food for those resorting to them. So does Bruce House, though in a fairly minimal way. A further characteristic of an hotel, inn or boardinghouse is that its accommodation is usually provided for people who are for varying periods away from their home, or who, for the time being, have no home. So we conclude that Bruce House certainly has some of the significant characteristics that are shared by hotels, inns and boardinghouses. Are there any characteristics that Bruce House lacks but which are fundamental to the nature of an hotel, inn or boardinghouse with the result that the lack of them in Bruce House so distinguishes it as to make one say that Bruce House is not similar? The customers of hotels, inns and boardinghouses are normally provided with a bedroom that provides complete privacy and can usually be locked. In Bruce House the sleeping accommodation is only unlockable cubicles, affording little privacy. The standards of sanitation, laundry facilities and service at Bruce House are of a low order, probably lower than at the vast majority of even low grade hotels. Hotels, inns and boardinghouses are normally run with a view to making a profit but Bruce House has never been so run. We ask ourselves whether these differences are such that we should regard Bruce House as an establishment that is so different as to be different in kind, or are they differences which are little more than differences of degree so that it would be right to say that Bruce House, though not the same as an hotel, inn or boardinghouse is, nevertheless, similar. This must be largely a matter of impression but we have come to the conclusion that the differences are not so great as to make us say that Bruce House is not similar to an hotel, inn or boardinghouse. In reaching this decision we take comfort from the decisions of this tribunal on Namecourt Ltd. (1984) 2 BVC 208,028; (1984) VATTR 22 where the facts had some similarity to those of this case and the tribunal reached the same conclusion. \[Emphasis added\] EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 29 International Students House \[1996\] BVC 2975 \[144\] The appellant was a charity that provided accommodation for foreign students at four buildings located in central London. There were 295 beds for single students in single, double, and three-bedded rooms, and 44 furnished flats for married students. There was a programme of activities and counselling and welfare services, and 110 staff. Students paid a monthly rent inclusive of furniture and services. On leaving, 28 days’ notice was required. The normal length of stay was one year; some stayed for 2 or 3 years. The aim of the charity was to contribute to better international relations by assisting foreign students to experience life in the UK. \[145\] The supplies of accommodation would be exempt from VAT unless the buildings were a “similar establishment” to a hotel, an inn, or a boardinghouse. \[146\] The Tribunal stated that it appeared common ground that one must look for the characteristics which distinguish the listed types of establishment from other types of establishment providing accommodation. Citing The Lord Mayor and Citizens of the City of Westminster the Tribunal noted two of the characteristics referred to in that case—the purpose for which the accommodation is provided and that the listed establishments usually provided accommodation for people away from their home or who had no home—and then stated (at page 2,985): It appears to the tribunal that a further characteristic must be added, namely that an hotel, inn or boardinghouse is concerned with the business of providing accommodation. The tribunal concludes that on the facts before it International Students House is not an hotel, inn or boardinghouse. \[147\] The Tribunal then considered whether it was a “similar establishment”. Having concluded that International Students House was not accommodation which was used by, or held out as being suitable for use by, visitors and travellers, the Tribunal continued (at pages 2,986- 2,987): The Tribunal asks further whether International Students House comes within the definition “similar establishment” ... It considers that as did the tribunal in the appeal of Namecourt Ltd that this is a pure question of fact. Although all bodies which provide furnished accommodation have at least that degree of similarity, the tribunal proceeds on the same basis as did the tribunal in the appeal of Allen Hall to find that there are characteristics which make International Students House entirely dissimilar to a hotel, inn or boardinghouse. Such places have as their predominant characteristic the offer of use of accommodation for gain, that being the purpose of their existence. The purpose of the existence of International Students House is as a charity, having the aims and objectives earlier stated and having a particular form of selection and policy with regard to its residents. The tribunal in the appeal of Allen Hall found three elements to be important in establishing the dissimilarity, namely the selectivity exercised over the choice of residents, the high degree of control and the emphasis of a corporate existence while in residence. The tribunal in the present appeal follows the same reasoning, and finds that these elements exist in the case of the appellant. \[Emphasis added\] \[148\] The Tribunal concluded that the predominant purpose of International Students House was not the provision of accommodation, but the fulfilment of its objectives. Providing accommodation was subsidiary to its main purpose of helping overseas students and improving international relations. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 30 Summary of United Kingdom Value Added Tax cases \[149\] In summary, the UK VAT Tribunal has asked the following questions in order to determine whether an establishment is a ‘similar establishment’ to a hotel, an inn or a boardinghouse. • Does the establishment have some of the characteristics possessed by hotels, inns, and boardinghouses? • Does the establishment lack any characteristics which a hotel, an inn, or a boardinghouse possesses and which are fundamental to the nature of a hotel, an inn, or a boardinghouse? • Are any differences such that the establishment is different in kind, or are they differences which are little more than differences in degree? \[150\] When considering the first of these three questions, the Tribunal has focused on characteristics which distinguish the three types of listed establishments from other establishments which also provide accommodation. Some of the characteristics recognised were: • the accommodation is provided as the main purpose of the listed establishments. • food is commonly provided. • the accommodation is usually provided for people who are for varying periods away from their home or who, for the time being, have no home. • the accommodation is provided as part of the business of the listed establishments. \[151\] When considering elements of dissimilarity, some of the factors which the Tribunal has considered are the: • degree of privacy provided; • nature of the room (e.g. furnishings provided); • level of selectivity exercised over the choice of guests; • degree of control exercised by management; • level of service provided; • standards of sanitation, laundry facilities and services provided; and • degree of communal facilities provided. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 31 \[152\] The views of the VAT Tribunal are useful in considering the issue of a similar establishment under the New Zealand GST Act and in some cases these views reflect those expressed by Keane DJ in Case L75. However, there are several reasons why care must be taken with any application of the UK approach to the New Zealand situation. \[153\] The VAT Tribunal takes the view that food is commonly provided in hotels, inns, and boardinghouses. In New Zealand, however, it is not unusual for a hotel or boardinghouse not to provide food. In addition, the New Zealand legislation considers similarity with a wider range of establishments—those listed in paragraphs (a)–(c) of the definition of “commercial dwelling”. In addition to hotels, inns, and boardinghouses, this includes motels, hostels, and camping grounds. While some of these may provide food, some clearly do not, and therefore the provision of food is unlikely to be considered a significant determinative characteristic in New Zealand. \[154\] Under the UK VAT legislation, the relevant provision refers to “a hotel, inn, boardinghouse, or similar establishment” and this has been interpreted by the Tribunal as requiring that similarity be established with the genus as a whole. The New Zealand GST Act refers to “any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c)”. In other words, when considering similarity under the New Zealand provision there is no requirement to establish similarity with a whole class of establishments; similarity with just one of the listed establishments is sufficient. Australian position \[155\] Under the Australian GST legislation “the right to occupy the whole or any part of commercial residential premises” is subject to GST. “Commercial residential premises” is defined as meaning: (a) a hotel, motel, inn, hostel or boardinghouse; or (b) premises used to provide accommodation in connection with a school; or (c) a ship that is mainly let out on hire in the ordinary course of a business of letting ships out on hire; or (d) a ship that is mainly used for entertainment or transport in the ordinary course of a business of providing ships for entertainment or transport; or (e) a caravan park or a camping ground; or (f) anything similar to residential premises described in paragraphs (a) to (e). However it does not include premises to the extent that they are used to provide accommodation to students in connection with an educational institution that is not a school. \[156\] Paragraph (a) is virtually the same as the New Zealand paragraph (a), while paragraphs (e) and (f) substantially correspond with paragraphs (b) and (d) of the New Zealand definition of “commercial dwelling”. There is no equivalent to the New Zealand paragraph (c). \[157\] The Australian Taxation Office has released a public ruling (GSTR 2000/20) entitled Goods and Services Tax: commercial residential premises. The ruling includes the Commissioner’s view on the meaning of paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of the definition of “commercial residential premises” and provides guidance on “residential premises”. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 32 \[158\] In relation to paragraph (f) the ruling adopts a similar approach to the UK VAT cases, but expands on the set of common characteristics divined in those UK cases. The ruling specifies that the characteristics are only those of a hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse (paragraph (a)) or similar premises (paragraph (f)). It does not relate to camping grounds or the types of establishment listed in paragraph (c) of the New Zealand definition. \[159\] The ruling discusses the following main characteristics of hotels, motels, inns, hostels, and boardinghouses. • Commercial intention—they are operated on a commercial basis (i.e. conducted in a business like manner, for reward). • Multiple occupancy—they provide sleeping accommodation on a multiple occupancy basis. • Holding out to the public—they hold themselves out as premises that will receive travellers who are willing and able to pay for accommodation and/or that they will accept reservations or contracts to let accommodation to guests or lodgers. • Accommodation is the main purpose—the provision of accommodation is the establishment’s primary purpose. • Central management—those establishments have central management to accept reservations, allocate rooms, receive payments, and arrange the services provided throughout the premises. Establishments that operate in a similar manner to a hotel, a motel, or an inn usually have an owner or manager present or readily accessible, holding some control over the premises as a whole and managing them. • Management offers accommodation in its own right—the management has control of the premises as a whole, whether or not it owns the property or any part of it and lets them in its own right, rather than as an agent. • Services offered—services, such as cleaning, the provision of food, laundering services, telephone, and minor services (e.g. wake-up calls or taxi bookings) are provided to guests. • Status of guests—those being provided with accommodation are guests, boarders, or lodgers. They can expect a reasonable amount of privacy from management, their staff, and other guests, but not to the same level expected by a tenant. \[160\] In the Commissioner’s opinion, in the absence of significant precedent in New Zealand, the approaches of the UK VAT Tribunal and the Australian Tax Office provide a useful background for considering the approach to be adopted in New Zealand. However, differences in the New Zealand legislation and in the approach taken in the only TRA decision on this issue must be taken into account in determining the New Zealand approach. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 33 Conclusions on paragraph (d) similar establishments \[161\] Whether an establishment is similar to one of the commercial dwellings listed in paragraphs (a)–(c) of the definition is a question of fact and degree. The phrase “similar to” is an imprecise term and requires an exercise of judgment. The requirement that an establishment be similar to any of the kinds listed in paragraphs (a)–(c) means that similarity is to be compared with one or more of the listed kinds of establishments. An establishment does not have to be similar to all of them, or all of those in any of each of paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c) as a group. \[162\] As similarity may be compared with one or more of the listed kinds of establishment, general characteristics of all or most of the listed establishments are useful. Ultimately, though, the test requires that the establishment being compared shares sufficient characteristics with one or more of the listed kinds of establishment. Each kind may place an emphasis on different characteristics, and may have characteristics peculiar only to them. Comparison of the level of each of the characteristics in the subject premises with the usual level of those characteristics found in the particular kind of listed establishment will be necessary to test similarity. \[163\] In the Commissioner’s opinion, in order to determine whether any particular premises are an “establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of \[the commercial dwelling\] definition” it is useful to begin by asking the following questions: • Does the establishment have any of the characteristics possessed by hotels, motels, inns, hostels, boardinghouses, camping grounds, convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes, or hospices? • Does the establishment lack any characteristics which are fundamental to the nature of the relevant listed establishments? • Are any differences such that the establishment is different in kind, or are they differences which are little more than differences in degree? \[164\] The answers to these questions will obviously depend upon the particular facts in any particular case. However, there are several common characteristics of commercial dwellings which will generally be relevant when determining whether an establishment is similar to the listed kinds of establishment. These characteristics are discussed below. Commercial nature \[165\] The most fundamental characteristic which is common to all commercial dwellings is the commercial nature of those establishments. Many of the other characteristics identified support this commercial or business aspect. In order to satisfy this characteristic the establishment must be operated on a commercial basis. It will be operated in a business-like fashion, with relevant factors being matters such as the nature of the activity, the scale of operations, the commitment of time, money and effort, the pattern of activity and the financial results. Generally the operation will be EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 34 conducted with a view to making a profit, although in some circumstances it may be operated by a non-profit body. A distinction may be drawn with the carrying on of a hobby or defraying the costs of what is really a private or investment asset or activity. \[166\] It may be that an activity could never realise a gain or profit in view of the costs of the operation, or that it is carried on for personal reasons or personal interest. Private use of the assets (e.g. holiday accommodation or use by family members or friends) may also indicate that there is no commercial intention, or insufficient commercial intention for the activity to be similar to the kinds of commercial dwelling specified in the definition. \[167\] It should also be noted that a commercial approach to the supply of accommodation is not sufficient, by itself, to make a dwelling a commercial dwelling. For example, many domestic rental activities are carried on in a commercial, and “for profit”, manner. Physical attributes of the premises \[168\] The size of the premises or scale of the activity should be commensurate with the commercial basis of the operation. In general terms, however, the ability to provide accommodation to a number of unassociated guests at a time will indicate a commercial dwelling. There should be provision for “multiple occupancy” (i.e. it should be capable of taking a number of unrelated or unassociated individuals or groups of people at a time). However, it is recognised that it may still possible to have a commercial dwelling that accommodates only one group of guests at a time. The capacity for multiple occupancy is only one, indicative (albeit strongly indicative) factor to consider in conjunction with the other criteria. \[169\] Some form of communal facilities, which may include kitchen, dining, bathroom, and laundry facilities to recreational and entertainment facilities, may be provided. However, the degree, standard, and nature of those facilities may vary considerably amongst the types of commercial dwelling and accommodation supplied. The absence of such communal facilities will not, however, mean that the premises are not a commercial dwelling. \[170\] The level of privacy, and the extent of any furnishings provided, will also vary depending on the nature of the premises. For example, guests staying in a basic cabin at a camping ground may be required to provide their own linen and may share communal facilities. By contrast, establishments similar to those in paragraph (a) will generally provide most of the furnishings for guests. Those in paragraph (c) may allow for a combination of supplied, and personal, furnishings. \[171\] Capacity for multiple occupancy will not be satisfied by an amalgamation of a number of individual units being managed by an agent on behalf of a number of different owners. Section 60(1) makes it clear that a supply made by an agent for a principal is made by the principal, not the agent. Where a manager lets premises on behalf of a number of owners, the accommodation is supplied by each principal (owner) rather than the agent (manager). Thus the supply of accommodation made by each owner will be in a single unit and such a supply will usually be the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. That single unit, or dwelling, will not usually satisfy EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 35 the commercial dwelling requirements. This will be the case whether or not that single unit is part of a larger complex containing multiple units. \[172\] As mentioned previously, one common characteristic of a commercial dwelling is the capacity for multiple occupancy (i.e. a number of concurrent unrelated guests). Accordingly, a taxable activity in a commercial dwelling is usually an activity carried on continuously and regularly where the accommodation supplier supplies a number of rooms to unrelated or unassociated individuals or groups of people at a time. It is the nature of such an activity that the supplier also usually exercises managerial control over the establishment. Further, occupancy in a commercial dwelling may involve an element of available communal or shared facilities. The shared or communal facilities combined with managerial control and oversight are not present where the supply made by an individual owner is a single unit. The proximity of other single units housed in a complex of multiple units does not, of itself, create the required level of shared facilities or managerial control. \[173\] An alternative view is that, as a supply of accommodation is being made in a complex of multiple units, the supply is in a commercial dwelling. However, the Commissioner considers that such a view is inconsistent with the words of the definition as they apply in this context. Where a single unit, of itself, constitutes a dwelling then, in order for it to constitute a commercial dwelling, that dwelling must have sufficient characteristics to be an “establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c)” of the definition of commercial dwelling. \[174\] However, where individual unit owners have leased their units to a third party operator, the supply of accommodation to occupants will be made by the third party, not the individual unit owners, and section 60 will not apply. In those circumstances, the multiple occupancy requirement will be satisfied in relation to supplies made by the third party on its own behalf and the premises may be a commercial dwelling, subject to a consideration of the other characteristics of commercial dwellings. Further, as supply of a unit to a third party operator will not be a supply of accommodation in a dwelling, the section 14(1)(c) exemption will have no application. Length of stay \[175\] The typical length of stay will vary with the kind of establishment being compared. While some commercial dwellings will be exclusively or primarily for short-term or temporary stays (e.g. most hotels and motels), some may have occupants for an extended period (e.g. boardinghouse lodgers or rest home or hospice residents). The latter group, particularly some long-term boardinghouse lodgers, may regard their rooms as their home, although the majority of commercial dwelling occupiers will not. \[176\] Even those guests who do consider their rooms in a commercial dwelling to be their home will occupy only as licensees—they will not be tenants. Their occupation will be by personal permission rather than the granting of a legal right of exclusive possession. The property owner will retain the legal right to exclusive possession of the property. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 36 Control \[177\] Most commercial dwellings will have a management presence on the premises. Where management does not have a physical presence, general control will still be retained over the premises during the occupation. \[178\] For many commercial dwellings there will be a reception and service area. Management will generally ensure the smooth running of the premises, and this will usually include periodic inspection (and cleaning and maintenance) of common areas. \[179\] Some commercial dwellings may be selective over their choice of residents; (e.g. there may be some screening of guests in boardinghouses or targeting of particular groups for hostels). Some, like hotels or motels, will be generally available to the public. \[180\] Management will almost invariably provide any (landline) telephone and power, with charges for them sometimes being included in, and sometimes added to, the tariff. It would be unusual for the occupant of any commercial dwelling to have an account with a utility provider. Services \[181\] Generally the services provided in a commercial dwelling will include cleaning, maintenance, rubbish removal, and the provision of consumables. They will often include the provision of linen, towels, and cleaning products. \[182\] In some longer-term accommodation, such as boardinghouses and some hostels, occupants may be responsible for cleaning their own rooms. However, cleaning the common areas and facilities will usually be the responsibility of management. Food or meals may be provided or available. \[183\] Service is typically provided during the occupant’s stay, although particularly for very short stays this may not happen until the end of the stay. Marketing \[184\] Marketing of a commercial dwelling is usually undertaken in a commercial way; although the extent of this will vary amongst the groups of similar kinds of commercial establishment. For example, the nature of the advertising carried out by a paragraph (c) commercial dwelling (i.e. convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice) may be different in nature to that carried out by a hotel or boarding house. Camping grounds and some motels and hotels may advertise significantly and often seasonally. \[185\] Most commercial dwellings will have obvious signage. Again this will vary with their advertising needs, and some types have standard, well understood signs; for example, motels tend to have “vacancy/no vacancy” signs outside. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 37 \[186\] Many commercial dwellings will have a listing in the Yellow Pages, advertise in newspapers, use business cards, advertise or list in industry-specific publications, or have an advertising presence on the internet. HOLIDAY HOMES, HOMESTAYS AND FARMSTAYS, AND SERVICED APARTMENTS \[187\] In this part of this statement, the impact of the conclusions reached in relation to dwellings and commercial dwellings will be considered in relation to three common types of holiday/short-term accommodation, namely holiday homes, homestays and farmstays, and serviced apartments. These will be considered in general terms. It is important to recognise that conclusions as to whether or not individual premises are a dwelling or commercial dwelling will always be dependent upon the particular facts concerned. The following is a general discussion indicating factors which may be more or less likely to indicate that a particular dwelling is a commercial dwelling. Holiday homes \[188\] Many people own holiday homes and let them out on a casual basis to friends and acquaintances. Some use them less for their personal pleasure and rent them out reasonably consistently, advertising by various means, to maximise the rental activity. Some may own a number of holiday homes which they use privately on a limited basis, or not at all, and rent them out as extensively as possible. \[189\] The potential variety of holiday homes is wide, from a bach or crib to substantial residential premises. The overriding common feature, however, is they are usually additional to the owner’s primary place of residence, but are intended (to a lesser or greater degree depending on the owner’s circumstances) for use as a holiday home. \[190\] Holiday homes are dwellings as their predominant function or purpose is to be a place of residence or abode. It does not matter that a holiday home is not a particular person’s permanent or main residence. \[191\] Owning a number of holiday homes that are rented out (whether in proximity to each other or not) will not affect the conclusion that each is a dwelling. Private use of a holiday home is also irrelevant. A holiday home which is used partly by the owner and partly let out will still be a dwelling. \[192\] Holiday homes are generally not excluded from being dwellings, by virtue of being commercial dwellings, because they are not sufficiently similar to any of the listed kinds of commercial dwellings. \[193\] The types of commercial dwelling with which a comparison can most readily be made are motels and hotels. However, it is the Commissioner’s view that a single motel unit or hotel room is not a commercial dwelling—rather it is the whole hotel or motel complex that constitutes the commercial dwelling and any comparison must be made with that. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 38 \[194\] There are several factors which would generally indicate that holiday homes are dissimilar to hotels and motels, so do not constitute commercial dwellings, and these are discussed below. However, it is important to note that the question of whether a particular holiday home constitutes a commercial dwelling will depend upon the particular facts of that case. It may be that in some cases the various factors discussed below are present in differing degrees which may lead to a conclusion that a particular holiday home is a commercial dwelling. Commercial nature \[195\] The letting activity is usually not carried on in as commercial a manner as it is carried on in a hotel or motel complex. The letting is often undertaken simply to offset the cost of what is essentially a private asset. The provision of accommodation to others is generally of lesser importance than providing a holiday home for the owner. Often the private use of a holiday home will be significant, and it will be unavailable for rent at times when the owner is using it, which may be during some prime holiday rental periods. \[196\] A person may purchase a holiday home for commercial reasons, much the same as a person may purchase a domestic rental property. There may be no intention to use the property for private purposes, or if so used it is subsidiary to the commercial letting (e.g. it will be used privately only if a commercial let is not possible). In such circumstances, marketing and advertising may be undertaken in a manner consistent with such a commercial undertaking. Physical attributes of the premises \[197\] The element of multiple occupancies generally found in hotels, motels and other commercial dwellings is unlikely to be present. Although several individuals may be accommodated, they will usually be part of the same group who are in the holiday house or apartment under the same booking. As the premises essentially accommodate only one group at a time, there is also no sharing of communal facilities by guests who are unacquainted. Legal nature of the occupation \[198\] Like the listed types of commercial dwellings, the occupation of holiday homes will generally be by licence rather than tenancy, although it is possible that any long-term occupation could be by tenancy, which would not be the case in relation to the listed commercial dwellings. Furthermore, it is also common practice for the owner of a holiday home to treat the occupier as having an exclusive occupancy during the licence period. Management—level of control exercised and services provided \[199\] The level of control exercised and the services provided are likely to be much less than that exercised or provided by an hotelier, a motelier, or a proprietor of another listed commercial dwelling. The owner of a holiday home will usually not have a physical presence at the property during the rental, and will not, usually, retain EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 39 general control or inspect the premises during the occupation. Services such as cleaning, maintenance, rubbish removal, provision of consumables and linen are likely to occur only between periods of occupancy, or will otherwise remain the responsibility of the guest. This is not the case with most commercial dwellings. Marketing \[200\] This is likely to be less than that undertaken by hotels and motels, which tend to have at the very least Yellow Pages and Automobile Association accommodation guide (and other similar) listings and prominent signage. Multiple homes \[201\] Where a person owns a number of holiday homes, which they rent out, it is still unlikely that those premises would, as a group, constitute a commercial dwelling. While the commercial nature of the operation and marketing may increase, this is still likely to fall short of what is usual amongst moteliers or hoteliers. The level of management and services provided might also increase. However, the owner (or agent on behalf of the owner) is still unlikely to exercise any routine presence or control during the occupancies. People who rent holiday houses usually expect undisturbed enjoyment of the premises during their stay. Services, like cleaning, are still more likely to be provided between, rather than during, occupancy of each house. \[202\] The multiple occupancy criterion is unlikely to be satisfied even where homes that are side by side are let by a person, as they will not have the same proximity and communality that a motel will have. In addition, where a single holiday home, of itself, constitutes a “dwelling” then, in order to be a commercial dwelling, that home must have sufficient characteristics to be a similar establishment. Motels are usually comprised of units joined in a row or a number of rows. Similar establishments to motels might be comprised of “chalets” set in a common ground, sharing some facilities. In contrast, holiday homes are likely to be on separate titles and physically distinct sections. In the Commissioner’s view, this is more likely to constitute a number of separate dwellings, none of which will amount to a commercial dwelling in its own right. Conclusions \[203\] Supplies of accommodation in holiday homes will be exempt as the supply of accommodation by way of hire in a dwelling or dwellings, unless they are commercial dwellings. \[204\] It would be very unusual for a holiday home or a number of them jointly to be an establishment sufficiently similar to one of the types of commercial dwellings listed in the definition so that it would be a commercial dwelling. Homestays and farmstays \[205\] “Homestay” is, compared to the other types of accommodation discussed, a relatively new term and, along with related terms like “farmstay” and “B&B”, defies precise description. Essentially “homestay” or “farmstay” accommodation involves EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 40 providing short term holiday accommodation in a private home for a charge. Typically, it involves providing accommodation to paying guests in a person’s own home by making available a bedroom or bedrooms, and possibly other rooms, exclusively for guests, and sharing other parts of the home with guests. It may also involve preparing meals for guests. \[206\] The essential criterion of a “homestay” is that paying guests stay with the owners in their home. “Homestay” strongly implies that in addition to accommodation and food, the guest will be welcomed into, and be part of, the home while staying. Homestay hosts will usually spend time with their guests, providing personal hospitality. “Farmstay” is a similar concept, but implies that in addition to being part of the home, there will be some element of experiencing farming or country atmosphere and life. \[207\] Homestays and farmstays provide guests with their own bedroom and, in some cases, additional space which is exclusively available to the guests. The area of the house exclusively available to guests is likely to be significantly less than the area of the rest of the house. Home-cooked meals may be provided. Hosts may provide guests with their own bathroom facilities or sometimes guests share facilities with other guests or use the hosts’ facilities. Guests are likely to have access to most of the owners’ living and service areas, including access ways, the kitchen and indoor and outdoor living areas used by the owners. Sometimes there may be a guest lounge area. They will not usually have access to the owners’ bedroom or bathroom and the owners may also reserve certain other areas of the home for their exclusive use. \[208\] A house offering homestay or farmstay accommodation is unlikely to appear significantly different from neighbouring houses or farms. Advertising is often through a book of homestay and B&B accommodation, or on a website maintained by or for an association of owners. \[209\] Case S56 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,361 is a TRA decision concerning a farmstay. However, that case concerned a claim for input tax credits on the construction of a farmhouse and did not deal with the issue of the supply of accommodation in the farmhouse. The main focus of the case was on determining the principal purpose of the taxpayer in constructing the farmhouse and it was concluded that the business purpose outweighed the private residential purpose. It is interesting to note that in reaching his decision, the TRA was influenced by the fact that the house was built at double the size otherwise needed, and the design and layout were related to the farming and farmstay activity. Barber DJ indicated that when considering the issue an element of realism and pragmatism was required. \[210\] The terms “homestay”, “farmstay” and “B&B” are often considered interchangeable. In general terms, a B&B may be larger than a homestay, and may be more akin to a small private hotel, having a greater number of available rooms than may be available in a homestay. Alternatively, an undertaking described as a B&B may be similar to a homestay as described above. As the name suggests, the availability of meals may be limited in a B&B to breakfast, but this may also be the case in a homestay. However, it is important to note that the label applied to any particular homestay, farmstay or B&B is not relevant for the purposes of determining whether it is a dwelling or a commercial dwelling. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 41 \[211\] In a B&B a private living area may be set aside for the owners. However, depending on the size of the B&B, the area exclusively available to guests is more likely to equal or exceed the area of the rest of the house. A B&B is also more likely to appear different from its neighbours; chiefly due to its size, the existence of signage and, in many cases, parking facilities for guests. Often the running of a B&B will constitute a full-time job for one of the owners. A property may be purchased specifically to be a B&B, but many are converted family homes. Where a property satisfies all these characteristics it may be more likely to be a commercial dwelling, regardless of whether it is in fact called a homestay, farmstay, or B&B. \[212\] A homestay or farmstay will clearly be a dwelling as the main function or purpose of the premises is to be a place of residence or abode. In addition, the premises are obviously actually physically used as a place of residence or abode by the owners and the guests. \[213\] To be a commercial dwelling, a homestay or farmstay must be an establishment similar to any one of the listed types of commercial dwelling. The type which is most similar is a boardinghouse. Another, less likely possibility, is that they are similar to an inn, being a smaller or private hotel. \[214\] The various factors in relation to homestays and farmstays are considered next. Commercial nature \[215\] While an income of some significance is possible, the nature of the premises and the operation carried on are quite different to that of a boardinghouse or private hotel. It cannot be said that they are similar to a motel. The predominant use of homestay premises will ordinarily be to provide accommodation for the owner and family. The predominant use of a commercial dwelling, such as a boardinghouse, private hotel, or motel is not to house the owner and family, but to provide accommodation to paying guests and to make a profit. \[216\] To be a commercial dwelling, a homestay operation would need to be run on a commercial basis (i.e. along business lines). Factors relevant to this would include the commitment of time and money, the planning and projections undertaken (particularly for a new venture), the prospect of making a “profit”, the research and marketing undertaken, and the suitability of the location. \[217\] It is recognised that there is considerable variation in homestay accommodation. Many will be offering accommodation in spare bedrooms vacated by grown children, and in these more ordinary styles of homestay, it is highly unlikely that the homestay will constitute a commercial dwelling. However, there are also homestays which trade on their exclusivity and extremely high level of service. In these cases, it may be accepted that the exclusiveness or intimacy afforded by a small- scale operation is an integral part of the operation and an indicator of a commercial intent. Typically this will be reflected in the tariff. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 42 Physical attributes of the premises \[218\] Whereas in a boardinghouse or private hotel the owner’s or manager’s quarters will be separate from, and subordinate to, the guests’ quarters, in a homestay the guests are actually in the owners’ living quarters. In addition, common areas in the listed kinds of commercial dwelling are truly common (i.e. each guest has an equal right to be there with all others using the area). In contrast, in a homestay or farmstay situation, the “common” areas are generally the owners’ living and service areas, which the owners allow the guests access to. The very essence of a homestay is that the guests are allowed to stay in the owners’ home. The guests do not have an equal right with the owners to be there—they are allowed there at the owners’ pleasure. This is also consistent with guests’ relatively brief and sporadic use of these areas, which the owners will use extensively, continuously, and indefinitely. \[219\] In most cases in a homestay or farmstay the areas exclusively available to guests will be significantly less than the area of the rest of the house and the premises are unlikely to be a commercial dwelling. However, in circumstances where the area exclusively available to guests exceeds the area of the rest of the house, it is much more likely to be a commercial dwelling. As the size of the operation and/or the house increases, the premises become less the owners’ home, and more a house which has the predominant purpose of supplying accommodation to paying guests. At that point, the house may become of such a size and the provision of accommodation may be of such a scale that the house will be similar to a boardinghouse. \[220\] While the element of multiple occupancies is less likely to be present in a simple homestay or farmstay, a homestay may be able to accommodate more than one guest at a time. As Keane DJ noted in Case L75, scale is significant in determining whether the premises are a commercial dwelling, and the larger the premises the more likely it is one. A homestay with only one guest room is clearly dissimilar to a hotel, a motel, an inn, a hostel, or a boardinghouse in this respect and unlikely to be a commercial dwelling for that reason (although the exclusive homestays referred to above may be a valid exception to this). A homestay with five or more bedrooms for guests is reasonably easily seen as similar to a boardinghouse. \[221\] Homestay premises are likely to look similar to neighbouring domestic residential properties and may not have signage visible to the public, unlike the listed types of commercial dwellings. Nature of the occupation \[222\] As in commercial dwellings, guests will be in homestay or farmstay premises by licence, and will usually be there for a short term. \[223\] From a guest’s point of view, a stay in a homestay or farmstay is distinct from staying in a dwelling of a commercial nature like a hotel because they are staying in someone’s home, a private dwelling, enjoying home comforts and personal hospitality. \[224\] As the size of the premises being considered increases, they may still be called a “homestay” but they will be more similar to a boardinghouse or private hotel, EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 43 or B&B establishment. If it then meets the other criteria of commercial dwellings (such as commercial nature, scale and marketing) it is more likely to be a commercial dwelling. Management—level of control exercised and services provided \[225\] In a homestay this is typically at a very high level: the owners provide significant personal attention and care and provide a raft of services, e.g. fresh linen and towels, consumables, refreshments, breakfast and often other meals, and information. Although this might be considered to indicate a commercial nature in the same way as the service in a top hotel might be very attentive, it is also consistent with the guest being more of a personal rather than commercial guest. The high priced “boutique” homestays noted above could be an exception to this. Marketing \[226\] This is generally at a lower level than most other commercial dwellings, being commensurate with what is usually a lower turnover and with the less commercial nature of the operation. Conclusions \[227\] In general homestays and farmstays will not usually be commercial dwellings. The size of the operation and the non-commercial nature of it will generally preclude a homestay from being a commercial dwelling. Unlike the listed kinds of commercial dwelling, the supply of accommodation in a homestay is generally concerned with the provision of personal hospitality in the owners’ own home. In addition, the element of multiple occupancies is less likely to be present. \[228\] As a general guideline it might be expected that premises will be more likely to be a commercial dwelling when the house provides for multiple occupancies and the area of the house that is exclusively reserved for guests’ use exceeds the area of the rest of the house. Nevertheless, some homestays, such as up market or “boutique” homestays, may have the necessary commercial element even when the guest capacity and/or area is small. \[229\] To be a commercial dwelling, a homestay operation would need to be run on a commercial basis – along business lines. Factors relevant to this include the commitment of time and money, the planning and projections undertaken (particularly for a new venture), the prospect of making a “profit”, the research and marketing undertaken, and the suitability of the location. Serviced apartments \[230\] The word “apartment” connotes a self-contained unit with kitchen, bathroom, and laundry facilities, usually physically joined to its neighbouring property or properties. Units in a high-rise apartment building are usually thought of, but flats in a block and time-share units would also fall within the description. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 44 \[231\] There are two non-physical aspects of serviced apartments that differentiate them from the same sort of premises let on an ordinary monthly tenancy which are GST exempt. • Service or services are provided. • The rental period tends to be short and occupation sporadic. \[232\] Serviced apartments will be furnished. Services which are either automatically provided or optional would typically involve some combination of cleaning, linen and laundry services, rubbish removal services, and the provision of food or meals. In a larger block, there may be a reception desk or an on-site office, dry cleaning services, telephones, fax machines, audiovisual equipment, computer and printing facilities, valet car-parking and servicing, arrangement of transportation, provision for foreign exchange transactions, recreational activities, and conference and business rooms. In a large complex, these facilities may be much the same as would be offered by a large hotel. \[233\] A flat or house rented out on an ordinary monthly tenancy will not be a serviced apartment simply because the landlord arranges and pays for the provision of basic services (e.g. rubbish removal, lawn mowing, or weekly cleaning). \[234\] The letting of serviced apartments may be long term, but is more often short to medium term. The occupant may be staying in that locality for a holiday, on a short business trip, or on a longer term business trip (e.g. a secondment to another centre where the occupation lasts for weeks or months). \[235\] This statement considers the situations where a person, providing significant services in relation to each of the following premises, rents out the following. • A single apartment or flat (which may or may not be attached to the owner’s dwelling). • Several apartments or flats (which may be in a high rise complex, adjoining, or on separate titles in close or distant locations). These may be owned and let directly by a person or company or their agent, or be leased to a third party which lets a number of the units or operates the whole block on its own behalf. • A time share unit or a number of time share units. \[236\] All these premises will be dwellings unless they are commercial dwellings. To be a commercial dwelling, the premises would need to be sufficiently similar to one or more of the listed kinds of commercial dwelling. The types of commercial dwelling with which comparisons can most readily be made are motels or hotels. Similarity is not with a room in a hotel or a motel unit but with the hotel or motel establishment itself. Although the apartment owner may reside on the same section of land (e.g. in the case of an attached flat), the self-containment of the unit(s) in the types of premises contemplated precludes similarity with a boardinghouse. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 45 \[237\] The following five factors are considered. Commercial nature \[238\] Several factors suggest that serviced apartments are run in a business-like or commercial manner. Shorter term stays in premises with services provided usually command a significantly higher rent than similar premises would on an ongoing monthly tenancy. Providing services during the occupancies (as opposed to services provided between occupancies as is usually the case in respect of holiday homes that are let out), as well as taking bookings, providing access, keys, etc. on a regular basis, requires a greater degree of organisation and involvement. Unlike an ordinary residential tenancy of an apartment, the occupation of a serviced apartment is usually by licence rather than tenancy and, obviously, services are provided. \[239\] Although those factors give some indication that the activity is carried on in a commercial way, the scale of the activity is likely to be the prime indicator of a sufficiently commercial or non-commercial nature. For example, where there is significant use of the premises by other than paying guests (e.g. the owners or family or friends), this would indicate that the apartment is more akin to a holiday home and it is less likely to be a commercial dwelling. Physical attributes of the premises \[240\] A single apartment, even when let on a short-term basis to numerous people, will not satisfy the multiple occupancy criterion common to commercial dwellings. Commercial dwellings provide accommodation for a number of unassociated people simultaneously. \[241\] Where an owner lets more than one apartment, this requirement could potentially be met. However, when compared with a hotel or motel operation, the letting of more than one apartment is still likely to be a much less commercial activity unless a significant number of apartments are involved. \[242\] Motel owners or operators tend to reside on the same piece of land as the motel units, and operate a distinct office. An apartment owner may also live on the same land, for example, where two or more apartments are attached to the owner’s house, or where the owner of a block of flats lives in one and lets the others. However, without, for example, the high turnover of guests inherent in a motel complex, it is likely that these scenarios would lack the other commercial hallmarks of a motel. \[243\] In a larger complex, like a high-rise apartment building, a manager (or owner) may live on the premises and operate an office and provide or organise the provision of services. However, where there is a manager renting the units out on behalf of several individual owners this will still not satisfy the requirement for multiple units in relation to each owner. Section 60(1) makes it clear that a supply made by an agent for a principal is made by the principal, not the agent. Where a manager lets premises on behalf of a number of owners, the accommodation is supplied by each principal (owner) rather than the agent (manager). Thus the supply of accommodation made by each owner will be in a single unit. The supply of EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 46 accommodation in a single unit is the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. A single unit, or dwelling, will generally not satisfy the commercial dwelling requirements. \[244\] However, where individual unit owners have leased their units to a third party operator, the supply of accommodation to occupants will be made by the third party, not the unit owners, and section 60 will not apply. In those circumstances the multiple occupancy requirement will be satisfied in relation to the third party operator and the premises may be a commercial dwelling. \[245\] The extent of the shared facilities provided is another factor to consider. However, the range of facilities provided may vary quite dramatically between one set of serviced apartments and another (as may also be the case with some motels). Nature of the occupation \[246\] All the listed types of commercial dwellings in the definition are occupied by licence rather than tenancy, even if occupied longer term. In contrast, while serviced apartments will typically be occupied by licence for shorter periods, where the occupation is for a longer term, it may be by tenancy. Management—level of control exercised and services provided \[247\] The level of control exercised and services provided varies a lot among serviced apartments. The degree to which any control is exercised and services provided will be relevant in determining whether any particular serviced apartments are a commercial dwelling. \[248\] The services provided in a block of serviced apartments may be minimal or may be much the same as that provided in a hotel or motel with (e.g. daily cleaning and linen changes). Services such as cleaning, maintenance, rubbish removal, and the provision of consumables and linen may occur during or only between periods of occupancy. Timeshare units are usually cleaned only at the end of the week, while common facilities are cleaned continuously. The level and frequency of services provided may be more optional for the occupier in respect of some apartments. Owners or managers may or may not have a physical presence on the property, retain general control, or inspect the premises during the occupation. Marketing \[249\] Marketing may be undertaken on a similar level to that undertaken in motels or hotels in the case of larger complexes, but for smaller operations it is likely to be much less. A comparison with the usual sort of marketing undertaken for motels (e.g. listing in Yellow Pages and accommodation guides, signage, and advertising in the media) may help to discern how commercial the nature of the operation is. However, it should be noted that the extent of the marketing of an entire complex will be irrelevant where the apartments are individually owned and supplied, and each apartment does not constitute a commercial dwelling in its own right. EXPOSURE DRAFT—FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY 47 Conclusions \[250\] Serviced apartments are subject to a wide variation in scale, the services provided, the management control exercised, the marketing undertaken, and the level of commerciality generally. All are dwellings: their predominant function or purpose is as a place of residence or abode of one or more individuals. \[251\] Single apartments are unlikely to be commercial dwellings. Apartment complexes of some scale (providing accommodation to a number of unassociated parties) with a high turnover and high level of service can more readily be seen as similar to hotels or motels. \[252\] The letting of a number of apartments on behalf of each of the individual owners will not give rise to a supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling. On the other hand, where a number of apartments are leased to a single entity which in turn supplies them on its own behalf, there may be the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling by that entity. Draft items produced by the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel represent the preliminary, though considered, views of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In draft form these items may not be relied on by taxation officers, taxpayers, and practitioners. Only finalised items represent authoritative statements by Inland Revenue of its stance on the particular issues covered.

Govt on Business Tax Review progress
====================================

Finance Minister Michael Cullen outlined progress on the Business Tax Review in a speech delivered today. Submissions have been analysed, and the government is now trying to determine the most effective package of business tax changes and considering the details of how they would work in practice. A likely outcome, he said, was "an attractive mix of a lower corporate tax rate and tax credits". For more information see the [speech](/news/2006/2006-10-31-govt-business-tax-review-progress#speech)

SPEECH

### Speech at inaugural meeting of Open 2 Business

Thank you for inviting me to be with you here today.

I would like to congratulate Stuart, Tony and everyone else involved in launching this business network which has as its motto, I understand, 'Fiscal Accountability with Social Responsibility'.

Those are two objectives that I myself have a great deal of affinity with.

And I would like to think that your motto is also one that summarizes two of this government's priorities over the past seven years.

Economic and social progress cannot be separated. They are two sides to the same coin. We have made great strides in both areas in the last seven years. Briefly, New Zealand has been one of the top performing economies in the OECD, unemployment is now one of the lowest in the world, more than 330,000 jobs have been created, and household incomes have risen. Prudent fiscal management has turned the government into a net saver, and allowed significant long term investments in upgrading vital infrastructure, hospitals, schools, roads, as well as investments in the NZ Super Fund. People are wealthier, healthier and more secure.

But we can't afford to rest on our laurels. Economic transformation is not a job that ever finishes; it is a long term game. We must continue to strive to improve our productivity and lift our game in an increasingly globalised world.

This government is particularly focused on the key drivers of transformation – savings, infrastructure, skills, research and development and exports.

And a critical part of that agenda is the Business Tax Review.

I do not want to use the full time allotted to me to speak because I think it is more useful for you if I open the floor to any questions that you may have of me on these or any other matters that are of concern to you as business people in the commercial capital.

The driving force behind the range of options identified by the business tax review discussion document released three months ago is the strong desire by the government to further improve the capability of business to grow and to compete in an increasingly borderless international economy.

The purpose of the review process is to facilitate the progressive transformation of our economy into becoming a higher-wage, higher-skill and more knowledge-based economy over time.

We want to ensure that our business tax rules best encourage innovation, better support business investment and further encourage New Zealand-based firms to either enter or to expand their engagement in offshore market opportunities.

The discussion document, as you will know, suggested options for consideration such as reducing the company tax rate, tax base changes and measures to reduce the cost of complying with tax rules. Options being examined include targeted tax credits to encourage increased investment by companies in R&D, in export market development and in skills development.

Inland Revenue and Treasury received more than a hundred submissions on the review. A broad spectrum of submitters were represented – including businesses of all sizes, industry/business groups, tax practitioners, business advisers, private individuals, unions, local government, and some political parties. Overall, I have been impressed by the high quality of many submissions, a lot of time and effort has gone into considering the issues and prioritising the options.

Officials have reviewed the submissions and this feedback from submitters is providing an important input into the next stage of the review.

We are currently addressing two main issues. First, developing advice on the best package of reforms to lift the performance of businesses and to support the transformation of the economy. Second, and in parallel, working through the more detailed issues around how these potential reforms would be implemented in practice. The review is working to a very tight timetable – in order to deliver reforms to be in place for April 2008 – and this means that it is necessary to make progress on the detail of how the reforms would be implemented at the same time as considering what the best package of reforms would be.

It is important to remember at a time of great clamour for tax cuts that fiscal policy does not exist in isolation of the wider macroeconomic environment. Responsible governments must also be sensitive to ensure their fiscal stance does not complicate the job of the central bank. Who would forgive us if our fiscal decisions cause interest rates to rise?

This means that we will need to make room for tax reforms within existing fiscal policy. Stronger tax revenues – if recent outturns translate into higher forecasts – will help, but we will still need to keep tight control on other priorities and we will need to defer spending increases that we might otherwise want to pursue.

The economy is also close to a number of constraints, in particular the large current account deficit, relatively high dollar, and high rates of capacity utilisation. The strength of the public finances has been a key factor reassuring the Reserve Bank not to increase interest rates further, and reassuring ratings agencies to not downgrade NZ. Maintaining a prudent fiscal policy is critical to prevent injecting further stimulus into the economy – which would only result in increasing these pressures, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. This is a point National's finance spokesman John Key seems oblivious to as he seems to think billions of dollars of tax cuts – I am not sure how much as he seems to change his mind on this score every day – are affordable and responsible right now.

I should also reiterate that contrary to headlines you may have seen the surplus last year does not of itself indicate any permanent strengthening of the government's fiscal position. We will need to wait for the economic and fiscal forecasts (in December) to get a better idea of the likely future path.

We want to foster a business environment that encourages greater innovation, investment in the business and their staff, and exporting. The business tax review is likely to produce an attractive mix of a lower corporate tax rate and tax credits, particularly helping those businesses focused on lifting their performance, expanding and tackling overseas markets.

The review of international tax currently underway is also looking at important issues that will contribute to this business environment, and changes in these areas will also have a fiscal cost.

I also recognise that changes to company tax have implications for personal taxation and these will be considered at the same time as the changes to business taxation.

The current phase of work is perhaps the most difficult. We are trying to determine the most effective package of business tax changes – that would make the greatest contribution to lifting the performance of businesses and the economy.

Inevitably, this requires consideration of the more detailed design issues – essentially, how the different tax changes would work in practice – in order to develop a view on the highest priority tax changes.

For example, we are keen to foster greater innovation, more investment in the business and in staff and a stronger engagement with the global economy by businesses. There are a great many ways that businesses can innovate and invest to develop and grow their business, and there is no single right answer that applies for all businesses – investing in research to develop new science may be the best strategy for some businesses, for others investing in their staff or innovating around new products, processes or markets.

We know that targeted tax credits can encourage these activities directly, but their effectiveness depends in part on how accurately we can define the relevant activities. This would need robust definitions of eligible expenditure and other eligibility criteria. So we are working on these definitions to get a better idea of how the tax credits might work, to help inform the decision whether to pursue them.

Equally, we know that some of the other possible initiatives raised in the discussion document – for example, the company rate reduction – would encourage a wide range of business activities, without trying to identify those that contribute most to raising performance. However, company rate reductions are more expensive because a lot of the cost may not feed through to greater innovation or other shifts in behaviour – if instead it is simply distributed as higher dividends to shareholders.

The international tax review is looking at the tax treatment of overseas subsidiaries and, hence, whether New Zealand is an attractive place to base an international company. Investing overseas – to set up a distribution network or other in-market presence – can also be an important part of the expansion of a business into exporting.

The review will also consider our non-resident withholding tax rates, as bilateral reductions in these rates would make it easier for outbound investors to repatriate their profits from overseas.

The need to reform our international tax rules was also given a high priority in submissions on the Business Tax Review, in particular by larger, more internationally active businesses. A discussion document on international tax will be released later this year.

I want to assure you that this government is actively engaged in making a difference to our futures. We have a long term strategy and a great confidence in this country that at times is not shared by some who delight in knocking our great land. We have achieved much already in the past seven years and I want to leave you with some positive words from an outsider which not surprisingly were barely reported last week.

The commentary, originally published in Forbes magazine, was from the founder and president of California-based Barclay Partners Asset Management, William J. Buechler, after a recent trip to New Zealand to assess investment opportunities here.

_"To my surprise,"_ Mr Buechler said, _"I continually experienced a strange, yet pervasive, lack of optimism for the future of New Zealand and a lack of confidence in business and the economy. For lack of a better term, it might be called 'The New Zealand Blues'.__"_

He went on to note that as someone that does not live in New Zealand, he begs to differ.

His advice to potential international investors in New Zealand is that when it comes to leadership and vision, "_the Kiwis have it_.

"_As other investors from around the world realise the opportunities and advantages of investing in New Zealand, new money from these outside investors – both retail and institutional – will flow to New Zealand in amounts well beyond anything experienced in the past and will serve as the catalyst that jumpstarts an economic boom in New Zealand that will simply defy current expectations. At least that is the way I see it, as an outsider looking in_."

I certainly share his confidence in our future and I welcome your thoughts.

Thank you.

Student loan scheme bill introduced
===================================

A student loan scheme bill tabled in Parliament today introduces new rules for borrowers who are overseas and simplifies the administration of the student loan scheme rules. The changes for overseas borrowers include a repayment holiday of up to three years; new repayment obligations; extension of "interest-free" loans to full-time undergraduates; and extension of the amnesty for non-resident borrowers in arrears. Other changes include a reduction in the late payment penalty for all borrowers, and allowing data matching between Inland Revenue and Customs to ensure entitlement to interest-free loans.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### A fresh start for overseas student loan borrowers

There will be a fresh start for those overseas with student loans under new rules unveiled by Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today.

"The changes introduced in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill today are part and parcel of our aim to enhance the quality and lower the cost of tertiary education," said the Ministers.

"We want to improve the skills base of New Zealand by ensuring greater numbers of students have access to high quality tertiary education. This is essential if we are to transform New Zealand into a higher wage, knowledge-based economy.

"Interest-free student loans are a key part of improving access to tertiary education. However, it is clear the rules around overseas borrowers need to be improved as they discourage many from meeting their obligations and may deter some from coming home.

"We recognise that graduates want to travel overseas and gain valuable skills and experience and that repaying student loans during their OE can be difficult.

"However, we don't want them to accumulate an unmanageable debt in the process which ends up discouraging them from returning home and contributing to the economy. Therefore, we need a fresh start.

"The new rules will make it easier for students heading overseas to stay on top of their repayment obligations and give more breathing space for those who are overseas and are struggling with rising debt.

"The fact that interest-free loans are generally limited to borrowers living in New Zealand has increased financial incentives for borrowers to leave New Zealand without informing Inland Revenue because their loans would then attract interest.

"In future Inland Revenue will know when borrowers go overseas. A law change will allow data matching between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. This will ensure that only those entitled to interest-free loans have access to them.

"The data match is expected to reveal about 40,000 borrowers who are or have been non-resident and whose loan accounts will therefore have to be adjusted," said the Ministers.

New rules for borrowers overseas from 1 April 2007

**Fresh start**

*   The amnesty for non-resident borrowers in arrears will be extended to 31 March 2008. This means penalties will be wiped. If they apply for the amnesty and meet certain conditions, including making regular payments based on the new repayment rules for two years, their loan balance will not increase except for interest.

**Making it easier to repay**

*   There will be a repayment holiday for borrowers going overseas of up to three years, during which time they will not have to make repayments, although their loans will still attract interest. This also applies to those who have met the amnesty conditions.
*   For all overseas borrowers who are not on a repayment holiday, their yearly repayment obligations will be based on the size of their loan balances. A borrower with a loan balance of $15,000 or less will be expected to repay a minimum of $1000 a year, a borrower with a loan of between $15,000 and $30,000 is expected to pay $2000 a year, over $30,000, the minimum repayment is $3000 a year. Repayments are currently based on 1/15th of the size of the loan.

**Encouraging overseas study**

*   Inland Revenue will be able to grant interest-free loans to undergraduates studying full-time overseas to bachelor's degree level.

**Other changes**

*   Simplifying the rules that determine whether someone is a New Zealand borrower, and thus required to repay the loan on an income-contingent basis, or an overseas borrower, whose payment will be based on the size of the loan (see above).
*   Fine tuning specific interest write-off rules to reflect the introduction of interest-free loans.
*   Borrowers who had repaid their loans by 13 November 2006 and had an interest write-off to which they were not entitled will not have the write-off reversed.

Changes applying to all borrowers

*   The late payment penalty for all borrowers will reduce from 2.0 per cent per month to 1.5 per cent per month. The change will apply to amounts subject to a late payment penalty on or after 1 April 2007.
*   Inland Revenue's powers to grant hardship relief will be made more flexible by allowing it to suspend payments during the year for borrowers who apply for it.

Information on these and other technical changes in the bill is available in the commentary on the bill, published at: [http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)

### Questions and answers

### Questions and answers: Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill

_Why are the repayment provisions being changed and why has the Government chosen to introduce a repayment holiday and a three-tiered repayment arrangement?_  
The changes aim to provide fairer, less punitive, repayment provisions for borrowers living overseas, to ensure that their loans do not increase in such a way that discourages them from returning to New Zealand. This is consistent with the intent of interest-free loans.

After study, many graduates go overseas on their 'OE' and return after a few years. The Government appreciates that, while overseas, most graduates will not be earning high incomes and that they may find it difficult to make repayments. With this in mind, the Government is introducing an automatic three-year repayment holiday with repayment obligations based on the size of the borrower's loan when the holiday ends.

_Is it fair that borrowers overseas aren't required to make repayments while borrowers in New Zealand are? Won't this just encourage borrowers to go overseas?_  
The repayment holiday recognises that it may be unrealistic to expect borrowers who are travelling overseas and doing holiday jobs to make repayments. Because repayment obligations for borrowers in New Zealand are income-contingent, borrowers are protected from having to make repayments when their income is low. This is not the case currently for borrowers living overseas who are expected to make repayments based on 1/15th of their loan size, which can be onerous or impossible for some.

The holiday is limited to three years, so that those going overseas long-term will still be required to make repayments when the holiday ends. In addition, borrowers living overseas are subject to compounding interest, even during the holiday period, while borrowers living in New Zealand are not.

_Why not just have income-contingent repayment obligations for borrowers living overseas?_  
This would cause a number of administration difficulties, such as at what level to set the repayment threshold. Borrowers in New Zealand are required to repay ten percent of all income over $17,160. For a borrower living in London, this threshold is very low given the cost of living there. For a borrower living in Vietnam, for example, this threshold is relatively high. England has seven different repayment thresholds depending on what country the borrower lives in. A similar system would be complex to administer and difficult for borrowers to understand their obligations.

_Why is the amnesty on student loan penalties being extended?_  
The amnesty is being extended by one year to give borrowers identified as non-resident borrowers as a result of the data match – which will take place after the existing amnesty ends – the chance to come within the amnesty. The amnesty allows non-resident borrowers with arrears the chance of a fresh start by having their penalties cancelled. Penalties have been acting as a disincentive for borrowers to return to New Zealand.

_Why are the interest write-offs that were in place prior to interest-free loans being abolished?_  
Borrowers living in New Zealand for six months or more are eligible for interest-free loans. The old interest write-offs therefore only apply in very limited circumstances to borrowers who are living overseas. Having interest write-offs for borrowers overseas is inconsistent with the policy intent of interest-free loans, which is to encourage borrowers to return to New Zealand.

_Why will borrowers studying full-time at undergraduate level overseas be eligible for interest-free loans?_  
Interest-free loans for borrowers studying will alleviate debt escalation for borrowers who take time out of the paid workforce to study full-time. Borrowers studying at post-graduate level overseas are already eligible for interest-free loans. Borrowers must provide proof to Inland Revenue that they are studying full-time and evidence that establishes that their course is equivalent to a course in New Zealand of bachelors degree level or above (this evidence is obtained from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority).

This change does not mean that those living overseas can take out a student loan for study that they are doing overseas, rather, that if they have a student loan prior to leaving New Zealand, it will be interest-free while they continue to remain in full-time study.

_Why is the penalty rate being reduced?_  
Borrowers are currently subject to a penalty rate, which is equivalent to an annual rate of 26.82 percent. This rate has often been criticised as being too punitive. The Government has recognised this, but realises that there must still be consequences if borrowers fail to meet their obligations. The new penalty rate is equivalent to an annual rate of 19.57 percent. This rate will be the same for borrowers living in New Zealand and borrowers living overseas.

The hardship provisions are also being altered to give the Commissioner of Inland Revenue more flexibility in cases of hardship. For example, the Commissioner is being given the ability not to require repayment if payment would cause a borrower serious hardship. This means that borrowers will not be penalised if they cannot afford to meet their repayment obligations.

_What is the fiscal cost of these changes?_  
Officials estimate the net cost to be about $15 million for 2007/08. This represents the outstanding penalties and interest write-off reversals from the estimated 40,000 borrowers overseas balanced against the expected write-off of penalties and softening in the repayment and penalty regime.

Peter Dunne speech to EMA
=========================

In a speech today to the Employers and Manufacturers Association, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne discussed a range of tax policy topics from his perspective as Leader of the United Future party. Topics included the Business Tax Review, targeted tax incentives, corporate and personal tax rates, adjustments to tax thresholds, and income splitting.

Leader, United Future

SPEECH

### Speech to Employers and Manufacturers Association

_8am, Tuesday, 28 November 2006  
Crowne Plaza, Albert St, Auckland_

I am speaking to you this morning as the Leader of the United Future Party, who just happens to be the Minister of Revenue.

United Future is a business friendly party that encourages initiative, innovation, investment and self-reliance.

We believe in preserving, enhancing and sharing our nation's prosperity, and in promoting government policy that encourages initiative, rewards hard work, and creates jobs.

We are a centre party, all about doing what is best for New Zealand, and not at all about promoting a particular ideology, or view of the world.

We are interested in doing things that work, not just forever talking about them.

The Business Tax Review currently underway is a classic example of our approach.

It represents the most comprehensive review of business tax arrangements since 1988, and arises as a direct consequence of the confidence and supply agreement between United Future and Labour.

You may recall that at the last election United Future committed itself to a business tax rate of 30%, as well as increased incentives for research and development.

The post-election negotiations with Labour resulted in the agreement to hold a Business Tax Review, and my own appointment as Minister of Revenue, responsible for carrying out that review, in conjunction with the Minister of Finance.

We began work jointly and with our respective key Inland Revenue and Treasury officials late last year.

Our initial proposals were released for public consultation in July.

They included a reduction in the company tax rate to 30 cents; and improved assistance for research and development, as per United Future's policy.

They also included proposals for new tax incentives to boost export market and skills development, matters of particular interest to the Labour Party, and a series of more technical changes to depreciation and asset write-offs, building on the substantial changes introduced in the 2005 Budget.

Altogether, they amounted to a programme which, if implemented in full, would cost just under $2 billion a year.

If, as a result of a reduction in corporate tax rates, there were to be changes to personal tax arrangements, the total cost of the package could climb towards $3 billion.

United Future pushed for a Business Tax Review because we considered that with the targeted tax relief being provided through the Working for Families package, which could see a household on $43,000 better off by $336 a fortnight from next year, the priority was clearly for business tax reform.

We have argued for a reduction in the corporate tax rate because of the need to retain competitiveness with our major trading partner, Australia, in the first instance.

A corporate tax rate of 30 cents, without the accompanying capital gains tax, stamp duties, or compulsory superannuation levies, would certainly achieve that goal.

But that is not the only step we believe we should consider, which is where the targeted incentives for research and development, export markets and skills development come in.

For many small businesses, a 30% tax rate may not offer much advantage.

That is why the review has proposed initiatives that would improve productivity, business investment and competitiveness.

When businesses invest in R & D activities, export market development and skills improvement in the workforce there are wider benefits to the country as a whole.

Businesses invest in R & D to improve their products and processes, and that contributes to productivity and competitiveness.

At present, many businesses under-invest in R & D because they do not capture all the benefits.

R & D tax credits should help to resolve the problem of under-investment in this area.

Tax credits for export market development are another possibility.

They could be a solution to businesses under-investing in developing new markets, which has wider implications for other businesses and for the economy as a whole.

Similarly, raising skill levels should also help to increase productivity.

Employers may be reluctant, at present, to spend more on developing the skills of their employees because they are easily lost to the business when employees change jobs, though the skills are not necessarily lost to New Zealand.

Tax credits for skills enhancement should help to reduce under-investment in skills development as well.

The excesses of the 1970s and early 1980s have understandably given tax incentive schemes of this type a bad name, and one of the real challenges we confront is batting off the cynicism that we are about to repeat that awful nightmare all over again.

I am not a natural advocate for schemes of this type – but I am also pragmatic enough to acknowledge that we do need to do more to boost export performance, and tax credits may well be a way of assisting us to achieve that.

The challenge in my mind is not therefore whether we have targeted tax incentives, but rather how they can be best designed to achieve the objectives we seek for them, and resolving that is a critical element of the work now being undertaken.

To return to my original theme, the exercise we are currently engaged in is a business tax review, not a general tax review.

At the same time, it will be almost impossible not to consider the implications of any significant changes in the corporate tax rate for personal taxes, a point Dr Cullen and I acknowledged the day the Business Tax Review document was released.

A reduction in the business tax rate will widen the gap between the top personal tax rate and the business rate, which is generally considered to be undesirable, although I note from recent discussions with Ireland's Finance Minister that the gap between the two in that country is now 30%, without adverse effect.

United Future's solution is to work over time towards a 30:30:30 alignment in the corporate, trust and top personal tax rates, although I acknowledge that is an aspiration that will not be achieved quickly, and will certainly not be part of the current package.

Tax rates, however, are only a part of the picture.

The income thresholds at which the particular rates apply are an equally important element.

In 2000 when Labour put up the top personal tax rate to 39 cents on incomes over $60,000, it was supposed to affect the top 5% of income earners only.

Now, 12% of taxpayers are caught by that rate – and they pay 51% of all income tax.

Just to retain relativity with the 2000 position, we would probably be looking at adjusting the top threshold to somewhere over $90,000, with consequential adjustments to other thresholds.

That move alone would restore about $35 a week to the after-tax incomes of people in the top tax bracket

So adjustments in tax thresholds can deliver a far more effective real tax cut to more taxpayers than a simple rate reduction.

That is why we were pleased the Minister of Finance adopted United Future's policy of indexing thresholds in the 2005 Budget, but important though it is that thresholds be indexed to prevent them slipping behind real income levels, the reality is that indexation of itself will not resolve the imbalances now becoming obvious.

Our election policy also included a tax free threshold for all income earners of $3,000, which was roughly equivalent to abolishing the current Low Income Earner Rebate, and cutting the tax rate on the first $38,000 of income to just under 18 cents in the dollar.

United Future's present view is that coming on top of the significant changes the Working for Families has introduced, any personal tax changes in the future are more likely to be a combination of rate reductions and threshold adjustments, rather than across the board rate cuts.

As far as the Business Tax Review is concerned, the process from here is broadly as follows.

Later this year, when we have a clear picture from both Treasury and Inland Revenue of the current revenue position, and the likely future track, Dr Cullen and I will consider the final scope, shape and content of our business tax reform package, with a view to decisions being taken in February/March next year.

At that point we will also consider the personal tax issues, and whether there is scope for change in that area.

Our proposals will then go through the normal Cabinet process, prior to being signed off by both our Caucuses, in time to enable me to introduce the necessary legislation to Parliament in May.

It remains our intention that the tax changes arising from this review take effect from 1 April 2008.

Beyond the Business Tax Review, there are three other important tax initiatives that should be referred to here.

The first relates to international tax, in particular the Controlled Foreign Company rules.

A review of these rules is long overdue.

The Business Tax Review foreshadows this, and we will be releasing a Discussion Document before the end of the year.

This will involve analysis of whether New Zealand should modify its treatment of CFC income, and whether there are measures that could reduce tax compliance costs for CFCs.

We will also be looking at other parts of the system such as non-resident withholding tax rates, the thin capitalisation rules, foreign dividend withholding payments, and the conduit relief rules.

In many senses, modernising the international tax rules will be critical to attracting and retaining investment in New Zealand, as will be our business tax regime.

The second issue relates to the charitable sector, something very close to United Future's heart.

Last month, I released a Discussion Document reviewing the current arrangements for charitable donations tax rebates.

Of particular interest to the business community will be the proposals relating to increasing the deduction available to businesses for charitable donations, and possible workplace giving initiatives.

Submissions on these and the other proposals in the document close at the beginning of next month, and it is my hope that decisions arising from the review can be incorporated into next year's Budget.

And finally, there is the issue of income splitting for households.

Research by both the OECD and the Families Commission supports United Future's long held contention that we do not do enough to recognise the plight of second income earners in a household, invariably a mother at home caring for the kids.

Targeted tax relief through policies like Working for Families has been the preferred way of addressing these matters to date, but there will come a time when more of the same is viewed as just middle class welfare payments.

Taxing households on the basis of the members within them, rather than just the individual income earner, which is really what income splitting is about, has the potential to not only be fairer, but also to recognise more effectively the contribution both partners are making to the running of that household.

It is not a costly policy to implement.

Treasury estimates in 2005 were that our policy of allowing couples with dependent children earning up to $120,000 between them to split incomes would cost about the same as dropping each of our current 21 cent, 33 cent and 39 cent tax rates by 1 cent.

United Future has long argued for income splitting for these reasons, but so far ours has been a lone advocacy.

I am working on another tax Discussion Document, due for release early in 2008, to canvass the tax issues relating to income splitting and household income, as per our confidence and supply agreement with the government.

I would hope, given the mounting public debate on issues relating to the work/life balance, that employers and manufacturers would take a close interest in this issue, and engage in the consultation process.

Finally, let me raise one other issue.

In July next year the Kiwisaver scheme commences.

As you will be aware, it is a voluntary contributory savings scheme, with – thanks to United Future's intervention – a mortgage diversion arrangement to assist first home buyers.

The government has been careful to point out that it is not the first step towards compulsory superannuation, and their caution about getting too far ahead of public opinion is understandable, giving the corrosive superannuation debate of the last 20 years, and the failure of compulsory superannuation proposals in the life of the Kirk Government in the 1970s and more recently, the Bolger/Peters government in 1997.

However, it is also true that converting Kiwisaver to a compulsory scheme would be very simple – the current opt-out provision for new employees could easily be removed, thus making the scheme mandatory.

United Future is not advocating that – yet.

But if it becomes clear over the next few years, that there is a groundswell for compulsory superannuation, then it may well be that in addition to adjusting Kiwisaver in the way I have described, future corporate and personal tax reform could well focus on tax offsets for the contributions made to compulsory superannuation.

I emphasise, though, that the searing effect of the superannuation debate since 1984 means that no party is likely to go out on a limb for this course, unless it is clear that it has sustained and substantial public support to do so.

The worst outcome would be to begin the compulsory savings journey – only to have politics as usual intervene for the third time in 30 years to cut it short.

Overall, the concessions we were able to secure from the Labour Party on tax issues during our post-election negotiations were amongst the strongest reasons why we concluded another confidence and supply agreement with the government.

Now, we look forward to its support in ensuring we deliver on those commitments.

KiwiSaver default providers named
=================================

The government has announced the names of the six companies to be appointed as default providers for KiwiSaver, the workplace-based retirement savings scheme that comes into operation on 1 July. For more information see the [media statement](/news/2006/2006-12-07-kiwisaver-default-providers-named#statement)

Minister of Commerce

### KiwiSaver on track with default providers selected

Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel today named six default providers they intend to appoint for KiwiSaver, the workplace-based retirement savings scheme which comes into operation in July next year.

Dr Cullen said the announcement of the default providers is an important step in the introduction of the scheme which aims to help New Zealanders develop long-term savings habits and will give them more choices for securing their financial futures.

The six providers selected will be ready to accept members when the scheme comes into operation on July 1, 2007. They are:

*   ASB Group Investments Limited
*   AMP Services (NZ) Limited
*   ING (NZ) Limited
*   Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited
*   National Mutual Corporate Superannuation Services Limited (trading as AXA New Zealand) and
*   TOWER Employee Benefits Limited.

"The default providers are required to meet stringent criteria so as to ensure they are able to offer the kinds of retirement savings options New Zealanders want and need," said Dr Cullen.

"The appointments are subject to each company becoming a KiwiSaver provider and successfully implementing the necessary systems and processes that will be required for it to begin operating on 1 July 2007."

People who join KiwiSaver without nominating a preferred savings scheme will be automatically allocated to one of the selected default providers.

"We had a large number of applicants and our appointment of a number of default providers will ensure KiwiSavers who don't choose their own provider will still be looked after by a provider of high quality.

"This is important to ensure employees can have confidence in KiwiSaver.

"I am heartened by the level of interest being shown by the savings industry which gives me confidence that employees will have a good range of providers to choose from.

"KiwiSaver aims to make it easier for employees to save for their futures. It is essential New Zealanders develop better long-term savings habits so they can look forward with more confidence to a retirement that meets their aspirations.

"Today's announcement shows we are on track for a successful launch of the scheme. A public information campaign will be launched in the months before the 1 July start date together with forums to assist scheme providers," said Dr Cullen.

Lianne Dalziel said the selection of the companies to be appointed as default providers was an open competitive tender process where ministers were assisted by advice from independent external experts who carried out detailed evaluation of potential providers.

"In making our decision ministers followed a fair, consistent and transparent process which ensured all potential default providers were assessed on an equal basis. Remember too that any provider, not just a default provider, will be able to offer KiwiSaver schemes that meet the requirements of the KiwiSaver Act.

"New Zealanders will be able to actively choose a KiwiSaver scheme that best meets their specific savings needs. Members are not confined to using one of the default providers and membership is easily transferable as people's needs change over time," she said.

**Background**  
KiwiSaver is a voluntary scheme where employees elect to contribute 4 or 8 per cent of their gross salary. They will be automatically enrolled and will have eight weeks to opt out. To kick-start the scheme the government is providing a $1000 contribution and paying some scheme fees in order to improve the returns for savers. Employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes will be exempt from tax, subject to a cap of the lesser of the employee's contribution or 4 per cent of their gross salary or wages.

The official KiwiSaver website [http://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz](http://www.kiwisaver.govt.nz)
 provides full information on the scheme.

### KiwiSaver default providers - Questions & Answers

**How did you choose the default providers?**  
An open competitive tender process was undertaken to select the companies to be appointed as default providers, where Ministers were assisted by advice from independent external experts who carried out detailed evaluation of potential providers

The companies to be appointed as default providers are required to meet stringent criteria so as to ensure that they are able to offer the kinds of retirement savings options New Zealanders want and need.

**What criteria were used?**  
The default providers have been selected on a number of criteria, including their:

*   Security and organisational credibility;
*   Organisational capability;
*   Proposed design of the providers Default KiwiSaver Scheme;
*   Administration capability;
*   Competitive fee levels; and
*   Investment capacity/capability.

**Do people have to join a default provider KiwiSaver scheme?**  
No, people do not have to join a default provider KiwiSaver scheme.

Employees starting a new job on or after 1 July 2007 will be automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver with the ability to opt-out. Those employees who do not opt out will be allocated to a KiwiSaver scheme in one of three ways:

1.  the member can actively choose a KiwiSaver scheme; or
2.  if no KiwiSaver scheme is chosen by the member, then they will be allocated to their employer's preferred KiwiSaver Scheme if they have one; or
3.  if the employer has not chosen a preferred KiwiSaver Scheme, then the member will be automatically allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme by Inland Revenue.

All KiwiSaver schemes will be run by the private sector regulated similarly to existing registered superannuation schemes and governed by trust deeds. Any provider, not just default providers, will be able to offer KiwiSaver schemes that meet the requirements of the KiwiSaver Act.

**Are default providers better than other KiwiSaver scheme providers?**  
The companies to be appointed as default providers were selected from amongst those who submitted a formal proposal in the competitive tender process and subsequently went through a detailed evaluation process. Any provider, not just default providers, will be able to offer KiwiSaver schemes that meet the requirements of the KiwiSaver Act and not all potential providers of KiwiSaver schemes will have chosen to seek selection as default providers.

The range of products offered by other KiwiSaver schemes may differ from those offered by default providers. Members will be able to actively choose a KiwiSaver scheme that best meets their specific needs.

KiwiSaver tax exemption extended
================================

The tax exemption for employer contributions to KiwiSaver will be extended to other registered superannuation schemes, the government announced today. From 1 July next year, employer contributions will be exempt from specified superannuation contribution withholding tax for amounts of up to 4 percent of an employee's gross salary.

### Further help for saving as KiwiSaver tax exemption extended

The tax exemption for employer contributions to KiwiSaver will be extended to other registered superannuation schemes, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"This is a further significant step to help New Zealanders save for their future," said the Ministers.

Employers currently pay SSCWT – specified superannuation contribution withholding tax – on their contributions to registered superannuation schemes, although contributions to KiwiSaver schemes were exempted under legislation enacted in September.

"It is essential that New Zealanders develop long term savings habits so they can have more financial security in their retirement years.

"By making employer contributions tax free, we are making it even more attractive for workers to save as their balances will grow much quicker with an employer subsidy whether they opt for KiwiSaver or stay in an existing scheme.

"Extending the exemption will also ensure tax neutrality between KiwiSaver and other registered superannuation schemes.

"Under the changes announced today, employer contributions to other registered schemes will be exempt from tax for amounts of up to 4 percent of an employee's gross salary.

"A tax-free employer contribution will mean, for example, an extra $660 a year in savings for people earning $50,000 a year who contribute 4 percent of their salary and whose employers contribute another 4 percent.

"This is a win-win. Employers who take advantage of the opportunity to contribute to the long-term financial well being of their staff are likely to see greater employee job satisfaction, as well as greater loyalty and retention.

"The tax exemption will be available only for contributions to schemes that have lock-in rules similar to those of KiwiSaver, for which schemes will have to amend their trust deeds.

"The extended exemption will apply from 1 July 2007, when KiwiSaver begins, and will be added to the taxation bill currently before Parliament by means of a Supplementary Order Paper.

"That bill also encourages people to save through KiwiSaver by removing the current over taxation of low income earners who invest in managed funds. In future KiwiSavers who earn less than $38,000 will be taxed at 19.5 per cent on their savings, not 33 per cent," said the Ministers.

Today's announcement builds on the significant progress this government has made in helping this country save and prepare for the future through:

*   Reversing National's cuts to New Zealand Superannuation, restoring the married rate to not less than 65 per cent of the average net ordinary time weekly wage
*   Establishing the New Zealand Superannuation Fund to help fund the future cost of New Zealand Superannuation
*   Introducing the State Sector Retirement Savings Scheme for civil servants
*   Introducing workplace-based saving through KiwiSaver with a tax exemption for employer contributions.

"This government has made saving a priority. We have put in place a firm foundation to allow today's generation and generations to follow to have greater confidence that they will be able to meet their retirement aspirations," said Dr Cullen.

### **Extending the KiwiSaver tax exemption to other registered superannuation schemes**

### Questions and answers

**What is SSCWT?**

SSCWT stands for **Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax**. It is a tax on any monetary contribution to a superannuation fund that is paid by the employer for an employee's benefit.

Employer contributions made to a superannuation fund are subject to SSCWT. It differs from tax on employee superannuation contributions, which is normally subject to tax at personal marginal tax rates.

**What is the KiwiSaver SSCWT exemption?**

The KiwiSaver SSCWT exemption was introduced to encourage employers to contribute to their employees' savings for retirement. The exemption allows employees' balances to grow quicker, without being reduced by tax. Under the exemption, employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme are exempt from SSCWT, subject to a cap – the lesser of the employee's contribution or 4% of the employee's salary or wages.

For example, if the employee and the employer each contribute 4% to a KiwiSaver scheme, SSCWT will be exempt on all 4% of the employer's contribution. If an employee contributes 2% to a KiwiSaver scheme and an employer 3%, there will be no SSCWT on 2% of the employer contribution. (The remaining 1% would have SSCWT.)

**How is the exemption being extended?**

The exemption is being extended to include employer contributions to other registered superannuation schemes, subject to the same cap as the KiwiSaver SSCWT exemption. The change will apply from 1 July 2007 – the date that KiwiSaver is launched and the KiwiSaver SSCWT exemption applies.

**Why is the SSCWT exemption being extended?**

Limiting the exemption to KiwiSaver schemes would make KiwiSaver a tax-preferred investment, thus creating distortions. That would create a risk that existing employer-sponsored superannuation schemes would wind up, leading to the distribution of savings from those schemes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some members would spend their savings rather than reinvest them in similar retirement savings vehicles. That would be counter to the government's objective of increasing savings.

**How will the extension work?**

For employer contributions to be exempt from SSCWT, the following conditions must be met:

*   The registered superannuation scheme must be a defined contribution scheme with at least 20 non-associated members.
*   The scheme must be registered as at 1 July 2007.
*   As a minimum, the KiwiSaver lock-in rules relating to withdrawals will apply, and more lenient withdrawal provisions will not be permitted. That means lock-in until age 65 or five years of membership, whichever is the later, except for:
    *   first home ownership;
    *   significant financial hardship;
    *   serious illness; or
    *   permanent emigration.
*   The minimum contribution rate to the locked-in account is 4 per cent of the employee's gross base salary or wages, and:
    *   employer contributions can count towards this; and
    *   if such contributions count, the contributions have to vest immediately.
*   Members cannot borrow against the locked-in amount.
*   Contributions (of both member and employer) in the locked-in account are required to be transferred to a KiwiSaver scheme or another approved scheme, if the member ceases to be eligible to be a member of that scheme or otherwise ceases membership.

Employee and employer contributions to which the exemption from SSCWT applies must be locked in. Any contribution over and above the minimum 4 per cent contribution can be subject to the scheme's normal withdrawal rules. For example, if an employer contribution is 10 per cent and an employee contribution is 10 per cent, then 8 per cent in total will be locked in (4 per cent employee contributions and 4 per cent employer contributions, which are subject to the SSCWT exemption). The remaining 12 per cent could be subject to the scheme's normal lock-in rules, and the employer's contribution will be subject to SSCWT.

The exemption for employer contributions is capped at 4 per cent of an employee's contribution or 4 per cent of the employee's salary or wages, whichever is less.

The Government Actuary will have to approve a scheme as having met the required criteria to be eligible for the exemption. The scheme will have to provide statistical information, on a regular basis, to the Government Actuary about the funds held in the locked-in accounts.

**What is the estimated fiscal cost of extending the exemption?**

The cost is estimated to be around $17 million in forgone revenue in 2007/08, increasing to $18 million in 2008/09 and $19 million in 2009/10. These calculations are subject to a number of sensitive assumptions, including an assumption of how many people will avail themselves of the exemption.

**Will the SSCWT tax exemption favour just those people on higher incomes who can already afford to save more for retirement anyway?**

No. The SCCWT exemption is capped to the lesser of the employee's contribution or 4% of the employee's salary or wages.

**Why will the SSCWT exemption be capped?**

The cap on the tax exemption afforded to employer schemes has been designed to align with the cap on the tax exemption for KiwiSaver schemes. This is to allow for a more level playing field between KiwiSaver and other employer schemes. Putting a cap on the SSCWT exemption reduces the risk of abuse – it is a prudent measure intended to prevent excessive "salary sacrifice" arrangements being entered into for the purpose of reducing someone's tax liability rather than for saving. In addition, the cap will limit the fiscal cost to the government of the SSCWT exemption.

**Won't the exemption encourage "salary sacrifice"?**

The exemption may lead to salary sacrifice arrangements to a degree, but the cap will help ensure that aggressive salary sacrifice arrangements do not occur.

**Won't the exemption encourage employees and unions to increase pressure on employers to contribute to superannuation schemes?**

Some employers, employees and unions may wish to discuss the option of employer contributions as part of their normal negotiations over remuneration and work conditions.

**Why aren't contributions made by the self-employed and employees eligible for the exemption?**

The tax exemption is on SSCWT, which is not paid by employees or the self-employed.

**Why not have a tax exemption for contributions made by the self-employed and employees?**

The main reason for the tax exemption was to encourage employers to contribute towards their employees' savings for retirement. Having a tax exemption on contributions made by the self-employed would be inconsistent with that goal.

**Isn't the government just encouraging the self-employed to structure themselves as companies?**

There are many reasons why the self-employed may not want to structure themselves as companies. The government does not think that extending the exemption to them would be the deciding factor in their choice of structures.

**Will members of existing schemes be eligible for the $1,000 government contribution and the fee subsidy that applies to KiwiSaver members?**

No. Other schemes will have their own features to encourage membership.

### Examples

**I'm a member of my employer's superannuation scheme and earn $30,000 a year. I contribute 2% of my salary and my employer contributes an additional 2%. What does the exemption mean for me?**

If your employer's scheme changes its trust deed to allow members to access the exemption and you elect to have your funds subject to the KiwiSaver lock-in rules, you will be eligible for your 2% employer contributions to be tax-free. The annual benefit to you will be $126 a year (based on a 21 percent SSCWT rate).

**I'm a member of my employer's superannuation scheme and earn $50,000 a year. I contribute 6% of my salary, and my employer contributes an additional 6%. What does the exemption mean for me?**

If your employer's scheme changes its trust deed to allow members to access the exemption and you elect to have your funds subject to the KiwiSaver lock-in rules, you will be eligible for your 4% employer contributions to be tax-free. The annual benefit to you will be $660 a year (based on a 33 percent SSCWT rate).

**I'm a member of my employer's superannuation scheme and earn $80,000 a year. I contribute 4% of my salary, and my employer contributes an additional 4%. What does the exemption mean for me?**

If your employer's scheme changes its trust deed to allow members to access the exemption and you elect to have your funds subject to the KiwiSaver lock-in rules, you will be eligible for your 4% employer contributions to be tax-free. The annual benefit to you will be $1,056 a year (based on a 33 percent SSCWT rate).

Govt looks at international tax changes
=======================================

A government discussion document released today seeks feed-back on proposals for changing New Zealand's international tax rules, to improve the competitiveness of New Zealand companies operating overseas. The main proposal is to relax the controlled foreign company rules by introducing a tax exemption for active income from the offshore operations of New Zealand businesses. A further proposal is to reduce non-resident withholding tax rates in the tax treaties that New Zealand negotiates with other countries.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Reducing the tax burden for NZ companies offshore

A review of international tax rules aims to improve the competitiveness of New Zealand companies operating in export markets overseas, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Active income from the offshore operations of New Zealand companies may be exempted from domestic income tax to help them compete internationally," the Ministers said.

The possible change is outlined in a discussion document released today that seeks feedback on options for a major revamp of New Zealand's international tax rules.

"We are looking at a radical shift in our approach to taxing offshore income from our companies operating overseas, one that distinguishes between active income, such as manufacturing and industrial activity, and passive income, such as royalties and interest," said the Ministers.

"Under such a distinction, offshore active income would be exempt from New Zealand tax, rather than taxed as it is earned, as happens now.

"The current rules may encourage New Zealand companies to relocate their headquarters to some countries where their offshore income is treated more favourably. Reducing the tax burden will improve their competitiveness and help to ensure New Zealand retains more activity.

"For example, a New Zealand-based company with operations in China would be able to take the same advantage of China's tax holidays as companies from other countries. Under New Zealand's current international tax rules, however, the company would pay tax at a 33 per cent rate on such income.

"We want to ensure New Zealand companies operating offshore with subsidiaries can obtain the same advantages in another country as their competitors.

"The tax rules of nearly all other countries distinguish between active and passive income, and either delay taxing offshore active income until dividends are paid or exempt it altogether, as Australia does.

"The rules can also create high compliance costs because they require New Zealand-based firms overseas to calculate their income tax in accordance with New Zealand tax rules, even though there may be little or no additional tax to pay here once they have paid foreign tax.

"Our tax system plays an important role in fostering a competitive business environment. That is why it is a key focus of the government's Economic Transformation agenda.

"The possible change would bring us in line with most other OECD countries and reinforce our efforts to improve competitiveness under the Business Tax Review.

"Reform of the international tax rules was urged by many in submissions to the Business Tax Review especially large, export focused companies. It has also been raised with government by a number of business groups. Some firms consider a move to an active/passive regime as important, if not more important, than lowering the corporate tax rate.

"Also under consideration is a possible reduction in non-resident withholding tax rates in the tax treaties that we negotiate with other countries. This is levied when a non-resident derives interest, royalties or dividends from New Zealand. Lower rates would help encourage inward investment and would also benefit New Zealand firms investing offshore because reciprocal arrangements could apply as tax treaties were renegotiated.

"If the government proceeds with the changes outlined in the discussion document, it will be necessary to introduce complementary domestic tax base protection measures to ensure that only offshore active income is exempted. For example, if active foreign income becomes exempt from New Zealand tax, we would need to ensure that excessive interest is not deducted from New Zealand earned income

"We anticipate lively interest in the possible reform, and look forward to receiving submissions on the ideas canvassed in the discussion document. Submissions are due by 16 February 2007 and the government expects to be in a position to make decisions by the middle of next year," the Ministers said.

### Questions and Answers: International Tax Discussion Document

**1\. What are the major changes for New Zealand's international tax rules contained in the discussion document?**

The discussion document explores three key areas for change:

*   Relaxation of the current controlled foreign company (CFC) rules by introducing an active income exemption. In broad terms, "active" income would include income derived from active business, such as manufacturing or industrial activity. In contrast, passive income, which includes investment-type income such as dividends, interest, rents and royalties, would continue to be taxed on an accrual basis.
*   Related changes to other aspects of our international tax rules such as the interest allocation rules, to protect the New Zealand domestic tax base.
*   Possible changes to New Zealand's tax treaty policy on non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends, interest and royalties.

**2\. What are these changes intended to achieve?**

The possible changes outlined in the discussion document are aimed at improving New Zealand's international competitiveness. They would bring New Zealand's international tax system into line with international norms, recognising that there could be costs to being different. The tax system plays an important role in fostering a competitive business environment and, as such, is a key focus of the government's Economic Transformation agenda.

The changes are aimed at promoting an enabling environment that allows New Zealand firms to internationalise and makes New Zealand better able to attract and retain capital.

**Controlled foreign company (CFC) rules**

**3\. What are the CFC rules and how are our rules different?**

New Zealand's current CFC rules are designed to tax all offshore income of CFCs as it accrues, with a credit for foreign taxes paid. This approach is out of step with international norms, where active income is generally exempt from tax or has tax deferred until it is returned in the form of dividends. Australia, for example, has an active income exemption in its CFC rules.

**4\. Who will benefit from the proposed exemption for offshore active income?**

An exemption for the active income of CFCs would benefit New Zealand firms operating overseas by placing them on a more equal footing internationally. It would remove an additional tax cost not faced by firms based in comparable jurisdictions, such as Australia. These New Zealand firms would not only see a potential reduction in their tax burden, but a reduction in tax compliance costs would also be likely.

The example at the end of these questions and answers illustrates the benefits of such an exemption for a New Zealand firm with a manufacturing subsidiary in China.

**5\. How would the exemption for offshore active income improve New Zealand's international competitiveness?**

An exemption for offshore active income would make New Zealand relatively more attractive as a location for global firms. As the current CFC rules are more comprehensive than those of other countries, New Zealand-resident firms with offshore operations may face a higher tax burden than firms resident in comparable jurisdictions, creating an incentive for New Zealand firms to migrate. An exemption for offshore active income would align New Zealand's rules with those of other countries, removing this factor as an incentive for firms to migrate, and would make New Zealand more attractive for foreign investment. It would also reduce the tax costs for New Zealand firms looking to expand their operations offshore.

**6\. What other changes to the international tax rules are likely to be necessary if offshore active income is exempt from New Zealand tax?**

If offshore active income were exempt from New Zealand tax, consequential changes to the interest allocation rules would be necessary to protect the domestic tax base. The "grey list" exemption under the current CFC rules and the conduit rules might no longer be necessary if offshore active income were exempt from New Zealand tax.

**7\. What are the compliance cost implications for New Zealand firms?**

CFC rules with an active/passive distinction could be simpler in operation than our current rules for the types of firms and activities the change would seek to benefit. A firm with genuinely active operations abroad would no longer face the compliance costs of applying New Zealand tax rules to its foreign operations that exist under the current CFC rules. If dividends could be exempted, the firm would not need to comply with the dividend withholding payment rules.

The one area of extra complexity could be the extension of our interest allocation rules, which would be necessary to target the exemption appropriately. However, these rules should affect only those firms that over-allocate their global interest costs against their New Zealand income. In addition, these rules would rely on domestically available information, and should be reasonably straightforward to apply.

**8\. How would the new rules compare with Australia's?**

Changes canvassed in the discussion document would bring our CFC rules more in line with international norms and Australia's system of taxing offshore income. However, the design of the New Zealand system would need to reflect the realities of our business environment and other features of our tax system.

**9\. When will the government make decisions on the possible changes?**

The government recognises the importance of CFC reform for New Zealand-based firms with offshore CFC investment. Once submissions have been received and analysed, the government expects to be in a position to make decisions on the options by mid-2007.

**Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT)**

**10\. How would lower NRWT rates benefit New Zealand firms?**

Lower treaty rates of NRWT would encourage inward investment. This would complement a lowering of the company rate from 33% to 30%, one of the options set out in the recent Business Tax Review discussion document.

Lower treaty rates of NRWT would also benefit New Zealand firms investing offshore, because they would enjoy lower rates of foreign withholding tax. This would increase after-tax returns from outbound investment, consistent with the International Tax Review's focus on international competitiveness.

**11\. Why is the case for reducing NRWT on dividends stronger for direct investment than for portfolio investment?**

The international trend is to reduce rates on non-portfolio dividends. For example, Australia has agreed lower rates on such dividends with the United States and the United Kingdom, amongst others. Lower treaty limits on portfolio dividends are less common internationally. The OECD continues to recommend NRWT of 15% on such dividends, which is consistent with New Zealand's current treaty policy.

**12\. Why might reduced rates on interest and royalties not be justified?**

There are likely to be material fiscal costs and avoidance implications. These may outweigh any benefits associated with lower rates.

**13\. Why rely on double tax agreements? Why not just reduce rates in domestic law?**

Reducing rates of NRWT makes sense only if done through bilateral treaty negotiations because of the potential benefits of agreeing reciprocal changes with our major trading partners, which will benefit New Zealanders investing offshore.

**Example – Impact of an active income exemption**

The move to an active income exemption under New Zealand CFC rules would be a significant policy shift designed to benefit New Zealand firms with outbound investments.

Consider a New Zealand company, NZ Co, with a manufacturing subsidiary in China, China Co, which earns a net income of $100. Under China's foreign enterprise income tax, special reductions in tax rates are provided in the first years after an investment is made. This income is fully exempt in the first and second profitable years, and a fifteen percent rate of tax applies in the third, fourth and fifth years.

If China Co is in its first year of operation in China and is fully exempt from tax in China, NZ Co would still be subject to tax on that income in New Zealand under the current CFC rules. A company like NZ Co would be taxable in New Zealand on its global profits of $100, and would pay $33 in tax. On the other hand, if the foreign income were taxed in China at 15%, New Zealand would provide tax credits for any taxes paid in China. The total tax that the NZ Co faces would still have been $33 in total, but $15 would be paid to China and $18 to New Zealand.

If there were an active income exemption, New Zealand firms would be able to benefit from any tax exemption or reduced tax rate that China offers. The income of China Co would not be taxable in New Zealand. Taxes payable in New Zealand would be eliminated, and the net returns to New Zealand investors would increase correspondingly. This treatment would be consistent with other countries' treatment of offshore active income and would remove the current incentive for New Zealand firms to migrate to other countries to gain access to the reduced taxation.

Parliament passes tax bills
===========================

Parliament last night passed the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Taxation (Annual Rates of Income Tax) Bill, introduced in May as a single bill. The main focus of the new legislation is reform of the tax rules on income from share investments made through managed funds and by individuals. Other measures include changes relating to "salary sacrifice", people in New Zealand who have interests in Australian superannuation schemes, and extension of the KiwiSaver SSCWT tax exemption. The new legislation is expected to receive Royal assent within a few days. For more information see the [media statement](/news/2006/2006-12-13-parliament-passes-tax-bills#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Major investment income tax reforms welcomed

Revenue Minister Peter Dunne has welcomed the passage last night of law changes reforming New Zealand’s investment tax rules.

"The main purpose of the Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is to promote greater fairness in the tax rules for all investors. These new rules offer clear solutions to a number of long-standing problems with the investment tax rules," Mr Dunne said

"In particular, it removes the problem of lower-income earners being over-taxed on their earnings through managed funds and the over-taxation of managed funds' investments compared with individuals.

"This is a significant milestone in the lead-up to KiwiSaver next year, because managed funds will be the first investment choice for many thousands of ordinary investors who will be entering the scheme," Mr Dunne said.

"It is important for these investors – many of whom will be new to investment saving – to be taxed at their correct personal tax rate.

"The second part of the investment reforms deals with the taxation of income from offshore portfolio share investments.

"The basis of this reform is that New Zealanders should pay tax on their investment income whether it comes from New Zealand or overseas. The old rules allowed individuals who invested directly in the eight so-called "grey list" countries such as the US and the UK to pay little or no tax in New Zealand on their investment income, because companies in those countries often pay low or no taxable dividends.

"On the other hand, investors in shares in other countries such as India or Singapore have been fully taxed on their income. The new rules remove the bias in favour of investing in certain countries rather than others for tax reasons.

"The new rules will benefit ordinary New Zealanders saving through managed funds by:

*   taxing their savings at their actual tax rate – for example, 19.5%, and not 33%;
*   making capital gains on Australasian shares tax-free – they are currently taxable if made via a fund; and
*   applying the 5% fair dividend rate method to non-Australasian shares – funds are now normally taxed on capital gains plus dividends.

"These changes are important to make KiwiSaver work, because they remove tax penalties from investing in a managed fund.

"In addition to the measures contained in the bill, the Minister of Finance and I recently announced that the KiwiSaver tax exemption for employer contributions will be extended to other registered superannuation schemes. Again, this is a significant step forward in helping New Zealanders to save for their futures.

"This development, together with the new rules for the taxation of managed funds and offshore portfolio investment in shares will make for a much fairer and more consistent set of tax rules for New Zealand investors," said Mr Dunne.

Other tax measures included in the bill are:

*   Changes to the employer superannuation contribution rules to ensure employer superannuation contributions are taxed at the correct marginal rate for each employee and to minimise the potential for taxpayers to use excessive "salary sacrifice" as a means of paying less tax.
*   Changes to the tax rules on Australian superannuation funds to resolve compliance problems for people who have interests in these funds and to remove an associated potential tax disincentive for skilled people to come to New Zealand to work.
*   Changes to the tax treatment expenditure on geothermal wells, to remove uncertainty about the deductibility of capital losses arising from failed wells drilled in New Zealand. The new rules will also allow taxpayers to depreciate geothermal wells drilled or acquired between 1 April 2003 and 16 May 2006 and not yet in service from the beginning of the 2006 income year.
*   Changes to the tax exemption on income tax for operational allowances paid to military personnel on specified missions in designated operational areas. The exemption has been extended to apply to similar allowances paid to New Zealand police personnel serving in operational areas.

1 OFFICE OF THE MINISTER FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION AND OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF REVENUE Chair Cabinet STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS OVERSEAS PROPOSAL 1. This paper proposes that: • the amnesty on student loan penalties be extended; • borrowers overseas be automatically entitled to a three year repayment holiday with repayment obligations based on the size of borrowers’ loan balances when the holiday ends; • the penalty rate when borrowers fail to meet their repayment obligations be reduced; • interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans be abolished; • the meaning of ‘borrowers overseas’ be redefined; • interest write-offs that have been incorrectly given are not required to be reversed in cases where borrowers have repaid their loans; • the hardship provisions are altered so that they do not preclude borrowers being granted hardship relief in respect of payments made and that the Commissioner is given the discretion to remove the obligation to make repayments if payment would cause hardship; • borrowers are required to advise Inland Revenue when they have been, or expect to be, overseas for more than six months; and • the possibility of an overdue amount being subject to both interest and late payment penalties be removed. 2. The changes requested by the Cabinet Policy Committee at its meeting of 11 October 2006 have been incorporated into this paper. The additional information requested by that Committee (in relation to the treatment of overseas borrowers in other countries, the possibility of reciprocal agreements for the collection of student loans and the planned communication of the policy changes) is outlined in paragraphs 40-42 and paragraph 78. 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3. Interest-free loans have been accompanied by an amnesty on student loan penalties. Work on analysing the impact of interest-free loans and the amnesty has raised questions about the current regime for student loan borrowers overseas – this work has shown that the current approach is not working. In particular, the repayment regime for borrowers overseas is unaffordable for many and, combined with the existing penalty regime, may act as a deterrent for borrowers to return to New Zealand. This is contrary to the intent of both the amnesty and interest-free loans. This paper intends to rectify those problems. 4. A data match with the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) will help Inland Revenue to ensure that borrowers receive their correct entitlements and obligations. Work on the data match has raised issues about the working of the existing amnesty. It is estimated that as a result of a historic data match to establish entitlement to interest-free loans, 37,000 student loan borrowers will be identified who are currently being treated as resident but who should be treated as non-resident. It is also estimated that a further 6,000 borrowers will be identified as part of a separate exercise as having been non-resident in past years but who have returned to New Zealand and regained residency. 5. Once a borrower is identified as non-resident, the correct non-resident assessments must be established, resulting in penalties on borrowers’ accounts if they have not met their obligations. Establishing the correct assessments will, on average, increase loan balances in the order of $13,000 – $14,000 per borrower. 6. It is estimated that almost 80 percent of borrowers will have failed to meet their non-resident obligations, meaning that the existing regime for non-resident borrowers is not working in its current form. This paper recommends the following solutions: • extend the amnesty on student loan penalties to 31 March 2008 with a penalty to be added to borrowers’ loan balances if they do not come within it or fail to comply with its terms (to address the problem in the past of debt escalation discouraging borrowers from returning to New Zealand); • introduce a three year automatic repayment holiday for borrowers overseas with repayment obligations based on a three tier system according to the size of borrowers’ loan balances when the holiday ends (to address the problem going forward of debt escalation discouraging borrowers from returning to New Zealand); • reduce the penalty rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent per month when borrowers fail to meet their repayment obligations (so as to be less punitive when borrowers do not meet their obligations); 3 • remove the existing interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans (because the write-offs are inconsistent with the policy intent of interest-free loans); and • redefine the meaning of ‘borrowers overseas’ so that borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans would be subject to the overseas repayment regime provisions (so as to simplify which repayment regime borrowers are subject to). 7. The constraints of Inland Revenue’s student loan system have meant that the proposal to extend the amnesty on student loan penalties uses a different process than the existing amnesty. The system constraints also limit the options for setting repayment obligations going forward. 8. An estimated 41,000 borrowers have incorrectly received $143 million in interest write-offs which will need to be reversed. It is recommended that borrowers who have repaid their loans as at the date of announcement of policy changes in relation to student loan borrowers overseas not be required to have any interest write- off that was incorrectly given reversed. 9. It is also recommended that amendments be made to: • ensure that payment of obligations during the year does not preclude borrowers from being granted hardship relief in respect of those payments; • give the Commissioner the discretion to remove the obligation to make repayments if payment would cause serious hardship; • require borrowers to advise Inland Revenue when they have been, or expect to be, overseas for more than six months; and • remove any possibility of an overdue amount being subject to both interest and late payment penalties. 10. It is recommended that legislative changes to give effect to the proposals be included in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill, planned for introduction in October 2006. BACKGROUND 11. Interest-free student loans have increased the financial incentive for borrowers not to advise Inland Revenue when they go overseas. To mitigate this risk, Cabinet has agreed to a data match between Inland Revenue and Customs to determine which borrowers are eligible for interest-free loans (CAB Min (06) 5/4 refers). 4 PENALTIES ARISING FROM BORROWERS DETERMINED TO BE NON- RESIDENT 12. A historic data match in April 2007 will result in Inland Revenue becoming aware of an estimated 37,000 borrowers who are being treated as resident in New Zealand but who are actually overseas and non-resident. In addition, it is estimated that Inland Revenue will identify a further 6,000 borrowers who should have been treated as non-resident in past years as part of a separate exercise. These borrowers will be excluded from the historic data match because they have returned to New Zealand. Of the borrowers that will be identified as non-resident (whether as part of the historic match or as part of the separate exercise), an estimated 4,000 borrowers have repaid their loans. 13. Borrowers’ repayment obligations and entitlement to certain interest write-offs differ depending on whether they are resident or non-resident. 1 When a borrower’s residency status is updated the correct non-resident assessments must be established. Because the vast majority of, if not all, borrowers will have failed to have met their obligations, penalties will apply to the overdue amounts. It is estimated that establishing the correct assessments and penalties would, on average, increase loan balances in the order of $13,000 – $14,000 per borrower (bringing the average loan balance of affected borrowers to $28,000 - $30,000). GOING FORWARD – A NEW REGIME FOR BORROWERS OVERSEAS Extending the amnesty on student loan penalties 14. The existing amnesty allows borrowers non-resident as at 31 March 2006 with arrears and penalties to apply to Inland Revenue and have all penalties written off, provided that they meet their obligations under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 for two years. 15. Because the historic data match is not expected to occur until April 2007, borrowers whose correct residency status is established as a result of this match will not be eligible to come within the amnesty on student loan penalties (applications close on 31 March 2007). Not establishing borrowers’ arrears until after the amnesty ends will undermine the amnesty’s policy intent – to give borrowers in arrears a fresh start and to encourage borrowers to return to New Zealand. 16. To ensure that the purpose of the amnesty is not undermined, we consider that the application period for the amnesty should be extended until 31 March 2008. There is a risk that if the amnesty is not extended its objectives will be called into question, given that more non-residents will have penalties owing after the amnesty than before it. 1 Borrowers are considered non-resident if they have been out of New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period, provided they do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. 5 17. Under the existing amnesty eligible borrowers must have their correct liabilities established and then penalties are written-off when they come within the amnesty. 2 The constraints of Inland Revenue’s student loan system mean that the process of bringing the accounts of the 37,000 borrowers identified as non-resident as a result of the data match up to date would take 29 full time equivalent staff members 19 months to complete, not including the time taken to bring borrowers within the amnesty. Our recommended approach, therefore, is to use a different process for the extended amnesty. Like the existing amnesty, the extended version would apply to borrowers who were non-resident as at 31 March 2006. 18. It is recommended that the extended amnesty apply as follows: • the Commissioner is not required to raise non-resident assessments for past years if he has not already done so; • non-resident borrowers with arrears have existing penalties removed and assessments cancelled up to the date that a new repayment regime for borrowers overseas is introduced (compounding interest at the applicable rate(s) would apply on the loan balance over the period of default); • borrowers have the chance to apply to Inland Revenue for the amnesty and establish a repayment behaviour going forward in place of not establishing/removing penalties; • borrowers who apply for the amnesty and establish the required repayment behaviour do not have any penalties on their accounts; • the Commissioner is given a once only discretion to follow up any missed repayment and, provided the payment is made within one month of the Commissioner contacting the borrower, the missed payment is not treated as a failure to establish the required repayment behaviour; • borrowers who do not apply for the amnesty, or who apply but do not establish the required repayment behaviour, have a one-off penalty added to their loan balance; • borrowers have until 31 March 2008 to apply; • the 6,000 borrowers who will be identified as having been non-resident in past years but who have returned to New Zealand and regained residency as at 31 March 2006 will not be subject to any penalty (compounding interest at the applicable rate(s) would apply over the period of default); and • the 4,000 borrowers who have repaid their loans as at the date of announcement of the changes will not have their loans reopened. 2 It is a legislative requirement for the correct liabilities to be established. 6 19. While the above process is different to the existing amnesty, the net effect of the approach is an extension of the existing amnesty with a one-off penalty added to the loan balance of borrowers if they do not come within it or fail to comply with its terms. Compounding interest would continue to apply on the loan balance of borrowers who come within the amnesty. Required repayment behaviour 20. Borrowers will be required to apply to Inland Revenue to come within the amnesty. It is recommended that borrowers be considered to have complied with the amnesty terms if they repay an amount based on the size of their loan balance each year for two years as follows: • $1,000 for loan balances of $15,000 or less; • $2,000 for loan balances of $15,001 - $30,000; and • $3,000 for loan balances of over $30,000. 21. Payments would be due six monthly and would go towards reducing the amount owed by the borrower. It is further recommended that the Commissioner have the ability to reduce the amount payable in cases of serious hardship. Borrowers would be required to provide proof of the hardship and would still be expected to show some commitment to repay, even if it is just a nominal amount. Penalty added to borrowers’ loan balances 22. If borrowers do not apply for the amnesty, or fail to meet the required repayment behaviour, a one-off penalty would be added to their loan balance as a penalty for being non-compliant. We consider it important from an equity perspective that borrowers who have demonstrated that they want to do the right thing (ie borrowers who comply with the amnesty terms) are better off than those who do not. 23. It is recommended that the penalty added to borrowers’ accounts be: • the lesser of 5 percent of the borrower’s loan balance or the penalties under the existing rules; • in proportion to the degree of non-compliance with the required repayment behaviour so that borrowers who meet part of the required repayment behaviour are not subject to the full penalty; • be subject to compounding interest until it is repaid or until the borrower returns to New Zealand and is eligible for an interest-free loan; • added as at 31 March 2008, for borrowers who do not come within the amnesty; and 7 • added at the end of the tax year in which the failure to meet the amnesty terms occurred, for borrowers who come within the amnesty but fail to meet the required repayment behaviour. 24. The average penalty added to borrowers’ loan balances would be $1,050. A penalty of this level recognises that penalties have accumulated on borrowers’ accounts under a repayment regime which is unaffordable for many. Borrowers who come within the existing amnesty 25. Borrowers who come within the existing amnesty would become subject to the new amnesty terms but would be given credit for repayments already received. For example, if a borrower had applied for the existing amnesty and had met their repayment obligations for one year, they would only have one year of repayments left to make to meet the amnesty terms (repayments would be based on the size of their loan balance, as outlined above). Generally, the extended amnesty is more favourable than the existing amnesty because the required repayments are lower and the penalty added when borrowers come within the amnesty but do not meet its terms is lower. Equity issues 26. While it could be argued that the recommended approach is inequitable for resident borrowers whose arrears have already been established and compliant non- resident borrowers, the equity arguments can also be made with the existing amnesty. It could also be argued that it is inequitable that the 6,000 borrowers who were non- resident but who had regained their residency are not subject to any penalty on their accounts (these borrowers are not eligible to come within the existing amnesty 3 ). 27. On the other hand, it could be argued that extending the amnesty as outlined above is in fact equitable because the current repayment regime for non-residents is unaffordable for many (and as a consequence of the unaffordable regime penalties have accumulated on borrowers’ accounts). Repayment regime for borrowers overseas going forward Existing regime 28. Non-resident repayment obligations were designed so that loans would be repaid in a maximum of 15 years. This is achieved by requiring quarterly payments of a fixed amount of the principal (based on the loan balance at the beginning of the tax year following the year of departure), plus the estimated interest for the year. If the loan balance is less than $15,000, $1,000 of principal is required each year. For loans over $15,000, principal of 1/15th of the original loan balance is required. 3 Borrowers who have regained residency as at 31 March 2006 are not eligible to come within the existing amnesty. 8 29. For many borrowers the amount that they are expected to pay is simply not achievable. For example, a non-resident borrower with a loan balance of $60,000 will have a repayment obligation in the first year following departure from New Zealand of nearly $8,000. A resident borrower would need to have income of nearly $100,000 to have the same liability. Going forward 30. Given that it is estimated that almost 80 percent of borrowers have failed to meet their non-resident obligations, the non-resident repayment regime is clearly not working in its current form. The existing regime is unaffordable for many borrowers and is not consistent with the objective of encouraging borrowers to return to New Zealand. We consider that the repayment regime for borrowers overseas must be changed at the same time the amnesty is extended for the amnesty to meet its stated objectives. The constraints of Inland Revenue’s student loan system limit the potential options for setting repayment obligations for borrowers overseas (for example, setting obligations on a table mortgage basis is not possible with the existing system). 31. Going forward, we recommend that from 1 April 2007 borrowers overseas be automatically entitled to a three-year repayment holiday. Borrowers would not have repayment obligations for that period but compounding interest would apply to the loan balance. After the repayment holiday ends, annual repayment obligations would be based on the size of borrowers’ loan balances. Repayment holiday 32. A limited repayment holiday means that those going overseas short term have their loan balances increase at a reasonable rate (ie at the annual interest rate), removing a barrier to such borrowers returning to New Zealand. A repayment holiday acknowledges the New Zealand tradition of taking OEs – which can confer benefits on New Zealand – during which borrowers typically have low incomes. 33. Furthermore, migration statistics for the general population show that around 70 percent of New Zealanders return within three years. This suggests that giving a three-year repayment holiday would cover the majority of cases and would leave the penalty regime to deal only with those non-compliant, long term emigrants. Charging interest while borrowers are on the holiday is sufficient to cover the Government’s cost of borrowing and administration. 34. One potential disadvantage of a repayment holiday is that it would not distinguish between those going overseas on a short term basis and those going overseas long term. While it may be perceived as inequitable that borrowers in New Zealand have compulsory obligations while those overseas do not for three years, this perception risk is minimised somewhat in that the holiday only applies for a limited period. Furthermore, income contingency protects domestic borrowers when their 9 earnings are below a threshold. Borrowers in New Zealand are also entitled to interest-free loans, while those overseas are not. Detailed design 35. It is recommended that borrowers who do not use the full holiday period be entitled to use the remainder of the period the next time they became an overseas borrower. 36. It is also recommended that borrowers could opt not to use the repayment holiday if they wished. It is further recommended that borrowers who are already overseas as at 1 April 2007 are entitled to a repayment holiday as follows: • borrowers who have been compliant and borrowers who have been non- resident for less than one year are entitled to a three-year repayment holiday; • borrowers who have been non-compliant and who come within the amnesty and meet its terms are eligible to apply to Inland Revenue for a three-year repayment holiday once they have met the amnesty’s required repayment behaviour (if borrowers did not apply to Inland Revenue they would automatically be entitled to a three-year holiday the next time they became an overseas borrower); • borrowers who have been non-compliant and who do not come within the amnesty or who come within the amnesty and fail to meet its terms are entitled to a repayment holiday depending on the length of time they have been non-resident: • borrowers who have been non-resident for one year or more but less than two years are eligible for a two-year holiday; • borrowers who have been non-resident for more than two years but less than three years are eligible for a one-year holiday; and • borrowers who have been non-resident for more than three years are not eligible for a repayment holiday. Repayment obligations once holiday ends / if holiday not used 37. It is recommended that after the repayment holiday ends, or if borrowers elect not to use the repayment holiday, annual repayment obligations (with payments due six monthly) would be based on the size of borrowers’ loan balances as follows: • $1,000 for loan balances of $15,000 or less; • $2,000 for loan balances of $15,001 - $30,000; and • $3,000 for loan balances of over $30,000. 10 38. Repayment obligations set in this manner would be relatively simple for borrowers to understand, are more affordable than the existing repayment regime and are sufficiently high so that repayments would exceed interest charges for most borrowers, resulting in borrowers’ loan balances decreasing over time. Hardship provisions would be retained so that borrowers could renegotiate their repayment obligations with Inland Revenue if they are unable to meet them. 39. The disadvantage of a tiered system is that there is potential inequity around the steps. With a $15,000 loan balance, the repayment obligation is 7 percent of the principal. With a loan balance of $15,001, the repayment obligation is 13 percent of the principal. We do consider, however, this system to be more equitable than one where repayment obligations are fixed and not based on the size of borrowers’ loan balances (such as a repayment obligation of $1,000 per year for all borrowers). Treatment of borrowers overseas in other countries 40. The treatment of borrowers overseas in other countries is outlined below: Country Treatment of overseas borrowers Australia No annual repayment obligations while non-resident for tax purposes. Borrowers’ loans increase at the rate of inflation. Voluntary repayments of $500 or more attract a 10% discount (eg if a borrower repays $500, their loan balance will decrease by $550). England Annual repayment obligations of borrowers who provide income details are 9% of gross income above a threshold. The threshold is calculated by reference to the price level index of the borrower’s country of residence. For example, a borrower living outside England but living elsewhere in the United Kingdom with an income of £50,000 pounds would have a repayment obligation of £2,250. Annual repayment obligations of borrowers who do not provide income details are a fixed amount, based on the price level index of the borrower’s country of residence. For example, a borrower living outside England but living elsewhere in the United Kingdom would have a repayment obligation of £2,952. A defaulting borrower may be required to repay the whole of their loan. The rate of interest (equal to the rate of inflation) may be tripled. Canada Annual repayment obligations are calculated on a table mortgage basis. Borrowers who default may be reported to a credit agency (default can affect a borrower’s credit rating) and legal action may be taken. Interest charged on the loan is equivalent to the rate of interest charged on loans by chartered banks to their most credit-worthy customers + 2.5% (if a floating interest rate is selected) or + 5% (if a fixed interest rate is selected). Tax credits for a portion of the interest are available. Reciprocal agreements for the collection of student loans 41. Between mid-2000 and early 2003 the possibility of a reciprocal agreement with Australia for the collection of student loans was actively pursued by Inland Revenue. It was also raised at Ministerial level. However, as Australia does not require 11 payments from its non-resident borrowers, full reciprocity could not be achieved. An alternative of the Australian Tax Office (ATO) acting on Inland Revenue’s behalf on a fee basis was also explored. The ATO’s conclusion was that the proposal did not appear to financially advantageous to either party. 42. The possibility of a reciprocal agreement was also pursued with the United Kingdom with a possible option being developed. However, the United Kingdom showed little interest in this proposal. On 15 September 2006 the Commissioner raised the issue with the United Kingdom Acting Chairman. He undertook to look into it further, but indicated that current significant organisational changes and other priorities would likely mean that there would be little to no interest in taking up this issue. Setting the penalty rate going forward 43. The current penalty rate when borrowers fail to meet their obligations is 2 percent per month compounding on the amount outstanding, which equates to an annual rate of 26.82 percent (the rate applies to borrowers in New Zealand and borrowers overseas). This rate is often criticised as being too punitive. 44. The penalty rate needs to be set at a level which is not excessive but which discourages borrowers from repaying other debt in preference to meeting their student loan obligations. We therefore recommend that the penalty rate be set at 1.5 percent compounding per month, which is equivalent to a annual rate of 19.57 percent (similar to standard credit card rate). We recommend that this rate apply from 1 April 2007 and apply to both borrowers in New Zealand and borrowers overseas. Removing interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest-free loans 45. We consider that the interest write-offs that can apply when borrowers have been overseas for more than six months and are not eligible for interest-free loans should be reviewed. It is expected that very few borrowers are eligible for these write-offs. The interest write-offs are as follows: Full interest write-off for borrowers studying 46. Currently, resident borrowers who are not eligible for an interest-free loan for an entire tax year may be eligible for a full interest write-off for the entire year if they have studied for part of that year. Eligible borrowers who complete their study part way through the academic year are entitled to a full interest write-off to 31 March the following year. Borrowers receive the write-off even if they have been overseas for most of the year. 12 Base interest write-off for resident borrowers 47. Borrowers who are not eligible for an interest-free loan, who retain their tax residency and who earn below the repayment threshold are eligible to have their base interest written off for up to two years. Partial base interest write-off for resident borrowers 48. Borrowers who are not eligible for an interest-free loan, who retain their tax residency and whose base interest charged is more than half of their repayment obligation are eligible to have the difference written off for up to two years. Recommendation 49. Because retaining interest write-offs for borrowers overseas is inconsistent with the policy intent of interest-free loans (which is to encourage borrowers to remain in, or return to, New Zealand) we recommend the write-offs for residents be abolished from 1 April 2007. Abolishing the full interest write-off for borrowers studying would mean that the data match that currently occurs between the Ministry of Education and Inland Revenue to verify borrowers’ study status could be removed. Interest write-off for borrowers studying full-time overseas 50. The Commissioner can grant an exemption to the interest-free loans rules regarding time overseas so that borrowers who are studying full-time overseas at postgraduate level are eligible for interest-free loans. We recommend that this exemption be extended from 1 April 2007 so that borrowers studying overseas at undergraduate level are also eligible. This would mean that the existing base interest write-off/reduction for non-resident borrowers studying overseas could be abolished. 51. To qualify for the exemption it is recommended that borrowers provide Inland Revenue with verification from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority that their study leads towards a qualification equivalent to level 7 (bachelors degree level) on the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications. It is also recommended that borrowers provide Inland Revenue with evidence from their overseas tertiary education provider that establishes their full-time enrolment in the undergraduate course. This approach would be consistent with the current treatment for borrowers studying overseas at postgraduate level. Redefining ‘borrowers overseas’ 52. Currently, borrowers’ residency status for student loans purposes is based on tax residence. Tax residence can be difficult to determine because it is subject to whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand which is not always clear cut. It also makes administration of the student loan scheme difficult and costly and 13 makes it complicated for borrowers to understand which repayment regime they are subject to. 53. Going forward, from 1 April 2007 we consider that repayment obligations should be de-linked from tax residence and instead based on whether borrowers satisfy the eligibility criteria for an interest-free loan. Aligning repayment conditions with when a borrower ceases to be entitled to an interest-free loan will provide simplicity in that there will be just one clear cut rule for both – borrowers are either eligible for an interest-free loan and therefore subject to the repayment regime for borrowers living in New Zealand or not eligible for an interest-free loan and subject to the repayment regime for borrowers overseas. Borrowers who are granted an exemption to the interest-free rules regarding time overseas and who lose their tax residency would be required to declare their worldwide income to Inland Revenue so that their repayment obligations (which would be based on their income) could be calculated. 4 INTEREST WRITE-OFFS INCORRECTLY GIVEN 54. Resident borrowers are eligible to receive a base interest write-off if their income is below the repayment threshold or a partial base interest write-off if the base interest they are charged is more than half of their repayment obligation. Borrowers must file a tax return or respond to a personal tax summary (PTS) to be entitled to the interest write-offs. Inland Revenue has, however, been giving interest write-offs to all borrowers showing as resident in the above two categories, regardless of whether they have responded to a PTS. 55. If a borrower’s residency status is changed to non-resident, the interest write- offs that were received while the borrower was non-resident will be reversed. It is estimated that 36,000 borrowers will be identified as part of the historic data match and a further 5,000 borrowers will be identified as part of a separate exercise as having incorrectly received interest write-offs (borrowers in this second category will not be identified as part of the historic data match because they returned to New Zealand before 1 April 2006). 5 The amount of interest write-offs to be reversed for the affected borrowers is estimated as follows: 4 Generally, borrowers who are overseas for more than six months are ineligible for an interest-free loan. In certain circumstances, however, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can grant an exemption to this rule. 5 Not all borrowers identified as non-resident as part of the historic data match or the separate exercise received base interest write-offs that they were not entitled to receive. 14 Interest write-off reversal Average per borrower Total 6 Borrowers identified as non-resident as part of historic data match $3,700 $126m Borrowers identified as non-resident as part of separate exercise $3,300 $10m Borrowers who have repaid their loans $1,700 $7m Total $3,500 $143m 56. It should be noted that the figures above underestimate the true increase in borrowers’ loan balances because of the effect of compounding interest. It is estimated that the actual increase could be in the order of an additional $40 million. 57. It is likely that affected borrowers will feel aggrieved at seeing their loan balances increase when interest write-offs are reversed. However, we see no reason why such borrowers should keep the interest write-offs they have received. Not reversing the interest write-offs would mean that these borrowers are better off than compliant resident borrowers (who earn above the repayment threshold or whose base interest charged is at least half of their repayment obligation) and compliant non- resident borrowers. Reversing interest write-offs received by non-resident borrowers would have the effect of correcting their loan balances and would be consistent with the treatment under the existing amnesty. Inland Revenue is considering how to best communicate interest write-off reversals to affected borrowers. Borrowers who have repaid their loans 58. Of the borrowers that Inland Revenue will identify as non-resident (either as a result of the data match or as a result of the separate exercise), it is estimated that 4,000 borrowers will have received a letter from Inland Revenue congratulating them on repaying their loan. You are asked to agree that borrowers who have repaid their loans as at the date of announcement of the above policy changes not be required to have any interest write-off that was incorrectly given reversed. MINOR OR REMEDIAL CHANGES Hardship 59. The Student Loan Scheme Act allows for relief from payment of a borrower’s compulsory repayment obligation in cases of serious hardship. However, there is conflict in the wording of the provision and Inland Revenue’s opinion is that relief cannot be given in respect of any payment that has already been made. 6 Totals may not add due to rounding. 15 60. We recommend that an amendment be made to the hardship provisions to ensure that payment of obligations during the year do not preclude borrowers from being granted hardship relief in respect of those payments. We further recommend that the Commissioner be given the discretion to remove the obligation to make payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the year if it is considered that the borrower is likely to qualify for relief from his or her annual compulsory repayment obligation on the grounds of serious hardship. Requirement for borrowers to advise Inland Revenue when leaving New Zealand 61. Currently, borrowers are required to advise Inland Revenue when they have been, or expect to be, out of New Zealand for more than three months. We recommend that this time period be changed to six months, which would link more closely with entitlement to interest-free loans. (Generally, borrowers who have been overseas for more than six months are ineligible for interest-free loans.) The amendment would apply from 1 April 2007. Charging interest 62. Interest on student loans is charged under the loan contract not the Student Loan Scheme Act. Interest ceases to be payable once an amount becomes overdue as overdue amounts are subject to a monthly two percent compounding penalty. Until last year the contract provided for this. However, the 2005 and 2006 loan contracts are missing the necessary wording and it is possible that student loan arrears could be subject to both interest and late payment penalties. (For borrowers present in New Zealand for six months or more the interest would be written-off because such borrowers are eligible for interest-free loans.) StudyLink will restore the appropriate wording in next year’s contracts. 63. We recommend that a legislative amendment be made to remove any possibility of an overdue amount being subject to both interest and late payment penalties. The amendment would apply from the date of commencement of the Student Loan Scheme, ie from 1 April 1992. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS 64. The processes required to action the proposed policy changes are very manually intensive. Therefore, there is a high administrative and resource cost associated with the implementation of the proposed policies. System changes will be made in 2007/08 to automate some of the processes for future years. 65. It is estimated that following administrative funding is required to implement the changes: 16 $ million increase / (decrease) 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 & out-years Operating 6.645 0.768 0.919 0.919 Advertising (other operating) 2.000 - - - Capital 1.675 - - - Total 10.320 0.768 0.919 0.919 66. A $2 million advertising component in 2007/08 will communicate the complex policy changes to borrowers (in New Zealand and overseas) and key influencers (such as family, friends and colleagues) in New Zealand. 67. You are asked to increase funding to implement the changes as follows: $ million increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/2011 2011/12 2012/13 & outyears Operating balance impact 8.512 0.635 0.786 0.786 0.786 - Debt impact 1.675 - - - - - No impact 0.133 0.133 0.133 0.133 0.133 - Total 10.320 0.768 0.919 0.919 0.919 - 68. In addition, you are asked to approve the following changes to appropriations to implement the changes: 17 $ million increase / (decrease) 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 & outyears Departmental Output Expense: Services to inform the public about entitlements and meeting obligations (funded by revenue Crown) 8.495 0.518 0.669 0.669 0.669 - Service to process obligations and entitlements (funded by revenue Crown) 0.100 - - - - - Management of debt and outstanding returns (funded by revenue Crown) 0.050 0.250 0.250 0.250 0.250 - Capital Contributions to the Department Capital Investment 1.675 - - - - - Total Operating impact 8.645 0.768 0.919 0.919 0.919 - Total Debt impact 1.675 - - - - - 69. Furthermore, you are asked to agree that the drawdown of the $2 million advertising component of the above appropriations requires approval by joint Ministers, following consideration of the proposed advertising programme and strategy. 70. Inland Revenue officials have advised that they may be able to use departmental savings to fund part of the administration costs and will report back to joint Ministers later this year on whether this is possible. FISCAL IMPLICATIONS 71. The recognition of historical interest and penalties on the accounts of those borrowers identified as non-resident is estimated to have the following impact, which increases the operating balance by a corresponding amount: 18 $ million increase / (decrease) 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 & outyears Fair value recognition 141.960 - - - 72.

It is recommended that you agree that the above changes to appropriations for 2006/07 be included in the 2006/07 Supplementary Estimates and that, in the interim, these expenses be met from Imprest Supply. 75. The above adjustments are estimates and there may be a need to revisit the appropriation impact if the assumptions underlying the estimates change significantly. LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS 76. We recommend that legislation to give effect to the above proposals be included in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill, planned for introduction in October 2006. The Bill gives effect to the data match between Inland Revenue and Customs and currently has a category 2 priority – must be passed before the end of the year. 19 77. The existing amnesty ends on 31 March 2007. Ideally, legislation to extend the amnesty and to change the repayment regime for borrowers overseas would be enacted prior to this date to avoid least retrospective application. PUBLICITY AND COMMUNICATION OF POLICY CHANGES 78. We plan to issue a press statement outlining the changes upon the introduction of a Bill. Officials are currently working through a strategy to communicate the policy changes to borrowers. The changes will also be publicised in a Tax Information Bulletin following the passing of a Bill. FURTHER WORK 79. A business case for rebuilding Inland Revenue’s student loan system is due to be considered as part of the Budget 2007 process. Officials will also report to joint Ministers on: • a strategy to increase repayments made by student loan borrowers overseas by June 2007; and • the impact/effectiveness of the key policy changes in this paper by June 2008 and the actual cost of these policies with any unspent portion being returned to the Crown. 80. We have been advised by Treasury officials that they will be seeking improvements not only in the systems underpinning the student loan debt recovery, but also the strategy and departmental accountabilities for ensuring improvements in the way the student loan scheme is managed and debt, especially in relation to borrowers overseas, is recovered. REGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT 81. A regulatory impact statement is attached. A business compliance cost statement is not required because the proposal does not impose any compliance costs on business. HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 82. The proposals in this paper appear to be consistent with the rights and freedoms affirmed in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. A final view will be possible after the amendments are drafted for inclusion in the Bill. 20 CONSULTATION 83. Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Justice have been consulted in the preparation of this paper. RECOMMENDATIONS 84. We recommend that Cabinet: Amnesty on student loan penalties 1. Agree to extend the amnesty on student loan penalties so that: • the Commissioner is not required to raise non-resident assessments for past years if he has not already done so; • non-resident borrowers with arrears have existing penalties removed and assessments cancelled up to the date that a new repayment regime for borrowers overseas is introduced (compounding interest at the applicable rate(s) would apply on the loan balance over the period of default); • borrowers have the chance to apply to Inland Revenue for the amnesty and establish a repayment behaviour going forward in place of not establishing/removing penalties; • borrowers who apply for the amnesty and establish the required repayment behaviour do not have any penalties on their accounts; • the Commissioner is given a once only discretion to follow up any missed payment and, provided the payment is made within one month of the Commissioner contacting the borrower, the missed payment is not treated as a failure to establish the required repayment behaviour; • borrowers who do not apply for the amnesty, or who apply but do not establish the required repayment behaviour, have a one-off penalty added to their loan balance; • the amnesty applies to borrowers who were non-resident as at 31 March 2006; • borrowers have until 31 March 2008 to apply; • borrowers who will be identified as having been non-resident in past years but who have returned to New Zealand and regained residency as at 31 March 2006 will not be subject to any penalty (compounding 21 interest at the applicable rate(s) would apply over the period of default); and • borrowers who have repaid their loans as at the date of the announcement of the changes will not have their loan reopened. 2. Agree that borrowers be considered to have complied with the terms of the amnesty if they repay an amount based on the size of their loan balance each year for two years (with payments due six monthly) as follows: • $1,000 for loan balances of $15,000 or less; • $2,000 for loan balances of $15,001 - $30,000; and • $3,000 for loan balances of over $30,000. 3. Agree that the Commissioner be given the discretion to reduce the amount payable in cases of serious hardship. 4. Agree that the penalty added to borrowers’ loan balances when they do not come within the amnesty or fail to meet its terms be: • the lesser of 5 percent of the borrower’s loan balance or the penalties under the existing rules; • in proportion to the degree of non-compliance with the required repayment behaviour so that borrowers who meet part of the required repayment behaviour are not subject to the full penalty; • subject to compounding interest until it is repaid or until the borrower returns to New Zealand and is eligible for an interest-free loan; • added as at 31 March 2008, for borrowers who do not come within the amnesty; and • added at the end of the tax year in which the failure to meet the amnesty terms occurred, for borrowers who come within the amnesty but fail to meet the required repayment behaviour. Repayment regime for borrowers overseas going forward 5. Agree that the existing repayment regime for non-resident borrowers be abolished and that from 1 April 2007: • borrowers overseas automatically be entitled to a three-year repayment holiday; 22 • borrowers who do not use the full holiday period be entitled to use the remainder of the period the next time they became an overseas borrower; and • borrowers have the ability to elect not to use the repayment holiday. 6. Agree that borrowers already overseas as at 1 April 2007 be entitled to a repayment holiday as follows: • borrowers who have been compliant and borrowers who have been non-resident for less than one year be automatically entitled to a three- year repayment holiday; • borrowers who have been non-compliant and who come within the amnesty and meet its terms are eligible to apply to Inland Revenue for a three-year repayment holiday once they have met the amnesty’s required repayment behaviour; • borrowers who have been non-compliant and who do not come within the amnesty or who come within the amnesty and fail to meet its terms be automatically entitled to a repayment holiday depending on the length of time they have been non-resident: • borrowers who have been non-resident for one year or more but less than two years are eligible for a two-year holiday; • borrowers who have been non-resident for more than two years but less than three years are eligible for a one-year holiday; and • borrowers who have been non-resident for more than three years are not eligible for a repayment holiday. 7. Agree that annual repayment obligations after the holiday ends or for borrowers who elect not to use the repayment holiday (with payments due six monthly) be set at: • $1,000 for loan balances of $15,000 or less; • $2,000 for loan balances of $15,001 - $30,000; and • $3,000 for loan balances of over $30,000. Penalty rate going forward 8. Agree to reduce the penalty rate applicable when borrowers in New Zealand and borrowers overseas fail to meet their obligations from 2 percent per month compounding on the amount outstanding to 1.5 percent per month from 1 April 2007. 23 Interest write-offs for borrowers ineligible for interest free loans 9. Agree that the full interest write-off for resident borrowers studying (and the data match between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Education to verify borrowers’ study status) be abolished. 10. Agree that the base interest write-off for resident borrowers earning under the repayment threshold be abolished. 11. Agree that the partial base interest write-off for resident borrowers whose base interest charged is more than 50 percent of their repayment obligation be abolished. 12. Agree that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be able to grant an exemption to the interest-free loans rules regarding time overseas so that borrowers who are studying full-time overseas at undergraduate level are eligible for interest-free loans and to abolish the base interest write- off/reduction for non-resident borrowers studying overseas. 13. Agree that in defining study status for borrowers studying at undergraduate level: • undergraduate level is study that leads towards a qualification equivalent to level 7 (bachelors degree) on the New Zealand Register of Quality Assured Qualifications; • applicants must provide Inland Revenue with verification from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority that establishes the equivalency of the course; and • applicants must provide Inland Revenue with evidence from their overseas tertiary education provider that establishes their full-time enrolment in the undergraduate course. 14. Agree that the changes in recommendations 9 – 13 apply from 1 April 2007. Redefining ‘borrowers overseas’ 15. Agree that borrowers’ residency status be de-linked from tax residence and instead be based on whether a borrower is eligible for an interest-free loan from 1 April 2007. 24 Interest write-offs incorrectly given 16. Note that it is estimated that 41,000 borrowers have received $143 million in interest write-offs to which they were not entitled and these write-offs will need to be reversed. 17. Agree that borrowers who have repaid their loans as at the date of announcement of the above policy changes not be required to have any interest write-off that was incorrectly given reversed. Minor or remedial changes 18. Agree that an amendment be made to the hardship provisions to ensure that payment of obligations during the year does not preclude borrowers from being granted hardship relief in respect of those payments. 19. Agree that the Commissioner be given the discretion to remove the obligation to make payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the year if it is considered that the borrower is likely to qualify for relief from his or her annual compulsory repayment obligation on the grounds of serious hardship. 20. Agree that borrowers be required to advise Inland Revenue when they have been, or expect to be, out of New Zealand for more than six months. 21. Agree that recommendations 18 – 20 apply from 1 April 2007. 22. Agree to an amendment to apply from 1 April 1992 to remove any possibility of an overdue amount being subject to both interest and late payment penalties for any liability which arises.
