The Public Remedials Log was launched today. It seeks to inform the public about remedial legislative issues that Inland Revenue has considered. It also tracks the progress of each item through the legislative amendment process. Certain issues have been redacted because they contain sensitive information; these redactions will be regularly reviewed.

[Consultation opens on FIF rules](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2024/consultation-opens-on-fif-rules)

06 December 2024

Inland Revenue has launched consultation on policy proposals to address an aspect of New Zealand’s foreign investment fund rules. By imposing tax on unrealised income the current rules could be deterring some people from choosing to settle in New Zealand. The proposal suggests allowing some migrants to pay tax on dividends and realised gains.

Question 5: In your Inland Revenue Department how do you use Wellbeing Frameworks in your decision making, measurement and reporting? Question 6: In Inland Revenue Department how do you interface with values around nature? Inland Revenue provided support to the Tax Working Group and the development of He Ara Waiora in 2018, which has the goal of creating a more future-focused tax system by engaging tikanga Māori. The Exploring Te Ao Māori Perspectives on the Living Standards Framework for the Tax Working Group is available on the Treasury’s website: https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-09/dp18-11.pdf . While Inland Revenue does not use the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework for all policy projects, aspects of the Framework are referenced depending on the nature of policy questions, usually in the context of major reforms such as in the Tax Working Group’s 2018 Future of Tax Final Report: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- final-report.html. Inland Revenue relies on framework thinking to assess policy issues and make informed decisions and recommendations. The primary framework is a set of well-established tax policy design principles. Those principles are: 1. Efficiency and growth: Taxes should be, to the greatest extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g. causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. a. Efficiency also encompasses environmental protection through the use of an externalities framework. Externalities are where there are affects on third parties that are not taken into account by the people undertaking the activity – a common issue with environmental resources. 2. Equity and fairness: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on Page 3 of 4 Ref: 22OIA1499 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. 3. Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. 4. Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the tax system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. 5. Compliance and administration cost: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. 6. Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. An example of Inland Revenue using this framework is in the recent Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) on limiting interest deductibility on residential investment property. This is publicly available on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website: https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021-ris -interest-deductibility . The RIS relied on these principles to assess the proposal to: 1. Improve housing affordability for first home buyers 2. Maintain the rate of development of new housing stock; and 3. Improve housing affordability in the rental market Frameworks like this have been used for a very long time to assess the design of the tax system, including in the McLeod Tax Review of 2001, The Tax Working Group of 2010, and the Tax Working Group of 2018. For further detail about Inland Revenue’s tax policy framework, you can go to: https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/en/publications/2012/2012- other-bim/3-policy-challenges. Inland Revenue is also developing an officials’ framework for environmental and resource pricing. Once complete, this framework will be used by officials in central and local government to determine whether a pricing instrument such as a tax, cap and trade regime, subsidy or resource charge is an appropriate tool to address a given environmental or resource issue. It is intended that the framework will increase New Zealand’s toolkit of responses so it can effectively address a growing number of complex environmental and resource challenges. Inland Revenue does focus on delivering the Tiriti o Waitangi obligations of incorporating Māori principles, concepts and practices into the way Inland Revenue works through Māhutonga. Māhutonga is Inland Revenue’s programme that seeks to build Māori cultural capabilities thourgh Te Arapiki, a stair-cased learning approach that aligns to the expectations set out by Te Arawhiti (the Office for Māori Crown Relations) for all public servants. Te Mata o Te Arero is our Māori language plan which supports the revitalisation of te reo Māori.

### Consultation on Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements

* * *

### Executive summary

#### Discussion document

On 6 September 2016 the Government released a discussion document seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements in line with the recommendations in Action 2 of the OECD BEPS programme (T2016/1319 IR2016/342 refers).

#### Submissions and subsequent meetings

20 submissions were received on the discussion document. 6 were from corporates and financial institutions, 4 were from industry bodies, 2 were from private individuals and 8 were from professional services firms. A list of submitters is included as Appendix 1 to this report.

Following the submissions, Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have:

*   met with a number of submitters to further discuss their submissions; and
*   embarked on a series of five monthly workshops with Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand and the Corporate Taxpayers Group.

We have also been discussing hybrid issues with the Australian Tax Office, the Australian Treasury and the OECD secretariat. This report summarises the submissions received and (where relevant) our initial responses to those submissions, noting that consultation is ongoing with some of these matters yet to be covered. It also seeks your agreement to the timeframes for the remainder of the policy process.

Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals both in general views and specific coverage. Some submitters were supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions for hybrid regulatory capital. However, a greater number were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand.

Submissions also covered a number of specific aspects of, and general concerns with, the proposals, including the complexity of the proposals and that New Zealand should not be in the first wave of countries adopting the proposals.

#### Officials’ response to submissions

Nothing compelling has emerged in the course of consultation to date to suggest that full implementation of the hybrid rules generally as envisaged in the discussion document should not be pursued. We remain of the view that the proposals are likely to be in New Zealand’s best interests.

#### Post-discussion document developments outside New Zealand

We note that since the discussion document was released, the UK hybrid rules have come into force (1 January 2017), the EU has released a binding directive which requires EU members to expand their hybrid rules so that they apply to transactions with non-EU countries (effective 1 January 2020), and Australia remains committed to introducing hybrid rules (effective 1 January 2018 or 6 months after enactment). In all cases the rules as enacted or proposed are broadly those contained in the OECD’s Final Report on Action 2. No other jurisdictions have proposed implementing the OECD recommendations at this stage so New Zealand may well be within the first wave of adopters. However, the countries that are adopting the rules are significant for New Zealand. For instance, they are the source of approximately 62% of foreign direct investment into New Zealand.

Just before the discussion document was released, the OECD released a Public Discussion Draft titled _BEPS Action 2: Branch Mismatch Structures_. This document discusses cross border tax mismatches arising in the context of branches. As the title suggests, the OECD sees these mismatches as part of the hybrids project (BEPS Action 2). Accordingly, although most of these mismatches were not discussed in the Government’s discussion document, we seek your approval to consult with the original submitters on them as part of this project, and we expect that submitters will be comfortable with that.

#### Proposed path for development of policy and legislation

A number of submissions sought further consultation on the content of the hybrid rules (“what” rather than “whether”). Given the novel nature of the proposals and the fact that they will need to cover a wide range of situations and provisions, we agree that further consultation on their content would be useful. We have therefore agreed to conduct the workshops referred to above, which are currently scheduled to occur between now and June. This will help ensure that the proposals are implemented in a manner appropriate to the New Zealand context that minimises additional compliance and administration costs without discouraging productive foreign direct investment. We will prepare materials to facilitate discussion at the workshops, and to record their outcomes.

The timetable for these workshops was set before the date of the pre-election period was known. We therefore seek your views on whether we should:

*   keep to the current timeframe, which would involve seeking final Cabinet approval for policy decisions during the pre-election period – probably in mid-July; or
*   shorten the planned consultation timeframe so that final policy decisions can be made before 23 June. This would inevitably reduce the scope and quality of the consultation, but it would remain a useful exercise.

Officials currently consider that, if final policy decisions are made before the election (irrespective of whether this is just before or after the pre-election period commences), consulting on draft legislation over the election period would be a useful exercise. We currently envisage that the relevant legislation will form part of the first Omnibus Tax Bill following the election. Given the inevitable complexity of legislation on these issues, consultation on draft legislation would likely result in a smoother select committee process after that bill is introduced to Parliament. If you indicate you are comfortable with consultation on draft legislation, we will include a request to that effect in the Cabinet paper seeking final policy decisions.

### Background

1\. On 6 September 2016 the Government released a Discussion Document seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements in line with the recommendations in Action 2 of the OECD BEPS programme (T2016/1319 IR2016/342 refers).

2\. This report summarises the major themes of the submissions and our responses. The submissions are generally ordered from the more general and high level to the more specific.

3\. Although the expected effect of the hybrid rules will generally be to simplify commercial transactions (because they will remove the incentive to undertake transactions in a more complex tax-motivated fashion), as a technical matter, their interaction with the existing tax legislation raises an unusually large number of issues, some of them very technical. Because we are continuing to consult on those technical issues, we have not dealt with most of them here. However, they will be put before Cabinet in the process of seeking final policy approval.

### General submissions

4\. Submissions varied significantly in responding to the proposals. Some submitters were generally supportive of New Zealand taking action in line with the OECD hybrids package, subject to various provisos including that it was done in a co-ordinated fashion with other jurisdictions and/or that there should be concessions for hybrid regulatory capital. However, a greater number were in favour of adopting a targeted or phased approach to the OECD hybrids package focused on countering hybrid arrangements that are of most concern to New Zealand. The principal reasons for this were as follows:

*   The rules will increase the effective tax rate on inbound investment which is currently enjoying hybrid tax benefits, they will raise the required return from that investment, and therefore reduce investment in New Zealand.
*   In many cases, these negative effects will arise with no increase in New Zealand’s tax revenue. This is the case where hybrid investment into New Zealand is replaced by debt investment into New Zealand.
*   The rules may change the tax treatment of genuine commercial transactions inappropriately.
*   Our international tax rules are relatively robust and New Zealand is not as exposed as other countries to hybrid mismatches.
*   Abusive transactions can be dealt with effectively with simpler and more targeted rules.
*   New Zealand should not enact hybrid rules before international acceptance of the rules has been evidenced by enactment in other countries.

5\. A submission which was made in discussions against adoption of the rules is that their effect will be to replace hybrid arrangements with funding from countries with very low tax rates, or which do not tax foreign source interest. Such arrangements will not be subject to the hybrid rules. Generally these countries are what are commonly referred to as tax havens, but they could also include more established countries with which New Zealand has a double tax treaty, such as Hong Kong and Singapore (which have territorial tax systems).

6\. Officials are not convinced by the argument that the rules should not apply to inbound hybrid investment for the following reasons:

*   We consider that in some instances a disallowed hybrid instrument may be replaced with equity, resulting in higher tax payments in New Zealand.
*   Revenue may be raised even when the counterfactual investment is debt as hybrids often have a higher interest rate compared to ordinary debt.
*   Countries that are some of our most significant inward investment sources are also implementing anti-hybrid rules. The advantages of using hybrids to invest in New Zealand will be eliminated for investors from these countries, regardless of our course of action.

7\. There is some force in the argument that double non-taxation, or close to it, can be achieved using debt funding through low or no tax countries, or countries with pure territorial tax systems, and enacting anti-hybrid legislation is therefore pointless. However, in most cases there will be an additional cost to routing funding through these countries, because the interest paid will be subject to 15% rather than 10% New Zealand withholding tax. Perhaps more importantly, by pushing companies into using such countries, the negative effect of low tax jurisdictions on corporate tax revenues becomes more visible than it does with hybrids. Residence countries are able to neutralise this form of tax planning using controlled foreign company rules if they wish to do so (as New Zealand already does, and as the OECD recommends). The hybrid rules will not put an end to all tax planning using cross border transactions. But they make useful progress towards that objective.

8\. The remainder of this report is dedicated to the more specific submissions received and officials’ initial responses to them.

### National sovereignty/loss of coherence concerns

9\. A number of submitters were concerned about national sovereignty aspects of the proposals. These concerns were based on the fact that the rules mean that the New Zealand tax treatment of a cross border transaction can vary, depending on how that same transaction is treated in another country. Submissions objected to this, on the basis that it means a loss of sovereignty and that it reduces the coherence of the New Zealand tax system.

10\. The first objection is without foundation. New Zealand is free to enact laws implementing the OECD hybrid rules or not as it sees fit, and is equally free to repeal them. No national sovereignty is ceded. New Zealand’s tax system already contains numerous provisions which allow foreign tax systems to affect the amount of New Zealand tax imposed on a person. Examples are the foreign tax credit rules and the rule which taxes dividends derived from foreign direct investment by New Zealanders if the dividends are deductible in another country.

11\. The second objection has more substance. However, it is axiomatic that the hybrid rules will have this outcome. For the conceivable future, countries will have different rules for taxing instruments, transactions and entities. These rules will generally exhibit a high degree of coherence domestically. For example, a dividend paid by one domestic resident to another will be taxed as dividend by both parties. However, because the rules are different, they cannot be coherent in a cross border context, without some form of co-ordination such as the hybrid rules. Some payments which New Zealand treats as dividends will be treated as interest by another country, and vice versa. The effect of the hybrid rules is to introduce a different set of rules for certain cross border transactions, which increase global tax coherence by reducing double non-taxation outcomes. There is a loss of domestic consistency (since the same instrument may be taxed differently depending on the tax treatment of the foreign counterparty), but in a cross-border transaction, this is a less important concern than cross-border coherence.

12\. Most importantly, the hybrid rules do not affect coherence in a purely domestic context. They will only apply in a cross border context, and only where the outcome of applying the two domestic tax systems involved produces double non-taxation. In a world where more and more business is done across borders, cross-border tax mismatches are likely to become an increasingly significant problem.

### Rules will raise the cost of capital in New Zealand, in many cases without raising revenue in New Zealand

13\. This submission was made by a number of submitters. It primarily focuses on the effect of the rules on inbound debt/equity hybrids, where the return on an investment in New Zealand is properly deductible in New Zealand, and properly treated as an exempt dividend or otherwise not subject to tax in the investor country. The hybrid rules will deny a deduction for the return in this case.

14\. Submissions argued that this would:

*   Make no difference to New Zealand’s tax take. The theory is that all foreign firms wish to minimise their New Zealand tax. Accordingly, they all have the maximum amount of debt they are allowed under the thin capitalisation rules (60% of their gross assets). This being so, the response to the introduction of the hybrid rules will be to replace hybrid debt with ordinary debt, the return on which would generally be taxed in the other jurisdiction, but still deductible in New Zealand.
*   Push up the cost of capital in New Zealand, because it would increase the tax imposed on the return, and therefore decrease the amount investors are prepared to invest in New Zealand.

15\. As to the first submission, this theory does not seem to be supported by the facts. The average debt to asset ratio of large foreign-controlled firms in Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaire database in 2015 was 26 percent (with a median of 18 percent).[\[1\]](#footnote1)
 Only 64 firms in the database, or 20 percent of the total, had a debt to asset ratio higher than 50%.

16\. It does not appear to be the case that, in response to the introduction of the hybrid rules, all hybrids will be replaced with ordinary debt. Given how foreign-owned firms are currently capitalised, we consider it more likely that some portion of hybrid capital will be replaced by ordinary equity, the return on which is taxed in New Zealand.

17\. Moreover, if the Government does not enact anti-hybrid rules, this could signal to the private sector that the Government has a permissive attitude towards hybrids. There is therefore a risk that some firms currently operating in New Zealand will replace part of their equity with hybrid capital because of the available tax advantages. This could have a reasonably large fiscal cost.

18\. It is not necessarily the case that foreign firms do wish to minimise their New Zealand tax. The data above, showing that typical debt levels of large foreign-controlled firms are far below the New Zealand-tax minimising level of 60 percent, demonstrates this. For example, some Australian firms may prefer to pay tax in New Zealand instead of Australia. As stated in the recent Financial System Inquiry in Australia,[\[2\]](#footnote2)
 the share price of Australian firms is increasingly being set by non-resident investors, who do not benefit from franking credits, so may prefer paying tax in New Zealand, where the corporate tax rate is lower.

19\. As to the second submission, submitters are correct that, in some instances, the total tax impost (i.e. New Zealand tax plus foreign tax) on investors currently using hybrids will increase. This will make New Zealand a less attractive investment location to these investors. We do not think this is a significant concern for several reasons.

20\. As discussed above, we consider that if hybrid mismatches are eliminated, some hybrid capital would, be structured as equity. In these cases, the effect of the hybrid is to eliminate New Zealand tax on the investment. Neutralising hybrid mismatches will increase the total tax on investors because New Zealand tax would be payable. We do not consider that this is a problem. This treatment is in line with our general taxation settings, where we do impose a reasonable level of tax on foreign investment here. We think these settings serve New Zealand well.[\[3\]](#footnote3)

21\. In some cases the alternative to a hybrid investment is debt, where the effect of the hybrid is to eliminate foreign tax on the investment. In this situation submitters’ concern that these changes will push up the cost of capital in New Zealand has more force, as there would be no accompanying increase in New Zealand tax payments.

22\. However, in many situations submitters’ contention that these changes will push up the cost of investing in New Zealand is incorrect. Several other countries are also enacting anti-hybrid rules, including two of our largest trading partners (Australia and the UK). Collectively, these countries account for 59 percent of total FDI into New Zealand.[\[4\]](#footnote4)
 Our own enactment of anti-hybrid rules will have no impact on the total tax impost on hybrid capital originating from these countries, as the mismatch will be neutralised regardless through the primary/defensive hybrid rules structure.

23\. Even when an investor is from a country that is not enacting anti-hybrid rules, and the counterfactual investment is debt, the enactment of anti-hybrid rules is not an unambiguous loss for New Zealand. Hybrid elements frequently increase the interest rate on a financial instrument, so a switch to ordinary debt may reduce interest deductions here and accordingly increase New Zealand tax payments.

24\. Nevertheless it remains the case that, in some instances, the cost of investing in New Zealand will be pushed up because of this reform without any change in New Zealand tax revenues. We consider this to be a less pressing concern for New Zealand than it would be for other countries. While FDI is generally considered highly sensitive to company taxation, we argue in our inbound investment framework that tax is much less likely to play a critical factor in investment decisions into New Zealand. This is because New Zealand is an island nation, far away from the rest of the world. Much FDI here is likely to be associated with the supply of goods and services to the domestic market, which would be difficult to do without establishing a base here.

25\. In any event, there are potential indirect benefits to New Zealand from eliminating the inefficiencies that result from hybrid mismatches and the associated double non-taxation. This argument is dealt with in detail in the 2016 joint Treasury/IRD paper _New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment_. It is worth setting out the key passage here (see p21):

> _There are more general arguments in favour of joining a multilateral effort to remove arbitrage possibilities (which are at the heart of many BEPS issues). When companies engage in BEPS, the result is that no tax is paid anywhere on a portion of income. This clearly leads to an inefficient allocation of investment internationally as cross-border investments are subsidised relative to domestic investments. Eliminating this misallocation would increase worldwide efficiency, leading to higher worldwide incomes. The best approach for New Zealand may be to co-operate with other countries in eliminating this worldwide inefficiency in the hope of gaining its share of this extra worldwide income._
> 
> _Double non-taxation reduces company taxes worldwide. While there may be arguments that in certain circumstances the cost falls on other countries, it would be naïve to suggest that the cost never falls on New Zealand. Experience suggests that once taxation is eliminated in the residence country, source country taxation is placed at risk. For example, the BEPS-induced decline in US taxation of US residents’ foreign-sourced income is often cited as a major reason for the increased focus on reducing source-country taxation by US multinationals. In that case, a general move to eliminate BEPS possibilities would make tax collections in all countries, including New Zealand, more secure and less vulnerable to unexpected tax planning._

26\. Moreover, quite random reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment in New Zealand and lead to complex arrangements that are themselves a source of inefficiency. Identifying these situations, or designing rules that turn off our anti-hybrid rules in them, would be difficult. Such an approach could also be questioned by our trading partners – the tax advantages conferred by hybrids are, by definition, not intended by either country.

27\. There is a broad public concern that BEPS is unfair. Large companies escaping tax while earning substantial profits in a country has been the subject of considerable public controversy. Overall there are strong arguments for considering initiatives in this area. An important priority for the Government is considering rules to address BEPS.

28\. Given all of this, we remain of the view that implementing anti-hybrid rules with a general application remains in New Zealand’s best interests.

### Rules should be limited to deal with NZ-specific hybrid concerns

29\. In favour of this submission, submitters pointed to the fact that the rules are relatively complex and have the potential for overreach. They said that many of the structures considered in the Final Report have not been seen in New Zealand, and therefore do not need to be counteracted.

30\. We agree that the rules are complex, which is part of the reason we are conducting a series of workshops on technical aspects of the rules to minimise the risk that they reach further than they should. However, on balance, we do not think a partial approach would serve New Zealand well. The rules are a coherent package. Indications from other countries adopting the rules are that they will adopt all of them, subject only to relatively minor modifications. It will be preferable for New Zealand to do the same. This should reduce the need to make subsequent piecemeal amendments. It will also ensure our rules are internationally comparable. If an element of the rules were deliberately omitted from New Zealand’s response, this might be seen as a tacit blessing of that type of mismatch, inviting undesirable tax planning, with all the attendant risk of disputes and law changes.

31\. Lastly, while New Zealand almost certainly has not experienced all of the types of transactions considered in the Final Report, there is no doubt that New Zealand taxpayers have engaged in complex cross border tax planning, and that the structures entered into would have engaged most, if not all, of the proposed rules if they had been in force.

### Rules should not be enacted until more widely adopted

32\. Some submitters suggested that it would not be sensible for New Zealand to be an early adopter of the hybrid rules, and that we should wait for other countries, in particular Australia, to adopt them first. It was not altogether clear in some cases why early adoption was seen as undesirable. It could be because:

*   If another country already has the rules, their adoption by New Zealand will have no impact on the taxation of hybrid arrangements between New Zealand and that country. If another country does not, then adoption of the rules by New Zealand will be the event that eliminates the tax benefit of such arrangements. This is simply an argument against the adoption of the rules, and is dealt with in the remainder of this report.
*   If another country does not have the rules, it may be a more attractive investment destination than New Zealand, at least for investment from other countries that do not have the rules.
*   Even if another country has the rules, they may not be implemented in a pure and consistent way based on the OECD recommendations and/or other countries will have other features in their overall tax regimes so that they remain internationally attractive to multinational groups. New Zealand will benefit from waiting and seeing how the rules are adopted in larger economies.
*   If New Zealand waits to introduce the rules until they are more globally adopted, businesses will be more familiar with them, and New Zealand will be perceived as less of a special case.

33\. The most obvious response to this submission is that in fact, the rules are being widely adopted, and by many countries with which New Zealand has close investment links. Australia, the UK and the countries making up the EU account for approximately 62% of the direct investment into New Zealand.

34\. Leaving that aside, officials note that:

*   The hybrid rules work to neutralise mismatches involving the tax base of a country that adopts them regardless of their adoption by any other country.
*   Since Australia is also adopting the rules, there is less downside, from a “favourable destination for investment” perspective for New Zealand from doing so. Adoption of the rules will not make New Zealand a less favourable destination for our largest source of direct investment, nor will it make New Zealand a less favourable investment jurisdiction than Australia.
*   In relation to certain double deduction structures involving Australia,[\[5\]](#footnote5)
     if Australia adopts the rules and New Zealand does not, that might well be to the detriment of the New Zealand tax base. This might also be the case in other situations.
*   There is no evidence that the existence of hybrid mismatches has led to any investment in New Zealand that would be at risk if they were eliminated.
*   While acknowledging it may be safer to see how the detail of the rules is implemented in other jurisdictions, there is an advantage to New Zealand in being in the leading group of adopters, particularly with Australia. New Zealand has the chance to have some influence in how the rules are implemented around the world, we are able to benefit from engaging with other countries who are also actively engaged in developing their rules (particularly the case with Australia) and it may also prove possible to introduce our rules in a more co-ordinated fashion with Australia.

35\. We note that since the discussion document was released, the UK hybrid rules have come into force (1 January 2017), the EU has released a binding directive which requires EU members to expand their hybrid rules so that they apply to transactions with non-EU countries (effective 1 January 2020), and Australia remains committed to introducing hybrid rules (effective 1 January 2018 or 6 months after enactment). In all cases the rules as enacted or proposed are broadly those contained in the OECD’s Action 2. No other jurisdictions have proposed implementing the OECD recommendations for hybrids at this stage.

### Compliance cost concerns

36\. There is no doubt that the need to comply with the hybrid rules will involve some additional cost for business. There will be the initial cost of helping to develop and understanding the rules, and then the cost of ensuring that they are complied with. However, in the vast majority of cases, compliance costs can be minimised by not entering into, or unwinding, hybrid structures, and replacing them with structures that in most cases are commercially much simpler and cheaper, albeit less tax effective.

37\. The imported mismatch rule was a particular target of this submission. We appreciate the concerns raised here as the imported mismatch rule applies where the hybrid mismatch does not directly involve New Zealand, and serves as an integrity measure for some of the other OECD recommendations for hybrids. Prima facie it will require corporate groups to identify hybrid mismatches which are not subject to direct counteraction, and then to determine how the benefit of such mismatches should be apportioned between payments that are subject to the imported mismatch rule, which could involve multiple jurisdictions.

38\. The cost of compliance with this rule is reduced by the fact that it does not apply to payments made to other countries which have hybrid rules. Accordingly it will not apply to payments by a New Zealand resident to (for example) an Australian one (assuming Australia adopts the rules), and adoption of the rules in New Zealand will ensure that compliance costs in respect of this rule do not arise in respect of payments from countries which have hybrid rules to New Zealand. If New Zealand is within the first wave of adopters, there will be additional compliance costs as it waits for other countries to come on board, particularly so if New Zealand introduces the rules before Australia (although this is not expected on current timelines).

39\. We envisage that as a practical matter, the kinds of multinational groups where imported mismatches might conceivably apply will employ skilled tax managers, one of whose tasks will be to review the existence of mismatch arrangements throughout the group. The introduction of hybrid rules by other countries means that this task will be required to be performed regardless of whether or not New Zealand has hybrid rules.

40\. The workshops with submitters on technical aspects of the rules are intended to ensure that compliance and administrative costs do not become an undue burden on businesses or Inland Revenue. Imported mismatches will be covered through the upcoming workshops and we will report back on this matter as part of final policy recommendations.

### Effect on taxation of foreign branches of New Zealand companies

41\. A number of submitters argued that the adoption of recommendation 6, denying the ability of New Zealand companies to use foreign branch losses to reduce New Zealand taxable income, meant that New Zealand should revisit its current system of taxing the business income of foreign branches. Indeed, some submissions argued that an exemption for active income of a foreign branch should be enacted regardless of whether the hybrid rules proceed.

42\. This proposal was considered and rejected in an earlier Cabinet paper (T2013/2166 PAS2013/162). If the hybrid rules were to proceed on the basis set out in the preceding paragraph, there would be a good argument in favour of revisiting the proposal.

43\. However, the OECD is in the process of modifying its published position on this point. It now recommends that foreign branch losses be non-deductible in the head office country only if the losses are used in the branch country to reduce the tax on income which is not taxed in the head office company. For many ordinary businesses, this will not be the case, and therefore the adoption of the modified recommendation 6 will not affect their ability to use their foreign losses against New Zealand taxable income.

44\. Accordingly, we recommend at this stage that the hybrid project proceed without considering the general tax treatment of foreign branch income and losses. However, this issue could be considered in the near future if the Government wished to revisit it, subject to resource constraints.

### Branch mismatches

45\. On 22 August, the OECD released a Public Discussion Draft titled _BEPS Action 2: Branch Mismatch Structures_. This document discusses cross border tax mismatches arising in the context of branches. As the title suggests, the OECD sees these mismatches as part of the hybrids project (BEPS Action 2).

46\. The branch mismatches in the Discussion Draft are analogous to those considered in the Government’s September discussion document. They involve deductible/non-includible, double deduction, or imported mismatches. The only difference is that these mismatches arise because of differences in countries’ rules for taxing branch income, rather than because of differences in how countries tax entities or instruments.

47\. The counteractions proposed in the Discussion Draft are also of the same nature as those proposed in relation to hybrid mismatches.

48\. Officials are of the view that these mismatches also need to be considered. We note that the UK’s hybrid rules deal with branch mismatches, and that UK officials have stated that without this, the rules would have been much easier to circumvent.

49\. Officials believe it will be much better to consider branch mismatches in the context of the current consultation. Accordingly, we propose to discuss them at our meetings in mid/late March with the Corporate Taxpayer Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. We will also approach the New Zealand Law Society and the New Zealand Bankers' Association and offer them the opportunity to consider the branch mismatch issues. Apart from some individuals who submitted on the Government discussion document, these four groups represent all of the original submitters. We expect submitters will be comfortable with this approach.

### De minimis rule

50\. Four submissions supported a de minimis rule either generally, or specifically for the imported mismatch rule, to reduce compliance costs. One supported consideration of a general de minimis rule, but was concerned about possible complexity in the rules to show that that the de minimis could be relied upon. The submitter noted the imported mismatch rule (recommendation 8) as a place where a de minimis might be particularly useful. Two suggested a general de minimis so the rules would only be targeted at higher value transactions (e.g. $1m of relevant income/expenditure) or would not apply to smaller taxpayers (e.g. turnover under $80m). The fourth was supportive of a de minimis rule for the imported mismatch rule.

51\. Other than where the rules apply to timing mismatches, officials do not support a de minimis at this stage, but this will be discussed further as part of the private sector workshops. The OECD Final Report does not have a de minimis. For many of the rules, e.g. recommendations 3 and 6, it would be very complex to have a de minimis based on transaction size which could not also be abused. The issue of size is partly resolved by observing that the rules only apply to taxpayers entering into more complex cross border transactions. Within that context, even smaller taxpayers can be expected to understand how they are taxed in the countries in which they operate, recognizing that in most cases the rules only operate within control groups or related parties.

52\. In relation to the imported mismatch rule, presumably the de minimis would generally be based on the level of a New Zealand company’s interest expense. This could be a workable rule, though if a group has operations in, for example, the UK, the group will have identified possible imported mismatches in any event.

53\. Officials will keep this matter under review, with a particular eye to whatever measures are adopted in Australia.

### Regulatory capital (banks and insurance companies)

54\. A number of submissions addressed the question of whether regulatory capital required to be issued by banks and insurance companies should be subject to the hybrid regime. Capital adequacy regulations may lead, if not inevitably then without apparent effort, to the issue of cross border hybrid arrangements. A significant amount of hybrid capital has been issued by the New Zealand branches of the Australian trading banks with New Zealand operations. This capital is hybrid because it is treated as debt by New Zealand (and is therefore deductible) and as equity by Australia (and can therefore have franking credits attached to it, which can reduce or eliminate an Australian holder’s Australian tax liability on the dividend).

55\. Submissions made the following arguments:

*   Deductible/frankable instruments should not be regarded as hybrids at all, because franking credits are a limited resource and represent tax actually paid in Australia.
*   Bank regulatory capital should be excluded from the hybrid rules, given that the legal terms which give rise to its hybridity (subordination to other debt, conversion to equity in the case of distress etc.) are often the result of regulatory requirements.
*   Bank regulatory capital should be excluded from the hybrid rules because it is economically important.
*   Banks do not have a choice as to whether or not to attach franking credits to the return paid on deductible/frankable instruments – attachment of credits is a requirement of Australian law. Accordingly it would not be appropriate to apply the hybrid rules to the tax treatment of that return.
*   Bank regulatory capital should be excluded from the hybrid rules because the effect of including it will be that it is replaced with debt having a higher rate of interest, which would reduce the New Zealand tax base. Currently the hybrid debt has a lower rate of interest, because the third party lenders (mostly Australian individuals and investment entities) are prepared to take a lower cash return given that they receive franking credits on top of the interest.
*   Bank regulatory capital should be grandparented if issued before a certain date, especially because it is often publicly issued and refinancing it would not be straightforward.

56\. With the exception of the sixth point, and possibly the fifth point, officials do not believe that these submissions have much force for the following reasons:

*   In relation to deductible/frankable instruments, there is a hybrid mismatch. It is true that the nature of the imputation system means that this mismatch cannot be inexhaustibly tapped. However, so long as a company is not otherwise distributing all of its tax-paid profits (which is relatively unusual), the mismatch can be profited from in a similar way as a deductible/non-assessable mismatch.
*   As to the second and third submission, applying the hybrid rules to bank regulatory capital does not prevent such capital being issued cross border. It simply ensures that it does not enjoy an unintended tax benefit. The banking regulators have no interest in whether regulatory capital gives rise to tax benefits or not, and the removal of such benefits will in no way undermine their work. The result of applying the hybrid rules is simply that regulatory capital instruments are treated the same way as they would if both the issuer country and the investor country had the same tax rules.
*   As to the fourth submission, the Australian requirement to attach franking credits to the distribution is entirely consistent with New Zealand denying a deduction for the distribution. The distribution will then be treated as a payment of a dividend by both Australia and New Zealand. There is more of a difficulty for Australia in determining how it should apply the hybrid rules. It might, for example, be difficult for Australia both to require a franking credit to be attached to the dividend, and deny the shareholder a credit for that imputation credit. However, this is an issue for Australia to determine.
*   As to the fifth submission:
    *   When the deductible/frankable instruments were first issued, to some extent they did replace equity, rather than debt, financing. It is possible that if they are cancelled, they will be partly replaced with equity.
    *   The banks issuing these instruments are currently operating with more equity than “required” by the thin capitalisation rules, and accordingly the hypothesis that they will always minimise their New Zealand equity is not correct.
    *   Because they bear a higher risk, deductible/frankable instruments have a higher funding cost than ordinary debt. This helps counter the rate reduction achieved by the tax arbitrage.
    *   Not all deductible/frankable instruments are issued to third parties. There are also structures involving intra-group issuances which support third party issuances. The return payable on some instruments issued in these structures have been sufficiently high to raise transfer pricing concerns.

However, in the event that Australia decides not to deal with the treatment of deductible/frankable regulatory capital, officials would wish to consider more closely the effect on the New Zealand tax base of applying the hybrid rules to it.

57\. New Zealand’s stance in this matter will not be relevant if Australia acts, in accordance with hybrids recommendation 2, to tax the return on deductible/frankable instruments as interest (and therefore not frankable). A decision on this has been expected for some time, but has not yet been made. Officials intend to meet with submitters on this point once the Australian decision on regulatory capital has been announced. Officials will also consult with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand before final policy recommendations are made.

58\. Officials are sympathetic to the arguments in favour of grandparenting regulatory capital issued before the release of the Government discussion document on 6 September 2016. The finer details of grandparenting are likely to be clearer in our next report on this matter. Officials also hope that any grandparenting will be co-ordinated and consistent with whatever decision is made by Australia.

### Effect on New Zealand foreign trusts

59\. The discussion document on hybrid mismatch arrangements proposes to apply the hybrid rules to tax the foreign source income of New Zealand foreign trusts (i.e. trusts with a New Zealand trustee but no New Zealand settlor) if that income is not being taxed to:

*   the beneficiary, in the case of beneficiary income;
*   the settlor, in the case of trustee income,

in the beneficiary/settlor’s country of residence, if the non-taxation in the residence country is the result of the trust being a reverse hybrid. We received one submission in favour of this proposal and 7 not in favour.

60\. Many of the submissions referred to the fact that the 2016 report of the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (the Shewan Report) recommended no change to the current trust tax regime. They argued that this recommendation supported not applying hybrids recommendation 5.2 to New Zealand foreign trusts. However:

*   the terms of reference of the Inquiry were directed solely at trust record keeping and disclosure, not trust taxation;
*   the comments which were made in the Shewan Report on trust taxation were not made having any regard to the double non-taxation issue which is central to the hybrid rules. The Shewan Report was considering the appropriateness of the trust tax regime as a matter of the coherence of the New Zealand tax base on a stand-alone basis. It correctly stated that the non-taxation of non-residents on non-New Zealand source income was and remains orthodox international tax policy (paragraph 4.15). Leaving aside the hybrid rules, the Report recognized that it is reasonable for New Zealand not to tax such income when it is derived by the New Zealand resident trustee of a trust with no New Zealand settlor. However, the Shewan Report did not consider the impact of BEPS Action 2 on international tax policy. In particular, it did not consider whether a New Zealand foreign trust is a reverse hybrid (as defined for purposes of the hybrid rules) and whether, if it is, New Zealand tax should be imposed on its income.

61\. The Inquiry concluded that the changes to trust disclosure rules and practice which it recommended would deal adequately _with the problems identified, including reputational risk_. It was not asked to, nor did it, consider the problem of double non-taxation, and accordingly no conclusions were reached or recommendations made that are relevant to this issue.

62\. Officials have discussed the preceding paragraphs with John Shewan, who agrees that we have accurately reflected the scope and conclusions of his report.

63\. Submissions against our proposal raised a number of other points which, along with our responses, are summarised below.

*   A New Zealand trust is not a reverse hybrid, since it is not tax transparent in New Zealand. That is because the trustee is always taxable on New Zealand source trustee income. This submission is not correct. An entity can be partially tax transparent. The Final Report states (paragraph 140) that a person will be treated as tax transparent in respect of a payment where the reverse hybrid attributes or allocates a payment that it has received to an investor, and the effect of such attribution or allocation is to treat the payment as it would have been treated had it been paid directly to the investor. Clearly then a New Zealand foreign trust is tax transparent with respect to income allocated to beneficiaries. As the Government’s discussion document stated, this is not the case for trustee income. The argument for New Zealand taxation of foreign source income in that situation rests on the New Zealand principle that the residence of the settlor determines whether or not the trust’s foreign source income is subject to New Zealand tax.
*   The current tax treatment of New Zealand foreign trusts is appropriate and should be maintained. We agree that the current tax treatment makes sense on a single jurisdiction basis. However, it can lead to double non-taxation as a result of a hybrid mismatch. If the jurisdiction of the settlor (in the case of trustee income) or the beneficiaries (in the case of beneficiary income) would ordinarily tax the income, but is not doing so because it regards the income as derived by the New Zealand trustee, then there is double non-taxation as a result of differing treatments of the trust. This is an issue which the hybrid rules are trying to address.
*   Determining whether a New Zealand foreign trust and the settlor are in the same “control group” is not possible. Some work may need to be done in this respect, but our current associated person rules will provide a good foundation.
*   The fact that the foreign settlor of a trust is not taxed in another country on foreign source trustee income does not justify New Zealand taxing the New Zealand trustee on that income. The settlor is not taxed because the income is not theirs. Indeed, the settlor may be dead when the income is derived. This submission ignores the fact that the basis for New Zealand not taxing this income is the residence of the settlor. The logical extension of this approach is that the settlor’s residence country should regard the income as that of the settlor.
*   It might be more logical to tax the New Zealand trustee on its foreign source trustee income if it can be determined that the beneficiaries who will receive the income are not taxable on the income. However, in a discretionary trust this is not possible, because it is not known which beneficiary will receive the income. We do not agree that the foreign tax treatment of the settlor should not be taken into account. We do agree though that, if it can be shown that a beneficiary is subject to tax on foreign source trustee income, that would mean there is no hybrid mismatch to counteract in New Zealand.
*   Non-taxation of the settlor or a beneficiary might be a result of the person being resident in a country with no income tax, or with a territorial tax system, rather than because the person is resident in a jurisdiction which treats the income as derived by the trustee. We agree that in this case, double non-taxation is not a result of a hybrid mismatch, and there should be no hybrid counteraction. Applying the rules only to cases where mismatches result from hybridity will be required generally, and this is not a special case.
*   Difficulties would arise from the proposal where the trust holds foreign shares which are taxed under the fair divided rate (FDR) method. The FDR method is unique to New Zealand. Since the settlor residence country will not be taxing on the same basis, the reason that the trust’s income (calculated under New Zealand law) is not taxable in the settlor country is that that country will not see the settlor as having such income. We agree that differences of this kind will create complexity. However, this complexity will be an issue for other aspects of the rules as well, and will need to be dealt with. As a matter of principle, the issue would be resolved by determining, in the year the New Zealand income is derived whether the beneficiary or trustee would be taxed on that income if it also arose in their residence jurisdiction.
*   Compliance costs from this proposal would be substantial and in most cases no tax would be generated. There would no doubt be some compliance costs from this proposal, though in the main they would revolve around the need to communicate information already known by one of the parties or its advisors to the other parties or advisors. An assumption that this sort of “intra-group” communication is possible underpins many of the proposed rules and we do not consider there are any good reasons for treating trusts differently. It is possible that no or little New Zealand tax would be generated. However, the proposals would assist in the general move towards shutting down hybrid-mismatch-driven double non-taxation, the aim of which is to increase global tax revenues.
*   The proposal goes well beyond the ambit of the hybrid proposal, and appears to be advanced to support New Zealand tax applying when none would ever arise apart from the existence of a New Zealand resident trustee. This submission misses the point that the effect of the rules will only be to rectify double non-taxation arising from the existence of the New Zealand resident trustee. For example, if the settlor would not be taxed on the foreign source income if it derived the income directly, there is no suggestion that the hybrid rules would impose New Zealand taxation on that income if derived by a New Zealand tax resident trustee on whom the settlor has settled the income producing property.

64\. Since New Zealand trusts can give rise to double taxation due to hybrid mismatches, we intend to continue to develop our proposals in this respect, though we agree that applying New Zealand tax to trustee income on the basis of the existence of a hybrid mismatch will present some challenges.

### Interaction with withholding tax

65\. A number of submissions were concerned by the proposal in the Discussion Document that where an interest payment is disallowed under the hybrid rules, withholding tax would still be imposed as if that payment were interest. They were concerned that this would constitute double taxation. If the payment were treated as a dividend and fully imputed, it would not be subject to withholding tax.

66\. This is a complex issue. It may well be the case, at least with respect to recommendations 1 and 3, that ideally, the withholding tax treatment would match the deductibility status. However, we have assumed that this might not always be possible, particularly if the payer is not aware at the time of making the payment that the hybrid rules deny a deduction. Officials are continuing to review this question.

### Transitional

67\. The OECD Final Report recommended no grandparenting of existing transactions and an effective date based on the tax year which gives taxpayers sufficient time to restructure their transactions, which will all be either between related parties or within a control group.

68\. The Discussion Document proposed to follow this approach, with the effective date being the first balance date after enactment of the legislation.

69\. A number of submissions were in favour of grandparenting existing transactions, either without limit, or for 3-5 years. This was on the basis that taxpayers should be entitled to retain tax benefits that existed when transactions were entered into.

70\. As set out in paragraph 58, we now propose to consider limited grandparenting for frankable/deductible instruments issued before the release of the Discussion Document. Consistent with the OECD, and the approach in the UK, we do not propose any further grandparenting. The hybrid rules are doing no more than removing tax benefits which were not, in aggregate, intended by either country, and restoring a more “normal” result. The hybrid rules apply generally to transactions between related parties, which can generally be undone with relative ease. If there are any situations where this is not so, as with the frankable/deductibles, they have not emerged in consultation to date. If any emerge, we can consider them on a case by case basis.

71\. Many submitters supported New Zealand having the same effective date for the rules as Australia. Others submitted that New Zealand should not enact its rules until after the Australian rules have become effective, in order to give more clarity.

72\. Officials are sympathetic to the submissions for co-ordination on this point with Australia, but continue to believe at this stage that the core proposal (effective for balance dates after enactment) is a reasonable one.

### Consultation process

73\. A number of submissions sought further consultation on the proposals. Officials are sympathetic to these submissions, and are currently engaged in a consultation programme that is scheduled to take place between now and June. As mentioned above, we anticipate this process will also include consultation on the OECD’s discussion draft on branch mismatches. This timeline could be altered to allow for final Cabinet decisions to be made before the pre-election period commences on 23 June. However, this would inevitably reduce the scope and/or depth of the consultation. The private sector may also be disappointed by such a change. We welcome your views on the timing of this process.

74\. Some submitters also sought the opportunity to review draft legislation. Draft legislation was released for comment in the UK, and Australia is likely to do the same. Officials currently consider that, if final policy decisions are made before the election (irrespective of whether this is just before or after the pre-election period commences), consulting on draft legislation over the election period would be a useful exercise. Given the inevitable complexity of legislation on these issues, consultation on draft legislation would likely result in a smoother select committee process when final legislation is introduced to Parliament. If you indicate you are comfortable with consultation on draft legislation, we will include a request to that effect in the Cabinet paper seeking final policy decisions.

### FOREIGN HYBRID ENTITY DOUBLE DEDUCTIONS AND BEPS REFORMS

### Proposal

1\. This paper seeks Cabinet agreement to tax law changes to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities, particularly Australian Limited Partnerships, to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand. In addition, this paper seeks Cabinet’s approval for the proposals of three BEPS discussion documents to be progressed, subject to modification in consultation.

### Executive summary

2\. In September 2016, the Government released the discussion document _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ \[CAB-16-Min-0442\]. This was followed by the release of two further discussion documents for public consultation in March 2017; _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_, and _BEPS - strengthening our interest limitation rules_ \[CAB-17-MIN-0041\]. These three documents are a substantial part of the Government’s ongoing response to the OECD’s project to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). BEPS is a term that describes the various international tax planning techniques that some multinational businesses use to minimise their tax liabilities.

3\. The _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ discussion document proposed a comprehensive response to hybrid mismatches, including the use of double deductions by hybrid entities. Officials are currently consulting with the private sector on specific design issues relating to the proposals in the discussion document.

4\. Before then, it is important to confirm that the Government is willing to act on the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand-based groups by restricting the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities, particularly Australian Limited Partnerships (ALPs), to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand.

5\. This paper also seeks Cabinet’s approval for the other BEPS reforms proposed in the September 2016 and March 2017 discussion documents to be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. When combined with the decision on foreign hybrid entity double deductions, this will result in an adjustment to the revenue forecasts of $100 million per year from 2019/20 (with $50 million forecast in the preceding year). Given this is a conservative estimate, we note there is an accompanying positive fiscal risk that the revenue may be higher than estimated.

6\. We currently anticipate that final policy recommendations on these BEPS reforms will be considered by Cabinet later this year.

### Background

#### BEPS

7\. The New Zealand Government’s ongoing BEPS work programme has largely been driven by a wider momentum that has developed since 2012, when the OECD/G20 began work on their BEPS Action Plan, which was finalised in October 2015. As a member of the OECD Council, New Zealand approved the 2015 BEPS final package and has supported the BEPS Action Plan since the OECD’s first declaration on BEPS in 2013.

8\. Part of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan is _Action 2: Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ (the OECD recommendations), under which the OECD has designed a set of hybrid mismatch rules for countries to incorporate into their own tax systems. While it is not mandatory to adopt the OECD recommendations, OECD and G20 countries have agreed a general tax policy direction in respect of Action 2. This means that they are expected to converge over time in their treatment of hybrid mismatch arrangements following the agreed common approaches.

9\. The OECD has also recommended actions on _limiting base erosion involving interest deductions and other financial payments_ (Action 4), _preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status_ (Action 7) and _aligning transfer pricing outcomes with value creation_ (Actions 8-10). The Government’s March 2017 discussion documents outline a package of proposed law changes intended to address the OECD’s concerns and recommendations in these areas, although the specific proposals are tailored for the New Zealand environment and so differ in some respects from the OECD’s recommendations.

### Hybrid mismatch arrangements

10\. Hybrid mismatch arrangements arise when countries classify transactions and entities differently from each other under their domestic laws. For example, fixed rate shares may be treated as debt in one country and shares in another. This is inevitable. However, differences in classification provide multinational groups with opportunities to arbitrage between tax systems in two or more jurisdictions to create tax advantages. The result of hybrid mismatch arrangements is less aggregate tax revenue collected in the jurisdictions to which the arrangement relates.

11\. The Government’s discussion document _Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ proposed that New Zealand adopt the OECD recommendations by enacting a specific set of rules that remove the tax advantages of hybrid mismatch arrangements. The proposals apply mainly to related parties of multinational groups and planned arrangements. The expected outcome of having hybrid mismatch rules is that the tax benefit of hybrid mismatch arrangements is eliminated, in most cases influencing taxpayers to switch to more straightforward cross-border financing instruments and structures.

12\. The global response on adopting the OECD recommendations on hybrid mismatch arrangements is as follows:

a. The United Kingdom enacted rules earlier this year to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements (effective 1 January 2017).

b. The EU has released a binding directive which requires EU members to introduce hybrid rules (effective 1 January 2020).

c. Australia is committed to introducing hybrid rules (effective 1 January 2018 or 6 months after enactment).

#### Foreign hybrid entity double deductions

13\. A type of hybrid mismatch featured in the OECD recommendations and featured in the _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ discussion document is the double deduction mismatch, whereby a multinational group claims a tax deduction in two different jurisdictions for what is in substance one item of expenditure. This is most commonly achieved through the use of a hybrid entity – an entity that is treated for tax purposes as transparent (its income and expenditure is attributed to its owners) in the jurisdiction of its parent and opaque (it is taxed as a separate entity on its income and expenditure) in the jurisdiction it was established in. If that hybrid entity makes a loss it can be grouped against the profits of a related party in its establishment jurisdiction. Additionally, the hybrid entity’s parent is attributed the losses of the hybrid entity under the parent jurisdiction’s laws which can then be offset against its own profits. Each of these entity characterisations is valid when viewed in isolation, but in combination the hybrid entity allows the group to reduce its taxable income in two countries where there is only one economic loss.

14\. This double deduction effect can be achieved through the use of an Australian Limited Partnership (ALP), which is a type of hybrid entity that can be established in Australia with a New Zealand company as the 99% parent/limited partner. The diagram below sets out this structure and assumes that the ALP borrows money from a third party bank (and pays interest on that loan) to help fund the wider group.

**Figure 1 – ALP double deductions structure**

![Australian Limited Partnership (ALP) structure](-/media/9d5be0eb930a458093bf585d162185df.ashx)

15\. The ALP is treated akin to a company in Australia, such that its deductions resulting from its interest payments can be grouped with the operating income of Aus Co to reduce tax payable in Australia. However, the ALP is treated as a partnership in New Zealand, so (99% of) its deductions are attributed to NZ Co (the limited partner) and can be offset against New Zealand operating income. In this example, the expenditure of the ALP, and its ability to claim deductions, is uncontentious – it is interest payable at an arm’s length rate to a bank. Nevertheless, the tax revenue collected on two sources of operating income in two countries is reduced by using the ALP as the paying entity.

16\. This paper seeks Cabinet agreement to introduce tax law changes to restrict the ability of a New Zealand business to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities, such as ALPs, to reduce its New Zealand tax liability. This restriction may be limited, so it applies only to the extent that the double deductions are used to reduce the foreign tax liability of a related party.

17\. Alongside rules to achieve this effect, an option being considered to reduce compliance costs is to develop an elective regime whereby the New Zealand parent of a foreign hybrid entity could elect to treat that entity as opaque in order to match the foreign jurisdiction treatment. This may achieve a slightly harsher outcome to the hybrid rule proposal, with reduced compliance costs. The purpose of such a rule would be to allow taxpayers a path to removing the tax advantage of their foreign hybrid entities while avoiding the scope of the proposed hybrid mismatch rules which carry a higher degree of complexity.

18\. Final policy and design proposals on how the rule countering double deductions would be given effect, along with the remaining parts of the hybrid mismatch arrangements project, will be considered by Cabinet later this year. We currently anticipate this paper will be contemporaneous with a paper detailing the response to the other BEPS proposals mentioned below.

### Other BEPS initiatives

19\. The _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ discussion document consults on proposals to counter permanent establishment avoidance, strengthen our transfer pricing rules, and help Inland Revenue deal with uncooperative multinationals. These proposals are aimed at large multinationals that are able to report low taxable profits in New Zealand despite significant economic activity here. The main proposals are:

*   An anti-avoidance rule that will prevent multinationals from structuring their operations to avoid having a permanent establishment (a taxable presence) in New Zealand where one exists in substance.
*   Stronger “source rules” so New Zealand has a greater ability to tax New Zealand-sourced income.
*   Stronger transfer pricing rules which will adjust related party transactions if they don’t align with the actual substance of the multinational’s economic activities and shift the burden of proof onto the taxpayer (rather than Inland Revenue) for proving that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arms-length.
*   A range of administrative measures that will strengthen Inland Revenue’s powers to deal with large multinationals (with at least EUR €750m of global revenues) that do not co-operate with a tax investigation.

20\. Many of these proposals are based on similar tax reforms that Australia has introduced in recent years.

21\. The _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_ discussion document consults on proposed law changes that will limit the ability of multinationals to use interest payments to shift their New Zealand profits offshore. The main proposals are:

*   A proposal to limit high-priced related party debt by introducing an interest rate cap. The proposed cap would base the allowable interest rate on the market interest rates that the particular multinational group would actually use when borrowing from a third party such as a bank. The cap would be based on the credit rating of the multinational group as a whole, rather than their New Zealand subsidiary.
*   A proposal to tighten our existing thin capitalisation rules which limit debt as a percentage of total assets. The proposed rule would remove assets funded by non-debt liabilities from the measure of a firm’s total assets. Examples of non-debt liabilities are trade credits, provisions and out-of-the-money derivatives. This change would bring New Zealand’s rules more in line with other countries with thin capitalisation rules, including Australia.

### Consultation

22\. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials have discussed the foreign hybrid entity double deductions issue with interested private sector groups as part of ongoing consultation workshops on the wider hybrids project. Officials have also been in contact with the Australian Tax Office, the Australian Treasury, and the OECD secretariat in relation to this particular issue and the wider project.

23\. In relation to the two March discussions documents, Inland Revenue has also consulted with the Treasury, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Officials have also been in contact the Australian Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office. Officials have started to meet with key stakeholders to discuss these proposals but submissions are not due until 18 April.

### Financial implications

24\. The proposed rule on foreign hybrid entity losses derived from the _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ discussion document is estimated to increase tax revenue by $50 million per annum once fully implemented. In the first year of application 2018/19, approximately half ($25 million) of that estimated revenue will be captured.

25\. That rule may influence taxpayers to restructure their arrangements so that they fall out of the scope of the rule. This should not alter the estimated revenue effect. Further, specific design issues relating to the proposed rule (such as the opaque election to ease compliance costs) should not affect the estimated revenue.

26\. A total of $140 million in additional BEPS revenues was estimated at the time the March discussion documents were released - assuming all of the proposals are implemented.

27\. We seek Cabinet’s approval for the BEPS reforms to be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018. When combined with the decision on foreign hybrid entity double deductions, this will result in an adjustment to the revenue forecasts of $100 million per year from 2019/20 (with $50 million forecast in the preceding year). Given this is a conservative estimate, we note there is an accompanying positive fiscal risk that the revenue may be higher than estimated.

28\. These estimates assume that the Government will introduce a BEPS taxation bill following the general election which includes the proposed foreign hybrid entity rule and other proposed BEPS measures and that the bill is enacted as legislation and is in force by 1 July 2018.

### Human rights

29\. The proposals in this paper are consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993.

### Legislative implications

30\. Primary legislation would be required to implement the proposals in this paper. At this stage, it is feasible for legislation to be introduced to Parliament that will encompass all the BEPS measures (including the hybrids mismatch arrangements project) in an omnibus taxation bill following the September general election.

### Regulatory impact analysis

31\. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team at Treasury has advised that Inland Revenue is not required to prepare a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) at this stage of the policy process. The merits of the “in principle” decisions being taken at this stage can be made based on analysis already provided in the public consultation papers released last year (on hybrids) and in March (for the balance of the BEPS proposals). A RIS will be provided when Cabinet is asked to make final policy decisions on these measures.

### Publicity

32\. The offices of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue will arrange for the announcement of this decision if necessary, whether as part of Budget 2017 or otherwise.

### Risks

33\. There are risks associated with including the revenue from these changes in the Budget documents. Particularly in respect of the issues covered by the March discussion documents, the Government could be accused of making decisions before the consultation period has closed, effectively circumventing the generic tax policy process. Equally, the private sector may see the relatively conservative estimate of $50m for these changes as an indication that the Government does not intend to implement the full suite of changes being consulted on.

34\. In any event, we consider risks can be mitigated through clear communication of the process by which the estimates are included in the Budget process.

### Recommendations

35\. We recommend that you:

1\. **Agree** to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities, particularly Australian Limited Partnerships (ALPs), to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand;

2\. **Note** that the reforms proposed in the three BEPS discussion documents _Addressing Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements, BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ and _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_ will be progressed, subject to modification in consultation, for implementation from 1 July 2018;

3\. **Note** that as a result of agreeing to the foreign hybrid entity double deductions measure and progressing the hybrid mismatch arrangements project and the other BEPS proposals, the Budget 2017 revenue forecasts will adjusted as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions | 0   | 0   | 25  | 50  | 50  | 50  | 50  |

| **Total revenue effect** | 0   | 0   | 50  | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

4\. **Note** that officials are continuing to develop and consult on all aspects of the BEPS project and that Cabinet approval will be sought for final policy decisions later this year.

### New Zealand's adoption of the OECD's Multilateral Instrument

* * *

### Executive summary

1\. New Zealand’s adoption of the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (“the Multilateral Instrument” or “MLI”) is one of the core parts of the Government’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) reform package.

2\. The MLI will modify a significant number of New Zealand’s existing double tax agreements (DTAs) in order to bring them into line with OECD recommendations to address BEPS. The New Zealand Government has committed to signing the MLI on 7 June 2017 at the OECD signing ceremony in Paris.

3\. This report recommends that you sign and submit the attached Cabinet paper to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 27 April 2017 for consideration by the Cabinet External Relations and Defence Committee at its meeting of 2 May 2017.

4\. The Cabinet paper seeks authority for New Zealand to sign the MLI. The Cabinet paper also seeks approval for the steps necessary to give effect to the provisions of the MLI under New Zealand law. As one of the steps involves Parliamentary treaty examination, the Cabinet paper seeks approval of an extended National Interest Analysis (“NIA”).

5\. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been consulted during the preparation of the attached Cabinet paper and NIA.

6\. An officials’ issues paper titled _New Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS_ was released on 3 March 2017. The issues paper sought feedback on possible implementation issues associated with New Zealand’s signature and ratification of the MLI. Submissions closed on 7 April 2017 and five were received. Two stakeholder workshops (with representatives from Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) and Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG)) were held on 27 and 28 March 2017 to enable officials to better understand practitioners’ concerns.

7\. This report provides you with an overview of the submissions received and alerts you to aspects of the MLI considered to be the most controversial by submitters.

### Background

1\. Addressing tax treaty abuse has been a major part of the BEPS project and a number of the Action items in the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan make recommendations that can only be implemented through changes to DTAs, including:

*   preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances;
*   preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status;
*   neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements that have a treaty aspect and modifying the approach to a company that is resident in both contracting states; and
*   providing improved mechanisms for effective dispute resolution.

2\. Some of these recommendations are BEPS “minimum standards” that countries that commit to solving BEPS are expected to adopt. All other provisions are optional, but are DTA “best practice” and now form part of the OECD Model Tax Convention following adoption of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan.

3\. Countries were presented with the difficulty of how to quickly and efficiently implement these measures without requiring the bilateral renegotiation of several thousand existing DTAs. To this end, the OECD brought approximately 100 jurisdictions together to develop a multilateral treaty that would swiftly modify the DTAs of participating jurisdictions, thus avoiding the need for protracted bilateral negotiations.

4\. New Zealand officials were involved in the negotiation of the MLI text, which was formally adopted by the OECD in November 2016.

5\. The New Zealand Government has committed to signing the MLI on 7 June 2017 at the OECD signing ceremony in Paris and the Minister of Finance has delegated this duty to the Minister of Revenue. An Instrument of Full Powers will need to be obtained from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to enable the Minister of Revenue to sign the MLI. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will prepare this Instrument and arrange for its signature.

6\. New Zealand and other participating jurisdictions have submitted a preliminary list of notifications and reservations to the OECD, which includes the DTAs New Zealand has nominated to be modified by the MLI. These lists will determine which of New Zealand’s DTAs are modified and how they are modified, but will not be considered final until New Zealand ratifies the MLI.

7\. Where both parties to a DTA include that DTA in their respective lists of notifications and reservations, that DTA is a “covered tax agreement”. A list of New Zealand’s current covered tax agreements based on preliminary notifications and reservations as at 11 April 2017 is included at Appendix C. Based on current draft notifications, New Zealand is expected to have 29 covered tax agreements. While this list is not final, it provides a fairly good indication of the likely coverage of the MLI. New Zealand’s approach is to nominate most of its 40 DTAs. This gives New Zealand the best chance of strengthening our DTAs with as many jurisdictions as possible. The only DTAs not nominated are those with counterparties who are not expected to sign the MLI.

8\. A list of the provisions New Zealand has indicated it will adopt is included as Appendix B. New Zealand’s approach has been to adopt all applicable minimum standard and optional provisions. This is because the OECD Model Tax Convention plays an important role in informing New Zealand’s treaty policy and New Zealand has committed to resolving BEPS more generally. New Zealand also believes the changes to be made by the MLI are correct in principle and should be as widely adopted as possible.

### Public consultation

9\. An officials’ issues paper titled _New Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS_ was released on 3 March 2017. The issues paper sought feedback on possible implementation issues associated with New Zealand’s signature and ratification of the MLI.

10\. While we do not generally consult on tax treaties, because of the novel nature of the MLI we recommended seeking submissions from the private sector on how it will work in practice. This issues paper focused on implementation issues, however submitters also commented on the substantive provisions as well.

11\. Submissions closed on 7 April 2017 and five were received from Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG), EY, PwC and KPMG.

12\. Two stakeholder workshops with representatives from CA ANZ and CTG were held on 27 and 28 March 2017 to enable officials to better understand practitioners’ concerns prior to formal submissions being made.

#### Overall comments

13\. CA ANZ and EY supported the adoption of the MLI as the most effective way to implement the treaty-related BEPS recommendations. EY agreed that the MLI should be implemented as widely as possible, taking up minimum standards and virtually all optional articles, with few reservations.

14\. PwC acknowledged that participating in OECD and G20 initiatives to target BEPS is a key focus for the New Zealand Government, while not explicitly supporting the adoption.

15\. CTG did not express an overall view on adoption, but submitted that New Zealand should not adopt all of the optional provisions.

16\. KPMG acknowledged that the New Zealand Government has the constitutional ability to decide New Zealand’s tax treaty position and that it therefore makes sense to achieve this in the shortest time at the least cost through the MLI, but KPMG noted that despite this constitutional position, it is also clear that in the current environment there is a demand for transparency and actual consultation for New Zealand’s treaties. KPMG submit that this has not occurred with New Zealand’s decision to sign the MLI, even with the release of the issues paper and views the implementation of the MLI as a “fait accompli”. KPMG references in their submission as a point of comparison, the detailed consultation undertaken by the Australian Government.

17\. Officials note that, consistent with international treaty practice, the negotiation of the MLI was on a strictly confidential basis and that public consultation by Australia and the UK (like New Zealand), was undertaken after the MLI had been negotiated and formally adopted. Unlike New Zealand, however, Australia consulted on what position the Australian Government should take in relation to specific provisions. The New Zealand Government did not choose to take that approach – instead focussing on implementation.

#### Specific submissions

18\. The main issues raised in submissions relate to:

*   substantive positions taken by New Zealand;
*   requests for additional guidance and administrative resources to help taxpayers apply DTAs as modified by the MLI; and
*   technical domestic law changes.

##### Substantive positions taken by New Zealand

19\. Consistent with New Zealand’s approach to DTAs more generally, submissions were not requested on New Zealand’s position on the substantive provisions of the MLI.

20\. We note the MLI has been negotiated and adopted at an international level, and is not able to be changed. The text was formally adopted by the OECD in November 2016. New Zealand supported the outcomes of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan which are reflected in the MLI. The strengthened provisions contained in the MLI will be incorporated into the OECD Model Tax Convention and New Zealand’s negotiating model going forward.

21\. The issues paper did include a summary of the provisions New Zealand is intending to sign up to, in order to provide additional context for submitters. Submitters did comment on New Zealand position on the substantive provisions. We have highlighted the most controversial aspects in Appendix D. Generally speaking, the issues raised in relation to the substantive provisions are able to be managed administratively, are necessary to ensure New Zealand’s DTA network is strengthened against common BEPS techniques or are consistent with New Zealand’s overall position as a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan. The positions are also broadly consistent with the direction of New Zealand’s treaty policy over time.

22\. The substantive points raised by submitters and officials’ responses are summarised in the table in Appendix D.

##### Additional guidance and administrative resources

23\. A strong theme in submissions was the need for administrative guidance and access to competent authority resource to resolve uncertainty associated with the implementation of the MLI.

24\. Submitters requested:

*   guidance on how Article 3 (the fiscally transparent entity provision) affects collective investment vehicles with non-resident beneficiaries;
*   specific guidance on the competent authority process for the application of dual resident entity provision (Article 4) and in the case of Australia (at least) the existence of a streamlined process or a self-assessment system;
*   guidance on the application of the 365 day rule in the dividend transfer provision (Article 8) where the 365 day rule has not yet been met;
*   administrative guidance on a simplified measurement rule for assessing whether a company is a land rich company rule (Article 9), for example a rule based on quarterly measurements;
*   guidance on the interaction between section BG 1 and the treaty principal purpose test (PPT) (for example, a standard practice statement);
*   guidance on New Zealand’s position on profit attribution to permanent establishments;
*   that Inland Revenue should maintain a list on its website of covered tax agreements, dates of “entry into effect for specific taxes” for each of New Zealand’s covered tax agreements and any changes/additions by DTA partners so that taxpayers can easily determine when a DTA has been modified and the effective date of amendments to particular provisions;
*   that Inland Revenue should produce consolidated versions of New Zealand’s DTAs as modified by the MLI; and
*   more competent authority resource to address cases of double taxation and assist taxpayers with disputes.

**\[Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982\]**

26\. In relation to the request for specific guidance on the interaction between section BG 1 and the PPT, officials note that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has previously issued a substantial Interpretation Statement on the interpretation and application of the GAAR (IS 13/01 “Tax Avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007”). It is not considered that further guidance on how the PPT and the GAAR will apply would be helpful, and specific cases will depend on particular facts and circumstances. We also note that the OECD/G20 final report on Action 6 gave guidance on the interaction of domestic law general anti-avoidance rules and tax treaties, including the PPT.

27\. In terms of providing guidance on New Zealand’s approach to profit attribution to permanent establishments, this topic is not directly covered by the MLI and is still subject to work at the OECD level. Once that work is complete, consideration could be given to producing guidance on New Zealand’s position on this issue.

28\. In response to the request for Inland Revenue to produce consolidated versions of the DTAs modified by the MLI, we note that publishers may produce consolidated texts as they currently do with amending protocols and original DTAs. However, based on requests for Inland Revenue to produce these and the fact that many of our counterparties are already considering producing them, we are looking into whether it would be feasible for Inland Revenue to produce informal consolidated versions (or endorse those produced by our treaty partners), in respect of New Zealand’s most significant DTAs. These informal versions would not be legally binding.

29\. In addition to this, New Zealand Inland Revenue officials are continuing discussions with overseas counterparts to determine what additional certainty the competent authorities may be able to provide to taxpayers (for example, through a memorandum of understanding which sets out in further detail how each MLI provision applies to the DTA).

##### Technical domestic law changes

30\. Submitters suggested a number of technical changes to domestic law.

31\. In particular, they were concerned about ensuring that the arbitration process under the MLI would function seamlessly with New Zealand’s domestic dispute resolution procedures. Officials will report separately to you on domestic law changes needed in this respect.

32\. Submitters also suggested that domestic time limits for refunds should be extended (from the current 4 years) where a refund is the result of MAP or arbitration, given the length of time these processes can take.

33\. Submitters also raised the need for clarity around the interaction between the strengthened permanent establishment provisions in the MLI and the proposed permanent establishment anti-avoidance provision currently being considered by the Government. Officials will advise Ministers on this issue when reporting on the outcomes of consultation on the Government Discussion Document _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_.

34\. One submitter suggested there should be a domestic law change to prevent section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applying in cases where the PPT in a DTA has been invoked. Officials do not support this suggestion. It runs counter to the recent reform to ensure section BG 1 overrides DTAs in avoidance cases. The application of either or both provisions to a particular transaction will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.

35\. Officials will report to you separately with recommendations on these domestic law issues.

### Next steps

36\. This report recommends that you sign and refer the attached Cabinet paper to Cabinet Office. It is intended that the Cabinet paper be considered by the Cabinet External Relations and Defence Committee at its meeting of 2 May 2017. The Cabinet Office deadline for receiving papers for that meeting is 10am, Thursday 27 April 2017.

37\. The Cabinet paper seeks agreement for New Zealand to sign the MLI. The Cabinet paper also seeks approval for the steps necessary to give effect to the provisions of the MLI under New Zealand law. As one of the steps involves Parliamentary treaty examination, the Cabinet paper seeks approval of an extended NIA.

38\. After the MLI is signed, it will need to be given effect under New Zealand domestic law. This will be achieved by an Order in Council made under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. We will report to you on the Order in Council once the MLI has been signed and other relevant steps have been taken, including the completion of Parliamentary treaty examination.

39\. The Cabinet Manual requires that Cabinet approval for any treaty action be sought either jointly or in consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Cabinet paper and accompanying documents therefore need to be referred to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for consultation.

40\. The Cabinet paper and extended NIA, along with the full text of the MLI and New Zealand’s proposed reservations and notifications are attached. The accompanying documents are to be appended as annexes to the Cabinet paper when it is submitted to Cabinet Office.

41\. The reasons for signing the MLI are set out in the Cabinet paper and extended NIA, along with an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the MLI for New Zealand.

42\. The Cabinet paper recommends, in particular, that Cabinet:

*   approve the text of the MLI and New Zealand’s reservations and notifications, and authorise the signing of the MLI;
*   approve the extended NIA;
*   agree that, following signature, the MLI and NIA be submitted for Parliamentary treaty examination;
*   invite the Minister of Revenue to issue drafting instructions for an Order in Council to give effect to the MLI; and
*   authorise officials (once all necessary steps have been completed) to deposit New Zealand’s instrument of ratification with the MLI Depositary and confirm New Zealand’s notifications and reservations.

43\. There is an opportunity for the Minister of Revenue to sign the MLI at a signing ceremony arranged by the OECD, to be held in Paris on 7 June 2017. If the Minister of Revenue is not able to attend, then it is possible that another Minister or the New Zealand Ambassador to the OECD may be able to attend the signing ceremony.

### Appendix B

| BEPS measure | Detail | Minimum standard | Should NZ adopt? | Australia’s position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1\. Neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements that have a treaty aspect  <br>(Action 2 report) | **Fiscally transparent entities**<br><br>The MLI introduces or amends a fiscally transparent entity (FTE) provision. FTEs (like trusts or partnerships) create arbitrage opportunities because they are treated differently for tax purposes by different countries. The MLI provision clarifies that treaty benefits will only be allowed to the extent to which the item of income is taxed in the state in which the entity is resident. New Zealand already includes this provision (or an equivalent provision) in its DTAs with Australia, United States, Chile and Japan.<br><br>_Article 3 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Similar substantive position to NZ.<br><br>Adopt for DTAs that do not contain a detailed provision addressing FTEs. |
| **Dual resident entities**<br><br>The MLI introduces or amends a dual resident entity (DRE) tie breaker provision. Like FTEs, DREs can be used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The proposed provision will require CAs to agree the residence status of a DRE. Where there is no agreement, either treaty benefits will be denied or only allowed to the extent the CAs agree.<br><br>_Article 4 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Similar substantive position to NZ.<br><br>Adopt, but exclude the last sentence (for constitutional issues). |
| **Relief of double taxation**<br><br>The MLI allows countries to strengthen their application of the exemption method to relieve double taxation. New Zealand already applies the (more robust) credit method in all of its DTAs, and therefore proposes not to adopt any of the options.<br><br>_Article 5 of the MLI_ | No  | Not applicable | Same as NZ<br><br>Not applicable |
| 2\. Preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (Action 6 report) | **Preamble language – minimum standard**<br><br>The MLI will amend the preamble to DTAs to emphasise that as well as aiming to relieve double taxation, the treaty also aims to prevent opportunities for non-taxation, reduced taxation or tax avoidance.<br><br>_Article 6(1) and (2) of the MLI_ | Yes | Yes | Same as New Zealand |
| **Preamble language – optional amendment**<br><br>The MLI allows countries to adopt the following optional amendment to the preamble to DTAs:<br><br>“Desiring to further develop their economic relationship and to enhance their co-operation in tax matters,”<br><br>_Article 6(3) and (6) of the MLI_ | No  | No  | Different to New Zealand.<br><br>Adopt |
| **Treaty anti-abuse rules**<br><br>The MLI requires jurisdictions to introduce an anti-abuse rule into DTAs. Jurisdictions can meet this minimum requirement in one of three ways:<br><br>1.  a principal purpose test (PPT) alone;<br>2.  a PPT plus a “simplified limitation on benefits” (LOB) clause. The LOB is a mechanical provision that seeks to identify, through a series of black-letter tests, whether a person is genuinely entitled to the benefits of a DTA; or<br>3.  enter into bilateral negotiations to include a detailed LOB provision plus a PPT or anti-conduit rules.<br><br>New Zealand has indicated it wishes to adopt a PPT alone. The PPT is similar to New Zealand’s domestic law GAAR and will deny treaty benefits if the principal purpose of an arrangement was to secure those benefits. Also, in officials’ view, it generally covers the same treaty shopping issues as the alternative approaches.<br><br>_Article 7 of the MLI_ | Yes | Yes | Same as New Zealand |
| **Dividend transfer transactions**<br><br>The MLI introduces a provision that requires shares to be held for a minimum of 365 days for the shareholder to be entitled to the reduced withholding tax (WHT) rates on dividends. This is to stop shareholders buying shares temporarily to access the reduced WHT rates and then immediately selling them.<br><br>_Article 8 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Same as New Zealand |
| **Land rich company rules**<br><br>The MLI introduces a treaty provision that strengthens the anti-abuse “land-rich company” test (land rich companies are companies whose assets are mainly land).  <br>Some treaties do not contain this provision at all, so the MLI also allows it to be inserted into those treaties. The new rule reinforces the position that the source jurisdiction can tax land held by non-resident owners in the other jurisdiction through corporate vehicles.<br><br>To prevent artificial and temporary dilution of the amount of land held by a company just before sale, the MLI provision requires the threshold for the amount of land ownership which triggers the rule to be measured on every day in the 365 day period leading up to the sale of the shares.<br><br>The MLI provision also ensures the same rule applies to other investment vehicles such as partnerships and trusts.<br><br>_Article 9 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Similar substantive position to New Zealand.<br><br>Adopt generally, but do not adopt para. (b) for DTAs that already contain an equivalent provision. |
| **Third-state PE rule**<br><br>The MLI introduces a treaty provision that denies treaty benefits in the case of income derived by a PE of a resident of one of the parties to the DTA, where that PE is situated in a low tax third-state.<br><br>_Article 10 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Different to New Zealand<br><br>Do not adopt. |
| **Right to tax own residents**<br><br>The MLI introduces a provision that preserves a jurisdiction’s right to tax its own residents. For example, this rule prevents New Zealand residents engaged in a tax avoidance arrangement claiming a DTA prevents New Zealand from using the domestic law GAAR to impose tax.<br><br>_Article 11 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Same as New Zealand. |
| 3\. Preventing the artificial avoidance of PE status | **Commissionaire arrangements and similar strategies**<br><br>Currently, a number of artificial structures, including the civil law concept of a “commissionaire”, arrangements whereby contracts which are substantially negotiated in a State are not concluded in that State because they are finalised or authorised abroad and arrangements whereby a related party who habitually concludes contracts on behalf of an enterprise is characterised as “independent agents”, can be used to avoid having a PE in a jurisdiction. A new provision will deem non-residents using these structures to have a PE in the jurisdiction.<br><br>_Articles 12 and 15 of the MLI_ | No  | **\[Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982\]** |     |
| **Specific activity exemptions – preparatory and auxiliary qualification**<br><br>Certain specific activities carried on in a jurisdiction are deemed not to constitute a PE (for example, premises used for simply storing goods or stock maintained for display or delivery). These specific carve-outs from the PE definition allowed quite substantial economic activities to fall within them.<br><br>The MLI proposes clarifying that the specific carve-outs listed in the DTA must be subject to an additional requirement that they be “preparatory and auxiliary” in nature. There are two options for dealing with this issues – Option A (which New Zealand favours) which subjects all of the existing specific activities to an explicit “preparatory and auxiliary” test, and Option B, which does not subject the specific activities to the “preparatory and auxiliary” test (because these activities are considered to be inherently preparatory and auxiliary in nature), but subjects any other activity or combination of activities to the “preparatory and auxiliary” test.<br><br>_Articles 13 and 15 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Similar substantive position to New Zealand.<br><br>Adopt Option A for DTAs that do not already contain an equivalent provision. |
| **Specific activity exemptions – Anti-fragmentation rule**<br><br>The MLI introduces an “anti-fragmentation” rule that will prevent an enterprise from dividing up all of its activities so that related parties each carry on a separate part of the business (that fall within the PE exceptions), but taken together they constitute a PE.<br><br>_Articles 13 and 15 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Same as New Zealand. |
| **Anti-contract splitting rule**<br><br>Currently a construction, installation or building project does not constitute a PE unless it last for more than 12 months (or six months in the case of many of New Zealand’s treaties). Entities were abusing this time limit by having back-to-back contracts so they never exceeded the time threshold. Generally the contracts were undertaken by different companies within the same group of companies. The new an “anti-contract splitting” rule will aggregate related projects to prevent PE avoidance.<br><br>_Articles 14 and 15 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Similar substantive position to New Zealand.<br><br>Adopt except for provisions of DTAs that cover exploration for or exploitation of natural resources. |
| 4\. Providing improved mechanisms for effective dispute resolution | **MAP – access to the CAs of either jurisdiction**<br><br>In covered tax agreements that do not already have it, the MLI will introduce a provision allowing taxpayers to request mutual agreement procedure (MAP) in cases where they believe taxation is not in accordance with the treaty. If a MAP provision is already contained in a DTA, the MLI will amend it to allow taxpayers to approach the CA of either jurisdiction to resolve uncertainty as to how the DTA applies (New Zealand’s DTAs currently contain MAP provisions, but taxpayers are only entitled to approach the CA of the jurisdiction of which they are a resident).<br><br>_Article 16 of the MLI_ | Yes | Yes | Same as New Zealand. |
| **MAP – corresponding adjustment**<br><br>Requires contracting states to make appropriate corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases.<br><br>_Article 17 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Similar substantive position to New Zealand. Adopt, except for DTAs that already contain an equivalent provision. |
| **Arbitration**<br><br>If, under the MAP process, the CAs do not agree on the correct interpretation of the DTA, the CAs can submit the matter to an independent arbitrator (or a panel of three arbitrators) for decision. The arbitrators will decide which of the CAs is correct. The CAs are generally bound by the decision of the arbitrators, but the taxpayer is not. Therefore, the taxpayer could pursue a court case if it disagrees with the arbitrators’ decision.<br><br>New Zealand’s approach is to adopt what is referred to as “final offer” or “last best offer” arbitration (in Article 23(1)), but to accept “independent opinion” arbitration if the other party to the Covered Tax Agreement chooses this (by entering a reservation under Article 23(2)). In the case of “independent opinion” arbitration, New Zealand will adopt Article 24(2) and (3) which means that the arbitrators’ decision will not be binding on the CAs if they come to an alternative resolution of all unresolved issues within 3 calendar months of the delivery of the arbitrators’ decision.<br><br>New Zealand also proposes to require undertakings of confidentiality by all parties involved in arbitration (Article 23(5)) and reserves the right not to include arbitration provisions in Covered Tax Agreements with jurisdictions that do not require the same (Article 23(6) and (7)).<br><br>New Zealand intends to enter a free form reservation in respect to arbitration to carve out cases that involve the application of New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule contained in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.<br><br>_Articles 18 – 26 of the MLI_ | No  | Yes | Very similar substantive position to New Zealand (including reserving on GAAR).<br><br>But has not reserved the right to not adopt arbitration with jurisdictions which do not require confidentiality of proceedings. |

### Appendix D

| Submission | Officials’ response |
| --- | --- |
| The dual resident entity provision in Article 4 should not be adopted. There are compliance costs associated with adopting this provision. Submitters felt many cases of dual resident entities were innocent. There are existing domestic law rules that address the mischief this rule aims to address. | *   For some time OECD countries have been dissatisfied with the existing rule. This is partly because there is no consensus on how it should be interpreted and applied, and partly because there is concern about abuse.<br>*   Eight of New Zealand’s DTAs (including the New Zealand-US DTA) already contain this provision and it has not, to our knowledge, been problematic.<br>*   This provision is the new OECD best practice and will be the international standard going forward in terms of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Australia is opting for it as well.<br>*   While there are some domestic law measures that prevent certain types of abuse by dual resident entities, they do not cover all situations.<br>*   New Zealand officials will manage the compliance costs and certainty issues by providing administrative guidance, in particular through a potential agreement with Australia on how the provision will be applied in practice between our two countries. |
| It is not necessary to adopt specific anti-avoidance measures (such as the contract splitting rule in Article 14, the dividend transfer rule in Article 8, and the land-rich company rule in Article 9), given there will be an overall general anti-abuse rule.<br><br>These provisions will increase compliance costs. | *   Specific provisions that address known abusive arrangements are desirable.<br>*   These provisions will become part of the OECD Model Tax Convention (sometimes as alternative provisions in the commentaries) and will be the starting point for future bilateral negotiations going forward.<br>*   Some of these provisions are already included in some of New Zealand’s DTAs with no apparent issues.<br>*   Officials are looking at administrative measures to reduce compliance costs (e.g. administrative guidance on accepting quarterly valuations for the land-rich company provisions). |
| New Zealand should exclude from its list of covered tax agreements DTAs with countries who do not agree to adopt arbitration. This leaves open the possibility that “bad faith” adjustments will be made by a country under the strengthened MLI provisions, with no ability for taxpayers to request binding arbitration of this decision. | *   This approach would reduce the efficacy of the MLI in enabling New Zealand to meet the OECD minimum standard as New Zealand would have to endeavour to undertake bilateral negotiations with these excluded jurisdictions, which could represent about half of New Zealand’s DTAs, based on current draft notifications.<br>*   This would mean that – until bilateral negotiations can take place – the DTAs excluded on this basis would remain vulnerable to the BEPS techniques the MLI is designed to address.<br>*   On balance it is in New Zealand’s interest to obtain the stronger DTA provisions, even if it is without the optional arbitration provisions.<br>*   We also note that many of New Zealand’s DTAs already include a principal purpose test and wide permanent establishment rules, but no ability to pursue arbitration. Therefore this combination is already a feature of some of our existing DTAs and, from New Zealand’s perspective, is not problematic.<br>*   We also have to expect that our treaty partners will apply DTA provisions in good faith. New Zealand’s DTAs contain MAP processes to address any issues with this.<br>*   Finally, there is hope that, over time, more countries will adopt arbitration through the MLI or bilateral negotiations. |
| The rationale for New Zealand’s reservation on section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act (the domestic law general anti-avoidance provision (GAAR)) in respect of arbitration is not clear.<br><br>New Zealand should not reserve on section BG 1. | *   New Zealand’s domestic GAAR overrides DTAs under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.<br>*   This means that, to the extent to which an arbitration decision was contrary to the GAAR, New Zealand would be unable to implement it. As arbitration is required to binding, New Zealand’s inability to implement a decision that is contrary to the GAAR is problematic.<br>*   Therefore, New Zealand has taken the position (as have a number of other countries),[\[3\]](#footnote3)<br>     that a case will be excluded from arbitration to the extent that any unresolved issues relate to the application of a domestic law GAAR.<br>*   We do not agree that New Zealand should remove this reservation as it would give rise to potential conflicts with our domestic law. |
| New Zealand’s section BG 1 reservation with respect to arbitration should also extend to MAP. | *   This is not an option under the MLI.<br>*   Additionally, subjecting section BG 1 cases to MAP does not present the same domestic law conflict as binding arbitration. |
| New Zealand should consider expanding the section BG 1 reservation to include the proposed PE avoidance rule (contained in the Government Discussion Document _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_) | *   This is not yet in domestic law (or even approved by Cabinet), so it would not be appropriate to include this in a reservation at this time. This is something that could be added before New Zealand deposits its instrument of ratification after further consideration. |
| Listed companies may not be able to access arbitration as their continuous disclosure obligations (to the stock exchange) would not allow arbitration to be kept confidential | *   Confidentiality of arbitration is core to its acceptance by a large number of jurisdictions (including New Zealand).<br>*   If New Zealand did not agree to confidentiality, other countries would not agree to arbitration with New Zealand. This would mean all taxpayers – not just listed companies – would be denied arbitration.<br>*   This is not in taxpayers’ interests.<br>*   We expect that the level of disclosure could be managed to prevent the loss of arbitration. |
| DTAs under negotiation should be included at covered tax agreements. | *   We have included DTAs currently under negotiation where the other party has agreed to this approach. |
| New Zealand would be justified in making the application of the MLI to a particular DTA conditional on acceptance that New Zealand taxpayers include PIEs and KiwiSaver schemes and confirmation that a look through entity is also entitled to DTA relief. | *   This is not an option under the MLI.<br>*   Additionally, look through entities are also the subject of the fiscally transparent provision of the MLI which makes entitlement to treaty benefits conditional on an item of income being taxed in the state in which the entity is resident. A blanket approach to fiscally transparent entities is therefore inconsistent with the provision itself, New Zealand treaty policy and international best practice. |
| Why has New Zealand taken a different position from Australia on the third state PE rule (in Article 10) | *   Australia has not yet made a decision on whether to adopt Article 10, so it is not yet clear whether we differ from Australia.<br>*   We have considered this provision – in particular how it applies to outbound investors – and believe it is principled, appropriate and balanced.<br>*   If the provision applies too widely or applies to innocent cases, there is competent authority discretion to grant treaty benefits. |

www.ird.govt.nz Ref: 22 OIA1665 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 05 April 2022 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 18 March 2022. You requested the following: IRD’s policies for both working overtime an d accumulating annual leave. Overtime policy Inland Revenue does not hold any policies regarding working overtime. Rather, overtime provisions are stipulated in individuals’ employment agreements. Therefore, this part of your request has been refused under section 18(e) of the OIA, as the policy requested does not exist. Annual leave policy There is no specific policy solely on accumulating annual leave. However, I have attached a copy of Inland Revenue’s Leave Policy and Annual Leave Guidelines which address when annual leave is accrued. Right of Review If you disagree with my decisions on your OIA request, you can ask an Inland Revenue review officer to review my decisions. To ask for an internal review, please email the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at: CommissionersCorrespondence@ird.govt.nz. Alternatively, under section 28(3) of the OIA, you have the right to ask the Ombudsman to investigate and review my decision. You can contact the office of the Ombudsman by email at: info@ombudsman.parliament.nz. Publishing of OIA response Finally, please note that, Inland Revenue regularly publishes, on its website, responses to requests that may be of interest to the wider public. Your personal details or any information that would identify, you will be removed prior to it being published. Thank you again for your request. I trust that the information provided is of assistance to you. Yours sincerely Erina C layton Enterprise Leader, People & Workplace Services 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Who this policy applies to This policy and the guidelines which support its application apply to all Inland Revenue employees. Many of the leave provisions are contained in employment agreements. Additionally, employees may have individually negotiated provisions/terms with Inland Revenue or have specific protected terms (some documents refer to these as “grandparented”). To ensure correct identification of entitlements and obligations, people leaders need to check the employee’s personnel file and their employee's agreement (including any variations). Specific practice around leave NOTIFICATION AND RECORDING Employees should notify their people leader that they intend to take leave as early as possible and specify the type of leave. Employees are required to organise leave arrangements with their people leader. The leave is entered and approved through our self service tools to maintain an accurate record of leave taken and current entitlements. In the case of domestic violence leave, the leave can be also be applied for via a union support person or HR Advice. Specific types of leave For further information check the specific guidelines which expand on many of the leave types below (Topic 2 – ‘Leave’ in our People Policies & Guidelines. The homepage also includes links to employment agreements, protected entitlements etc.) ANNUAL LEAVE Annual leave may be taken as it accrues. It must be taken in either full or half days. While generally it is the employee’s choice as to how and when they request leave, the usual expectation is that they will take annual leave within 12 months of becoming entitled to it. Employees are encouraged to take at least one long break of at least two weeks each year for rest and recreation. Inland Revenue can require an employee to take annual leave (including specifying when) but must provide a minimum of 14 days’ notice. (Situations when this may occur are covered in the annual leave guidelines). Anticipating annual leave Where applicable, the employees’ employment agreement sets out how much leave may be anticipated. An employee may anticipate some of the next year’s annual leave entitlement if their people leader approves. If the employee stops working for Inland Revenue before accruing enough leave to cover the anticipated annual leave taken, Inland Revenue will recover the difference from the final pay if possible. 1 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PEOPLE POLICIES AND GUIDELINES Topic 2(a) – Leave Annual Leave Guidelines These guidelines provide information about requesting, accruing and using annual leave. Process and planning requirements You must enter your requests for annual leave in our self-service tools for approval by your people leader before you take the leave. The leave can only be entered in half or full days. Your people leader will approve or decline leave as soon as possible so you can make plans. Requesting your leave as far in advance as possible will increase your chances of being able to take the leave at a time that suits you and supports your leader to plan for the impact of your absence on work demands and priorities. Your leader may decline a request for annual leave if your absence at the requested time will affect the needs of the business (for example, if delivery deadlines would be affected). Your leader will let you know the reasons for declining the request and can support you in reconsidering your leave plans. The only exception to entering your leave in our self-service tools in advance, is if you’re absent from the office. For example, if you are taking annual leave because you have run out of sick leave or to extend a period of bereavement leave. Your leader will still need to approve the leave before you take it. They can enter it for you, or you can do it as soon as you return to work. How you accrue annual leave Annual leave accrues as you work, including when you are on annual and other paid leave. When you are absent on special leave without pay for more than 35 consecutive days (including weekends), you will not accrue annual leave beyond the first week of that absence. Exceptions to this are set out in the Holidays Act s16 2(a) and include parental leave, unpaid sick leave, unpaid bereavement leave and unpaid family violence leave Using your annual leave for sickness or bereavement You can ask your leader to consider a request to use annual leave to cover a period of sickness. If you have paid sick leave available then annual leave will not be approved. Depending on the circumstances, if you suffer a bereavement and you wish to have a period of time off work following the death, you may request annual leave in addition to any approved bereavement leave.

Yo urs sincerely Cate Robertson Enterprise Leader – Strategic Architecture \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Channel Strategy Refresh Strategic and Investment Board Date: 1 May 2024 Sponsors: Mary Craig, James Grayson Attendees: Cate Robertson, Brijesh John, Souradeep Gupta Appendix A Item 1 Purpose and Background •Channel Strategy is a key enabling business strategy under Our Strategy. It provides directional statements for Inland Revenue (IR)’s channel management and related investments and directly supports other related strategies such as Customers and Products. •Our channel strategy provides the vision, principles and recommendations based on current state assessment along with an integrated roadmap to guide investments in channels (delivered through customer, product and other change initiatives). Put simply, the channel strategy defines or guides which channels should be provided to which customers and for which services and products by best use of our operating model and enablers (technology, intelligence, business processes, policies and initiatives/change programmes). •A channel is a means by which IR can make itsproducts and services available to the customers.IR currently has around 40 customer channels which play a significant role in the New Zealand economy as a gateway to access tax and social policy products and services. Thecombination of channels with products and services defines the number of customer interactions we have at IR. •The previous Channel strategy was completed in 2015 as part Business Transformation (BT) programme. BT has achieved the desired channel shift to digital channels. The current focus is to build on those investments for the future and align to roles from Our Strategy. •Apart from the BT recommendations, the Channel Strategy initiative has considered refreshed Enterprise and Customer Segment Strategies, ongoing asset management, ‘Digital Divide’, ‘Inclusion’, ‘Te Ao Māori view’and ‘new service models’ (e.g. changing role of IR in providing social services) to evaluate the role of each channel. •Over 80 stakeholders across CCS, ES and ED&I have been consulted to bring a holistic view across IR’s channel-related initiatives and ongoing channel management activities. The findings and recommendations have also been socialised with governance groups such as PPG andother forums such as CCS-LT, ES-LT, ED&I-LT and several working groups across the business. 2 Recommendations It is recommended that the Board •Approves the Channel Strategy’s Vision and Principles (Pages 5,6). •Approves the three (3) sets of prioritised recommendations that are referenced in the summary report (ref: Page 7) to create an aspirational future state for our channels. These are to: 1. Implement integrated channel management and planning 2. Improve channel related voice of customer and data 3. Enable relationships in operating model to improve customer outcomes •Notesthat an integrated channel roadmap has been developed and its execution will follow IR’s standard governance aroundprioritisation, risk management, funding, design and implementationdecisions. •Notes that the recommendations and roadmap are provided to identify impactful changes in channel settings in the next horizon to ensure channels are efficient and effective, stewardship of channels are maintained, and enable broader contribution as per Our Strategy. •Notes that several of the recommendations are already in progress via various channel and customer related initiatives. •Notes the approach taken for the work undertaken includes integration of best practices, public sector context and broad stakeholder engagement across IR including teams operating channels, segments, products and services, technology, data and customer intelligence. Mary Craig Deputy Commissioner Enterprise Design and Integrity James Grayson Deputy Commissioner Customer & Compliance Services- Individuals 3 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) Role of Channels in IR Context 4 Channel Vision “Our vision is to continuously align our channels to a Customer Interaction Model that meets our customers’ preferences rather than what works for us. With focus on accessibility, trust and agility, we aspire to be responsive stewards, making broader contributions for all stakeholders. We will innovate and integrate our multi-channel approach, ensuring a seamless customer experience and effective and efficient service delivery.” 5 6 Following are a set of eight guiding principles for channel management and related investments: 1.Prioritise Customer-Centric Approach 2.Integrate Multi-Channel View 3.Provide Navigational Aid, Education and Engagement 4.Enable Natural Systems 5.Improve Personalization, Accessibility and Inclusivity 6.Enable Broader Contribution 7.Include Privacy, Ethics, Legal and Security concerns 8.Improve Agility, Re-Usability and Cost-Effectiveness •Directional statements under each principle have been created and provide guidance for initiatives, value streams or programmes of work that are channel related. •Channel principles and associated directional statements have been mapped in detail to Enterprise Strategy as well as other business segment and sub-strategies approved by SIB previously. •The implementation of channel principles will be underpinned by Te Pou o te Tangata / How we do things at IR.

Our Enterprise Strategy is central to shaping the approach to AI. This strategy revolves around four key elements: our people, the driving force behind our operations; our customers, who guide our operational focus; supporting the Crown to be a better Treaty partner, promoting equitable services across Aotearoa New Zealand; and maintaining the integrity of the tax and social policy system, our underlying cornerstone. AI holds the potential to strengthen these pillars by streamlining processes, anticipating risks, and optimising public service delivery. However, as AI innovations and data flow escalate, stewardship becomes more critical. Falling behind in this rapidly evolving field could jeopardise our ability to effectively maintain our services. It's also crucial that te ao Māori principles are deeply woven into our strategy. By aligning AI with our objectives, we can strive towards promoting ‘Oranga' via cross- government cooperation, robust social policy, and revenue generation. This combined strategic precision and deepened operational understanding could significantly elevate our performance. •We have leveraged technology for outcome improvement and efficiency gains throughout our history. While AI technologies are emerging and advancing quickly, they are simply the next tool for us to leverage to empower our people to further the interests and improve the delivery to our customers and New Zealanders as a whole. •Combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) with our service delivery can optimise resource utilisation and streamline operations. This would enhance result-oriented decision-making in Aotearoa New Zealand by leveraging machine learning models for accurate tax prediction and ensuring effective resource allocation. AI can also facilitate continuous innovative solutions that improve service delivery. •Fostering an AI-enabled ecosystem can promote stewardship by improving adaptability and safeguarding existing systems. Predictive analytics offer the ability to proactively adjust to future customer trends. Coupled with AI-enhanced cybersecurity, this would bolster legislative, asset, and resource integrity. Additionally, implementing AI-oriented training programs would ensure the workforce evolves in line with technological advancements. •Embracing shared AI platforms amongst public services can heighten the broader contribution of IR to New Zealand. Through rapid processing of cross-departmental data, AI can enable generation of holistic insights and innovative solutions. Moreover, the automation capabilities of AI can foster partnerships with other agencies to improve the efficiency and quality of public services.

This involves emphasising strategic alignment and innovation while observing a cautious approach towards risks. AI technology has a critical role in propelling the development of enterprise and refining various strategies rather than functioning on its own, with notable impacts on managing brand reputation and enhancing customer communication quality. Interviewees: Mary, James, Mike. •Suc c essful AI integration c ould enhance efficiency, effec tiveness, s tewardship princ iple alignment, and broader public s ervice delivery in A otearoa N ew Zealand, as well as c onfer a 1 .7 times greater likelihood of ac hieving exceptional outc omes for organis ations with enterprise-wide AI s trategies \[1 \]. •Suc c essful AI integration is c omplex and diffic ult, with only 2 8 % of organis ations ac hieving high outc omes from A I deployments in 2 0 21 \[1 \]. L arge-scale public s ervice organisations like I R may enc ounter extra barriers when adopting AI at s c ale. •As nearly 50% of organisations have reportedly experienced poor AI outcomes, it's evident that introducing AI into our systems poses a risk to upholding the principle of stewardship. Indeed, any related regulatory failures could jeopardise the integrity of the tax system. To avoid undermining public confidence and operational stability, careful planning of AI initiatives is key to ensure they enhance, rather than detract from, our efficiency and capability \[1\]. •With a potential for AI initiatives to become costly diversions, there's a clear risk of straining our resources without delivering the promised benefits. Thorough planning, strategic allocation of resources, and prudent execution can help manage this risk and ensure meaningful return on investment. •To navigate societal implications, it's pivotal for us to anticipate possible disruptions, continually assess societal responses, and create an inclusive communication strategy to engender trust and promote understanding among stakeholders. Our Customers •Value Drivers: We aim to leverage AI to enhance efficiency, decision-making, and service delivery, refocusing our resources on higher-value innovations for improved customer outcomes. •Te Ao Māori: We seek to ensure that data sovereignty principles underpin all AI initiatives, recognising Tangata whenua as kaitiaki (guardians) of their own data and fostering oranga (health and well-being) through equitable tax processes. •Inclusivity & Diversity: Ensuring our AI strategy at Inland Revenue prioritises accessibility and inclusiveness for all our customers and workforce is key in delivering a diverse, equitable, and representative service that aligns with the principle of manaakitanga in Te Pou o Te Tangata.

Advancements in efficiency and corresponding value for given business opportunities are essential, while also acknowledging the importance of having the necessary roles and skills aligned with value drivers. The strategic balancing of protection and opportunities, emphasis on enhancing decision support for staff, and partnering with intermediaries all form key aspects of the AI strategic considerations. Interviewees: Mary, Cate, Mike, Malcolm, Tina, James, Dan. •AI can automate routine processes, notably in back-office operations, enabling staff to focus on complex issues, thereby increasing efficiency and enhancing decision-making capabilities \[1\]. Notably, AI can provide decision support through real-time prediction and simulation \[2\]. •The integration of AI necessitates significant organisational changes, including reimagining work practices and developing new talent strategies. This presents both an opportunity to drive transformation and a challenge in managing the change journey within the organisation \[3\]\[4\]. •Successfully scaling AI technologies within the organization can bring about transformative benefits, impacting not just internal operations but also improving citizen services. This requires a strategic focus on use cases that yield high return on investment and foster internal cultural changes \[5\]. Shifting focus from improving isolated processes to a systemic approach that aims to create better outcomes as a whole is part of this. •Establishing the necessary data and technical infrastructure is critical for deploying AI. Any inadequacies in this area pose significant risks to the success and effectiveness of AI initiatives \[1\] •The need for upskilling or hiring key staff, along with refining approaches toward AI governance, presents risks related to talent acquisition and management. Ensuring that staff are adequately prepared and have developed the fluency to work with AI is vital for mitigating these risks, as well as putting robust governance processes in place \[1\]\[6\]. •Reliance on rapidly evolving technologies like big data analytics, RPA, AI, and machine learning introduces risks associated with keeping pace with technological advancements and ensuring that these are effectively integrated into tax processes \[6\]. 1.DI\_AI-readiness-for-government.pdf (deloitte.com) 2.How AI Can Help Leaders Make Better Decisions Under Pressure (hbr.org) 3.DI\_CIR\_State-of-AI-4th-edition.pdf (deloitte.com) 4.us-ai-institute-state-of-ai-fifth-edition.pdf (deloitte.com) 5.The Impact of Generative AI in Finance | Deloitte US 6.working-and-thriving-in-a-digital-tax-world (deloitte.com) 7.Digital Revenue Agency of the Future | Deloitte Luxembourg | Public Sector 8.DUP\_AI-augmented-government.pdf (deloitte.com) Te Ao Māori S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Adopting a Māori lens when considering how we use AI to better serve Aotearoa.

We c ould explore opportunities to inc orporate mātauranga Māori in AI systems through sustained community engagement. •Many AI applications require data to be stored in overseas data centers, which may conflict with principles of indigenous data sovereignty whereby Māori have the intrinsic right to control over their own data. Similarly, many Māori communities have expressed concern over the use of their language data to train Large Language Models for generative tasks without their consent, when they should be active decision-makers in the process \[1\]. •Potential for AI initiatives to perpetuate further harm, if insufficient consideration is given to te ao Māori. Particularly, care is needed to ensure that further bias is not encoded in AI models through the use of imbalanced datasets, and that generative AI tools do not misrepresent reo and tikanga in its outputs. Preventative steps should be communicated to the public.

This will avoid any adoption pains and optimise the efficiency gains of implementing AI within IR. •If organisational culture is neglected as we pivot towards higher use of AI, staff may become disillusioned with the power of AI to enhance their day-to-day work, or we may not see sufficient adoption in the first place. This risk of employee dissatisfaction can be mitigated by a well-thought-out change management plan. •The adoption of AI may cause concern for our staff and associated unions, as role descriptions have the potential to change. Entry level roles are poised to change the most, with internal training pathways also shifting in focus. We will need to carefully consider this risk as the organisation continues on its journey with AI. Te Tiriti S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Ensuring we support the Crown to deliver on our commitments to Māori under te Tiriti o Waitangi. In the context of AI, this aligns with commitments made as a signatory to the Algorithm Charter. We aim to move c los er to our as pirations of improving oranga by bec oming te T iriti- bas ed, es tablishing this c ons ideration as a c ruc ial foundation for our approac h to A I . •The key principles of te tiriti are highly relevant when implementing AI initiatives. The protection of Māori interests and prevention of future harm should be front of mind, alongside the incorporation of mātauranga Māori in all initiatives. This is supported by strong partnership with Māori, and a willingness to prioritise participation and engagement with tangata whenua. Many Māori researchers are already involved in determining how AI can be made mana- enhancing and beneficial for Māori, and several academic workshops have been held across the country \[1\]. These efforts have been supported by Te Hiku Media, among others. These organisations are partnering to implement AI-enabled linguistic resources for te reo Māori, in collaboration with local iwi \[2\]. This ongoing initiative has received government funding \[3\] and provides a practical example of how effective partnership, underpinned by te Tiriti, can provide beneficial outcomes for Māori. •When planning an AI initiative, the three voices framework can help with the synthesis of information from different knowledge sources across complex systems. Specifically, the voice of intent (legislation), voice of expertise (research) and voice of experience (community perspective) all come together to form a holistic view of how collective benefit can be derived for all involved \[4\].

There is an opportunity to engage with iwi Māori to raise awareness on the potential benefits of using AI for tax purposes, as well as to foster collaborative co-design, agreeing on system parameters of relevant AI tools and creating space in which mātauranga Māori can be shared. •Potential for tangata whenua to have a low appetite to engage with customer-facing AI solutions, due to a perception that AI will impact their right to control how services are delivered to them and how their information is utilised. This highlights the importance of transparency of AI tools and accountability, ensuring the AI tools are seen as trustworthy by both the organisation and the community. •There is a risk that, if partnership with Māori is seen as a one-time engagement process, the full benefit of our AI initiatives may not be derived for Māori communities. Instead, collaboration with tangata whenua should be seen as a foundational element of our AI framework that will enable its broader success. As AI tools continue to evolve, the connections to Te Tiriti will also change and need to be considered on an ongoing basis. Specifically, fairness and transparency should be prioritised to foster equitable outcomes and align with the associated equity principle of te Tiriti. Training & Fluency S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Cement AI fluency within our organisation to prepare for the future of work. We are committed to ensuring that the organisation has access to the right capabilities and personnel as work in the tax sector evolves.

This involves effective risk management against malicious actors and bias, maintaining the integrity of the tax system, and ensuring rigorous testing and explainability of AI models. The credibility and trustworthiness of the AI system is crucial, hence, security, anonymity regarding Personal Identifiable Information (PII), and an absence of bias in practice are paramount. Also, engaging experts and improving knowledge, especially among decision-makers, on ethics and data governance is essential to avoid potential public relations issues related to AI use. Interviewees: James, Cate, Anil, Tina, Lisa. •We have the opportunity to introduce guardrails embedding Trustworthy AI principles early in AI journey, ensuring AI systems are responsible, reliable, fair and transparent. •Responsible: Create and operate the technology in a socially responsible manner, with clear accountability of who is responsible for decisions made using AI systems. •Robust & Reliable: Confirm that AI functions properly beyond pilot stage, producing consistently accurate, relevant outputs. •Fair: Guard against illegal and unethical discrimination, ensuring equitable treatment of all. •Transparent: Help users (IR employees / the public) understand how their data can be used and how AI systems make decisions. Most organisations are still grappling with the risks associated with traditional AI, and Generative AI brings renewed attention to these. We should seek a balanced view of value creation opportunities with risks involved. Examples include: ▪Generation of misleading or false content, potentially causing confusion or harm to users who blindly rely on the generated output – e.g. our employees using Generative AI knowledge tools without proper training. ▪Users may not be aware that specific IR content was machine-generated. We must communicate how the system works and build transparency and trust. ▪Bias in the underlying data is a risk that can be amplified when AI models are trained on them – e.g. public-facing AI assistant less able to answer questions from certain socio-economic groups due to lack of past examples, perpetuating barriers to use. Secure & Confidential S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T To maintain trust and confidence, it is paramount in today's data-driven landscape to ensure the security and confidentiality of AI. It is important to implement robust measures to safeguard sensitive information and protect against risks, including data breaches, that may cause physical and/or digital harm. Privacy must also be respected, and consumer and employee data should not be used beyond its intended and stated use. This is also consistent with our Effective and Efficient role – as set out in the Enterprise Strategy, we have a responsibility to use our knowledge, resources and capabilities wisely. •There is increased guidance from the Privacy C ommissioner on Artificial Intelligence and the Information Privacy Principles \[1\]. These may provide a useful starting place in understanding our security and confidentiality needs. •Additionally, global frameworks may be leveraged. Most notably, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework which has been adopted by other agencies in the New Zealand public sector \[2\].The recently published ISO42001:2023 AIMS can be leveraged alongside NIST to develop a robust AI risk and controls library in the near term, and work towards compliance in the longer term \[3\]. •To ensure effective and efficient leadership, an IR specific approach should be taken to ensure confidentiality and integrity is maintained. This could be achieved through tools such as the AI Impact Assessment (tailored to our needs), and MLOps (tailored to the development systems in play at IR).

It is vital to accommodate the evolving advances yet ensuring sensitive data is securely held for the credibility of both the tax system and the organisation. Interviewees: James, Anil, Tina, Lisa. •We have the opportunity to introduce guardrails embedding Trustworthy AI principles early in our AI journey, ensuring AI systems are secure and confidential. •Preserving Privacy: Train AI models on representative data without compromising sensitive sources of training data. •Safe & Secure: Ensure that the technology, and the data that feeds into it, is protected from risks that may cause individual and/or collective physical, emotional environmental, and/or digital harm. Most organisations are still grappling with the risks associated with traditional AI, and Generative AI brings renewed attention to these. We should seek a balanced view of value creation opportunities with risks involved. Examples include: •The risk of individual and / or collective physical, emotional and/or digital harm – e.g. prompt injection attack leading to data leakage and/or inaccurate tax advice (due to prompt/data poisoning). •Where employing cloud architecture to host or run AI systems, this is subject to the same security risks as all cloud technology. Most notably, the risk of data breach, which results in a loss of customer trust, reputational impact, as well as regulatory fines & penalties. •The risk of re-identification of data subjects in an anonymised dataset, using AI technology, by external players or employees (insider threat). •AI technology is data hungry, and it can be tempting to use data for purposes beyond its initial intended use – resulting in data being used in ways notunderstood by customers and employees, or not permitted by agreements with them. 1.AI-and-the-Information-Privacy-Principles.pdf 2.AI Risk Management Framework | NIST 3.ISO 42001:2023 AIMS Standard International Best Practice S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Using global context to inform our navigation of AI-related risks as New Zealand’s tax authority.

The EU currently relies on existing legislation (GDPR, Digital Services and Digital Markets Act) to govern algorithms, but the AI Act with its associated standards of quality and safety is expected to be passed into law over the next few months . The US, on the other hand, does not currently have any legislation on AI usage at the federal level, and instead has guidelines outlined in the AI Bill of Rights and President Biden’s recent Executive Order on the topic \[2\]. These different approaches create a complex environment to navigate when seeking to identify best practices internationally. Data & Digital Whatisthe capabilitiyframework for AI Strategy? Digital Ecosystem Data & Information Foundations Architecture •Architecture:It is imperative that we continue to ensure a robustandadaptable technology infrastructure that can not only handle increasedAIworkloads, but also be flexible enough to leverage multi- cloudtechnologiesand manage potential risks associated with outdated systems, to support IR's journey towards being an AI-empoweredorganisation. •Data/Information Foundations: We recognise that establishing robust data foundations directly underpins our ability to effectively deploy AI, enhancing decision-making, processes and cybersecurity, within the wider context of our Data & Digital segment. These include considerations for not just transactional data but information and knowledge as well. •Digital Ecosystem:To successfully implement our AI strategy, weneedrecognise the importance of establishing a diverse and well- manageddigitalecosystem, harnessing relationships within it for actionable insights,whilemitigating risks of overdependence on specific vendors.

Furthermore, realis ing a metadata- informed analytics techniques nec essitates c areful preparation of exis ting and future data through rigorous c leansing proc esses. •Before implementing AI systems, we must comprehensively assess our current technology architecture. This not only includes technical compatibility but also whether the existing setup can handle expected AI workloads, especially when transitioning from a pilot phase to a production solution. These preparatory measures are crucial to avoid overburdening the system and ensure seamless integration of AI applications. •Prior to deploying AI solutions, we must test and adapt our technology architecture. This ensures it can handle the demands of such advanced technologies. Testing and modifying the architecture prior to rolling out solutions are crucial steps to guarantee a successful implementation of AI across IR \[2\]. •Successful AI integration heavily depends on high bandwidth, low- latency, and flexible technical architecture such as multi cloud. Beyond merely scaling up a proof of concept, this includes implementing robust systems capable of handling increased AI workloads and assuring data quality \[3\]. •Tax systems are forever evolving due to changing policy mandates. It is key that we adopt a modular and flexible approach to system architecture, allowing for rapid adaptations and improvements as and when necessary. This can help future-proof our AI capabilities and ensure they can harness emerging technologies as they evolve.

Furthermore, the preference from some team members is towards AI solutions as a service, with an expectation for vendors to add significant value. Interviewees: James, Mary, Cate, Mike, Malcolm. •The use of outdated or poorly documented systems within the technical architecture of IR can be a hindrance, as these constraints could limit our ability to manage risks and adapt to the required capabilities for successful AI implementation.\[1\] •The effective deployment of AI may require a heavy redesign or improvement of technical architecture, this could be an opportunity to consider high bandwidth, low-latency, and flexible architectures to allow for efficient AI application deployment.\[3\] •The implementation of AI at scale requires a different array of organisational capabilities compared to smaller scale projects or proofs of concept. It would therefore be challenging to translate the success of small pilots to a larger scale without also evolving the supporting architecture. •If current architecture is significantly based on outdated machine languages, it may pose challenges as these systems could potentially be incompatible with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. If not addressed, these technical impediments could potentially lead to financial burdens and create unfavourable outcomes for citizen services in the long-term. •Scaling from pilot projects to production level AI applications is a major shift that would require us to have infrastructure capable of handling the increased workload. If existing capacities cannot meet the required infrastructure demands, both in terms of processing power and bandwidth, we may face significant performance issues. •Dependence on a single vendor for AI technologies can lead to limitations in flexibility and adaptability. This could inhibit the ability to incorporate new advancements in technology or switch to better solutions, thereby posing a risk to the long-term success of our AI initiatives. Data (& Information)Foundations S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T High performance AI requires high quality, accurate and accessible data, information and knowledge. Data and information foundations are a critical strategic consideration as they support the accessibility, quality and security of the vast amounts of data necessary for AI solutions to function optimally. This directly ties into the larger Data & Digital pillar, as effective data foundations work in harmony with our architecture and digital ecosystem, underpinning our ability to harness AI’s potential to enhance key processes, enable insightful decision-making and guard against cyber threats. •We must approach data/information as both our most significant advantage and challenge \[1\]. It's vital to deploy resources to convert these vast data inflows into actionable insights. We must understand how to unlock the potential of new types of data while ensuring citizens' privacy and serving the public good. •A concrete data/information strategy and governance model are imperative \[2\]. It involves outlining clear roles and accountabilities for business and system owners and stewards. This model also provides guidelines for dealing with security, privacy and compliance issues, ensuring the data’s integrity, consistency and reliability. •Data/Information is a crucial ingredient for successful AI implementation \[3\]. Agencies need to distinguish and gain access to the crucial datasets for their operations. It is particularly important to develop platforms to access the identified data effectively. These platforms can improve the readiness and success rates of deploying AI in tax duties \[3\].

The extensive renewal of systems ensures processes efficiently convert raw data into a format suitable for analytics. However, the need for strengthened data governance and quality management processes is crucial, with an emphasis on maintaining accuracy and relevance. Furthermore, channel content data consistency is highlighted to support corresponding use cases. Interviewees: Mary, Cate, Mike, Tina, James, Dan. •With the right data and information strategy, there exists a significant opportunity to unlock the hidden power of data. By identifying relevant datasets and creating platforms for data accessibility, the quality and effectiveness of AI can be vastly improved \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]. •Revenue agencies have a unique opportunity to treat data and information as an asset. By investing in data quality and governance, agencies can ensure AI enhanced taxation and compliance processes, thereby facilitating better decision making and more accurate tax collection \[1\]\[2\]. •The sheer volume and variety of data/information can pose a serious challenge to revenue agencies. Overcoming this challenge requires an investment in processes that validate and enhance data quality. Inaccurate or poor-quality data can undermine AI effectiveness and lead to incorrect tax outcomes. \[1\] •There's an inherent risk of being overloaded by the vast volume of data generated by digital transactions. By not being equipped to handle these data flows, the effectiveness of AI outcomes could be compromised \[1\] •Inadequate data/info governance and unclear roles or accountability could lead to security vulnerabilities or compliance issues. Mismanagement of data can lead to unauthorised access or data misuse, posing significant risks to the operation and reputation of the agency \[2\] •Failing to identify relevant datasets or provide platforms for their access poses a risk for AI implementation at IR. Inadequate access to vital data could limit the potential of AI initiatives or lead to subpar results. Moreover, if data is used to answer basic questions rather than develop deep insights, there is a risk of under-utilising the sources present \[3\] Digital Ecosystem S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T We will need to utilise wider digital partners and technologies to ensure successful implementation of AI. For a robust approach to AI implementation, considering the digital ecosystem is essential as it not only provides the necessary breadth and diversity but also safeguards the organisation against overdependence and limits on innovation. Under the Data & Digital pillar, this aspect recognises the significance of having a healthy mix of partners, technologies, and data sources for continuous growth and competitiveness in the evolving AI landscape. •A well-orchestrated data ecosystem can offer the opportunity to unlock the next level of actionable insights. Interoperability, enabled by a well-thought-out ecosystem, can provide richer insights and more effective service to citizens. Our approach to AI should therefore focus on harnessing the potential of the relationships within this ecosystem to leverage data for faster, better decision- making \[1\]. •Trust forms a key ingredient for a sustainable digital ecosystem, especially when it revolves around data. All participants need to assure that data is protected as if it were their own. Our culture could also play a vital role in its willingness to adopt new technologies and adapt to changes in its operating system \[1\]. •To harness the full potential of AI, it's paramount to establish a diverse digital ecosystem. This ecosystem could range from existing technical solutions to partners across various sectors, including academia, industry, and governmental bodies. Such diversity provides technological agility to access a broad spectrum of AI-based solutions and helps avoid the risks associated with vendor lock or overdependence on a single entity. This, in turn, can expedite progress towards AI implementation at scale and enhance organisational readiness to adapt to any changes in the operating ecosystem \[2\]\[3\]. •The implementation of Tax Admin 3.0, through integration with taxpayers' natural systems using AI, promises a revolutionary shift towards real-time taxation. This approach enhances compliance, reduces administrative burdens, and addresses current structural limitations in tax governance, ultimately creating a more efficient, inclusive, and streamlined tax administration.

A key consensus is the necessity for clean, useful data as a primary foundation before layering any AI applications on top. Both the use of external partners for technology development and managing applications handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) internally were emphasised. The potential role of third parties is acknowledged, with the understanding that these partners could help consolidate data from different sources as well as assist in employing AI technology. Interviewees: Dan, James, Anil, Tina, Lisa. •Leveraging data ecosystems can offer the opportunity to unlock the next level of actionable insights, serving citizens more effectively and enabling richer decision making. This calls for an emphasis on not only developing internal capabilities, but also on building robust technology, ecosystems that capitalise on diverse external entities with distinct strengths \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]. •Balancing the risk and reward of data sharing is a common challenge in the public sector and requires considerable trust amongstall participants to ensure sustained data sharing. The continuous advancement and adoption of new technologies, standards and ethics for data use can help ease these challenges and accelerate sharing, but maintaining trust will be a persisting consideration \[1\]. •When interacting with the broader digital ecosystem during procurement, we should aim to clearly articulate business needs to vendors and establish suitable frameworks so that desired outcomes can be met while ensuring integrity and control. •By embedding compliance into business transactions with Tax Admin 3.0 and integrating tax processes with Natural Systems, efficiency is amplified, and tax gaps are minimised. These improvements encourage timely tax fulfilment, directly curbing uncollected debts and revolutionising the taxation framework. •Trust is key to the health of the digital ecosystem, however it can also be a risk if not properly managed. Trust can be established through good governance models and clear rule agreement among all ecosystem members \[1\]. •Relying heavily on a few vendors or partners can lead to overdependence or ‘vendor lock’, stifling innovation and causing difficulties in transition to new vendors in the future, which could trigger substantial disruption. A diverse ecosystem and integrating with a variety of vendors, including those emerging or niche, could mitigate this risk \[3\]. •The management of the relationships within the digital ecosystem is an essential element, posing a risk if not executed effectively. Deciding how to leverage each relationship is just as important as deciding who and how many to have within the ecosystem. Properly managed, these relationships can enhance operation \[3\].

We are dedicated to creating a wellbeing legacy for those to come, as well as demonstrating integrity of process as well as outcome (mahi tika). To achieve this, it will be essential to align with applicable AI standards and ensure the use of AI does not jeopardise compliance with various legislation and legal frameworks including tax, intellectual property, copyright law, and content/ data ownership across various jurisdictions. The AI Working Group has already drafted internal guidelines along these lines. •Regulatory c ompliance s hould be future-focussed - not only appreciating today’s legislation but also proactively antic ipating policies to follow. We s hould monitor for c hanges in regulatory policy that c ould impact our A I initiatives, and particularly for the introduc tion of any A I- related legislation.

Due to our broad ranging public role, any AI use cases have the potential to s ignificantly impact wellbeing, whether intentionally or not. Applying the charter’s recommendations around Trustworthy AI and Te T iriti will enable us to mitigate any ris ks as they arise. •A s per the T ax A dministration Act 1 994, our offic ers are res ponsible for the integrity of the tax s ys tem \[2 \]. A I fraud detec tion c apabilities, with options for real-time analysis, provide us with the opportunity to proactively monitor taxpayer c ompliance and thus better maintain the integrity of the s ys tem. •Extra care is required when using third-party services that integrate AI. These might be subject to international regulations surrounding AI and privacy, particularly if their service uses international data sharing. As such, procurement processes should be strengthened to ensure provider use of AI is compliant with all applicable standards \[3\]. We should seek transparency and control over how providers are implementing AI, to ensure that any exposure of personal information or associated harm is prevented. •Any deviation from applicable standards for AI use could result in severe reputational damage for our organisation due to its wide-ranging role as steward of New Zealand’s tax system. Strong transparency and human oversight are especially critical for us, as inaccurate AI output could jeopardise public trust. Political & Public Sector Landscape S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T Ensuring our approach to AI will align with expectations placed on ourorganisation by the government and taxpayer base alike. As a public sector organisation, we are accountable to both the current government and the people of Aotearoa New Zealand, hence our strategic foundation to build and maintain strong and trustful relationships (Whanaungatanga). C onsidering how this context ties in with our AI aspirations will be essential to ensuring theircontinued success. AI can also support efficiency by automating routine tasks, streamlining processes, and enhancing data- driven decision-making. •The fact that an AI solution is legally and financially feasible doesn’t necessary translate into moral and ethical acceptance from the target population, even if they stand to personally benefit. To provide a tax case study, the Australian government faced backlash after implementing Robodebt, an automated system that used income averaging to identify those in welfare debt and demand recovery of funds. The tool was highly inaccurate and lacked transparency, and many individuals experienced negative impacts to their finances and mental health because of the scheme. It incurred nearly $2B in lawsuit fees, with taxpayers footing the bill \[1\]. Although Robodebt didn’t directly use AI methods, it was perceived to have done so and thus caused public trust to be undermined \[2\]. Similarly, a Michigan government agency lacked the social license to implement MiDAS, an AI tool used to detect unemployment fraud and automatically require repayment from offenders. A retrospective study identified that 93% of the charges were incorrect, leading to the agency facing class-action lawsuits and losing its customers’ trust \[3\]. In both cases, stronger ethical design principles and public engagement could have ensured these organisations had the social license to operate the AI tool responsibly and derive associated efficiency gains. Ideally, the level of public acceptance will be re- assessed periodically throughout the lifecycle of the AI solution in question. •As we move through the current period of uncertainty, we may find it helpful to prioritise agile decision-making, informed by diverse voices \[4\]. Implementing AI in a trustworthy manner that balances the opportunities with the risks will be a crucial part of weathering this change.

The key is to transition gradually while ensuring informed customer consent and a build-up of public trust, thus earning a 'social license'. However, despite an internal push towards being 'more brave', navigating between the increasing expectations of efficient data usage and the absolute adherence to security and risk profiles is a challenging task. Interviewees: Mary, Cate, Anil, Phil, Lisa. •We have the opportunity to run targeted public engagement to gauge appetite for the incorporation of AI in tax processes. In doing so, we will aim to establish a social license, or ongoing public acceptance, for the initiatives we have planned. This process will differentiate initiatives that could be delivered from those that should be delivered based on public appetite and opinions. •Due to political shifts, and particularly the current period of government transition, the authorising environment in which we carry out our work may change. Therefore, flexibility of AI initiatives in adapting to changing government priorities will be a key factor in their ability to come to fruition in the current climate. We may need to be prepared to pause certain initiatives pending more certainty around thegovernment's demands of the public sector. Authorising Environment S T R A T E G I C C O N T E X T The s et of regulations , guidelines , and approval mechanis ms within our organis ation and the wider government that dictate the parameters for our AI s trategy implementation and development. I nternally, this involves the applic ation of existing frameworks , proc edures, and princ iples to A I operations, ens uring that A I is us ed res ponsibly and ethically, c omplying with the organis ation's data, information and knowledge governanc e framework. T he authoris ing environment externally refers toour unique legis lative pos ition under the T ax A dministration A c t, whic h authorises us to utilis e technology to make dec isions on the c ommis sioner's behalf, differentiating us from the wider regulatory landscape and political/public s ector c ontext. •A robus t authorising environment is fundamental to res ponsibly implementing AI in our operations. I t operates at multiple levels – we mus t ens ure our internal authorising environment aligns strategically with legislative permissions and s ec urity considerations, while als o attempting to influenc e a c learer, unified authorising environment within the wider public s ector. •D eveloping a c omprehensive understanding of A I and its ris ks is now a s trategic imperative. C urrently, lower perc eived ris ks as sociated with A I c ould be due to inadequate understanding. T o s uccessfully implement AI in our s trategic operations, we need to s trengthen our knowledge to c omprehend its implications, ris k fac tors, and rec ognise the potential for inc orrect results. •T he legis lative func tion of the T ax A dministration Act, allowing us to us e A I for dec ision-making, puts us in a unique advantageous pos ition in defining and navigating the authoris ing environment c ompared to other organis ations. H owever, this also implies an elevated role in s etting robust guidelines and frameworks aligning to ethic al and res ponsible AI utilisation. •Stewards hip is integral to our operation in the authoris ing environment. We mus t ens ure future hallmarks of good s tewards hip, inc luding s ignificant legislation, is fit for purpos e.

Interviewee: Cathy •T he authorisation by the T ax A dministration A ct for us to us e mac hines for dec ision-making provides a s olid legislative footing to pioneer A I applications in the public s ector.

While government has the authority to s et the environment, c urrently this has not been c onsolidated and c lear directives. D ifferent s ectors have varying frameworks, c asting doubts on the s olidity of the authoris ing environment and c ausing a range of approac hes. T his fragmentation and lac k of defined parameters inc reases the ris k of dis jointed AI methodologies. •O ur c urrent legislative framework s anctions technology to make c ommissioner dec isions. While beneficial, further as sessment is required for its s uitability towards A I progression. T he absence of c omprehensive A I understanding and c ontrol proc esses could hinder dec ision ac curacy and ac countability. We need to evaluate our existing privacy, ethics and data governance frameworks against evolving AI scenarios. A ny misalignment risks erroneous res ults and potential key ris ks going forward. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Thank you
24OIA2324 Page 1 of 8 5 July 2024 Dear Thank you for your request made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 11 June 2024. You requested the following: Can we please request the following information in relation to Goods and Services Tax (GST): Separated into the GST periods ending in the years 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022; 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 and 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024; 1 April 2024 to 30 June 2024: 1. Broken down by Industry (using BIC code or other industry identifier used by Inland Revenue): a. The total Sales and Income (GST taxable supplies) – Box 5; b. The total Purchases and Expenses (GST purchases) – Box 11; c. The total net GST payable or refundable per GST return period – Box 15 (showing GST payable as a positive number and GST refundable as a negative number, or other indicator you choose to differentiate between GST payable and refundable). Industry classification Classification of taxpayer into industries has been done using the Australian New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) data held by Inland Revenue. Please note, this data does not have full coverage and may not reflect the current industry for taxpayers that have not updated their information with Inland Revenue. Taxpayers for whom Inland Revenue does not hold an ANZSIC code have been included in the “unknown” industry category. Information being released I have provided, enclosed as Tables 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, a breakdown of total sales and income, total purchases and expenses and total net (Inland Revenue) GST payable broken down by industry for the years ended 31 March 2022, 2023, and 2024 as at 3 July 2024, and rounded to the nearest $10 million. Table 3 has been further broken down by splitting apart taxpayers with net GST to pay for their full year from those with a net refund. The released information does not include gross GST collected by the New Zealand Customs Service. Collections from Customs often result in refunds of input credits in the Inland Revenue data. Exports are also included in box 5 but are zero rated for GST, resulting in refunds of any input credits. 24OIA2324 Page 2 of 8 Returns for the June 2024 return period are not yet available; the year to 31 March 2024 has been provided and is comparable to the other requested years. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz ) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, may be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials. Thank you for your request.

24OIA2307 & 24OIA2309 Page 1 of 5 5 July 2024 Dear Thank you for your requests made under the Official Information Act 1982 (OIA), received on 6 June 2024. You requested the following: We would like to know how much P3 income tax was paid by March balance date taxpayers on 7 May 2024, compared to the same time in 2023 and 2022. In the past when we have requested similar information, you have captured tax payments for a period (I think up to 2 weeks) either side of the provisional tax date, recognising that taxpayers make payments before and shortly after the due date. We also recognise that 7 May is P1 for November balance dates, and P2 for July balance dates. If it is possible to exclude those tax payments from the data across the three years, please do so. And: ...published on the Inland Revenue website is the response to 24OIA1094 (attached). Although the information is presented in a different format, the letter and the table at Appendix A both refer to the population group being taxpayers with RIT in excess of $5,000 for the 2022 tax year. However in this case, the number of taxpayers is shown as 400,177. Can you please advise why there is a large difference in the taxpayer count on request 24OIA1094, and 24OIA1707. The below table shows the number of customers, number of transactions, and total value of payments made between the dates of 23 April 2024 to 19 May 2024 for the tax years 2022, 2023, and 2024 for customers who had residual income tax of $5,000 or more for the previous tax year and a standard balance date of 31 March. Tax year # of customers # of transactions Total amount ($) 2022 223,959 238,182 -$3,619,312,236 2023 258,473 288,511 -$3,926,876,390 2024 270,287 329,185 -$2,891,262,754 Grand Total 752,719 855,878 -$10,437,451,382 24OIA2307 & 24OIA2309 Page 2 of 5 I have reviewed the data in the responses for 24OIA1094 and 24OIA1707 and determined that there was an error that caused approximately 84,000 provisional taxpayers to be excluded from the data in 24OIA1094 if they were not a provisional taxpayer in the preceding year. The enclosed tables below, labelled Appendix A, restate the figures from 24OIA1707 with this error corrected. This data was extracted from Inland Revenue systems on 30 June 2024. Restated figures relating to the tax pooling and terminal tax due dates tables will be made available on Inland Revenue’s website at Tax statistics (ird.govt.nz) l ater this calendar year. Publishing of OIA response We intend to publish our response to your request on Inland Revenue’s website (www.ird.govt.nz) as this information may be of interest to other members of the public. This letter, with your personal details removed, will be published in its entirety. Publishing responses increases the availability of information to the public and is consistent with the OIA's purpose of enabling more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies and promoting the accountability of officials.

### Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting: Approval for Signature and Ratification

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Portfolio | **Revenue** |
| Purpose | This paper seeks approval of the text and agreement to sign the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (the MLI). |
| Previous Consideration | In February 2017, EGI noted that there is significant global media and political concern about base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), and agreed to the release of an officials’ issues paper on _New Zealand’s Implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Prevent BEPS_ \[EGI-17-MIN-0005\]. |
| Summary | Double tax agreements (DTAs) are bilateral international treaties which are designed to reduce tax impediments to cross-border services, trade, and investment without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax avoidance or evasion.

### SIGNATURE AND RATIFICATION OF THE MULTILATERAL CONVENTION TO IMPLEMENT TAX TREATY RELATED MEASURES TO PREVENT BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING

### Proposal

1\. This paper proposes that Cabinet authorises New Zealand’s signature of, and the steps necessary to ratify and bring into force, the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (“the Multilateral Instrument” or “MLI”). The full text of the MLI is attached as Annex A and a full list of New Zealand’s proposed notifications and reservations to be submitted at the time of signature and confirmed upon ratification is attached as Annex B. A table showing the MLI’s coverage of New Zealand’s double tax agreement (“DTA”) network is attached as Annex C.

### Executive summary

2\. DTAs are bilateral international treaties designed to reduce tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax avoidance or evasion. DTAs also enable tax administrations to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and avoidance. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the negotiation of and giving of effect to DTAs with other countries. New Zealand currently has 40 DTAs in force, primarily with major trading and investment partners.

3\. The MLI is a multilateral international treaty that proposes to quickly and efficiently amend a significant number of DTAs around the world to take into account new treaty standards relating to treaty abuse and dispute resolution that have arisen out of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G20’s 15-point Action Plan on base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”). It allows New Zealand to update the majority of its 40 DTAs without entering into bilateral negotiations with each of its treaty partners.

4\. In May 2016, Cabinet considered the MLI as part of the New Zealand Government’s response to BEPS (CAB-16-MIN-0218 refers). In February 2017, Cabinet approved the release of an officials’ issues paper seeking submissions on New Zealand’s implementation of the MLI (EGI-17-MIN-0005, CAB-17-MIN-0041 refers).

5\. This paper seeks Cabinet approval for New Zealand to sign the MLI at a signing ceremony arranged by the OECD to be held in Paris on 7 June 2017. As the MLI is subject to ratification it must be presented to the House of Representatives for Parliamentary treaty examination in accordance with Standing Order 397, this paper also proposes that Cabinet approves the text of an extended National Interest Analysis (“NIA”) for submission to Parliament. The extended NIA is attached as Annex D. This paper also proposes that Cabinet authorises the steps necessary to give effect to the provisions of the MLI under New Zealand law and, after those steps have been successfully completed, authorise officials to ratify the MLI by depositing an instrument of ratification, along with New Zealand’s list of confirmed notifications and reservations, with the MLI Depositary (the OECD).

### Background

6\. DTAs are bilateral international treaties designed to reduce tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax avoidance or evasion. DTAs also enable tax administrations to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and avoidance. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for the negotiation of and giving of effect to DTAs with other countries. New Zealand currently has 40 DTAs in force, primarily with major trading and investment partners.

7\. While DTAs are beneficial for taxpayers, investors and governments themselves, there is the potential for these bilateral agreements to be misused to reduce or eliminate a multinational’s worldwide tax. Misuse of DTAs in this way has been a feature of a number of cross-border tax avoidance arrangements.

8\. The misuse of DTAs forms part of a wider problem referred to as BEPS, which has been the focus of significant global media and political attention since late 2012, following evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world.

9\. BEPS is a global problem as many BEPS strategies exploit technical differences between different countries’ tax rules, so New Zealand has been working with the OECD and G20 to develop a co-ordinated global solution to address BEPS through the 15-point OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan.

10\. A number of the items on the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan address the misuse of DTAs and can only be implemented through changes to DTAs themselves. These are:

*   preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (Action 6);
*   preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status (Action 7);
*   neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements that have a treaty aspect (Action 2); and
*   providing improved mechanisms for effective dispute resolution (Action 14).

11\. Some of these solutions are “minimum standards” that countries that commit to solving BEPS are expected to adopt. Other provisions are optional, but are DTA “best practice” and now form part of the OECD Model Tax Convention following adoption of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan.

12\. Countries, including New Zealand, were presented with the difficulty of how to quickly and efficiently implement these measures without requiring the bilateral renegotiation of several thousand existing DTAs, which could take several years (or even potentially decades). For this reason, the Multilateral Instrument was developed under Action 15 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan to swiftly amend the DTAs of all participating jurisdictions.

### The Multilateral Instrument

13\. The MLI is a multilateral international treaty that proposes to quickly and efficiently amend a significant number of DTAs around the world to take into account new treaty standards relating to treaty abuse and dispute resolution that have arisen out of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan, as outlined in paragraph 10. It allows New Zealand to update the majority of its 40 DTAs without entering into bilateral negotiations with each of its treaty partners.

14\. New Zealand’s treaty negotiation resources are limited and to update New Zealand’s entire DTA network would take several years, if not decades, particularly as many of New Zealand’s treaty partners would likely place greater importance on updating more significant treaties. This would limit New Zealand’s likelihood of being able to meet the OECD minimum standard in a timely fashion.

15\. The text of the MLI was developed by the OECD Ad Hoc Group consisting of officials from more than 100 participating jurisdictions, including New Zealand, and was formally adopted by the OECD in November 2016. Experts in both international tax and public international law participated in the OECD Ad Hoc Group that developed the MLI to ensure that it works as intended.

16\. The MLI is flexible and allows jurisdictions to choose:

*   which of their existing DTAs they wish to modify through the MLI;
*   alternative ways of meeting BEPS minimum standards on treaty abuse and dispute resolution; and
*   whether they want to adopt the OECD-recommended provisions for non-minimum standards.

17\. Within some of these provisions, there are alternative ways of addressing BEPS concerns and the ability for countries to enter a variety of reservations.

#### New Zealand’s proposed MLI positions

18\. To make the best use of the MLI, New Zealand’s proposed strategy is to include the majority of its DTAs within the scope of the MLI and to adopt as many of the MLI provisions as possible, where they are in line with New Zealand’s overall treaty policy. This will give New Zealand the best chance of strengthening its DTAs with as many jurisdictions as possible and will introduce consistency across New Zealand’s treaty network.

19\. Of New Zealand’s 40 in-force DTAs, New Zealand has nominated 34 to be covered by the MLI. Many of these DTAs were concluded in the 1970s and 1980s and do not reflect modern treaty standards, even before the work on BEPS was completed. The six DTAs that have not been listed are with jurisdictions who will not be signing the MLI. To be modified by the MLI, both New Zealand and the other jurisdiction must elect for the MLI to apply to the DTA (if there is a match, then the DTA is a “covered tax agreement”). Based on current draft notifications, New Zealand is expected to have 28 covered tax agreements. See Annex C. While this list is not final, it provides a fairly good indication of the likely coverage of the MLI. Final coverage will not be confirmed until each jurisdiction deposits its instrument of ratification with the OECD Depositary.

20\. As noted in paragraph 18, New Zealand’s proposed strategy is to adopt as many of the MLI provisions as possible. This is because they are base protection measures that are in line with New Zealand’s existing treaty policy (which has a greater source state emphasis than the OECD Model Tax Convention on which the New Zealand negotiating model is based). For example, New Zealand generally takes a broader approach in its DTAs than the current OECD Model Tax Convention in determining whether a permanent establishment exists. This means that the recommendations under Action 7 (preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status) of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan which are contained in Articles 12¬ to 15 of the MLI are not contrary to New Zealand’s general treaty policy and, in New Zealand’s view, represent an improvement to the OECD Model Tax Convention.

**\[Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982\]**

22\. In addition to the proposed changes to the concept of a permanent establishment, it is proposed that New Zealand signs up to the provisions that relate to the following common problems identified with the OECD Model Tax Convention:

*   Fiscally transparent entities (like trusts or partnerships) create arbitrage opportunities because they are treated differently for tax purposes by different countries. The provision in Article 3 clarifies that treaty benefits will only be allowed to the extent to which the item of income is taxed in the state in which the entity is resident.
*   Dual resident entities can be used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities by manipulating the current “place of effective management” test. The proposed provision in Article 4 will require competent authorities to agree the residence status of a dual resident entity. If there is no agreement, then treaty benefits will be denied, or only granted to the extent to which the competent authorities can agree.
*   In the OECD Model Tax Convention and in many of New Zealand’s modern treaties, a lower withholding tax rate is available where the shareholder owns more than a certain proportion of the company’s shares. The MLI provision in Article 8 requires shares to be held for a minimum of 365 days for the shareholder to be entitled to reduced withholding tax rates on dividends. This prevents shareholders buying shares and holding them temporarily in order to access lower withholding rates.
*   Investors can hold land through companies and dispose of the shares in the company to avoid paying tax on the disposal of that land. Many treaties contain a “land-rich company rule” which allows the source jurisdiction to tax income derived from land when the majority of a company’s assets consist of land. To prevent artificial and temporary dilution of the amount of land held by a company just before sale, the provision in Article 9 requires the threshold for the amount of land ownership which triggers the rule to be measured on every day in the 365 day period leading up to the sale of the shares and extends the rule to interests in other entities such as partnerships and trusts.
*   Permanent establishments can be established in third states to exploit low tax rates and branch exemptions. Article 10 of the MLI introduces a provision that denies treaty benefits in the case of income derived by a permanent establishment of one of the parties to the DTA, where that permanent establishment is situated in a low tax third state.
*   Article 11 introduces a provision that preserves a jurisdiction’s right to tax its own residents. For example, this provision would prevent a New Zealand resident who is engaged in a tax avoidance arrangement from claiming that a DTA prevents New Zealand from using its domestic general anti-avoidance rule to impose tax.

23\. In addition to addressing these specific BEPS concerns, Article 6 of the MLI proposes to amend the preamble to DTAs to confirm that they are not intended to be used to generate double non-taxation, and under Article 7, New Zealand has selected the option of adding a principal purpose test to its DTAs. The principal purpose test is a general anti-abuse rule that applies to the whole DTA. Both Articles 6 and 7 form part of the OECD minimum standard.

24\. In addition to these base protection measures, New Zealand is signing up to taxpayer friendly measures relating to the mutual agreement procedure (“MAP”) and the availability of arbitration as a form of dispute resolution. These measures are a result of the work on Action 14 of the G20/OECD BEPS Action Plan relating to the improvement of mechanisms for effective dispute resolution. The key provisions are as follows:

*   Article 16 of the MLI introduces a provision allowing taxpayers to request MAP where they believe taxation is not in accordance with the treaty. This is a new OECD minimum standard. While the majority of New Zealand’s DTAs contain MAP provisions, the MLI will amend these provisions to allow taxpayers to approach the competent authority of either jurisdiction (currently they only permit a case to be presented to the competent authority of the taxpayer’s country of residence).
*   Article 16 also creates a new minimum standard regarding time limits for bringing a case to MAP and time limits for implementing a solution.
*   Article 17 requires contracting states to make appropriate corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases. This provision is already found in most of New Zealand’s DTAs except for New Zealand’s oldest treaties.
*   New Zealand has also opted to apply Part VI of the MLI, which will introduce arbitration as a means of dispute resolution. If a solution cannot be reach under MAP, taxpayers have the ability to request that unresolved issues can be taken to arbitration. New Zealand has already agreed to arbitration in its treaties with Australia and Japan. New Zealand’s experience is that the arbitration facility is very rarely used, but it acts as an incentive for the competent authorities of two jurisdictions to come to an agreement within the required time period for MAP.

#### Implementation issues and consultation

25\. The main difficulty in implementing the provisions of MLI compared with amending protocols stems from the fact that the provisions in the MLI have been drafted more broadly than they otherwise would for an amending protocol to take account of the fact that the MLI must be able to apply to not one DTA, but several thousand.

26\. This means that there can be some ambiguity in how the MLI applies to a particular DTA. This ambiguity is mitigated in many cases as a MLI provision will only replace the corresponding existing provision if both treaty partners notify the same provision. However, compliance costs may still be incurred as taxpayers will need to consider the DTA and MLI alongside both jurisdictions’ notifications and reservations.

27\. While officials generally do not consult on the content of tax treaties, due to the unusual nature of the MLI, public feedback was sought on potential implementation issues related to the Multilateral Instrument. An officials’ issues paper titled _New Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS_ was released on 3 March 2017. Submissions closed on 7 April 2017 and 5 were received (from EY, KPMG, PwC, Corporate Taxpayers Group (“CTG”) and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (“CA ANZ”)). Two stakeholder workshops were held on 27 and 28 March 2017 with CTG and CA ANZ to enable officials to better understand practitioners’ concerns.

28\. Two of the submissions supported the adoption of the MLI as the most effective way to implement the treaty related BEPS recommendations. One submission acknowledged that the New Zealand Government has the constitutional ability to decide New Zealand’s tax treaty position and it therefore makes sense to achieve this in the shortest time at the least cost through the MLI. One submission acknowledged that participating in OECD and G20 initiatives to target BEPS is a key focus for the government, while not explicitly supporting the adoption. The final submission did not express an overall view on adoption, but submitted that New Zealand should not adopt all of the optional provisions.

29\. The main issues raised in submissions relate to:

a. **substantive positions taken by New Zealand**. Although consultation was intended to focus on implementation issues, submitters did comment on the substance of the new provisions in the MLI. Most submitters were generally supportive of New Zealand’s adoption of the MLI and a number supported the proposals to take up most of the MLI provisions as an efficient way to amend our treaty network, but some submitters raised concerns about specific provisions. One point of contention among submitters was the proposal to adopt Article 4 of the MLI, relating to dual-resident entities (refer paragraph 22 above). However, this new rule is being adopted by many countries as a means of curbing certain forms of treaty abuse. It is also consistent with the position New Zealand has taken in a number of bilateral treaties. Officials are exploring ways to reduce compliance costs associated with this provision. Another concern related to one aspect of the new permanent establishment provisions which might lead to more taxation of New Zealanders operating offshore. However, New Zealand’s adoption of this provision would be consistent with both the proposals contained in the recent Government discussion document titled BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance and the long-term direction of New Zealand’s tax treaty policy.

b. **requests for additional guidance and administrative resources** to help taxpayers apply DTAs as modified by the MLI (including requests for Inland Revenue to produce consolidated versions of New Zealand’s DTAs as modified by the MLI). New Zealand officials have already been working with their Australian counterparts to scope what administrative guidance could be jointly developed to assist taxpayers. Publishers may produce consolidated texts as they currently do with amending protocols and original DTAs. In addition to this, New Zealand Inland Revenue officials are continuing discussions with overseas counterparts to determine what additional certainty the competent authorities may be able to provide (for example, through a memorandum of understanding which sets out in more detail how each MLI provision applies to the DTA).

c. **technical domestic law changes** needed to implement the MLI smoothly. Officials are considering these suggestions and will report separately to Ministers on what domestic law changes may be required before the MLI comes into effect.

### Next steps

30\. Subject to Cabinet’s approval for New Zealand to sign the MLI, we propose that the Minister of Revenue signs the MLI at a signing ceremony arranged by the OECD to be held in Paris on 7 June 2017. At the signing ceremony, New Zealand will also need to present its expected notifications and reservations.

31\. An Instrument of Full Powers will need to be obtained from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to enable the Minister of Revenue to sign the MLI. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will prepare this Instrument and arrange for its signature.

32\. Standing Order 397 provides that the Government will present any international treaty that is the subject of ratification by New Zealand to the House of Representatives for treaty examination by Select Committee. Accordingly, after signature, it is proposed that the MLI be submitted to the House of Representatives for Parliamentary treaty examination. For this purpose, an extended NIA has been drafted and is attached at Annex D. This paper seeks Cabinet approval of the extended NIA so that it can be submitted to Parliament as part of the Parliamentary treaty examination process.

33\. The MLI will be implemented by an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which has overriding effect in relation to other legislation relating to tax and the exchange of information that relates to tax. Subject to satisfactory completion of Parliamentary treaty examination, this paper also seeks Cabinet approval for me to issue drafting instructions for an Order in Council to implement the MLI into New Zealand domestic law.

34\. Article 34 provides that the MLI will enter into force for New Zealand once New Zealand has deposited its instrument of ratification. New Zealand will be in a position to deposit its instrument of ratification following the completion of all domestic procedures for entry into force. Subject to the successful promulgation of an Order in Council, this paper seeks Cabinet approval for officials to ratify the MLI by depositing New Zealand’s instrument of ratification with the MLI Depositary. New Zealand will also need to confirm its final notifications and reservations at this point in time.

### Consultation

35\. Tax policy officials and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were consulted in the preparation of this Cabinet paper.

36\. In addition, an officials’ issues paper titled _New Zealand’s implementation of the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS_ was released on 3 March 2017. Submissions closed on 7 April 2017 and 5 were received. Officials met with interested stakeholders. These submissions and views are summarised in paragraphs 26 to 29 above.

### Financial implications

37\. Normally, new DTAs or amending protocols constrain New Zealand from taxing certain income and limit the rate at which tax on passive income (dividends, interest, and royalties) can be imposed and therefore result in the reduction of New Zealand tax. This upfront revenue cost is then typically offset by other factors (for example, through reduced need to allow foreign tax credits).

38\. The MLI differs in that its provisions are typically base protection measures which increase New Zealand’s ability to tax inbound investment and equips New Zealand with a whole-of-treaty anti-abuse rule to prevent tax avoidance through the use of DTAs. This may result in more tax paid by non-residents in New Zealand. However, as the provisions are reciprocal, the MLI may increase the amount of foreign income tax paid by New Zealand residents with investments and business operations overseas. This could decrease the amount of New Zealand income tax paid on that foreign income as a foreign tax credit is provided for foreign income tax paid.

39\. Data limitations prevent officials from accurately estimating the actual impact on net tax revenue. However, as New Zealand is a capital importer and the MLI covers the majority of New Zealand’s DTA network, it is expected that overall impact on tax revenue will be positive.

40\. In terms of costs borne by Inland Revenue, there will be costs associated in administering the arbitration provisions of the MLI and some of the provisions that require competent authority agreement. However, these are expected to be relatively small. The existence of arbitration provides a strong incentive for tax authorities to resolve issues under the mutual agreement procedure before arbitration can be triggered. New Zealand’s DTAs with Australia and Japan already provide for arbitration and New Zealand’s experience is that very few cases have been brought by taxpayers under the mutual agreement procedure and almost all of these have been settled within the required time period, regardless of whether the DTA provides for arbitration.

### Human rights

41\. No inconsistencies with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993 have been identified.

### Legislative implications

42\. The MLI must be given effect by Order in Council, pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

43\. Accordingly this paper seeks approval for an Order in Council to be drafted and submitted to Cabinet following the signing of the MLI and the completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process.

### Regulatory impact analysis

44\. As this proposal has regulatory implications (it requires an Order in Council), the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirements apply. However, as this paper relates to an international treaty, an extended NIA has been prepared (see Annex D) rather than a separate Regulatory Impact Statement.

45\. The extended NIA was prepared by Inland Revenue. The extended NIA was circulated with this paper to the Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for departmental consultation.

46\. As this proposal has regulatory implications (it requires an Order in Council), the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirements apply. However, as this paper relates to an international treaty, an extended NIA has been prepared (see Annex D) in accordance with the RIA requirements.

47\. The extended NIA was prepared by Inland Revenue. The extended NIA was circulated with this paper to the Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for departmental consultation.

48\. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team (RIAT) and the tax strategy team in the Treasury have jointly reviewed the extended NIA prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the extended NIA meets the quality assurance criteria.

49\. The extended NIA compares the benefits and costs of signing the treaty relative to taking no action or other potential approaches to amending DTAs, and provides sufficient analysis to support the proposals.

50\. In part because provisions in the MLI are drafted broadly it has been difficult to project the revenue and compliance impacts from the treaty. RIAT recommends ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the MLI as part of the Government’s response to BEPS to ensure that any unintended consequences are known.

### Publicity

51\. It is proposed that New Zealand participates in the signing ceremony arranged by the OECD to be held in Paris on 7 June 2017. Appropriate media statements and announcements will be arranged once details have been finalised. The text of the MLI and New Zealand’s notifications and reservations will be publicly available on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website. The extended NIA will be publicly available on the Parliamentary website following Parliamentary treaty examination.

52\. It is expected that the OECD will also arrange its own publicity for the signing ceremony and will make all signatories’ reservations and notifications publicly available following the signing ceremony.

### Recommendations

53\. We recommend that the Cabinet:

1\. **note** that the Income Tax Act 2007 authorises the negotiation of, and giving effect to double tax agreements (“DTAs”) with other jurisdictions;

2\. **note** that officials participated in the negotiation of the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (the “MLI”), the text of which was formally adopted in November 2016;

3\. **note** that the MLI will quickly and efficiently amend the majority of New Zealand’s DTAs to include the recommended changes to tax treaties arising out of the OECD/G20 15 point Action Plan on base erosion and profit shifting;

4\. **approve** the text of the MLI attached to the Cabinet paper as Annex A (subject to any minor technical changes resulting from the process of translation or legal verification);

5\. **note** that officials have finalised New Zealand’s expected notifications and reservations in relation to the choices available in the MLI;

6\. **approve** New Zealand’s expected notifications and reservations attached to the Cabinet paper as Annex B;

7\. **delegate** to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue the authority to approve any changes to the notifications and reservations as a result of developments in other jurisdictions’ positions and any other minor technical changes;

8\. **agree** that New Zealand sign the MLI;

9\. **note** that an Instrument of Full Powers will need to be obtained from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to enable the Minister of Revenue to sign the MLI. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will prepare this Instrument and arrange for its signature;

10\. **approve** the extended National Interest Analysis (“NIA”) attached to the Cabinet paper as Annex D;

### Executive summary

1\. On \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\] in \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\], New Zealand signed the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (the Multilateral Instrument or MLI).

2\. The MLI is a multilateral international treaty that proposes to quickly and efficiently amend a significant number of double tax agreements (DTAs) around the world to take into account new treaty standards relating to treaty abuse and dispute resolution. The MLI cannot in and of itself allocate taxing rights between two jurisdictions; it is effective by modifying pre-existing DTAs. For it to modify a particular DTA, both jurisdictions must be parties to the MLI and must have included the DTA in their lists of notifications and reservations provided at the same time their instruments of ratification are deposited.

3\. The negotiation of, and giving of effect to, DTAs (and the MLI) is provided for by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

4\. DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. They do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. New Zealand has 40 DTAs in force, primarily with New Zealand’s major trading and investment partners.

5\. While DTAs are beneficial for taxpayers, investors and governments themselves, there is the potential for these bilateral agreements to be misused to reduce or eliminate a multinational’s worldwide tax. Misuse of DTAs in this way has been a feature of a number of cross-border tax avoidance arrangements.

6\. The misuse of DTAs forms part of a wider problem referred to as base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), which has been the focus of significant global media and political attention since late 2012, following evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world.

7\. BEPS is a global problem as many BEPS strategies exploit technical differences between different countries’ tax rules, so New Zealand has been working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G20 to develop a co-ordinated global solution to address BEPS through the 15-point OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan.

8\. A number of the items on the BEPS Action Plan address the misuse of DTAs and can only be implemented through changes to DTAs themselves. Some of these solutions are “minimum standards” that countries that commit to solving BEPS are expected to adopt. Other provisions are optional, but are DTA “best practice” and now form part of the OECD Model Tax Convention following adoption of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan.

9\. Countries, including New Zealand, were presented with the difficulty of how to quickly and efficiently implement these measures without requiring the bilateral renegotiation of several thousand existing DTAs, which could take several years (or even potentially decades). For this reason, the Multilateral Instrument was developed under Action 15 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan to swiftly amend the DTAs of all participating jurisdictions.

10\. To make the best use of the MLI, New Zealand’s strategy has been to include the majority of its DTAs within the scope of the MLI and has chosen to adopt as many of the MLI provisions as possible, as they are in line with New Zealand’s overall treaty policy. This gives New Zealand the best chance of strengthening its DTAs with as many jurisdictions as possible.

### Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action

11\. New Zealand signed the _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (the Multilateral Instrument or MLI) on \[\_\_\_\_\] in \[\_\_\_\_\]. The text of the Multilateral Instrument is attached as Annex A.

12\. The proposed treaty action is to ratify the Multilateral Instrument into force by depositing New Zealand’s instrument of ratification with the Depositary of the Multilateral Instrument, the Secretary-General of the OECD, in accordance with Articles 27 and 34 of the Multilateral Instrument, after the necessary domestic procedures for entry into force have been completed. At the same time New Zealand’s instrument of ratification is deposited, New Zealand must also provide its list of confirmed notifications and reservations. This is attached as Annex B.

13\. Before ratification can occur, the MLI must undergo Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Parliament’s Standing Order 397, and must successfully be given the force of law in New Zealand by an Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

14\. In general, the MLI will enter into force for New Zealand on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three calendar months after the date New Zealand’s instrument of ratification is deposited. However, the MLI itself will only enter into force once five jurisdictions have deposited their instruments of ratification. The procedure for entry into force of the MLI is set out in Article 34 of the MLI.

15\. The MLI cannot in and of itself allocate taxing rights between two jurisdictions; it is effective by modifying pre-existing DTAs. As DTAs are bilateral agreements negotiated by two jurisdictions, Article 35 of the MLI provides that the provisions of the MLI will only have effect in relation to a particular DTA once the MLI has entered into force for both parties to that DTA where both jurisdictions have nominated the DTA to be covered by the MLI by including the DTA in their list of confirmed notifications and reservations submitted at the time the instrument of ratification is deposited (i.e. it is a covered tax agreement).

16\. As with New Zealand’s DTAs more generally, Zealand’s signature of the Multilateral Instrument does not extend to Tokelau.

### Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty

#### General reasons for New Zealand concluding double tax agreements

17\. New Zealand began entering into DTAs in 1947, and currently has a network of 40 DTAs in force, predominantly with New Zealand’s main trading and investment partners.

18\. DTAs are bilateral international treaties that are principally designed to encourage growth in economic ties between countries. DTAs do this by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade and investment. Some impediments to cross-border economic activity can be addressed unilaterally. For example, New Zealand generally relieves double taxation by unilaterally allowing tax residents who derive foreign-sourced income to credit foreign tax paid against their New Zealand tax liability. New Zealand also unilaterally reduces withholding taxes on certain forms of inbound investment. However, unilateral solutions cannot address all of the issues that arise from cross-border activity. Moreover, the country applying unilateral measures must then bear the full cost of the relief. DTAs address these problems by facilitating bilateral solutions. DTAs enable a wider range of issues to be addressed than is possible unilaterally, and also enable the parties to a DTA to share the cost of providing relief.

19\. DTA networks make an important contribution to the expansion of world trade and to the development of the world economy, which are key objectives of the OECD. Internationally, the OECD has therefore assumed a leading role in promoting the use of DTAs. In particular, the OECD has produced a Model Tax Convention, and a comprehensive commentary, for member and non-member countries to use as a basis for concluding DTAs. As a member of the OECD, New Zealand is subject to an express recommendation issued by the OECD Council in 1997[\[1\]](#footnote1)
 for all member countries:

> 1.  _to pursue their efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions … with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not yet entered into such conventions …_
> 2.  _when concluding new bilateral conventions or revising existing bilateral conventions, to conform to the Model Tax Convention, as interpreted by the Commentaries thereon._

20\. New Zealand’s negotiating model is based on the OECD Model Tax Convention, with some differences that take into account New Zealand’s status as a small capital importing nation and other unique features of New Zealand’s economy, for example, the importance of primary industries. Therefore, the OECD Model Tax Convention and its associated commentary play an important role in New Zealand’s overall treaty policy and New Zealand’s DTA network.

#### Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the Multilateral Instrument

21\. While DTAs are beneficial for taxpayers, investors and governments, there is the potential for these bilateral agreements to be misused to reduce or eliminate a multinational’s worldwide tax. Misuse of DTAs in this way has been a feature of a number of cross-border tax avoidance arrangements.

22\. The misuse of DTAs forms part of a wider problem referred to as base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), which has been the focus of significant global media and political attention since late 2012, following evidence suggesting that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world.

23\. BEPS is a global problem as many BEPS strategies exploit technical differences between different countries’ tax rules, and New Zealand has been working with the OECD and G20 to develop a co-ordinated global solution to address BEPS through the 15-point OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan. The New Zealand Government has confirmed its commitment to resolving BEPS on a number of occasions.[\[2\]](#footnote2)

24\. A number of the items on the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan address the misuse of DTAs and can only be implemented through changes to DTAs themselves. These are:

*   preventing the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances (Action 6);
*   preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status (Action 7);
*   neutralising the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements that have a treaty aspect (Action 2); and
*   providing improved mechanisms for effective dispute resolution (Action 14).

25\. Some of the solutions under these Action items are “minimum standards” that countries that commit to solving BEPS are expected to adopt. Other provisions are optional, but are DTA “best practice” and now form part of the OECD Model Tax Convention following the adoption of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan.

26\. Given the important role the OECD Model Tax Convention plays in informing New Zealand’s treaty policy, as well as New Zealand’s commitment to resolving BEPS more generally, New Zealand is committed to including these minimum standards as well as the optional best practice provisions in its DTAs, where they are in line with overall New Zealand treaty policy.

27\. New Zealand’s treaty negotiation resources are limited and to update New Zealand’s entire DTA network would take several years, if not decades, particularly as many of New Zealand’s treaty partners would likely place greater importance on updating more significant treaties. This would limit New Zealand’s ability to meet the OECD minimum standard in a timely fashion.

28\. Finding resources to update DTAs is a common problem faced by many countries, not just New Zealand. The development of the Multilateral Instrument under Action 15 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan takes into account the existence of several thousand DTAs around the world and allows participating jurisdictions to quickly and efficiently amend their DTAs to counter BEPS. The text of the MLI was developed by the OECD Ad Hoc Group consisting of officials from more than 100 participating jurisdictions including New Zealand and was formally adopted by the OECD in November 2016.

29\. The MLI is flexible and allows countries to choose:

*   which of their existing DTAs they wish to modify through the MLI;
*   alternative ways of meeting BEPS minimum standards on treaty abuse and dispute resolution; and
*   whether they want to adopt the OECD-recommended provisions for non-minimum standards. Within some of these provisions, there are alternative ways of addressing BEPS concerns and the ability for countries to enter a variety of reservations.

30\. To make the best use of the MLI, New Zealand’s strategy has been to include the majority of its DTAs within the scope of the Multilateral Instrument and has chosen to adopt as many of the MLI provisions as possible. This gives New Zealand the best chance of strengthening its DTAs with as many jurisdictions as possible.

31\. New Zealand’s list of notifications and reservations can be found in Annex B. This document lists the DTAs New Zealand wishes to be covered by the MLI and the provisions New Zealand has indicated it will adopt. This document must be submitted at the time instrument of ratification is deposited and will be considered “confirmed” at that point in time. There is limited ability to amend New Zealand’s notifications and reservations following entry into force, which is discussed in further detail the section titled _Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects_.

32\. Of New Zealand’s 40 in-force DTAs, New Zealand has nominated 34 to be covered by the MLI. Many of these DTAs were concluded in the 1970s and 1980s and do not reflect modern treaty standards, even before the work on BEPS was completed. The six DTAs that have not been listed are with jurisdictions who will not be signing the MLI. To be modified by the MLI, both New Zealand and the other jurisdiction must elect for the MLI to apply to the DTA (if there is a match, then the DTA is a “covered tax agreement”). Based on current draft notifications, New Zealand is expected to have 28 covered tax agreements. See Annex C. While this list is not final, it provides a fairly good indication of the likely coverage of the MLI. Final coverage will not be confirmed until each jurisdiction deposits its instrument of ratification with the OECD Depositary.

33\. As noted above, New Zealand’s strategy in formulating its notifications and reservations has been to adopt as many of the MLI provisions as possible. This is because they are base protection measures that are in line with New Zealand’s existing treaty policy (which has a greater source state emphasis than the OECD Model Tax Convention) or are taxpayer friendly measures that provide improved access to dispute resolution. For example, New Zealand generally takes a broader approach in its DTAs than the current OECD Model Tax Convention in determining whether a permanent establishment exists. This means that the recommendations under Action 7 (preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status) of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan which are contained in Articles 12¬ to 15 of the MLI are not contrary to New Zealand’s general treaty policy and, in New Zealand’s view, represent an improvement to the OECD Model Tax Convention.

34\. The optional provisions New Zealand has chosen cover the following issues:

*   Fiscally transparent entities (like trusts or partnerships) create arbitrage opportunities because they are treated differently for tax purposes by different countries. The provision in Article 3 clarifies that treaty benefits will only be allowed to the extent to which the item of income is taxed in the state in which the entity is resident.
*   Dual resident entities can be used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities by manipulating the current “place of effective management” test. The proposed provision in Article 4 will require competent authorities to agree the residence status of a dual resident entity. If there is no agreement, then treaty benefits will be denied, or only granted to the extent to which the competent authorities can agree.
*   In the OECD Model Tax Convention – and in many of New Zealand’s modern treaties – a lower withholding tax rate is available where the shareholder owns more than a certain proportion of the company’s shares. The MLI provision in Article 8 requires shares to be held for a minimum of 365 days for the shareholder to be entitled to reduced withholding tax rates on dividends. This prevents shareholders buying shares and holding them temporarily in order to access lower withholding rates.
*   Investors can hold land through companies and dispose of the shares in the company to avoid paying tax on the disposal of that land. Many treaties contain a “land-rich company rule” which allows the source jurisdiction to tax income derived from land when the majority of a company’s assets consist of land. To prevent the artificial and temporary dilution of the amount of land held by a company just before sale, the provision in Article 9 requires the threshold for the amount of land ownership which triggers the rule to be measured on every day in the 365 day period leading up to the sale of the shares and extends the rule to interests in other entities such as partnerships and trusts.
*   Permanent establishments can be established in third states to exploit low tax rates and branch exemptions. Article 10 of the MLI introduces a provision that denies treaty benefits in the case of income derived by a permanent establishment of an enterprise resident in one of the parties to the DTA, where that permanent establishment is situated in a low tax third state and the residence state exempts the permanent establishment’s income.
*   Article 11 introduces a provision that preserves a jurisdiction’s right to tax its own residents. For example, this provision would prevent a New Zealand resident who is engaged in a tax avoidance arrangement from claiming that a DTA prevents New Zealand from using its domestic general anti-avoidance rule to impose tax.
*   A source jurisdiction generally cannot tax the business profits of a resident of the other contracting state unless there is a permanent establishment in the source state. The provisions in Articles 12 to 15 of the MLI introduce changes to counter common strategies used to avoid permanent establishment status.

35\. In addition to addressing these specific BEPS concerns, Article 6 of the MLI proposes to amend the preamble to DTAs to confirm that they are not intended to be used to generate double non-taxation. Under Article 7, New Zealand has selected the option of adding a principal purpose test to its DTAs. The principal purpose test is a general anti-abuse rule that applies to the whole DTA. Both Articles 6 and 7 form part of the OECD minimum standard.

36\. In addition to these base protection measures, New Zealand is signing up to taxpayer friendly measures relating to the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) and the availability of arbitration as a form of dispute resolution. These measures are a result of the work on Action 14 of the OECD/G20 BEPS Action Plan relating to improving mechanisms for effective dispute resolution. They recognise the fact that measures to counter BEPS should not lead to unnecessary uncertainty for compliant taxpayers and to unintended double taxation. Improving dispute resolution mechanisms is therefore an integral component of the work on BEPS issues.

37\. Article 16 of the MLI introduces a provision allowing taxpayers to approach the competent authorities of either party to the DTA to request MAP where they believe taxation is not in accordance with the treaty. This is a new OECD minimum standard. While the majority of New Zealand’s DTAs contain MAP provisions, the MLI will amend these provisions to allow taxpayers to approach the competent authority of either jurisdiction (currently they only permit a case to be presented to the competent authority of the taxpayer’s country of residence). In addition, Article 16 creates a new minimum standard regarding time limits for bringing a case to MAP and for implementing a solution.

38\. Article 17 requires contracting states to make appropriate corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases. This provision is already found in most of New Zealand’s DTAs except for New Zealand’s oldest treaties, which were concluded before the OECD Model Tax Convention included such a provision.

39\. New Zealand has also opted to apply Part VI of the MLI, which will introduce arbitration as a means of dispute resolution. If a solution cannot be reached under MAP, taxpayers have the ability to request that unresolved issues can be taken to arbitration. New Zealand has already agreed to arbitration in two of its treaties (with Australia and Japan). New Zealand’s experience is that the arbitration facility is very rarely used, but it acts as an incentive for the competent authorities of two jurisdictions to come to an agreement within the required time period for MAP.

40\. Note that while New Zealand has indicated that it will sign up to many of the optional provisions, these will only apply to a DTA if New Zealand’s treaty partner also signs the MLI, includes their DTA with New Zealand in their list of notifications and reservations and chooses to apply the same option as New Zealand.

### Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the Multilateral Instrument entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand

41\. The standard process for making amendments to DTAs is to renegotiate a new agreement or to negotiate a protocol that amends specific parts of the existing DTA (an amending protocol). In absence of the MLI, New Zealand would be expected to enter into bilateral negotiations with each of its treaty partners in order to meet the new OECD minimum standard. The advantages and disadvantages of bringing the MLI into force are therefore considered in relation to the status quo and also in relation to this bilateral negotiation approach.

42\. The MLI is a novel approach to modifying DTAs, but it is not unprecedented in international law. Experts in both international tax and public international law participated in the OECD Ad Hoc Group that developed the MLI to ensure that it works as intended.

43\. The provisions in the MLI have been drafted more broadly than they otherwise would for an amending protocol to take account of the fact that the MLI must be able to apply to not one DTA, but several thousand. This, combined with a limited ability to customise the MLI’s provisions, means that the interaction between the MLI and DTAs is not as straightforward as an amending protocol.

44\. This complication is one of the most significant trade-offs, but despite this, ratifying the MLI is expected to be in New Zealand’s overall interests.

#### Advantages of the Multilateral Instrument entering into force for New Zealand

45\. The main advantage in the MLI entering into force for New Zealand is that it would reduce the ability of multinationals and other investors to misuse DTAs to reduce both their New Zealand tax and their worldwide tax, or in other words, it resolves BEPS issues that relate to tax treaties. This is achieved through changes to specific provisions found in DTAs, as well as through more general changes, such as a new preamble and the introduction of a general treaty anti-abuse rule.

46\. Many of New Zealand’s treaties already contain pre-cursors to some of the MLI provisions, which will also feature in the updated OECD Model Tax Convention (for example, a principal purpose test, or a land-rich company rule that extends to interests in other entities). However, the drafting of these provisions often differs from treaty to treaty with no or little OECD commentary to rely on. By signing up to the relevant MLI provisions and replacing existing provisions, New Zealand will have consistency across its treaty network and will also be able to rely on the new OECD commentary relating to those provisions.

47\. While the resolution of treaty-related BEPS issues and the introduction of improved mechanisms for dispute resolution could also occur in absence of the MLI, in order to do this New Zealand would be required to enter into bilateral negotiations with each of its treaty partners.

48\. The main advantage of the MLI compared with the bilateral negotiation approach is that the MLI process is much faster and more efficient. Based on current projections it is possible that the MLI could enter into effect for New Zealand in 2019. Bilateral negotiations, on the other hand, could take several years or potentially decades to complete. No additional negotiations or discussions with treaty partners are required for the MLI to apply to a DTA. This is because jurisdictions have been required to provide draft notifications and reservations at various stages of the MLI project, which has provided clarity as to jurisdictions’ positions. In addition, “speed matching” sessions were arranged by the OECD in late February – early March 2017 so that bilateral treaty partners could meet to discuss any issues with the application or implementation of the MLI, either in general or with regard to specific provisions.

49\. In addition to the time it would take to complete bilateral negotiations, each individual amending protocol would need to be ratified according to each jurisdiction’s domestic law requirements, as opposed to ratifying the single MLI. This could add further time to the process and create bottlenecks in parliamentary processes, as other jurisdictions may place greater importance on ratifying amending protocols with more significant economies than New Zealand.

50\. In this respect, the main advantages of the MLI compared with entering into individual bilateral negotiations are that the BEPS solutions will be incorporated into New Zealand’s DTAs as soon as possible and resources (from both a policy perspective and a Parliamentary perspective) will be freed up to work on other priorities.

51\. New Zealand’s tax system operates on the principle of voluntary compliance, which relies on taxpayers understanding their tax obligations and how the wider tax system works. An important part of this is that, overall, the tax system is seen to be fair. If the view persists that multinationals do not pay their fair share of tax, this could undermine the integrity of the tax system. Therefore, New Zealand’s ratification of the MLI and the resolution of treaty-related BEPS issues in a timely manner support the overall integrity of the New Zealand tax system. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled _Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action_.

52\. The advantages to New Zealand in becoming a party to the MLI (as compared to the bilateral negotiation approach) can therefore be summarised as follows:

*   it significantly reduces the possibility of New Zealand’s DTAs being misused to reduce or eliminate tax liabilities;
*   it introduces taxpayer friendly measures relating to disputes resolution;
*   it allows New Zealand to update the majority of its DTAs quickly and efficiently;
*   the timely resolution of treaty related BEPS issues supports the overall integrity of the New Zealand tax system.

#### Disadvantages of the Multilateral Instrument entering into force for New Zealand

53\. The main disadvantage of the MLI entering into force for New Zealand stems from the fact that the provisions in the MLI have been drafted more broadly than they otherwise would for an amending protocol to take account of the fact that the MLI must be able to apply to not one DTA, but several thousand.

54\. This means that there can be some ambiguity in how the MLI applies to a particular DTA. This ambiguity is mitigated in many cases as a given MLI provision will only replace the corresponding DTA provision if both treaty partners notify the same provision.

55\. Any residual ambiguity may give rise to compliance costs as taxpayers will need to consider the DTA alongside the text of the MLI and the confirmed notifications and reservations of both parties to the DTA. This would not occur if instead of ratifying the MLI, New Zealand into individual bilateral amending protocols with each of its DTA partners.

56\. There are ways in which these upfront compliance costs may be mitigated. Publishers may produce consolidated texts as they currently do with amending protocols and original DTAs. In addition to this, New Zealand Inland Revenue officials are continuing discussions with overseas counterparts to determine what additional certainty the competent authorities may be able to provide (for example, through the mutual agreement procedure in DTAs, competent authorities can produce a memorandum of understanding to resolve any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the MLI with respect to a specific DTA). New Zealand officials may also consider producing informal consolidated versions of New Zealand’s DTAs in response to submissions requesting this.

57\. This complication is one of the most significant trade-offs, but despite this, bringing the MLI into force is expected to be in New Zealand’s overall interests. Any upfront compliance costs associated with determining how the MLI modifies a particular DTA and the administrative costs associated with producing guidance on the application of the MLI would be offset by the savings made from not having to enter into bilateral negotiations with each DTA partner and then having to bring each amending protocol into force.

58\. There are also compliance and administrative costs that would still arise if instead of ratifying the MLI, New Zealand entered into individual amending protocols with each of its DTAs partners, for example in the context of competent authority agreements to determine the residence of dual resident entities or in challenge the application of specific anti-avoidance provisions.

59\. The issue of compliance and administrative costs is discussed in further detail in the section titled _The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty_. While we are unable to quantify these compliance and administrative costs, we expect them to be modest and through consultation officials are working on ways to minimise these further.

60\. Another disadvantage is the uncertainty of outcomes for each individual DTA. Note that while New Zealand has indicated that it will sign up to many of the optional provisions, these will only apply to a DTA if New Zealand’s treaty partner also signs the MLI, includes their DTA with New Zealand in their list of notifications and reservations and chooses to apply the same option as New Zealand. As stated, notifications and reservations are considered to be in draft form until the instrument of ratification is deposited. Therefore, the modifications to a specific DTA will not be completely certain until both parties have completed their domestic procedures for entry into force and deposited their instruments of ratification. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, New Zealand can control its own position and only choose provisions that it believes are principled and will enhance New Zealand’s DTA network. If countries choose to sign up to fewer MLI provisions than New Zealand, then the DTA will still be strengthened to the extent there is a match. New Zealand believes the provisions in the MLI are principled improvements on the current OECD Model Tax Convention and therefore supports the inclusion of the provisions in its treaties so far as it is possible.

61\. Some stakeholders have raised issues about the inability to consider a set and certain package of measures on a treaty-by-treaty basis (as DTAs are usually a negotiated package, tailored to the specific circumstances of the jurisdictions involved and their bilateral relationship). For example, they have suggested it may be ideal to combine the new strengthened permanent establishment rules or the principal purpose test with the counterbalancing taxpayer-friendly measure of binding arbitration.

62\. Some countries may choose only to adopt the former provisions and not the latter, particularly as the inclusion of a principal purpose test is one way of meeting the minimum standard on treaty abuse under Article 7, while arbitration is optional. Theoretically it would be possible to exclude from the scope of the MLI DTAs with jurisdictions who have indicated in their draft notifications that they will not be signing up to arbitration. However, this would reduce the efficacy of the MLI in enabling New Zealand to meet the OECD minimum standard as New Zealand would have to endeavour to undertake bilateral negotiations with these excluded jurisdictions, which could represent about half of New Zealand’s DTAs, based on current draft notifications. This is undesirable for the reasons outlined above. It would also mean that – until bilateral negotiations can take place – the DTAs excluded on this basis would remain vulnerable to the BEPS techniques the MLI is designed to address. On balance it is in New Zealand’s interest to obtain the stronger DTA provisions, even if it is without the optional arbitration provisions. We also note that many of New Zealand’s DTAs already include a principal purpose test and broader permanent establishment rules, but no ability to pursue arbitration. Therefore this combination is already a feature of some of our existing DTAs and, from New Zealand’s perspective, is not problematic.

63\. Some of the provisions in the MLI (for example, the dual resident entity provision) require taxpayer engagement with competent authorities to determine their tax position. This will increase compliance and administrative costs in these cases. These provisions are used sparingly and are generally confined to areas where tax avoidance arrangements have been prevalent. However, there will be a need to put in place administrative measures to increase taxpayer certainty and minimise compliance costs as much as possible, particularly in bona fide cases where there is no mischief. Eight of New Zealand’s DTAs already contain this provision and it has not, to our knowledge, been problematic. In addition, if instead of ratifying the MLI, New Zealand entered into individual bilateral amending protocols, these costs would still arise. This is discussed in the section titled The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty.

64\. As New Zealand is signing up to the optional arbitration provisions contained in Part VI of the MLI, costs will be incurred if a case is submitted for arbitration. However, as noted below in the section titled _The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty_, the actual costs associated with administering the arbitration provisions are likely to be negligible as New Zealand’s experience is that arbitration is very rarely used and would still arise if New Zealand agreed to include arbitration in its DTAs in individual bilateral amending protocols.

#### Advantages of the Multilateral Instrument not entering into force for New Zealand

65\. It is an option not to ratify the MLI. In that case, the disadvantages identified above relating to implementation would not arise.

66\. In the fullness of time, New Zealand would be able to negotiate amending protocols with each of its DTA partners and tailor the drafting of these protocols to suit the preferences and needs of the treaty partners. This would make it clearer to taxpayers, practitioners and tax authorities what the exact change to each DTA is.

67\. In addition, the amending protocols would also be able to cover issues not included in the MLI.

#### Disadvantages of the Multilateral Instrument not entering into force for New Zealand

68\. If New Zealand does not become a party to the MLI, there are two possible options.

69\. The first is to leave New Zealand’s DTAs as they are. This would mean that there would still be opportunities for New Zealand’s DTAs to be misused to eliminate tax and New Zealand would not meet the new OECD minimum standard. As an OECD member country and a member of BEPS Inclusive Framework,[\[3\]](#footnote3)
 this position is undesirable.

70\. The second and more realistic option, given that New Zealand has indicated its commitment to the BEPS project is for New Zealand to begin bilateral negotiations with each of its DTA partners to incorporate the BEPS recommendations into its existing DTAs.

71\. Bilateral negotiations, however, could take several years or decades to complete. In comparison, no additional negotiations or discussions with treaty partners would be required for the MLI to apply to a DTA. This is because jurisdictions have been required to provide draft notifications and reservations at various stages of the MLI project, which has provided clarity as to jurisdictions’ positions. In addition, “speed matching” sessions were arranged by the OECD in late February and early March 2017 so that bilateral treaty partners could meet to discuss any issues with the application or implementation of the MLI, either in general or with regard to specific provisions.

72\. In addition to the time it would take to complete bilateral negotiations, each individual amending protocol would need to be brought into force according to each jurisdiction’s domestic law requirements, as opposed to bringing into force the single MLI. This could add further time to the process and create bottlenecks in parliamentary processes, as other jurisdictions may place greater importance on ratifying amending protocols with more significant economies than New Zealand.

73\. This is problematic for several reasons. It leaves New Zealand’s DTAs open to misuse for a much longer period of time, but it also has the potential to undermine the integrity of the tax system if there is a continued perception that multinationals do not pay their fair of tax in New Zealand. This is discussed in further detail in the sections titled _Advantages of ratifying the Multilateral Instrument and Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action_. It would also mean that resources that could otherwise be used to progress other projects and government priorities would be tied up in negotiating and ratifying individual bilateral protocols.

74\. Therefore, not becoming party to the MLI, and entering into bilateral negotiations with all of New Zealand’s treaty partners would not be in New Zealand’s overall interests. Of the options available, the proposed treaty action is the best policy option and will achieve the Government’s policy objectives.

### Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms

75\. DTAs cannot impose additional tax obligations beyond what is provided for under domestic law. This means that although the MLI consists largely of base protection measures that would allow the source country to impose tax where the existing DTA does not, these measures cannot go beyond what would otherwise be imposed in absence of a DTA.

76\. The text of the MLI itself cannot be amended to suit each jurisdiction’s preferences, but the MLI provides flexibility by allowing jurisdictions to opt into or reserve against certain provisions. The possible reservations are described in each Article and Article 28 provides that these are the only reservations that are able to be made. In the case of arbitration, free form reservations are permitted, but these must be accepted by the jurisdiction’s treaty partner in order for the reservation to apply to a DTA.

77\. To ensure the operation of the MLI is clear and transparent, signatories must notify the OECD Depositary of which DTAs they wish to cover, which reservations they wish to enter, optional provisions they wish to choose and which provisions in their nominated DTAs will be modified by the MLI. The OECD will publish this information online and it will be readily accessible to the public.

78\. These reservations must either be made at the time of signature of the MLI and confirmed at the time the instrument of ratification is deposited, or a provisional list of expected reservations must be provided at the time of signature and subsequently confirmed at the time the instrument of ratification is deposited. At the time of signature, New Zealand provided a provisional list of expected reservations and so New Zealand’s confirmed notifications and reservations must be submitted at the time the instrument of ratification is deposited.

79\. After a jurisdiction’s choices and reservations are confirmed at the time the instrument of ratification is deposited, that jurisdiction is still able to add new DTAs to their list of treaties covered by the MLI and withdraw their reservations (or reduce the scope of their reservations), but are unable to enter new or broader reservations. The effect of this is that, following ratification, New Zealand (and other) jurisdictions can expand, but not narrow, the application of the MLI to their DTA network. This is provided for in Articles 28 and 29 of the Multilateral Instrument.

80\. New Zealand’s provisional notifications and reservations can be found in Annex B and the overall effect of New Zealand’s options and reservations is discussed in the section titled _Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty_. As noted in that section, the MLI provisions will only apply to a DTA if the other treaty partner also chooses the same option. This means that the effect of the MLI could vary from treaty to treaty.

81\. There is no dispute settlement mechanism for the MLI itself, but Article 32 provides that any questions arising as to the interpretation or implementation of the MLI may be addressed by a “Conference of the Parties”. Under Article 31 a Conference of the Parties can be convened to consider a proposed amendment at the request of one of the parties to the MLI, but only if one third of the parties to the MLI support the request within six calendar months of the request being communicated.

82\. Note, however, that New Zealand is signing up to improved MAP provisions and arbitration, which will improve the dispute resolution mechanisms available in New Zealand’s existing DTAs that are being amended by the MLI.

### Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation

83\. Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the MLI will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 provides for the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. However, the override relates only to tax matters, and applies only in respect of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993.

84\. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the core provisions of the MLI and New Zealand’s DTAs, which may provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act 1982 is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other jurisdiction do not have to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act 1993 is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty.

85\. Article 34 of the MLI provides that the agreement itself will only enter into force once five jurisdictions have completed their domestic law requirements and have deposited their instruments of ratification. In particular, it will enter into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three calendar months beginning on the date of deposit of the fifth instrument of ratification. If New Zealand is one of the first five jurisdictions to ratify the MLI, it will enter into force for New Zealand on that date. If not, the MLI will enter into force for New Zealand on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three calendar months after the date New Zealand’s instrument of ratification is deposited.

86\. New Zealand will be in a position to deposit its instrument of ratification with the Depositary of the MLI, the Secretary-General of the OECD, once the Order in Council has entered into force, which will be 28 days after its publication in the _New Zealand Gazette_.

87\. As the MLI affects pre-existing DTAs that have been negotiated by two jurisdictions, Article 35 provides that the provisions of the MLI will only have effect in relation to a particular DTA once the MLI has entered into force for both parties to that DTA. For withholding tax, it will apply where the event giving rise to the tax occurs on or after 1 January of the next calendar year beginning on or after the latest date on which the MLI enters into force for each of the parties to the covered tax agreement. For income tax, it will apply to taxable periods (in New Zealand’s case, income years) beginning on or after a 6 month period from the latest date on which the MLI enters into force for each of the parties to the covered tax agreement.

88\. Some domestic law changes may be needed to facilitate the modifications to New Zealand’s DTAs by the MLI. For example, officials anticipate there may need to be some amendments to the dispute procedures in Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enable cases to be submitted to arbitration without prejudicing taxpayer rights under the domestic law. There may also be changes needed to the time bar rules to allow arbitration decisions to be implemented notwithstanding domestic law time limits for amending assessments and providing taxpayer refunds.

89\. As an alternative to the above Order in Council mechanism, the MLI could be given legislative effect by means of the enactment of a dedicated statute. However, this option would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation and could be difficult to achieve in reality given the system for depositing notification and reservations, so it is not preferred or practical.

### Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action

90\. With the political and media focus on BEPS in recent years, there has been a sentiment among the general public that multinationals are not paying their fair share of tax.

91\. New Zealand’s tax system operates on the principle of voluntary compliance, which relies on taxpayers understanding their tax obligations and how the wider tax system works. An important part of this is that, overall, the tax system is seen to be fair. If the view persists that multinationals do not pay their fair share of tax, this could undermine the integrity of the tax system and the ability to New Zealand to operate a tax system based on voluntary compliance and self-assessment.

92\. The provisions that New Zealand is signing up to in the MLI are base protection measures which will strengthen New Zealand’s ability to tax a multinational’s income where there is a New Zealand source and will reduce the ability of multinationals to misuse those DTAs to eliminate tax in New Zealand.

93\. Therefore, New Zealand’s ratification of the MLI and the resolution of treaty-related BEPS issues in a timely manner will assist in supporting the overall integrity of the New Zealand tax system.

94\. In addition, ratifying the MLI may enhance or reinforce New Zealand’s reputation in the international community as a supporter of the OECD/G20 BEPS project.

95\. From an economic impact perspective, the MLI, as a tool to resolve BEPS concerns that arise as a result of the misuse of DTAs, increases worldwide economic efficiency. This is because the use of BEPS techniques results in cross-border investments being subsidised relative to domestic investment. This leads to an inefficient allocation of investment internationally. Eliminating this misallocation would increase worldwide efficiency, leading to higher worldwide incomes.

96\. One source of such inefficiency arises from the use of complex arrangements to benefit from certain provisions found in DTAs. The introduction of a whole-of-treaty anti-abuse rule (the principal purpose test in Article 7) through the MLI should have a dampening effect on taxpayers’ appetites to use such complex arrangements.

97\. However, there is a potential trade-off that should be noted - increasing the tax that New Zealand is able to impose under a DTA could have a negative impact on the level of foreign investment into New Zealand and on the cost of capital. This concern is not unique to the MLI and is a potential concern with any tax measure that increases the effective rate of tax on inbound investment. In June 2016, officials released a draft paper titled _New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment_ which explores the issue in greater detail and can be found at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. In line with the analysis in this paper, our assessment is that any impact would likely be low and is acceptable in the overall context of the BEPS project. New Zealand is adopting the MLI alongside a number of likeminded countries who are implementing the BEPS measures broadly at the same time. Furthermore, the base protection measures included in the MLI are important to protect the New Zealand tax base and ensure that New Zealand is able to collect its fair share of revenues.

98\. As stated in New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment:

> _“Taxes are necessary to fund government spending. New Zealand faces growing fiscal pressures with an ageing population. Maintaining robust tax bases is important to reduce upward pressures on tax rates and help maintain our coherent tax structure._
> 
> _New Zealand levies tax on the profits of non-resident-owned firms that are sourced in New Zealand. These taxes should not be voluntary. Tax rules should not allow foreign-owned firms to sidestep paying taxes on their profits in New Zealand._
> 
> _Almost all taxes are likely to have some negative effects on economic activity. In setting taxes on inbound investment there is a balance to be struck. Taxes should not unduly discourage inbound investment but we want the tax system to be robust. It is important that taxes are fair and seen to be fair._
> 
> _…Deviations from normal tax rules, intended or otherwise, can lead to substitution of low-taxed investors for tax-paying investors, reducing national income without necessarily lowering the overall pre-tax cost of capital to New Zealand or increasing investment. Accordingly, base-maintenance provisions that ensure the intended level of tax is collected will often be in New Zealand’s best interest.”_

99\. Note that this is a secondary effect that arises from behavioural changes which officials are unable to quantify.

100\. When resolving BEPS issues it is important that New Zealand remains an attractive place to base a business and invest. Taking a unilateral approach could harm New Zealand’s reputation as a good place to do business, because New Zealand’s tax treaty network could look less favourable relative to other countries’ networks. However, a co-ordinated approach through the MLI minimises this risk by broadly simultaneously amending potentially several thousand treaties at the same time.

101\. Regardless, the overall benefits of ratifying the MLI are expected to outweigh the costs.

### The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty

102\. Normally, new DTAs or amending protocols constrain New Zealand from taxing certain income and limit the rate at which tax on passive income (dividends, interest, and royalties) can be imposed and therefore result in the reduction of New Zealand tax. However, this upfront revenue cost is typically offset by other factors (for example, through a reduced need for New Zealand to allow foreign tax credits for foreign income tax paid by New Zealand residents on foreign-sourced income).

103\. The MLI differs in that its provisions are typically base protection measures which increase New Zealand’s ability to tax inbound investment and equips New Zealand with a whole-of-treaty anti-abuse rule to prevent tax avoidance through the use of DTAs. This may result in more tax paid by non-residents in New Zealand.

104\. However, as the provisions are reciprocal, the MLI may also increase the amount of foreign income tax paid by New Zealand residents with overseas investments and business operations. This could decrease the amount of net New Zealand income tax paid on that foreign income as a foreign tax credit is provided for foreign income tax paid.

105\. Data limitations prevent officials from estimating the actual impact on net tax revenue. However, as New Zealand is a capital importer and the MLI covers the majority of New Zealand’s DTA network, it is expected that the overall impact on tax revenue will be positive. A similar effect would be expected if instead of ratifying the MLI, New Zealand entered into individual amending protocols with each of its DTA partners.

106\. In terms of costs borne by Inland Revenue, there will be costs associated in administering the arbitration and other competent authority agreement provisions contained in the MLI. However, these are expected to be small and would be the same if instead of ratifying the MLI, New Zealand entered into individual amending protocols with each of its DTA partners.

107\. The existence of arbitration provides a strong incentive for revenue authorities to resolve issues under the MAP before arbitration can be triggered. New Zealand’s DTAs with Australia and Japan already provide for arbitration and New Zealand’s experience is that very few cases have been brought by taxpayers under the MAP and almost all of these have been settled within the required time period, regardless of whether the DTA provides for arbitration.

108\. As mentioned above, there will be additional compliance and/or administrative costs associated with determining how the MLI modifies particular DTAs, producing guidance on the application of the MLI and using competent authority agreements to determine the treaty residence of dual-resident entities or challenging the application of specific anti-avoidance provisions such as the third state permanent establishment rule. While we are unable to quantify these compliance and administrative costs, we expect them to be modest and through consultation officials are working on ways to minimise these further.

109\. Some of these compliance and administrative costs would still arise if instead of ratifying the MLI, New Zealand entered into individual amending protocols with each of its DTAs partners, for example in the context of competent authority agreements to determine the treaty residence of dual-resident entities or in challenging the application of specific anti-avoidance provisions.

110\. Other costs are unique to the ratification of the MLI but would be offset by the benefits of the MLI. For example, the upfront compliance costs associated with determining how the MLI modifies particular DTA and the administrative costs associated with producing guidance on the application of the MLI would be offset by the savings made from not having to enter into bilateral negotiations with each DTA partner and then having to bring each amending protocol into force.

### Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action

111\. The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were consulted about the content of this extended National Interest Analysis.

112\. In addition, an officials’ issues paper titled _New Zealand’s implementation of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS_ was published in March 2017 and is available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. While officials generally do not consult on the content of tax treaties, due to the complicated nature of the MLI, public feedback was sought on potential implementation issues related to the MLI. Two stakeholder workshops were held on 27 and 28 March 2017 with interested practitioners to enable officials to better understand practitioners’ concerns. Submissions closed on 7 April 2017. Submissions received by that date were taken into account in the drafting of this extended National Interest Analysis, particularly in relation to the potential mitigation of identified disadvantages associated with New Zealand’s ratification of the MLI.

### Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects

113\. After a jurisdiction’s choices and reservations are confirmed at the time the instrument of ratification is deposited, that jurisdiction is still able to add new DTAs as DTAs covered by the MLI and withdraw their reservations (or reduce the scope of their reservations), but are unable to enter new reservations. The effect of this is that, following ratification, New Zealand (and other) jurisdictions can expand, but not narrow, the application of the MLI to their DTA network. This is provided for in Articles 28 and 29 of the MLI.

114\. Article 33 provides that any party may propose an amendment to the MLI by submitting the proposed amendment to the Depository. Under Article 31 a “Conference of the Parties” could be convened to consider the proposed amendment at the request of the proposer, but only if one third of the parties to the MLI support the request within six calendar months of the request being communicated.

115\. Article 38 provides that the MLI could be supplemented by one or more protocols. To become a party to such a protocol, one must be a party to the MLI, but parties to the MLI are not bound by such protocols unless they also become a party to that protocol.

116\. New Zealand may enter into subsequent bilateral protocols which could supersede and replace the MLI provisions in a DTA.

117\. Going forward, the MLI provisions are likely to form part of New Zealand’s negotiating model and so will be generally incorporated into new DTAs.

### Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty

118\. Article 37 provides that any party to the MLI may withdraw from the Multilateral Instrument at any time by notifying the Depositary. The withdrawal is effective from the date of receipt of the notification by the Depositary.

119\. However, if the MLI has already entered into force for both parties to a DTA, then that DTA will remain modified by the Multilateral Instrument.

### Agency Disclosure Statement

Inland Revenue has prepared this extended National Interest Analysis (NIA). Inland Revenue has analysed the issue of implementing the Multilateral Instrument, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation.

As part of that process, Inland Revenue considered the option of not entering into the MLI and instead retaining the status quo or entering into bilateral negotiations with each of New Zealand’s DTA partners.

Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. The policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation.

The provisional notifications and reservations lodged by New Zealand at the time of signature reflect the new OECD minimum and best practice standards relating to tax treaties. The position taken by New Zealand in the provisional notifications and reservations are consistent with the New Zealand negotiating model and will likely be incorporated into the New Zealand negotiating model going forward.

The revenue effect for New Zealand as a result of the changes under the MLI is expected to be negligible but potentially revenue positive due to New Zealand’s status as a net capital importer.

An Order in Council will be required to give the MLI effect in New Zealand law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is provided for under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the MLI.

The Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted about the content of this extended NIA. An officials’ issues paper on implementation issues associated with the MLI was released in March 2017 and the submissions received informed the analysis in this extended NIA.

Inland Revenue’s view is that the policy options considered will not impose material additional costs on business interests; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles.

1 The recommendation follows similar OECD Council recommendations that have been in place since before New Zealand joined the OECD.

2 See for example, the BEPS Cabinet Paper released in June 2016 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2016-other-cabinet-paper-beps-update.pdf and the Government press release welcoming the release of the Multilateral Instrument on 28 November 2016 https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/oecd-multilateral-instrument-counter-beps.

3 The Inclusive Framework is a group of over 90 jurisdictions that have committed to combatting BEPS. Members of the inclusive framework will develop a monitoring process for the four minimum standards as well as put in place the review mechanisms for other elements of the BEPS Package. One of the functions of the Inclusive Framework is to support the development of the toolkits for low-capacity developing countries.

### Update on Multilateral Instrument

* * *

1\. On Monday 15 May 2017, Cabinet approved New Zealand’s signature of the OECD’s _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_ (the Multilateral Instrument or MLI). CAB-17-MIN-0241 refers.

2\. Cabinet also approved New Zealand’s expected notifications and reservations, which included a list of 34 double tax agreements (DTAs) that New Zealand nominated to be covered by the MLI. T2017/1004; IR2017/260 explains why these 34 DTAs were chosen.

3\. Jurisdictions’ positions on the MLI are still subject to change. To allow New Zealand to respond to treaty partner’s changing positions, Cabinet authorised the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue to approve any changes to the notifications and reservations as a result of developments in other jurisdictions’ positions.

4\. Yesterday OECD advised that Papua New Guinea and the United Arab Emirates have joined the Ad Hoc Group on the MLI.

5\. Accordingly, we recommend that you approve adding New Zealand’s DTAs with these two countries to our list of nominated DTAs in New Zealand’s expected notifications and reservations.

6\. We do not yet know if these countries will list their DTAs with New Zealand. But by adding them to New Zealand’s list, it means that if they sign the MLI and nominate their DTA with New Zealand, our DTAs with these countries will be modified to contain the improved BEPS provisions.

7\. The final expected notifications and reservations must be provided to OECD no later than 26 May to allow processing before signature of the MLI on 7 June 2017. Changes can be made after signature, but this would be procedurally unusual. Therefore, we recommend that addition of the Papua New Guinea and United Arab Emirates DTAs is made in the final version submitted to OECD by 26 May 2017.

### Recommended action

We recommend that you agree that New Zealand adds our double tax agreements (DTAs) with Papua New Guinea and the United Arab Emirates to our list of nominated DTAs in New Zealand’s expected notifications and reservations to be provided by 26 May 2017.

### BEPS – summary of submissions on March 2017 discussion documents

* * *

### Executive summary

1\. This report summarises the main points made by submitters on the two BEPS discussion documents released in March 2017:

*   BEPS – _transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ (“transfer pricing and PE avoidance”); and
*   BEPS – _strengthening our interest limitation rules_ (“interest limitation”).

2\. We received 43 submissions on these discussion documents in total – 16 submissions on the transfer pricing and PE avoidance discussion document, and 27 submissions on the interest limitation discussion document. A full list of all the submitters, together with a brief description, is included in the appendix to this report.

3\. We have considered all the submissions in detail and we will report back to you with advice on these submissions next week. We will include recommendations that endeavour to meet the concerns raised by submitters to the greatest extent possible, while still achieving the desired policy objectives.

#### General reaction

4\. Some general comments provided by submitters were similar for both discussion documents.

*   Submitters acknowledged that it was important to address BEPS risks facing New Zealand and agreed in principle that change is needed to strengthen interest limitation, transfer pricing and PE rules.
*   Submitters argued that the proposals will have a negative impact on New Zealand’s attractiveness as an investment destination.
*   Submitters indicated that the application date for all new law changes should be sufficiently prospective to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs.
*   A number of submitters also argued that existing advance pricing agreements (APAs)[\[1\]](#footnote1)
     should be grandparented and allowed to run their course.

#### Main issues raised by submitters

5\. The main issues raised by submitters in relation to the specific proposals were:

*   **The interest rate cap proposal should not proceed**. Many submitters on the interest limitation discussion document argued that no specific rule for limiting interest rates on related-party debt was necessary given the proposed strengthening of the transfer pricing rules (in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_). The allowable interest rate on related-party loans is currently set using transfer pricing, and submitters argued that strengthening the transfer pricing rules would be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates on related-party loans.
*   **Deferred tax should be carved out from the proposed non-debt liability adjustment**. The interest limitation discussion document proposed a change to how allowable debt levels are calculated under our thin capitalisation rules. A near-universal comment from submitters was that deferred tax liabilities should be carved out from the proposed adjustment. Deferred tax is an accounting concept – accounting standards require that companies recognise deferred tax on their balance sheets in certain situations. In principle, a deferred tax liability is supposed to represent future tax payments that a taxpayer will be required to make; however, submitters argued that this is often not the case.
*   **The PE avoidance rule should be more narrowly targeted**. Many submitters considered that the proposed rule could widen the PE definition in substance rather than just prevent avoidance. They were also concerned that it could capture ordinary commercial arrangements and discourage foreign investment.
*   **The “time bar” for transfer pricing should remain at 4 years**. There was strong opposition to the proposal to extend the transfer pricing time bar to 7 years (in line with Australia’s 7 year time bar). The time bar limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position.

#### Next steps

6\. Officials are happy to discuss this report with you at your joint Ministers’ meeting on 19 June. We will report back next week with advice and recommendations on these submissions and the other issues raised by submitters.

### Background

7\. Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to the aggressive tax planning strategies used by some multinationals to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This outcome is achieved by exploiting gaps and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules to avoid tax. BEPS strategies distort investment decisions, allow multinationals to benefit from unintended competitive advantages over more compliant or domestic companies, and result in the loss of substantial corporate tax revenue. More fundamentally, the perceived unfairness resulting from BEPS jeopardises citizens’ trust in the integrity of the tax system as a whole.

8\. New Zealand’s tax system is already quite robust by international standards. However, there is room for improvement. As New Zealand is a strong supporter of the OECD’s BEPS work, many of our BEPS measures are based on the recommendations from the G20/OECD Action Plan Report which seek to counter large multinationals engaged in aggressive BEPS tax practices. In response to the OECD’s BEPS work, the New Zealand Government released a series of public consultation documents, including two discussion documents in March 2017:

*   BEPS – _transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ (“transfer pricing and PE avoidance”); and
*   BEPS – _strengthening our interest limitation rules_ (“interest limitation”).

9\. The Government received 43 submissions on these discussion documents in total – 16 submissions on the transfer pricing and PE avoidance discussion document, and 27 submissions on the interest limitation discussion document. A full list of all the submitters, together with a brief description, is included in the appendix to this report.

10\. Most of the submitters are tax advisors or represent businesses that could be negatively affected by the proposals. Therefore, the submissions are understandably critical of some of the measures. However, submitters have also provided constructive suggestions on how the proposals could be redesigned or better targeted in order to reduce unintended impacts such as uncertainty for investors or double taxation. We are confident we can refine the proposals to address many of the submitters’ concerns while ensuring the measures are just as effective at combatting BEPS.

11\. This report summarises the main issues raised by submitters. We will report back with advice and recommendations on these submissions and other issues next week.

### General issues raised by submitters

#### Submission: general support for addressing BEPS

12\. Submitters acknowledged that it was important to address BEPS risks facing New Zealand and agreed in principle that change is needed to strengthen interest limitation, transfer pricing and PE rules. However, submitters did not agree with many of the proposed changes put forward in the discussion documents. Only two submitters supported all of the proposed changes in both documents (Oxfam and NZ Council of Trade Unions).

#### Submission: wider economic concerns

13\. Many submitters argued that the proposals have the potential to significantly impact the flow of capital to New Zealand and the willingness of non-residents to establish business in New Zealand. Submitters argued that many of the proposals contained in the discussion documents could make New Zealand a less-attractive investment destination and, on this basis, should not be implemented (CTG, CA ANZ, Olivershaw, NFTC).

14\. Some submitters on the PE avoidance proposals argued that the proposals introduce complex and onerous rules which may incentivise foreign companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand (CTG, CA ANZ, NFTC).

#### Submission: application date

15\. The planned commencement date for these measures is income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. At the time the discussion documents were released, this commencement date was not publicly known.[\[2\]](#footnote2)
 However, many submitters anticipated the Government would seek an early commencement date and argued in their submissions that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these proposals to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary (PwC, CTG, EY, CA ANZ).

16\. Several submitters (including PwC and Powerco) submitted that the application date for these proposals should be no earlier than 1 April 2019.

17\. A number of submissions on the interest limitation discussion document also argued that transitional rules should be provided for existing investments for up to five years post enactment.

#### Submission: grandparenting APAs

18\. A taxpayer is able to apply for an advance pricing agreement (APA), which is essentially a binding ruling that confirms Inland Revenue agrees that the taxpayer’s planned transfer pricing positions are compliant with the transfer pricing rules for up to five years. A large number of submitters expressed concern that APAs would be invalidated when the new legislation comes into effect. These submitters suggested that all existing APAs affected by the proposals in these discussion documents should be preserved under transitional rules for the term of the APA.

#### Comment

19\. The majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand are compliant and the Government is committed to making sure New Zealand remains an attractive place for them to do business. However, there are some multinationals that deliberately attempt to circumvent New Zealand’s tax rules. These multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in the current rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms.

20\. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that foreign companies would remove their existing personnel from New Zealand as a result of the PE avoidance proposals, as most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. It is also very unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand.

21\. Cabinet has noted that the reforms are expected to commence from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on an expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date.

### Interest rate cap

#### Summary of proposed rule

22\. The interest limitation discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach for pricing cross-border related-party loans, and instead proposed two new pricing rules (one for when a company has a foreign parent and one when it does not):

*   An _interest rate cap_, which would apply when a New Zealand company has a foreign parent (e.g. it is a subsidiary of a multinational company). Under the interest rate cap, the allowable interest rate on related-party debt would be set with reference to the interest rate the parent company could borrow at.
*   A _modified transfer pricing rule_ when a New Zealand company has no foreign parent (e.g. it is owned by a group of non-residents acting together). Under the modified transfer pricing approach, the allowable interest rate on related-party debt would be determined using transfer pricing, but with a presumed set of conditions (including that the debt is senior unsecured debt issued on standard terms).

#### General reaction

23\. This proposal – in particular the _interest rate cap_ – was the focus of most submissions. Several submitters agreed that the rules for limiting the interest rate on related-party loans need strengthening, but only two submitters agreed with the proposed approach (Oxfam and NZCTU).

24\. The general view of submitters was that the proposed interest rate cap should not be adopted at all, or if it is adopted, that it should only be a safe harbour, meaning that an interest rate higher than that provided for under the cap would be allowed if it can be justified under transfer pricing.

25\. The proposal has also attracted positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts.[\[3\]](#footnote3)

26\. Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks – “transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates, so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules”.[\[4\]](#footnote4)

#### Submission: interest rate cap proposal should not proceed

27\. Submitters argued that the interest rate cap proposal was not necessary and should not proceed. They noted that the Government, in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_, proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally. Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates.

#### Submission: concerns with design and impact of interest rate cap proposal

28\. Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons, including that it:

*   is inconsistent with the arm’s length standard so would result in double taxation;
*   will increase compliance costs;
*   will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk; and
*   has no international precedent

#### Comment

29\. We agree that transfer pricing, with the modifications proposed in the discussion document _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ will limit the ability for taxpayers to use artificial or commercially irrational funding structures. However, we remain concerned that these rules would not be adequate to prevent taxpayers from choosing to borrow from related-parties using higher-priced forms of debt than they would typically choose when borrowing from third parties.

30\. We will report back with our advice and recommendations in relation to these submissions.

### Non-debt liability adjustment

#### Summary of proposed rule

31\. The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand (“deductible debt”). Currently, the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable).

32\. The interest limitation discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (i.e. its liabilities other than its interest-bearing debts). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities.

#### General reaction

33\. Several submitters (including CA ANZ, EY and KPMG) indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax).

34\. A number of other submitters (including CTG, PwC and several submissions representing the infrastructure industry) argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers’ thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold.

#### Submission: deferred tax should be carved out

35\. To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable profits and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer’s non-debt liabilities could include “deferred tax liabilities”, which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer’s assets could include “deferred tax assets” which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit.

36\. All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that, for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, these deferred tax liabilities should be ignored. Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer’s assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities).

37\. Submitters noted that Australia’s thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because:

*   often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future;
*   deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity; and
*   deferred tax balances can be volatile – taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them.

#### Comment

38\. We have considered these submissions carefully, including discussing them with the agency in charge of setting accounting standards in New Zealand (the External Reporting Board or XRB) and the Australian Treasury. Our report next week will provide you with advice and recommendations on this issue.

### PE avoidance

#### Summary of proposed rule

39\. Where a DTA applies, New Zealand is only able to tax a non-resident on its income from sales to New Zealand customers if the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. The discussion document proposed a rule to prevent non-residents from structuring their affairs to avoid having such a permanent establishment in New Zealand where one exists in substance.

#### General reaction

40\. Submitters were not strongly opposed to a new PE rule in principle, with two submitters supporting the proposal (Oxfam, NZCTU) and the remainder mostly accepting the need (or inevitability) for some form of PE avoidance rule. However, seven submitters considered that we should not adopt any PE avoidance rule at this stage. These submitters argued that:

*   The OECD’s Multilateral Instrument (MLI)[\[5\]](#footnote5)
     includes a widened definition of a PE. Any PE avoidance issues should be addressed under this. Alternately we should defer consideration of a PE avoidance rule until the impact of the OECD’s BEPS measures has been determined (EY, AmCham, DEG, CA ANZ).
*   The rule is unnecessary, as any current issues with PE avoidance can be addressed through our transfer pricing rules (NZLS, DEG, CA ANZ).
*   The rule will apply to non-abusive transactions, is outside the OECD’s BEPS initiatives and will erode taxpayer certainty (CTG, NFTC, Deloitte).

#### Threshold for the application of the new measures

41\. A majority of submitters (EY, NFTC, DEG, Deloitte, CTG CA ANZ, PwC, KPMG, Russell McVeagh) considered that the proposed PE avoidance test was too broad. They argued that it would widen the PE definition in substance rather than just prevent avoidance. They were also concerned that it could capture ordinary commercial arrangements and discourage foreign investment. Submitters suggested two options for narrowing the scope of the rule:

*   the PE avoidance rule could be targeted at abusive or artificial arrangements; or
*   New Zealand could adopt the wording of the OECD’s widened PE avoidance definition in the MLI.

#### Overriding DTAs

42\. A majority of submitters considered that our PE rule should not override our DTAs (CTG, KPMG, CA ANZ, NFTC, NZLS, EY, Russell McVeagh, DEG). This is because DTAs are important to international trade, and New Zealand exporters also need to rely on them. Submitters also considered that we should not depart from the OECD’s agreed BEPS measures, particularly where the country of the non-resident has declined to adopt the widened PE definition in the MLI.

#### Comment

43\. Our proposed PE avoidance rule is broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS initiatives and measures adopted by the UK and Australia.

44\. The OECD’s Commentary to the Model Tax Convention (the Commentary) states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between domestic anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. It also confirms that States are not obliged to grant the benefits of a DTA if the DTA has been abused (noting that this should not be lightly assumed). Accordingly, the proposed PE avoidance rule should not conflict with New Zealand’s DTAs. We also note that both the UK and Australian PE avoidance rules over-ride their DTAs.

45\. We will report back with advice and recommendations on these submissions.

### Transfer pricing

#### Summary of proposed rules

46\. Transfer pricing rules guard against multinationals using related-party payments to shift profits offshore by requiring these payments to be consistent with an arm’s length or market price that unrelated parties would agree to. Chapter 5 of the discussion document outlined a package of proposals to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules.

#### General reaction

47\. Three submitters (CTG, EY, KPMG) considered the transfer pricing proposals were unnecessary and argued that the existing transfer pricing rules are sufficient.

48\. Other submitters generally accepted that there was a need to update New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation so it aligned with the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines (which were developed to combat BEPS).

49\. However, as expected, there was strong opposition to the proposal to extend the time bar for transfer pricing adjustments to 7 years.

#### Extending the time bar to 7 years

50\. Inland Revenue currently has 4 years from the day that a taxpayer has filed an income tax return in which it can investigate and adjust the tax position taken by the taxpayer in their income tax return. This 4 year period is known as the time bar. The discussion document proposed that transfer pricing issues should have a longer time bar of 7 years (consistent with fact that Australia and Canada have 7-year time bars for transfer pricing).

51\. Most submissions on the discussion document opposed this proposal. The main arguments raised by submitters were:

*   A longer time bar increases uncertainty for taxpayers and does not promote efficiency in transfer pricing disputes (will delay timely resolution).
*   The discussion document argued that a longer time bar is needed because transfer pricing issues are complex and fact-specific, but submitters noted that this is also true of other areas of tax such as tax avoidance, the capital / revenue boundary and complex financial arrangements.
*   Most countries have the same time bar for transfer pricing and other tax issues, and in most cases this was less than 7 years.
*   If a transfer pricing dispute is resolved in favour of Inland Revenue, the taxpayer will be at risk of double tax in jurisdictions where the time bar has already passed.
*   Imposing a longer time bar is inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation goals of real-time review and helping taxpayers get it right from the start.
*   Inland Revenue should invest more resource into its transfer pricing team if the investigations are taking longer than 4 years.

#### Comment

52\. We will report back with further advice and recommendations on this and the other transfer pricing submissions.

### Next steps

53\. Officials are happy to discuss this report with you at your joint Ministers’ meeting on 19 June. We will report back with advice and recommendations on these submissions and other issues next week.

### Base erosion and profit shifting – overview of current reports

* * *

1\. This report accompanies three papers providing further updates on the development of policy proposals introduced in three Government discussion documents on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS):

*   _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ (released in September 2016);
*   _BEPS – Strengthening our interest limitation rules_ (released in March 2017); and
*   _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ (released in March 2017).

2\. We reported to you on 9 March 2017 with a summary of submissions received on the discussion document _Addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements_ (T2017/460, IR2017/133 refers). We also reported to you last week with a summary of submissions on the two March 2017 discussion documents (T2017/1630, IR2017/361 refers).

3\. This package of reports seeks policy decisions on a range of proposals relating to all three discussion documents, including a number of suggested refinements to address issues raised by submitters. The attached reports are:

*   BEPS – interest limitation submissions and policy decisions (T2017/1576, IR2017/325);
*   BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance submissions and policy decisions (T2017/1577, IR2017/330); and
*   BEPS – recommendations on addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements (T2017/1604, IR2017/353).

4\. These reports also seek your approval for officials to prepare a set of four papers seeking Cabinet’s agreement to policy decisions and to include the BEPS proposals in a tax bill later this year. Subject to your decisions and assuming you are comfortable with all the proposals, we anticipate the following timeline:

| Date | Milestone/action |
| --- | --- |
| Thursday 29 June | Joint Ministers’ meeting to discuss these reports and policy recommendations |
| Week commencing 10 July | Provide the following Cabinet papers and RISs to Ministers:<br><br>*   Cover paper with overview of BEPS package<br>*   Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance<br>*   Interest limitation<br>*   Hybrid mismatches |
| Thursday 20 July | Deadline for lodging Cabinet Papers in CabNet |
| Wednesday 26 July | EGI |
| Monday 31 July | Cabinet |

#### Further consultation

5\. We recommend that, following Cabinet decisions in July, further consultation is undertaken on outstanding policy issues and technical design details relating to the BEPS package. We will report back to you on that consultation and any further feedback we receive on the proposals.

6\. A number of submitters have also expressed interest in consultation on an exposure draft of the planned BEPS bill. We have signalled to submitters that an exposure draft could be provided on specific aspects of the proposals that are likely to be of most interest – for example, the permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule proposed in the discussion document _BEPS – Transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_.

7\. To stay on track with the planned commencement date of income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, the BEPS bill will need to be introduced and have its first reading by 14 December 2017. Due to this timing constraint, we are not proposing that submitters be consulted on an exposure draft of the entire bill. However, targeted drafting of specific sections where consultation will provide the most value is possible within this timeframe.

8\. In the attached reports on interest limitation, and transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance, we have focused on the major issues relevant to the policy decisions to be made by Cabinet in July. We have not addressed all submissions on the March 2017 discussion documents that relate to technical or operational detail. We will advise you on such submissions following detailed design and further consultation with submitters. The hybrids report seeks more detailed final policy decisions because it has already been subject to a second round of consultation.

#### Fiscal implications

9\. Some of the revenue for these proposals has already been included in Budget 2017 forecasts:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$ million – increase / (decrease)
| Vote Revenue | 2016/17 | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 and out years |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foreign hybrid entity double deductions | 0   | 0   | 25  | 50  | 50  | 50  | 50  |
| Other BEPS measures | 0   | 0   | 25  | 50  | 50  | 50  | 50  |
| **Total revenue effect** | 0   | 0   | 50  | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

10\. If our recommendations in these four reports are agreed to and adopted by the Government, then the forecasts could be adjusted further by these amounts:

| Vote Revenue | 2016/17 | 2017/18 | 2018/19 | 2019/20 | 2020/21 | 2021/22 | 2022/23 and out years |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |$ million – increase / (decrease)
| BEPS measures – transfer pricing, permanent establishments, and interest limitation | 0   | 0   | 45  | 90  | 90  | 90  | 90  |
| BEPS measures – hybrid instruments | 0   | 0   | 19  | 19  | 19  | 14  | 0   |
| **Total additional revenue effect** | 0   | 0   | 64  | 109 | 109 | 104 | 90  |

11\. The additional revenue from certain hybrid instruments is a result of agreeing to the OECD hybrids recommendation 1 proposal with the grandparenting approach for these instruments recommended in the attached paper on hybrids. This revenue is contingent on taxpayer behaviour after the implementation of the hybrid rules.

12\. The total would come to the maximum revenue forecast for new BEPS measures that we have previously advised ($190 million per year for out years) and exceed this revenue forecast for the first four years in which the BEPS measures will apply. We are recommending in the report BEPS – interest limitation submissions and policy decisions (T2017/1576, IR2017/325 refers) that we continue to consult on details of the thin capitalisation proposal. Depending on the outcome of this consultation, the revenue forecast could be $10 million per year lower.

#### Economic implications

13\. It is inevitable that the higher tax payments resulting from these measures will make New Zealand a less attractive investment location for multinationals engaged in BEPS arrangements. At the same time, these multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in our tax rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Furthermore, random reductions in tax, depending upon the opportunism of taxpayers, are likely to distort the allocation of investment into New Zealand. Given this, we believe implementing these measures remains in New Zealand’s best economic interests.

#### Administrative implications

14\. The changes proposed in the BEPS discussion documents and recommended in these reports are not expected to increase administrative costs or require any significant systems changes for Inland Revenue. This is because the reforms change the way some taxpayers self-assess their tax liabilities that they report to Inland Revenue.

15\. We note, however, that a common theme in submissions on all three discussion documents was that administration of the proposals would place a higher demand on Inland Revenue’s audit and investigation functions. Our view is that any required increase in Inland Revenue’s resourcing as a result of the BEPS package will be accommodated within existing baselines. We will report back if these administrative implications are expected to change.

#### Application date

16\. Cabinet has noted that the reforms are expected to commence from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on an expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date.

17\. At the time the March 2017 discussion documents were released, this application date was not publicly known. However, many submitters anticipated the Government would seek an early application date and argued in their submissions that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these proposals to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary. We expect to receive more feedback on the planned application date and other transitional issues in the next round of consultation.

#### Proactive release

18\. We recommend that the Government consider proactively releasing submissions on the BEPS discussions documents and the MLI officials’ issues paper, the BEPS Cabinet papers, and policy reports (including the pre-Budget 2017 Cabinet paper and policy report (T2017/949, IR2017/237)). This could be done at the time of announcements Ministers may want to make in relation to the package.

### BEPS – interest limitation submissions and policy decisions

* * *

### Executive summary

1\. In March this year the Government released the discussion document _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_. This report advises on the main issues relevant to the policy decisions to be made by Cabinet in July. Following this decision, we will design the detail of the proposals, on which we propose further consultation.

2\. The use of debt is one of the simplest ways of shifting profits out of New Zealand. Robust rules limiting the use of debt (and limiting interest payments on that debt) are therefore important base protection measures. Accordingly, the discussion document proposed two key changes to these rules:

*   a new method for limiting the deductible interest rate on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower (referred to as the interest rate cap), which we estimated would increase tax revenues by $40 million per year; and
*   a change to how allowable debt levels are calculated under our thin capitalisation rules (referred to as an adjustment for non-debt liabilities), which we estimated would increase tax revenues by $50 million per year.

3\. We received 27 submissions on the proposals. A full list of submitters is included in the appendix to this report. Most submitters were stakeholder groups, tax advisors, and foreign-owned firms that would be affected by the proposals. In general, submitters acknowledged the need to respond to BEPS concerns. However, many submitters did not support the specific proposals put forward.

4\. In summary, we are recommending several modifications to the original proposals put forward. We estimate these modifications will not affect the revenue estimate for the proposals (which was $90 million per annum from the 2018/19 year). However, as discussed below, we are proposing to consult further on the details of one of the proposals (to exclude deferred tax from the non-debt liability adjustment), the outcome of which could have a fiscal consequence. If deferred tax were to be entirely omitted from the proposal, the revenue forecast would reduce by $10 million per year.

#### Interest rate cap

5\. The discussion document proposed replacing transfer pricing rules with a rule to cap the interest rate deduction allowed on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower (“inbound related-party loans”) based on the credit rating of the parent company - with a one-notch reduction for the New Zealand subsidiary. We viewed this interest rate cap proposal as a straight-forward, simple and non-manipulable way of pricing related-party debt. We considered that the cap was largely consistent with an arm’s length approach under transfer pricing principles – albeit we accept that this would not be true in every case.

6\. As a starting point, many submitters argued that no specific rule for limiting interest rates on related-party debt was necessary. Submitters noted that the Government has proposed to strengthen those rules generally (in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_). They thought that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates on related-party loans.

7\. Submitters were concerned that the rule was novel and untested. They were concerned that New Zealand would stand out on its own and that this would deter FDI.

8\. Another concern raised by submitters is that the cap would frequently result in double taxation because the foreign revenue authority would require a higher return on the debt and impose tax on that basis. (As explained in the body of our report, our view is that it is unlikely that our treaty partners will challenge this approach under our treaties.)

9\. Some submissions highlighted the consequences of adopting a blunt rule in the nature of the cap. These include concerns that:

*   the cap is not a good proxy for an arm’s length interest rate in some situations and so could result in double taxation;
*   the cap would deny deductions even when the amount of debt in the subsidiary was low;
*   the cap may increase compliance costs, for example, where a foreign parent has no credit rating (about half of New Zealand’s largest foreign-owned businesses are owned by companies with no credit rating);
*   the proposal involves different rules for firms owned by a group of non-residents rather than a single foreign parent, which creates perceptions of unfairness.

10\. Following consultation and further analysis, we consider that if the Government pursued the interest rate cap, adjustments would be needed to the original proposal which would make it more complex. For example, a different or modified rule may need to be applied to firms with low levels of debt. The result of these adjustments would be that different rules would apply to taxpayers in different situations (more so than originally proposed). Such differences create perceptions of unfairness, and give rise to boundaries that can be difficult to formulate, administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient – especially as taxpayers try to arrange their circumstances to fall within certain boundaries.

11\. The difficulty is, however, that simply relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes. It is clear that the international consensus (as reflected in the OECD recommendation for countries to adopt an arbitrary formulaic approach (EBITDA)) is to move away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit the interest rates on related-party debt. Commentators have said that ordinary transfer pricing is unsuited to pricing related-party financing transactions. Professor Richard Vann from Sydney University has said “transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates”.

12\. Accordingly, we recommend that the discussion document proposal be replaced by a _restricted transfer pricing_ methodology. We consider this methodology is a better way of achieving the interest rate cap’s objective and would have the same revenue impact. Like the cap, this approach will generally result in the interest rate on the related-party debt being in line with that facing the foreign parent. This is because, under the rule, debt will generally be required to be priced on the basis that it is “vanilla” (that is, without any features or terms that could push up the interest rate) and on the basis that the borrower could be expected to be supported by its foreign parent in the event of a default.

13\. Implementing these restrictions in legislation will address the problem that the transfer pricing guidelines, in so far as they apply to related party debt, are open to interpretation, subjective, and fact intensive in their application.

14\. We would recommend that the interest rate cap as initially proposed be available as a safe harbour. This could be provided administratively. A related-party loan with an interest rate consistent with the interest rate cap would automatically be considered acceptable. We believe this would be an attractive option to many companies as it is both simple and provides certainty.

15\. We also intend that access to the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) under our Double Tax Agreements be available to taxpayers who consider that taxation under the new rule is inconsistent with the relevant treaty. This will address submitters’ concerns about double taxation. We do not, however, expect many MAP cases will eventuate because of the shift in the international consensus on what is acceptable in relation to the pricing of related party debt.

16\. We note that the Australian Taxation Office recently released draft guidelines, which are designed to incentivise Australian subsidiaries to structure their related-party loans into ordinary “vanilla” loans at interest rates similar to that facing their foreign parents. This will produce a similar result to the restricted transfer pricing approach we are recommending. However, the Australian guidelines are administrative measures – taxpayers are able to dispute them if they so choose.

#### Non-debt liability adjustment

17\. The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of debt a taxpayer can claim interest deductions on in New Zealand (“deductible debt”). Currently, the maximum amount of deductible debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets as reported in its financial accounts (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable).

18\. The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest bearing debts). Some common examples of non-debt liabilities are accounts payable, reserves and provisions, and deferred tax liabilities.

19\. This proposal was accepted by some submitters but opposed by others, who argued for example that the proposal amounts to a substantial reduction in the amount of deductible debt allowable under the thin capitalisation rules. Overall, this proposal was much less contentious than the interest rate cap.

20\. We consider this non-debt liability proposal should proceed. This is because the core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules are better served with the non-debt liability adjustment. For example, one of the objectives of the rules is to ensure that a taxpayer is limited to a commercial level of debt. A third-party lender, when assessing the credit worthiness of a borrower, would take into account its non-debt liabilities. Moreover, the current treatment of non-debt liabilities means companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company. We note that Australia requires this same adjustment for non-debt liabilities.

21\. A near-universal comment from submitters was that certain non-debt liabilities – most significantly _deferred tax liabilities_ – should be carved out from the proposed non-debt liability adjustment. Deferred tax is an accounting concept – accounting standards require that companies recognise deferred tax on their balance sheets in certain situations. In principle, a deferred tax liability is supposed to represent future tax payments that a taxpayer will be required to make. Submitters argued that this is often not the case – that deferred tax liabilities frequently are technical accounting entries and do not reflect future tax obligations. Submitters also pointed to the rules in Australia, which do include a carve-out for deferred tax liabilities and assets.

22\. While many deferred tax liabilities represent a genuine requirement that tax on current accounting profits will be payable in the future, given the concerns raised by submitters, we recommend that we consult further on this matter. We could explore, for example, whether particular deferred tax liabilities that will not result in future tax payments could be identified and carved out from any adjustment. Note that the deferred tax balances of some taxpayers are significant – if a deferred tax exemption were provided, we estimate that this would reduce the fiscal impact of the non-debt liability proposal by up to $10m per year (from $50 million per year to $40 million per year).

#### Other proposals

23\. Finally, the discussion document proposed several minor changes to the thin capitalisation rules. One of these proposals, which was generally welcomed, is a special rule for project finance. This proposal will allow full interest on third party debt to be deductible even if the debt levels exceed the thin capitalisation limit if the debt is non-recourse with interest funded solely from project income. This will allow a wider group of investors to participate in public-private partnerships without interest expense denial than has been possible previously. However, some technical issues have been raised which we will consult further on.

24\. The other minor changes to the rules are summarised in the table below. Some of these were supported by submitters while others were opposed. Where they were opposed, we are recommending changes to the proposals that, in general, will address submitters’ concerns.

### Background

25\. In March the Government released the discussion document _BEPS – strengthening our interest limitation rules_. This report provides advice on the 27 submissions the Government received on the discussion document. It also seeks policy decisions on the proposals, including a number of suggested modifications to address issues raised by submitters.

26\. We have met with many of the submitters (CA ANZ, CTG, PwC, KPMG, EY, NZBA) to discuss their submissions and explain the proposals. A full list of submitters is included in the appendix to this report.

27\. This report advises on the important issues relevant to the policy decisions to be made by Cabinet in July. Following this decision, we will design the detail of the proposals, on which there will be further consultation.

### General comments on the proposals

#### Submitters support interest limitation but not the particular proposals

28\. Submitters acknowledged that it was important to address BEPS risks facing New Zealand, and that part of this would involve strengthening New Zealand’s rules for limiting interest deductions for firms with cross-border related-party debt. However, as detailed below, submitters did not agree with many of the proposed changes put forward in the discussion document.

#### Submission: wider economic concerns

29\. Many submitters argued that the proposals have the potential to significantly impact the flow of capital to New Zealand and the willingness of non-residents to establish business in New Zealand. Submitters argued that many of the proposals contained in the discussion document could make New Zealand a less-attractive investment destination and, on this basis, should not be implemented (CTG, CA ANZ, Olivershaw).

##### Response

30\. We disagree with submitters on this matter. The majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand are compliant and the Government is committed to making sure New Zealand remains an attractive place for them to do business. However, there are some multinationals that deliberately attempt to circumvent New Zealand’s tax rules. These multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in the current rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms.

#### Submitters do not support an EBITDA-based approach for New Zealand

31\. Most submitters were strongly against adopting an EBITDA-based rule as recommended by the OECD. Only one submitter (SKYCITY) discussed the merits of New Zealand adopting this approach – namely that it is advantageous for firms with assets that generate revenue but that cannot be recognised under accounting standards (such as casino licenses).

32\. A key reason the other submitters did not support an EBITDA-based approach is that earnings can be volatile. A taxpayer that has interest deductions within the allowable limits one year could breach those limits the next if its revenues fall – even if that is because of factors outside their control (such as poor global economic conditions). Other reasons given by submitters were that:

*   some industries have particularly volatile earnings, and these would be especially impacted by an EBITDA-based rule;
*   such a rule may disadvantage groups that are heavily capitalised and have tangible fixed assets with long depreciation periods; and
*   such a rule is not appropriate for commodity-based economies such as New Zealand.

33\. We find the first of these arguments (volatility of earnings) particularly compelling. Provided a reasonable rule for limiting the interest rates of related-party debt can be developed (as discussed below), we do not see merit in adopting an EBITDA-based rule.

34\. We note that Craig Elliffe, a professor of tax at Auckland University, reaches this same conclusion in a forthcoming academic article. He writes “… contrary to the strong recommendation in the OECD’s report, there is no compelling case for change to an earnings-based EBITDA method from an assets-based regime”.[\[1\]](#footnote1)

#### Concerns about horizontal inequity

35\. Some submitters raised concerns that the proposals will result in horizontal inequity between businesses owned or controlled by offshore investors as compared with those in New Zealand. This is because the proposals predominately affect foreign-owned businesses.

36\. We do not share these concerns. Foreign-owned businesses are able to reduce their New Zealand tax payments through the use of interest deductions in a way that domestically-owned firms cannot. Indeed, we consider the proposals will increase horizontal equity between foreign-owned and domestically-owned businesses.

#### Application to outbound investment

37\. While the primary focus of the BEPS reforms is on foreign-owned businesses, similar base protection considerations can arise where New Zealand-owned businesses have offshore operations. For this reason, New Zealand’s international base protection measures (such as the thin capitalisation rules and the transfer pricing rules) apply to both foreign-owned and domestically-owned businesses.

38\. Consistent with this approach, the discussion document proposed that any changes ultimately adopted would apply to both foreign- and domestically-owned businesses.[\[2\]](#footnote2)

39\. Three submitters disagreed with this approach, suggesting instead that the proposals should initially apply only to foreign-owned businesses. In particular, they were concerned that New Zealand-owned businesses with foreign-operations could be negatively impacted by the non-debt liabilities proposal.

40\. We consider that the proposals should apply to outbound investment as originally proposed – as above, base protection concerns can arise with domestically-owned firms.

41\. However, one submitter in particular (SKYCITY) has raised concerns with how the thin capitalisation rules operate for domestically-owned firms – in particular, that fact the rules do not take into account the value of some of its assets when determining its allowable level of debt causes them particular problems. We think this issue should be a subject of further consultation.

#### Submission: application date

42\. The planned application date for these measures is income years starting on or after 1 July 2018. At the time the discussion documents were released, this application date was not publicly known.[\[3\]](#footnote3)
 However, many submitters anticipated the Government would seek an early application date and argued in their submissions that there needs to be sufficient lead-in time for these proposals to allow taxpayers to restructure their affairs if necessary (PwC, CTG, EY, CA ANZ).

43\. Several submitters (including PwC and Powerco) submitted that the application date for these proposals should be no earlier than 1 April 2019.

44\. A number of submissions on the interest limitation discussion document also argued that transitional rules should be provided for existing investments for up to five years post enactment.

##### Response

45\. Cabinet has noted that the reforms are expected to commence from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on an expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date.

46\. We note that, in relation to the changes to the thin capitalisation rules (such as the non-debt liability adjustment), taxpayers would have until 30 June 2019 to adjust their balance sheets as taxpayers have the ability to determine their thin capitalisation ratio based on their year-end asset and liability values.

#### Submission: grandparenting APAs

47\. A taxpayer is able to apply for an advance pricing agreement (APA), which is essentially a binding ruling that confirms Inland Revenue agrees that the taxpayer’s planned transfer pricing positions are compliant with the transfer pricing rules for up to five years. A large number of submitters expressed concern that APAs would be invalidated when the new legislation comes into effect. These submitters suggested that all existing APAs affected by the proposals in the discussion document should be preserved under transitional rules for the term of the APA.

48\. Without grandparenting of existing APAs, taxpayers may be disincentivised to engage with Inland Revenue in the interim as the high cost of obtaining an APA proportionally increases if the length of the APA is shortened.

##### Response

49\. We agree that APAs existing prior to the application date of these proposals should be grandparented. There is a high cost and a rigorous process involved in obtaining an APA and it would be unfair if the new proposals rescinded APAs issued before the 1 July 2018 application date – especially considering APAs only run for five years.

### Submissions on the proposed interest rate cap

#### Summary of proposed rule

50\. When borrowing from a third-party, commercial pressure will drive the borrower to obtain a low interest rate. The same pressure does not necessarily exist in a related-party context. A rule to constrain the interest rate of such debt is necessary. Transfer pricing rules provide the current constraint on interest rates.

51\. The discussion document proposed moving away from a transfer pricing approach, and instead limiting the interest rates on related-party loans from a non-resident to a New Zealand borrower (“inbound related-party loans”) – one for when a company has a foreign parent and one where it does not:

*   An _interest rate cap_, which would apply when a New Zealand company has a foreign parent (for example, it is a subsidiary of a multinational company). Under the interest rate cap, the allowable interest rate on related-party debt would be set with reference to the interest rate the parent company could borrow at.
*   A _restricted transfer pricing rule_ when a New Zealand company has no foreign parent (for example, it is owned by a group of non-residents acting together). Under the modified transfer pricing approach, the allowable interest rate on related-party debt would be determined using transfer pricing, but with a presumed set of conditions (including that the debt is senior unsecured debt issued on standard terms).

52\. The purpose of these proposed rules was to ensure that the interest rate on related-party debt is roughly in line with what the borrower would actually agree to if they were borrowing from a third party.

#### General reaction

53\. This proposal – in particular the _interest rate cap_ – was the focus of most submissions. Several submitters agreed that the rules for limiting the interest rate on related-party loans need strengthening, but only two submitters agreed with the proposed approach (Oxfam and the CTU).

54\. The general view of submitters was that the proposed interest rate cap should not be adopted at all, or if it is adopted, that it should only be a safe harbour, meaning that an interest rate higher than that provided for under the cap would be allowed if it can be justified under transfer pricing.

55\. The proposal has also attracted positive comments from knowledgeable parties that did not put in a formal submission. Michael Littlewood, a professor of tax at Auckland University, has said that the Government is right to seek to limit interest rates on related-party debts.[\[4\]](#footnote4)

56\. Richard Vann, a professor of tax at the University of Sydney, has made similar remarks – “transfer pricing has not proved up to the task of dealing with interest rates, so it is necessary to come up with clearer and simpler rules”.[\[5\]](#footnote5)

#### Submission: transfer pricing changes should be sufficient

57\. A recurring theme in the submissions is that the Government, in the discussion document _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_, proposed to strengthen the transfer pricing rules generally. Submitters wrote that these strengthened rules should be sufficient to address any concerns about interest rates.

##### Response

58\. Relying on transfer pricing, as suggested by submitters, will not achieve the desired policy outcomes.

59\. The international consensus is moving away from using ordinary transfer pricing to limit interest expenses in relation to related-party debt. Concerns over highly-priced related-party debt were part of what was behind the OECD’s recommended interest limitation rule based on EBITDA. Interest denial could result under an EBITDA rule even if the interest expense is appropriate as determined by the arm’s length standard.

60\. The detail of the transfer pricing rules are “soft law”. They are contained in the OECD transfer pricing guidelines to support the application of tax treaties. Most countries rely on them to solve transfer pricing issues even in the absence of a treaty. The transfer pricing guidelines take the form of guidance rather than set rules. We consider that, once amended as proposed in the _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ discussion document, the transfer pricing rules will work well for non-debt items. However, because of the significant BEPS risks associated with related-party interest payments, we consider that the rule for such payments needs to be stronger, less subjective, and less open to interpretation.” We note, for example, the Australian Taxation Office has stated that the recent Chevron case in Australia had cost them $10 million in external experts (not taking into account the cost of their own staff) even though it involved related-party interest payments that were, in our view, plainly excessive.[\[6\]](#footnote6)

61\. In addition, transfer pricing does not adequately take account of the fact that related-party debt financing is fundamentally different to third-party debt financing. For example, subordinated debt[\[7\]](#footnote7)
 is less likely to be repaid compared to senior debt, and so carries a higher interest rate. This is appropriate in a third-party context: the higher interest rate compensates for the higher risk. However, in a related-party context, debt and equity are highly substitutable. The riskiness of a parent’s investment in a subsidiary does not change whether it invests through equity (which would generate no deduction) or debt. We do not consider that related-party debt being subordinate to other debt should justify a higher interest rate.

#### Submission: various concerns with interest rate cap

62\. Submitters expressed concern about the proposed interest rate cap for a number of reasons, including that it:

*   is inconsistent with the arm’s length standard so would result in double taxation
*   will increase compliance costs
*   will apply to firms with a low BEPS risk
*   has no international precedent.

##### Inconsistency with arm’s length standard

63\. Many submitters argued that the proposal is not consistent with the arm’s length standard (the approach that underpins how countries apply the transfer pricing rules). They argued that it will result in double taxation: the lender jurisdiction will price the loan under traditional transfer pricing, which will produce a higher interest rate than what would be allowable under the rate cap. For example, suppose for a loan between Canada and New Zealand, the Canadian Revenue Authority expects the loan to produce interest income at 7% but the proposed cap would allow deductions only of 5%. In this example, double taxation of the 2% difference would result.

64\. As a more technical matter, submitters were concerned that if double taxation did arise, they would be denied the treaty resolution process if the interest rate cap was incorporated in the thin capitalisation regime rather than the transfer pricing rules.

65\. Supporting the double taxation argument, submitters wrote that the New Zealand subsidiary of a multinational will generally have a higher credit risk than the parent. A traditional transfer pricing exercise would therefore result in a higher interest rate. Similarly, submitters saw the proposal as implicitly assuming that the New Zealand subsidiary would have the same credit risk as its foreign parent, and stated that this is not the case and does not represent commercial reality.

66\. More generally, submitters were concerned that the interest rate cap would be inconsistent with our Double Tax Agreement (DTA) obligations. DTAs require arrangements (such as a loan) between a New Zealand company and a treaty-partner company to be treated for tax purposes as if it were entered into on arm’s length terms – something submitters argued the cap would not do, since they submitted it would allow deductions for less than an arm’s length amount of interest.

##### Compliance costs

67\. Many submitters indicated that the proposed interest rate cap would increase compliance costs, even for firms with low gearing levels. They argued that the foreign jurisdiction in a cross-border loan transaction will still require a transfer pricing analysis of the loan for their own purposes (to ensure the interest rate on the loan is not too low), even if the same transaction was also priced using the interest rate cap in New Zealand.

68\. Some submitters also wrote that the cap would be harder to apply when the foreign parent does not have a credit rating,[\[8\]](#footnote8)
 as a credit scoring exercise for the foreign parent would have to be carried out (in contrast to when the parent had a credit rating – where the credit rating could simply be used).

##### Rule applies to firms at low risk of BEPS

69\. Submitters were concerned that the interest rate cap would apply even if a firm had a very low level of debt. Submitters argued that this was inappropriate for two reasons:

*   If a firm is concerned about the application of the interest rate cap (for example because of double taxation), there is no action the firm can take other than completely eliminating all related-party debt. Submitters contrasted this with the EBITDA rule as proposed by the OECD, which can also result in double taxation but firms are able to reduce the risk of this by reducing the amount of debt they hold.
*   Firms with low debt levels, and therefore presenting a low risk of profit shifting using interest, could nevertheless suffer interest denial under the proposal (or alternatively incur costs in restructuring any related-party lending to ensure interest denial does not arise).

##### Rule has no international precedent

70\. Some submitters were concerned that the proposed cap is novel and would not be well understood by foreign jurisdictions. Submitters argued that the proposed rules are not a co-operative approach to international tax policy and will be inconsistent with the OECD and all other countries.

##### Response

71\. We do not agree with all the concerns raised but there were some valid issues to consider. Taking all the submissions, consultation, and subsequent analysis into account, we now recommend that the original proposal be replaced with a restricted transfer pricing approach. This alternative will still use, as a key component in the analysis, the cost of funds of the foreign parent; however, it will incorporate some limited flexibility, which we consider will address many of submitters’ concerns. This alternative approach is discussed more below – following our analysis of key submissions which are still relevant to this alternative approach.

72\. We do not agree with the argument that the interest rate cap is systematically inconsistent with the arm’s length standard. On the contrary, we consider the cap will generally be consistent with the standard because of the transfer pricing concept of “implicit parental support”. “Implicit parental support” is the notion that a foreign parent will stand behind a New Zealand subsidiary in the event of a default. That is, multinational groups generally do not let their local subsidiaries go under. “Implicit parental support” is a significant factor in transfer pricing analysis because it hypothesises that, as a commercial matter, it would affect what rate a third party lender would charge the New Zealand subsidiary and what that subsidiary would be prepared to pay. Accordingly, the credit rating of the foreign parent is a strong element in determining the credit rating of the New Zealand subsidiary.

73\. Inland Revenue administers transfer pricing having regard to the concept of implicit parental support but some taxpayers do dispute it. Submissions on this were mixed. At one end of the spectrum, CTG said “An assumption of implicit parental support is not valid. A rational commercial lender would never rely on implicit support…” In general, the other submitters agreed that implicit support was a factor to be taken into account in applying the arm’s length test. However, views varied on how important a factor it is.

74\. We acknowledge that there would be cases when the interest rate cap would not produce an arm’s length interest rate because, for instance, the New Zealand subsidiary is in a completely different line of business from the rest of the multinational group and has a different risk profile. Nevertheless, we do not accept that in these cases the interest rate cap would frequently result in double taxation. This is partly because the cap is not arbitrary (unlike EBITDA). Moreover, in our view, the shift in the international consensus makes it less clear that our treaty partners (especially Australia, given their guidance discussed below) would dispute the result of the cap under a treaty.

75\. We agree that, as originally proposed, the interest rate cap would have produced some arguably inappropriate results. In particular, we agree with submitters’ concerns that the cap would have applied regardless of a taxpayer’s debt level in New Zealand. Yet if a firm has low levels of debt in New Zealand, it is unlikely that the structure of their loans (including their interest rates) has been driven by tax. Were the cap to proceed, we would recommend that it would apply more generously to taxpayers with lower debt levels.

76\. We also acknowledge that applying the cap for New Zealand subsidiaries with foreign parents that do not have credit ratings might not be straight forward. Where the foreign parent has a credit rating, the allowable interest rate under the cap would be derived from that rating. However, where the parent has no credit rating, the credit worthiness of the parent would first have to be determined by a third party expert before the rate allowed by the cap could be calculated. While the advice we have is that this is not a difficult exercise in the scheme of things, it does result in more compliance costs for some taxpayers compared to others and may give rise to integrity issues.

77\. Finally, we note that 16 of foreign-owned firms covered by Inland Revenue’s International Questionnaire[\[9\]](#footnote9)
 were owned by consortiums of non-residents (and therefore have no identifiable foreign parent). Because there is no identifiable parent, the interest rate cap cannot apply to these businesses. The discussion document proposal was to apply a restricted transfer pricing approach to determine the rate on their shareholder debt funding. But we acknowledge the argument that having two sets of rules (a cap and a restricted transfer pricing approach) is a sub-optimal feature of the original proposal given the problem of excessive interest rates can arise regardless of whether there is a foreign parent.

78\. Overall, if the Government were to pursue the interest rate cap proposal, we would recommend some adjustments which would add significant complexity. For instance, as above we would recommend adjusting its application for New Zealand subsidiaries with low levels of debt. This would mean that the cap applied differently to taxpayers depending on their circumstances. These differences create perceptions of unfairness. In addition, boundaries can be difficult to administer and comply with. At the margins they may give rise to behaviours that are inefficient – especially as taxpayers try to arrange matters so that they fall within certain boundaries.

##### Modified approach

79\. We recommend that the discussion document proposal – whereby the foreign parent’s credit rating is the _sole_ determining factor of the New Zealand interest rate for related party debt, be replaced by a _restricted transfer pricing_ methodology. Like the cap, this approach involves a strong presumption that the interest rate on the related-party debt would be in line with that facing the foreign parent. However, unlike the cap, a taxpayer would be able to deviate from this if they can show that it would be appropriate.[\[10\]](#footnote10)
 In addition, all the circumstances, terms and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer (or its foreign parent) can demonstrate that they have third party debt that features those terms or conditions.

80\. We consider that this approach would, in general, achieve the same result as the interest rate cap but expect that it would be more acceptable to submitters. This is because it would only impact firms that do not have “vanilla” related-party debt. It also provides a limited amount of flexibility by allowing additional factors to be taken into account in addition to the foreign parent’s credit rating when determining an appropriate interest rate in legitimate cases. This approach also has the advantage that it would apply consistently across taxpayers to the greatest extent possible.

81\. Under this restricted transfer pricing approach, inbound related-party loans would be priced following the standard transfer pricing methodology. However, it would contain two additional elements to clarify that:

*   There is strong presumption that the New Zealand subsidiary would be supported by its foreign parent in the event of default;
*   All circumstances, terms, and conditions that could result in an excessive interest rate will be required to be ignored – unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that they have third-party debt featuring those terms and conditions. The types of modifications to the terms, conditions and surrounding circumstances we would seek to make under this approach are:
    *   That the loan has no exotic terms that are generally not seen with third-party lending[\[11\]](#footnote11)
        
    *   That the loan is not subordinated
    *   That the loan duration is not excessive
    *   That the debt level of the borrower is not excessive.

82\. The combined effect of these additional elements is that the interest rate on related-party debt will generally be in line with the interest rate facing the New Zealand borrower’s foreign parent.

83\. If a taxpayer is able to demonstrate that it (or its parent) has substantial third-party loans with a particular feature, then that feature will not be required to be completely ignored. Instead, that feature will be an allowable factor in the pricing of the loan to the extent the taxpayer’s third-party debt has that feature.

84\. For example under this rule, an inbound related-party loan would generally be priced for tax purposes on the basis that it is not subordinated. However, if a taxpayer actually issues subordinated debt to third parties, then some amount of its related-party debt could also be priced as if it were subordinated. Similarly, a loan would generally be priced for tax as if its duration were not excessive, but if the taxpayer has third-party debt with a very long duration, its related-party debt could be priced as if it had a similarly long duration.

85\. We consider that this approach would be effective in achieving the overarching objective of this project – which is to ensure that interest rates on related-party debt are broadly similar to the interest rates that the borrower would actually agree to with third-party debt. The rule requires related-party debt to be priced as if it is an ordinary senior loan; however, if taxpayers can demonstrate that they raise debt from third-parties on other terms which result in higher interest rates, this can be taken into account.

86\. We recommend that you agree in principle to the adoption of this restricted transfer pricing approach to determining the interest rate for related-party cross border loans. Its precise detail (for example, the wording of the required modifications, and what constitutes “excessive”) would then be considered as part of further consultation.

87\. This approach takes account of more factors than the interest rate cap, which focused solely on the foreign parent’s cost of funds. However, this means the rule may be more costly for taxpayers to apply than the cap (particularly for subsidiaries of large multinationals that have credit ratings).

88\. We recommend that the interest rate cap as initially proposed be available as a safe harbour. We believe this would be an attractive option to many companies as it is both simple and provides certainty.

89\. This safe harbour could be provided either legislatively or administratively. We consider it likely that an administrative safe harbour is the best approach as it provides more flexibility. Nevertheless, we consider that would be a useful matter to consult on further.

90\. We note that this rule would still apply in place of our standard transfer pricing rules. It could therefore be considered inconsistent with the arm’s length principle, much like the interest rate cap. However, unlike the cap as originally proposed, we note that:

*   if a taxpayer with a conservative level of debt borrows from its parent with a “vanilla” loan, there is no difference between this restricted transfer pricing approach and standard transfer pricing.
*   lenders in countries that have a double tax agreement with New Zealand will be able to use the Mutual Agreement Procedure to alleviate any double taxation that may result because of this rule; however, as above, we do not consider this situation likely.

##### Australian guidelines

91\. Since the release of the discussion document the Australian Tax Office released draft guidelines for the interest rates of cross-border related-party loans.[\[12\]](#footnote12)
 These guidelines are designed to encourage Australian subsidiaries of multinational companies to restructure their related-party loans into ordinary “vanilla” loans. Overall, just like the restricted transfer pricing rule above, the guidelines have a clear expectation that the interest rate on related-party loans should be in line with the foreign parent’s cost of funds:

> “Generally, the ATO expects any pricing of a related-party debt to be in line with the commercial incentive of achieving the lowest possible ‘all-in’ cost to the borrower. The ATO expects, in most cases, the cost of the financing to align with the costs that could be achieved, on an arm’s length basis, by the parent of the global group to which the borrower and lender both belong.”

92\. However, unlike what we have recommended, the Australian guidelines are administrative measures – taxpayers are able to dispute them if they so choose. Nevertheless, we think it appropriate to proceed with a law change as we are recommending. Given the manipulability of the general transfer pricing rules, we consider more robust measures are necessary to ensure related-party debt is appropriately priced.

#### Application of rule to banks

93\. The discussion document did not propose exempting any particular industries from the interest rate cap.

##### Submissions

94\. Following a discussion with the New Zealand Bankers Association (NZBA), we received submissions from NZBA and most of the large banks. These submitters argued that New Zealand banking groups should be excluded from the interest rate cap. The main arguments contained in these submissions are:

*   Banks are subject to prudential regulation in both New Zealand (RBNZ) and Australia (APRA), which requires related-party loans to be priced on arms-length terms. These regulations also put restrictions on the type of debt that can be issued and the permitted level of support the Australian banks can provide to their New Zealand subsidiaries.
*   Unlike most foreign-owned companies operating here, New Zealand’s foreign-owned banks issue large amounts of third party debt. This makes transfer pricing exercises more straight-forward as there are clear comparable interest rates.
*   Because banks are financial intermediaries (that is, in the business of borrowing from capital markets and then lending out that money), they will be most affected of all firms by a rule that limits the allowable interest rates on related-party debts.

##### Response

95\. We agree that banks would have been disproportionately impacted by the interest rate cap as originally recommended. This is because banks, more than most businesses, rely on debt to fund their businesses, and because they regularly issue non-standard types of debt to third parties (such as debt that converts to equity in certain events). In addition, unlike most foreign-owned companies operating in New Zealand, New Zealand’s foreign-owned banks regularly borrow significant amounts from third-parties. This means, when pricing a related-party loan between a New Zealand bank and its foreign parent, there are generally third-party comparables that can be used to ensure the interest rate on the related-party loan is not excessive.

96\. We would have therefore recommended that registered banks be carved out from the interest rate cap. However, it is less clear that a carve-out from the approach we now recommend – the restricted transfer pricing approach – would be necessary. Under this method non-standard terms on related-party debt (such as convertibility into equity) would be allowable if the taxpayer can demonstrate that it (or its foreign parent) issues debt with those non-standard features. We consider that this is likely to be the case with the banks, as they (and their Australian parents) do regularly issue third-party debt with non-standard terms, for example.

97\. Nevertheless, to ensure this rule would have no unintended consequences, we consider that the issue of whether banks should be subject to the restricted transfer pricing approach should be considered as part of the further consultation. We note that the original revenue forecast of $40m per year from the interest rate cap did not take into account any impact it might have on the banks; whether or not the restricted transfer pricing rule applies to them will have no impact on this revenue forecast.

### Submissions on the treatment of non-debt liabilities

#### Summary of the proposal

98\. The thin capitalisation rules limit the amount of deductible debt a taxpayer can have in New Zealand. Currently, the maximum amount of debt is set with reference to the value of the taxpayer’s assets (generally, debt up to 60 percent of the taxpayer’s assets is allowable).

99\. The discussion document proposed changing this, so that a taxpayer’s maximum debt level is set with reference to the taxpayer’s assets net of its non-debt liabilities (that is, its liabilities other than its interest bearing debts).[\[13\]](#footnote13)
 This is because the core objectives of the thin capitalisation rules are better served with the non-debt liability adjustment. For example, one of the objectives of the rules is to ensure that a taxpayer is limited to a commercial level of debt. We consider that a third-party lender, when assessing the credit worthiness of a borrower, would take into account its non-debt liabilities.

100\. Moreover, we are concerned that the current treatment of non-debt liabilities means companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in a company by its shareholders. For example, at present if a company purchases some inventory on deferred payment terms, its allowable debt level under the thin capitalisation rules will increase (because its assets have increased but its interest bearing debts have not). We do not consider that this is an appropriate outcome.

#### General reaction

101\. Several submitters (including CA ANZ, EY and KPMG) indicated they supported the proposal in principle and understood the need for this change, raising only technical design issues (particularly relating to deferred tax).

102\. A number of other submitters (including CTG, PwC and several submissions representing the infrastructure industry) argued that the proposal should not go ahead. They submitted that the proposed change would introduce volatility to taxpayers’ thin capitalisation calculations and is not relevant to BEPS. They also wrote that the proposed exclusion of non-debt liabilities from assets would amount to a material reduction in the existing 60 percent safe harbour threshold.

103\. Some submitters also argued that the existing 60 percent thin capitalisation safe harbour is already too low for infrastructure businesses – which are by nature highly geared and capital intensive – and so this proposal would disproportionately affect this industry’s ability to stay within the 60 percent safe harbour.

104\. Similarly, some submitters suggested introducing an additional arms-length test to allow taxpayers to gear at higher levels than the 60 percent safe harbour where that can be supported as a commercial level of debt. Submitters used the infrastructure industry as an example, where they argued that it is normal for third party debt to be secured on economic terms in excess of the 60 percent safe harbour ratio. Submitters suggested that an arms-length test would also address industry-specific concerns as noted above.

##### Response

105\. At present, the thin capitalisation rules ignore non-debt liabilities. This means that companies are able to have high levels of debt (and therefore high interest deductions) relative to the capital invested in the company. The current treatment also means that companies with the same level of profit or loss can have very different thin capitalisation outcomes, depending on their non-debt liabilities.

106\. With regard to the specific points raised by submitters:

*   we agree that in some cases the non-debt liability adjustment will increase volatility in thin capitalisation ratios; however, in other cases the adjustment will reduce volatility (such as when both assets and non-debt liabilities increase).
*   We do not agree that the proposal amounts to a significant adjustment in the thin capitalisation safe harbour. This change only impacts taxpayers that have large non-debt liability balances. A taxpayer with only small non-debt liabilities will see very little change in its thin capitalisation ratio. In addition, this change will have no impact on a taxpayer if their thin capitalisation ratio remains below the 60 percent safe harbour (for example, even if the change results in a large increase in a taxpayer’s ratio – say from 30 percent to 40 percent – the taxpayer will have no additional tax to pay as its ratio is still within the 60 percent safe harbour).

107\. Overall, we do not consider that any of the points raised by submitters provide a reason not to proceed with the non-debt liability adjustment (subject to the modifications discussed below).

108\. We agree with submitters that the 60 percent safe harbour will not always be appropriate, but consider that the thin capitalisation rules already adequately deal with these situations. For example, a New Zealand company’s debt level can exceed the safe harbour if it is still in line with the debt level of the company’s multinational group (under what is known as the worldwide group debt test).We acknowledge that the use of the worldwide group debt test is rare; in our discussions with submitters we mentioned that we would be happy to look at changes to that rule if there are particular problems with its application in practice. No submissions were received on this.

109\. With regards to implementing an arm’s length debt test, we note that this was considered by the OECD as part of its work on best-practice interest limitation rules. The OECD recommended against such a rule, concluding that it is not an effective method for preventing profit shifting using debt. We do not recommend an arm’s length debt test.

#### Submission: deferred tax should be ignored

110\. To remove the mismatch between income tax calculated on taxable profits and income tax calculated on profits recognised for accounting purposes, deferred tax balances are recognised in financial statements. As such, a taxpayer’s non-debt liabilities could include “deferred tax liabilities”, which arise when accounting profits are greater than profits for tax purposes. Similarly, a taxpayer’s assets could include “deferred tax assets” which arise when profit for tax purposes is greater than accounting profit.

111\. All submitters that commented on this proposal were of the view that, for the purposes of the non-debt liability adjustment, these deferred tax liabilities should be ignored. Submitters also wrote that deferred tax assets should be excluded from assets. That is, a taxpayer’s assets for thin capitalisation purposes would be: (assets – deferred tax assets) – (non-debt liabilities – deferred tax liabilities).

112\. Submitters noted that Australia’s thin capitalisation rules feature this adjustment for deferred tax. They argued that our rules should feature a similar adjustment because:

*   often deferred tax does not represent a real cash liability the company has to pay in the future
*   deferred tax balances are ignored when third-parties (including third-party lenders) are assessing the financial position of an entity;
*   that deferred tax balances can be volatile – taxpayer thin capitalisation levels could become volatile without excluding them;

113\. Many submitters referred to the removal of building depreciation in Budget 2010 in making their arguments. The 2010 changes meant that companies that owned previously depreciable buildings needed to record a (sometimes significant) deferred tax liability, which will never result in a future tax payment.

##### Response

114\. We have considered these submissions carefully, including discussing them with the agency in charge of setting accounting standards in New Zealand (the External Reporting Board or XRB) and the Australian Treasury.

115\. Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax liabilities because a taxpayer may recognise a profit for accounting purpose that will not be taxable until a later period – the deferred tax liability represents that latent tax liability. However, we acknowledge in some cases deferred tax liabilities on a taxpayer’s balance sheet will not accurately represent future tax payments the taxpayer will be required to make.

116\. Our contact at the XRB made a similar remark, commenting that:

> “In many cases deferred tax balances are simply a timing difference between when income tax is expensed in the financial statements and when income tax becomes payable to the IRD; and in other cases, deferred tax balances recognised in the financial statements may have no impact on the current or future amount of income tax payable to the IRD.
> 
> Many users of general purpose financial statements, which include significant deferred tax balances, consider the deferred tax balances and movements to be accounting entries that should be ignored when evaluating the financial performance and financial position of an entity. \[…\] The recognition of deferred tax adds a level of complexity and volatility to the financial performance reported, which many CFO’s feel are unnecessary and result in deferred movements which are difficult to explain to shareholders.”

117\. Nevertheless, the fact remains that accounting standards require the deferred tax to be recognised – suggesting that they do often represent something real. Moreover, while some deferred tax liabilities will not result in future tax payments, not carving out deferred tax is consistent with the general policy taken in the thin capitalisation rules of following accounting principles.

118\. The Australian Treasury commented that a key reason they carved out deferred tax from their non-debt liability adjustment is because of volatility concerns (mirroring comments made by submitters above). We agree that not carving out deferred tax could increase volatility of a taxpayer’s thin capitalisation ratio in some instances, though consider that in many other situations it would also reduce it.

119\. We recommend that we consult further on issues relating to deferred tax and the non-debt liability proposal. We could explore, for example, whether particular deferred tax liabilities that will not result in future tax payments could be identified and carved-out from any adjustment.

120\. Deferred tax balances of some taxpayers are significant. If there was a carve-out for deferred tax, we estimate that this would reduce the fiscal impact of the non-debt liability proposal by up to $10 million per year (from $50 million per year to $40 million per year).

#### Submission: other technical adjustments

121\. Submitters also wrote that it would be appropriate to make other exclusions from the non-debt liability adjustment, for example certain types of derivatives and redeemable preference shares. This was because, for example:

*   they are more akin to equity;
*   they are not used to fund a taxpayer’s balance sheet; or
*   that not excluding them would mean that taxpayers’ thin capitalisation ratios would become inappropriately volatile.

##### Response

122\. We consider that these other minor exclusions be considered as part of further consultation.

### Submissions on other matters

#### De minimis for inbound thin capitalisation rules

##### Proposal

123\. Many countries provide an exemption for companies with little interest expense, on the basis that they present a low BEPS risk. New Zealand has a de minimis in its outbound rules (of $1 million of interest deductions), but it does not currently have a de minimis in its inbound thin capitalisation. The discussion document proposed extending the existing de minimis so that it applies to inbound entities as well, provided none of the entity’s debt is owner-linked debt (that is, debt from the owner, or that has been guaranteed by the owner).

##### Submissions

124\. Submitters generally supported a de minimis rule on compliance cost saving grounds but wrote that limiting the proposed de minimis to firms with no owner-linked debt would make the de minimis very limited in application. CTG suggested that consideration should be given to adopting Australia’s flat de minimis of $2 million which applies regardless of whether any lending is from related parties. Further to this, CA ANZ submitted that the outbound de minimis rule should be extended to $2 million as in Australia.

##### Response

125\. If a firm has owner-linked debt, they present a higher BEPS risk than a firm with only third-party debt. On this basis, we consider that the proposed de minimis for inbound entities strikes the right balance between reducing compliance costs and BEPS risk.

126\. Submitters did not provide any evidence that the current de minimis threshold in the outbound rules is too low. We do not consider it necessary to increase the current threshold from $1 million to $2 million as some submitters suggested.

#### Infrastructure projects

##### Summary of the proposal

127\. The discussion document proposed adopting a rule presented in the OECD’s final report on best-practice interest limitation rules, which would exempt certain infrastructure projects funded entirely with third-party limited recourse loans from interest limitation rules. This exemption recognises that such funding presents little risk of BEPS.

##### Submissions

128\. Submitters strongly supported this proposal. They wrote that it would make New Zealand a more attractive place for Public Private Partnership (PPP) investment and provide more flexibility in how such investments can be structured.

129\. Submitters did make several technical submissions, primarily with a focus on ensuring the exemption works with the various commercial structures adopted by PPPs. We are currently working through these submissions. We note that further consultation with submitters may be necessary.

##### Response

130\. We recommend that you seek Cabinet approval to this proposal in principle.

#### Non-resident owning body change

##### Proposal

131\. At present, when an entity is controlled by a group of non-residents acting together, its allowable debt level is the greater of:

*   60 percent; and
*   110 percent of its third-party debt.

132\. We were concerned that allowing a company to have total debt of 110% of its third-party debt would allow entities to be funded through inappropriately high levels of debt. For example, a project funded 90 percent with third-party debt could have 9 percent shareholder debt and only 1 percent equity.

133\. Accordingly, the discussion document proposed changing this test so that, if an entity has a debt level in excess of 60 percent, the interest deductions on its related-party debt should be denied to the extent the entity’s debt level exceeded 60 percent. The discussion document proposed grandparenting existing arrangements.

##### Submissions

134\. This proposal was not a focus of many submissions. The main comments received were:

*   That the proposed grandparenting of existing arrangements was appropriate; and
*   That the way the proposal was worded implied it was unnecessarily restrictive.

##### Response

135\. We recommend that this proposal proceed.

#### Asset valuations

##### Proposal

136\. In general, the thin capitalisation rules are based on the value of a company’s assets as reported in its financial statements. However, a company may use the net current value of an asset as an alternative to its financial statement value, provided that would be allowable under generally accepted accounting principles.

137\. The discussion document proposed removing the net current valuation method from the list of available asset valuation methods for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules. This change would mean that a company would only be able to use values as reported in its financial statements.

138\. We proposed this change because we considered that the valuation method chosen for financial reporting purposes will be the one that most fairly represents the value of a company’s assets. In addition, financial reporting valuations are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than asset valuations adopted solely for thin capitalisation purposes.

##### Submissions

139\. No submissions on this proposal supported the removal of the net current valuation method. Many submitters argued that the flexibility to adopt an alternative valuation method is appropriate. They noted adopting a current valuation approach for financial reporting purposes means that the asset needs to be independently valued every year - an expensive exercise. In contrast, the current approach (where taxpayers can value assets at historic cost for financial reporting but based on current values for thin capitalisation) means taxpayers need to incur the costs of a valuation only when necessary (that is, when relying on an asset’s financial value would mean the company would breach the thin capitalisation safe harbour).

140\. Most submitters on this proposal suggested explicitly requiring revaluation of assets by an independent expert valuer, which is a feature of Australia’s rules[\[14\]](#footnote14)
). One submitter (CTG) also suggested that taxpayers should be required to disclose on their returns if the net current valuation method has been used. This would allow Inland Revenue to better target its resources while ensuring that taxpayers using the net current valuation method for genuine reasons are not unfairly penalised.

141\. A few submitters suggested that the thin capitalisation rules should include all measurable assets, including intangible assets. This is consistent with Australia’s approach. One submitter with significant intangible assets indicated that lenders look at the earning potential of intangibles and with sufficient rigour imposed on the process, there is no reason for intangible assets to be excluded from the thin capitalisation calculation.

##### Response

142\. We are concerned about the robustness of the current rules (such as the risk that taxpayers are valuing assets without seeking an independent valuation) and the change proposed in the discussion document is aimed at ensuring asset values used by taxpayers for thin capitalisation purposes are robust. However, we understand that removing the net current valuation method could increase compliance costs for a number of firms.

143\. On this basis, we recommend modifying this proposal to allow firms that meet certain conditions to use the net current valuation method. This modified approach would also be subject to robust legislative requirement (such as requiring revaluation of assets by an independent expert valuer as suggested by submitters, and ensuring a consistent valuation method is used year-to-year) to ensure asset valuations that are being used are robust.

144\. We do not support the proposal of including intangible assets in thin capitalisation calculations. These assets – for example, internally-generated intellectual property – are very difficult to value, which is why they are not recognised as assets under New Zealand’s accounting standards. We have discussed this suggestion with the Australian Treasury – they have informed us that the Australian Taxation Office has significant difficulty determining the value of intangible assets, and that they are seeing taxpayers increase their reported values for these assets in response to the recent tightening of their rules (thereby diminishing the impact of the tightening).

145\. We note that the safe harbour rule that submitters are referring to is only one option available to taxpayers in the thin capitalisation rules. The worldwide group debt test can alternatively be used by those taxpayers concerned about breaching the 60 percent safe harbour due to the exclusion of intangible assets.

#### Measurement date for assets and liabilities

##### Proposal

146\. Taxpayers can currently choose to value their assets and liabilities on the last day of the income year, or use an average of their values at the end of each quarter, or each day, in the income year.

147\. The first of these methods, valuing assets and liabilities on the last day of the income year, is the simplest and most widely-used approach. However, there is the potential for a taxpayer to use this method to breach the thin capitalisation debt limits for up to one year without facing any interest denial, by partly repaying a loan or converting it to equity on or before their balance date.

148\. The discussion document proposed removing the first of these asset valuation methods so that assets can only be valued for thin capitalisation based on the average values at the end of every quarter or at the end of every day. This would ensure that the thin capitalisation rules apply effectively to a loan that was substantially repaid just before the end of the year.

##### Submissions

149\. No submissions on this proposal supported the removal of the year-end valuation option. In particular, submitters were concerned that requiring valuations on a quarterly or daily basis would impose significant and unnecessary compliance costs for the majority of taxpayers subject to the thin capitalisation rules. Submissions indicated that the year-end valuation option is almost always used and that removing this option would require taxpayers to prepare audited financial statements solely for tax purposes at points in the year when they are not required for financial reporting purposes.

150\. Submitters presented two alternative approaches:

*   Calculating an average of the opening and closing values of assets and liabilities each income year. This approach features in Australia’s rules.
*   Implementing an anti-abuse rule in the thin capitalisation regime to tackle this type of tax-driven behaviour.

##### Response

151\. We accept the submission that the proposal to require quarterly or daily valuation would impose significant compliance costs on the majority of corporate taxpayers. We note that both alternative approaches proposed by submitters have advantages and disadvantages. In particular, adopting the Australian approach would require most corporate taxpayers to change their measurement method, whereas a strengthened anti-abuse rule is far more targeted at taxpayers that present a higher BEPS risk.

152\. We agree with submitters that the proposal in the discussion document should not proceed. Instead, we recommend adopting the suggestion by submitters to implement an anti-abuse rule that targets situations when a taxpayer substantially repays a loan just before the end of the year. This approach most directly targets the behaviour of concern.

#### Minor remedial

153\. Finally, the discussion document proposed a minor remedial to how section FE 18(3B) applies in relation to trusts. Very few submitters commented on this proposal – the few that did (for example, CA ANZ) supported it.

154\. We recommend that the proposal proceed without amendment.

### Other issues not progressed

#### Finance companies

155\. One submitter suggested that special rules for non-resident owned finance companies should be developed. For technical reasons, the thin capitalisation rules are not currently very effective for these companies.

156\. We agree that special rule for finance companies (similar to the special regime currently in place for registered banks) is necessary to ensure the thin capitalisation rules apply effectively to them. However, such rules would be complex to develop. Furthermore, a review of Inland Revenue data indicated that foreign-owned finance companies do not present much BEPS risk at present. Accordingly, in developing the proposals for the discussion document we focused on other, more pressing areas of reform. We recommend the development of a special rule for foreign-owned finance companies be considered for a later time.

#### Non-residents acting together with New Zealand residents

157\. Broadly, the inbound thin capitalisation rules apply only to companies where 50% or more of the ownership interests are held by:

*   a single non-resident; or
*   a group of non-residents acting together.

158\. This means that the thin capitalisation rules do not necessarily apply if a company is owned by a group of residents and non-residents acting together, even though similar profit shifting risks can arise. Two submitters questioned this result.

159\. We agree that it would be desirable to review whether the situations when the thin capitalisation rules apply should be broadened further. However, this matter was not discussed in the original discussion document. Submitters have had no opportunity to comment on the appropriateness or otherwise of such a broadening. As such, we consider that a change at this time would not be appropriate.

160\. We recommend that this be considered in any subsequent review of the rules.

#### Link to recent NRWT reforms

161\. The Government recently bolstered the withholding tax rules on interest payments to non-residents, ensuring they cannot easily be structured around. Four submitters suggested that this means the proposals put forward in the discussion document are unnecessary.

162\. We do not agree. NRWT on interest payments is taxed at either 10 or 15 percent (depending on whether the payment is to a jurisdiction New Zealand has a DTA with). This rate is much lower than the company rate of 28 percent. It is therefore important for New Zealand to have robust rules to ensure that excessive interest deductions are not taken in New Zealand, as this still substantially reduces the overall tax take in New Zealand.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Inland Revenue’s recommended option is Option 2. The main reason is that a lengthy bright-line test such as 10 years is likely to be an inefficient way of collecting tax revenue. Taxes that generate a lot of behavioural changes while raising relatively small amounts of revenue tend to be very inefficient. If the bright-line test causes taxpayers to hold onto their properties for more than 10 years, the government will obtain no tax revenue from these people. In these cases, the tax is causing people to act in ways that can be undesirable (by holding onto a property longer than would be desirable in the absence of tax) while raising no revenue. Option 2 will also assist with the Government’s objective of putting downward pressure on rents because a smaller likelihood of gains being taxed is likely to incentivise landlords to invest in rental housing, which will, to some extent, encourage the building of dwellings and provision of rental housing. A potential disadvantage of Option 2 is that it will mean a narrower capital income tax base because fewer gains will be taxed. However, we consider that a 10-year bright-line is unlikely to be an efficient way of taxing this capital income. If the government wanted to tax the income, it would be preferable to have a tax on these gains irrespective of when the assets were sold. Views of stakeholders The Treasury The Treasury agrees that the current 10-year bright-line test likely has significant efficiency costs relative to the revenue raised, and that the arbitrary time boundary raises issues of fairness. However, the Treasury does not have a firm view on whether a 2-year bright-line test is preferable to the current 10-year test. The Treasury recommends a 20-year bright-line test or longer. This would capture more capital gains, thereby improving the fairness of the tax system and supporting more sustainable house prices. Treasury considers it unlikely that landlords will pass on the tax change through lower rents in the short run. Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, found that the main drivers of rents over the past twenty years have been household income growth and the physical supply of rental housing relative to demand. The Treasury therefore expects that reducing the bright-line period would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. In the longer term, the change could result in some increase to rental housing supply, thereby putting downward pressure on rents. This will depend on the degree of flexibility in urban land supply and/or opportunities to intensify existing land. As a result, the impact of reducing the bright-line period in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that reducing the bright-line period increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development - Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] government of National, ACT and New Zealand First. As such, the options under consideration were limited to the status quo and introducing a 2-year bright-line test. Time constraints also applied to the policy development of the proposal and has not permitted consultation on the various options, or refinement of the preferred option. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 1: Diagnosi ng the policy proble m W h a t i s t h e c o n t e x t b e h i n d t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m a n d h o w i s t h e st a t u s q u o e x p e c t e d t o d e v e l o p? The rental market 1.Upward pressure on rents can be driven by many factors that influence the supply of rental properties. These factors may be related or unrelated to tax settings. 2.However, moving back to a 2-year bright-line test can reduce pressure on rents by encouraging the construction of dwellings and thus putting downward pressure on rents. 3.Rental affordability is a significant issue in New Zealand. Based on Household Economic Survey data for the year ended June 2022, a quarter of renting households were spending over 40% of their disposable income on housing costs, and rents have risen faster than mortgage payments. Renters also have higher rates of reporting housing issues like dampness, mould, and lack of heating. 1 4.While rental affordability (measured by the ratio of changes in rent prices to changes in incomes) has been mostly constant over the past decade, 2 New Zealand has not fared favourably in international comparisons. The proportion of low-income households (the lowest income quintile) in New Zealand spending over 40% of their income on rent was the highest in the OECD in 2018 data at 61%. 3 The same analysis for households of all incomes finds New Zealand is also near the top of OECD countries for the proportion of renters spending over 40% of their income on housing costs (24%), 4 and for median spend on housing costs by renting households (28% of household income). 5 The latter measure of median spend increases to 41% for low-income households. 6 The bright-line test 5.The bright-line test was originally introduced in 2015 to improve compliance with the land sale rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 by supplementing the intention test. 7 Under the intention test, gains from the sale of land purchased with a purpose or intention of disposal are taxable. However, this test can be difficult to enforce because there can be difficulties determining a taxpayer’s purpose or intention in relation to land. The difficulties meant that some land speculators were not paying tax on gains from property sales in instances where they should have been paying tax. 1 https://www.stats.govt.nz/news/housing-affordability-more-challenging-for-renters-than-homeowners/ 2 https://www.hud.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/Methods-Nov-2022.pdf 3 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 18. 4 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 20 5 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 22. 6 International comparisons of housing affordability for renters and owners, p. 23 7 The regulatory impact statements published for the introduction of these rules, as well as the subsequent extensions of these rules, are available here (2015), here (2017), and here (2021). Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6.The bright-line test originally applied to residential property that was acquired and disposed of within 2 years. The test was extended to acquisitions and disposals within 5 years in 2018, with the objective of ensuring that tax is paid on the gains from property speculation and to improve housing affordability for owner-occupiers by reducing demand from speculators. 7.The test was extended again in 2021 to apply to acquisitions and disposals within 10 years (or 5 years for new builds). This extension was intended to reduce investor demand for property. This would reduce the amounts investors were prepared to pay for houses and the number of houses they would buy, thereby supporting first-home buyers and helping lift New Zealand’s home ownership rates. 8.The Government is concerned that the current 10-year bright-line test treats a very wide group of investment property owners as property speculators. In addition, the Government is concerned that the current bright-line tests place upward pressure on rents. This can happen in the longer run, by reducing the supply of dwellings. 9.The Income Tax Act 2007 contains other provisions that impose income tax on property transactions. However, it continues to be the case the that the key provision taxing gains from speculation (the intention test) is difficult to enforce. As a result, if there is no bright-line test, it is likely many people who have gains from the sale of land that should be subject to tax under the intention test will fail to comply. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 10.While the gains on any residential investment property purchased with the intention to sell are taxable, the subjective nature of determining investors’ intention makes this difficult to enforce. Therefore, there are good policy reasons to continue to have a bright-line test to provide more clarity to the taxation of gains from residential property sales. 11.However, the longer 10-year bright-line period gives rise to a large “lock-in” effect, where investors are incentivised to hold onto property until the bright-line period has expired to avoid tax liability. This can be an inefficient way of raising revenue. In addition, this can reduce the stock of dwellings over time (relative to what the stock would have been without this lengthy bright-line test). This can put upward pressure on rents. W h a t o b j e c t i v e s a r e s o u g h t i n r e l a t i o n t o t he p o l i c y p r o b l e m ? 12.The Government’s objective in repealing the current bright-line tests and replacing them with a new 2-year bright-line test is to reduce upward pressure on rents. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to addres s the policy proble m W h a t c r i t e r i a w i l l b e u s e d to c o m p a r e o p t i o n s to t h e s t a t u s q u o ? 13. The likely impact of the options will be assessed against the status quo under the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents and improving housing affordability in the rental market. The impact on housing affordability and home ownership is also considered, given those outcomes were a motivation for the status quo bright-line test. 14. The options will also be evaluated against the traditional tax policy criteria of efficiency, equity, integrity, fiscal impact, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. These are described below. a. Efficiency: Taxes should be, to the extent possible, efficient and minimise (as much as possible) impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g., causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. b. Equity: The tax system should promote fairness. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the appropriate treatment of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. c. Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time and minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. d. Fiscal impact: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints, and the system must raise sufficient revenue to support the Government’s fiscal strategy. e. Compliance and administration costs: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for Inland Revenue to administer. f. Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. W h a t s c o p e w i l l o p t i o n s b e c o n s i d e r e d w i t h i n ? 15. The Government has already announced its intention to repeal the current bright-line tests and replace them with a new 2-year bright-line test. 16. Ministers have directed officials to provide advice on this policy within the timeframes required for decisions in December 2023. Therefore, the scope of feasible options is Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] limited. Officials are progressing this advice on the basis of the commitment made in National’s Back Pocket Boost, as the coalition agreements are silent on changes to the bright-line test. This is for the bright-line proposal to take effect from July 2024 so that properties acquired before July 2022 will not be subject to taxation under the bright-line test. Limitations on consultation 17. Formal stakeholder engagement following the Generic Tax Policy Process has not been possible in the time allowed for preparation of this advice. The risks of a lack of formal consultation include the potential for unintended consequences arising from the policy change. Consultation also enables a more rigorous understanding of trade-offs when making policy changes. This is pertinent for a proposal like reducing the bright- line test, which could have impacts on the rental property market and the housing system more generally with respect to prices, rents, and the supply of housing. Because the bright-line test has been subject to several changes since introduction, its impacts on the housing system, as well as the mechanics of the changes and how the proposal will work, have been discussed and submitted on previously. 18. The absence of consultation for the current proposal means that officials have not been able to establish whether issues raised in previous submissions are just as relevant to the current proposal. For example, no formal consultation has occurred to determine whether stakeholders consider moderating growth in house prices is as much of a priority for the current proposal compared to when previous bright-line changes were being considered. This is an important point when considering that the current proposal has a different motivation to that of the status quo. This is reflective of trade-offs, for which consultation would ideally occur to help improve understanding of the relevant issues. 19. One issue in particular that may be affected by a lack of consultation is the 1 July 2024 implementation date. This is out of sync with the tax year and has implications for property owners in trying to understand how the rules apply to them part-way through the year. This will be mitigated through taxpayer guidance and website updates to ensure the timing of the change is well signalled. W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? Option 1: Retain the status quo 20. Option 1 is to retain the status quo. Under current law, a 5-year bright-line test applies for properties acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and before 27 March 2021. A 10- year bright-line test applies for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021, except for new-build land, for which a 5-year bright-line test applies. 21. Option 1 addresses concerns around property speculation by dampening demand. In addition, it ensures that speculators are taxed on gains from the sale of residential investment land. Due to the length of the 10-year period, it is likely to result in significant lock-in effects and may, in the longer run, place upward pressure on rents. Option 2 – Introduce a new 2-year bright-line test Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 22. Option 2 is to repeal the current bright-line tests and introduce a new 2-year bright-line test. This test would tax properties sold after the application date, provided they were acquired within 2 years of the date of sale. 23. Option 2 will address the Government’s concerns that a very wide group of investment property owners are being treated as property speculators. 24. Option 2 will also continue to address concerns around property speculation by providing a clear rule under which gains from property speculation will be taxed. At the same time, it will support two of the other objectives of the original 2-year test. These were to minimise the number of sales made taxable that were acquired without an intention of resale, and to minimise costs to taxpayers in complying with the bright-line test. Options analysis 25. Option 2 is assessed relative to Option 1 (the status quo) against the Government’s objective of reducing upward pressure on rents as well as the criteria listed above. 26. Reducing upward pressure on rents and impact on home ownership: Option 2 will mean that beyond a 2-year period, residential investment property owners will not be subject to the bright-line test. This will reduce the total taxes they pay if they end up needing to sell a property within the 2–10 year period. This can incentivise new construction, which would put downward pressure on rents in the longer run. This would help renters. 27. A shorter bright-line period decreases the tax cost of investing in residential property. An increase in demand for purchasing such property could then put upward pressure on property prices compared to the status quo. This would be detrimental to first-home buyers. The impact on home ownership rates cannot be quantified. 28. Efficiency: The change is likely to have limited effects on economic growth but a significant effect on other aspects of economic efficiency. 29. The key potential efficiency advantage of taxing gains generated by investors in residential property is that the gain is a form of economic income. Not taxing these gains when other forms of income are taxed can reduce the efficiency of the tax system. This is a possible reason for preferring Option 1 relative to Option 2. 30. However, we consider that this is a very weak argument for preferring Option 1. It is a reason for taxing gains irrespective of how long an investment property is held. It is not a good argument for taxing gains only if a property is sold within 10 years of acquisition. 31. The original 2-year bright-line test had a clear rationale. This was to tax gains when it was very likely that the gains should have been taxed under the intention test. The 2- year bright-line test did this without the difficulties and economic costs of applying the intention test while at the same time minimising the number of sales that were taxed without an intention of resale. This rationale cannot be reasonably said to apply for a 10-year bright-line test. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 32. Taxing gains only if investment property is sold within 10 years can be a very inefficient way of taxing gains on investment property. This is because if a property appreciates significantly in the first few years it is owned, there can be a large incentive for the owner to hold the property for at least 10 years so that gains are not taxed. 33. These "lock-in” effects constitute deadweight costs that decrease economic efficiency, as residential property owners may hold rentals for longer than they otherwise would if not for the bright-line test. Option 2 decreases some of the inefficiencies associated with lock-in. 34. The compounding effect of capital gains for a property owner who is “locked” into holding the property for 10 years creates a proportionately large distortion compared to a property owner who is locked in for 2 years where capital gains have less time to accrue. 35. In many cases, it will also be likely that the gains accrued during a 2-year lock-in period would have been taxable under the intention test anyway, which decreases the economic distortions the bright-line test creates when considered in conjunction with existing taxing provisions. Conversely, the gains accrued during a 10-year lock-in period are less likely to have been taxable under the intention test, leading to larger inefficiencies. 36. Taxes that are easy to step around are inefficient. They can produce behavioural changes while generating very little revenue. It is inefficient to provide an incentive for a taxpayer who wishes to sell a property after 5 years to hold onto the property for an additional 5 years. This has a large efficiency cost per dollar of revenue raised when many properties are held for more than 10 years and no revenue is gained on these properties. 37. Overall, there are significant efficiency gains achieved by reducing the bright-line period, and this is a strong reason to prefer Option 2. 38. Equity: One possible fairness disadvantage of Option 2 relative to Option 1 is that it taxes less capital income. People are normally taxed on their income and exempting capital gains can be criticised as horizontally inequitable. It favours those who earn income as capital gains over those who are earning most other forms of income. If those who earn this sort of income tend to be better off, this can also be criticised on vertical equity grounds if this undermines a government’s tax progressivity goals. 39. However, once again this provides very weak fairness grounds for taxing gains on residential investment properties if these properties are sold within 10 years of acquisition but not if they are held for a longer period. It also provides weak fairness grounds for taxing gains on residential investment property when other gains are not being taxed. 40. By contrast, there is a good fairness ground for the original 2-year bright-line test. This is that most sales within this short period will have been in cases where the intention test should have applied and the income should have been taxed under general income tax principles. 41. Revenue integrity: Revenue integrity may decline under Option 2 as it is possible that properties held for more than 2 years that should have been caught by the intention Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] test may no longer have tax paid on sale. At the same time, it minimises the number of cases where the tax will apply even though the gains should not have been caught by the intention test. 42. Fiscal impact: The expected fiscal cost of Option 2 over the forecast period (to 2027/28) is estimated to be approximately $202 million. 43. Compliance and administration costs: A reduced bright-line test will capture fewer property transactions and affect fewer people, which reduces compliance costs. The complexity that exists in the current bright-line settings could also be reduced to further lessen compliance costs. Changing the bright-line test will create some initial administrative work such as providing guidance and education campaigns. 44. Coherence: There appears to be little policy rationale for taxing gains on investment properties only if the properties are sold within 10 years. By contrast there is a policy rationale for a 2-year bright-line test, being that it ensures gains are taxed when they should have been taxable under the intention test. Thus, Option 2 appears superior to Option 1 on grounds of coherence. Treasury assessment of the options 45. The Treasury agrees that the current 10-year bright-line test likely has significant efficiency costs relative to the revenue raised, and that the arbitrary time boundary raises issues of fairness. However, the Treasury does not have a firm view on whether a 2-year bright-line test is preferable to the current 10-year test. 46. The Treasury recommends a 20-year bright-line test or longer. This would capture more capital gains, thereby improving the fairness of the tax system and supporting more sustainable house prices. 47. In the short and medium term, the bulk of the impact from reducing the bright-line test to 2 years is likely to be reflected in house prices, with minimal impacts on rents. House price impacts are highly uncertain and will depend on the timing of reducing the bright- line period. The Treasury will analyse these potential impacts further and may adjust our house price forecasts to reflect them as part of the Budget Economic and Fiscal Update. 48. In the long run, tax changes could also impact the supply of housing by incentivising new construction, and could therefore have more significant impacts on rents. The long-run incidence on house prices and rents will depend on the flexibility of urban land supply and the availability of opportunities to intensify existing urban land: a. low flexibility of urban land supply and limited opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily raise house prices in the long run. b. high flexibility of urban land supply and significant opportunities to intensify mean the policy will primarily reduce rents in the long run. 49. Research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross-agency group of housing experts, suggests that rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for rental housing. The Treasury therefore expects that reducing the bright-line test to 2 years would not significantly impact rents in the short run, as the stock of housing supply is fixed. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 50. The Treasury’s assessment of the evidence is that urban land supply has been highly restrictive over the last two decades, as demonstrated by the gradual fall in interest rates pushing up house prices rather than pushing down rents. 51. Recent policy changes (such as the Auckland Unitary Plan) appear to have improved the responsiveness of supply for higher-density housing. However, without further changes, housing supply may continue to be unresponsive to demand in the long term. 52. As a result, the impact of reducing the bright-line period in the long term will depend on future policy. Supporting the flexibility of urban land supply will make it more likely that reducing the bright-line period increases the supply of housing in the long run rather than primarily raising house prices. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development – Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga assessment of the options 53. HUD agrees with Inland Revenue’s assessment of the impact on supply, house prices, and rents. Based on research by the Housing Technical Working Group, a cross- agency group of housing experts, showing rents are primarily driven by household incomes and the relative supply and demand for housing, HUD believes the impact on rent prices in the short term will be negligible. In the long term, reinstatement should make rents under Option 2 less than under Option 1, with the magnitude of that contingent on any improvements to overall efficiency of urban land supply response. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section 3: Delivering a n option H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e i m p l e m e n t e d? 56. This change will give rise to minimal system changes, and tax return processes will remain the same. Changes required will include updating all taxpayer guidance, websites, and calculators. 57. It is currently proposed that the changes will apply to disposals of residential land after 1 July 2024. There is a potential for confusion resulting in errors by taxpayers and significant software challenges for accounting software suppliers, arising from an application date that does not align with the ordinary tax year (1 April to 31 March). This could be mitigated by applying the proposals from 1 April 2024, which would be Inland Revenue’s preference. H o w w i l l t h e n e w a r r a n g e m e n t s b e mo n i t o red, ev a l u a ted, a n d re v i e wed? 58. Inland Revenue currently has processes in place to monitor all New Zealand property transactions and to identify possible bright-line transactions and notify taxpayers. Inland Revenue may request transactors in property to update transaction details accordingly in myIR. None of these processes are expected to change as a result of the proposal. 59. Where non-compliance is identified, there are process for reminders, compliance visits and audits (where necessary). These processes will continue for any amended bright- line test.

### BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance submissions and policy decisions

* * *

### Executive summary

1\. In March this year the Government released a tax discussion document called _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_ which proposed the introduction of a package of transfer pricing and permanent establishment (PE) avoidance rules targeted at countering large multinationals engaged in aggressive tax practices. This report provides advice on the 16 submissions we have received on this discussion document. It also seeks policy decisions on the reform package following this consultation.

2\. In summary, we recommend proceeding with all but one of the proposals in the discussion document (we do not recommend proceeding with the proposal to require large multinationals to pay disputed tax earlier). We recommend making a number of refinements to some of the original proposals in response to submissions. These refinements will make the proposals more certain for taxpayers and better targeted at the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) arrangements we are concerned about.

3\. Agreeing to our recommended changes will not change the previously estimated forecast tax revenue from the transfer pricing and PE proposals (which is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum thereafter).

#### Summary of submissions

4\. Two submitters (Oxfam and NZCTU)[\[1\]](#footnote1)
 expressed support for all the proposals on the grounds that they would help ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

5\. Most submitters accepted in principle the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and PE avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more workable and better targeted. Many submissions focused on when the PE avoidance rule would apply and when Inland Revenue would reconstruct a transfer pricing arrangement. We are confident we can refine the proposals to address many of the submitters’ concerns while ensuring the measures are just as effective at combatting BEPS.

6\. Some submitters were opposed to proceeding with any of the proposed measures as they considered the new rules were unnecessary and would make New Zealand’s tax environment more uncertain and unattractive for multinational investment.

7\. Most of the submitters are tax advisors or represent businesses that could be negatively affected by the proposals. Therefore, the submissions are understandably critical of some of the measures. As expected, submitters strongly opposed the proposals that increased Inland Revenue’s powers to investigate large multinationals. These administrative proposals included:

*   extending the transfer pricing time bar from 4 years to 7 years. This is the period within which Inland Revenue can adjust a transfer pricing tax position taken by a taxpayer;
*   allowing Inland Revenue to request information that is held by an offshore group member; and
*   requiring large multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront (rather than at the end of a dispute).

#### Our response

8\. We agree with submitters that the proposal to make large multinationals pay disputed tax upfront is unnecessary, and recommend not proceeding with the proposal. Inland Revenue already charges “use of money interest” on tax owing, which provides a strong incentive for paying tax which is in dispute.

9\. We recommend proceeding with all of the other proposals in the discussion document, subject to a number of refinements to make the proposals more certain for taxpayers and better targeted. These refinements should not reduce the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms.

10\. Otherwise, we consider the measures are well-targeted at the specific problems that Inland Revenue has actually observed in its investigations of multinationals. Currently only a small number of multinationals use the aggressive PE avoidance or transfer pricing arrangements which are targeted by the proposals. This suggests the new rules will only increase uncertainty or tax costs for a small number of multinationals.

11\. The following table summarises the main issues raised by submitters and our recommended responses:

| Submission | Recommended response |
| --- | --- |
| The anti-avoidance threshold for the application of the PE avoidance rule should be narrowed so it does not apply to ordinary commercial arrangements. | **Accept** the submission. We consider the rule should be more narrowly targeted at avoidance arrangements. We could do this either by requiring a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance, or by adopting into domestic legislation the OECD’s widened PE definition. We would like to give further consideration as to which approach we should adopt. |
| The PE avoidance rule is not necessary in light of the OECD’s new widened PE definition (which New Zealand is implementing with some countries through the Multilateral Instrument and through future double tax agreement (DTA) negotiations). | **Accept** the submission in part. In cases where the applicable DTA includes the OECD’s new widened PE definition, the proposed PE avoidance rule seems unnecessary. However the OECD’s widened PE definition will not be included in most of our DTAs under the MLI (although it may be included under subsequent bilateral DTA negotiations). To reflect this, we recommend that the proposed PE rule apply only where an applicable DTA does not include the OECD’s widened PE definition. |
| The PE avoidance rule should not override New Zealand’s DTAs. | **Decline** the submission. For the rule to be effective it needs to override those DTAs which do not include the OECD’s new widened PE definition. This is consistent with the Australian and UK approaches. |
| The proposed anti-avoidance source rule is too broad and should be more targeted at the perceived problem. | **Accept** the submission. We consider the rule should be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules. |
| The life insurance proposals represent an unfair and unilateral reconstruction of the tax treatment of life insurance premiums and should not proceed. | **Accept** the submission in part. We consider that the proposed reinsurance amendments are necessary to ensure that the rules apply as intended and to protect the tax base. However, there is little revenue at risk in relation to the foreign investment fund amendments and a significant likelihood of accidental non-compliance under the proposed change. Accordingly, we recommend that the foreign investment fund related life insurance changes do not proceed (meaning that any life insurance policies issued in New Zealand by life insurers from Singapore, Russia, and Canada would remain exempt from the foreign investment fund rules). |
| The time bar which limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position should remain at 4 years (not be extended to 7 years as proposed). | **Decline** the submission. We consider there is still a good justification for extending the time bar to 7 years for transfer pricing issues (consistent with Australia and Canada). |
| The burden of proof for transfer pricing matters should remain with Inland Revenue (rather than being shifted onto the taxpayer as proposed). | **Decline** the submission. The burden of proof is on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in most OECD and G20 countries, including Australia. This means most multinationals already have to prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof for other countries. Also, the burden of proof is on the taxpayer for other tax matters. |
| The test for reconstructing a transfer pricing arrangement should align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. | **Accept** the submission. New Zealand’s legislative test for reconstructing an arrangement should be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. |
| The proposal to make large multinationals pay disputed tax upfront is unnecessary and should not proceed. | **Accept** the submission. We recommend not proceeding with this proposal as Inland Revenue already charges “use of money interest” on tax owing, which provides a strong incentive for multinationals to pay tax that is in dispute. |
| The proposal to require a New Zealand member of a multinational group to pay tax owed by a related non-resident group member should not proceed. | **Decline** the submission. However, we agree that the rule should only apply if the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself. |
| The proposed extension of Inland Revenue’s information collection powers to allow Inland Revenue to request information that is held offshore by a related group member should not proceed. Submitters also raised concerns about the new civil penalty of up to $100,000 for failing to provide requested information (which replaces the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty). | **Decline** the submissions. We consider that these information proposals are necessary to ensure that the multinational group is required to provide Inland Revenue with the requested information and has appropriate incentives to comply with these requests. However, we recommend allowing the multinational to appeal the penalty. |

12\. We also propose widening the scope of the original proposal to deem an amount of income to have a New Zealand source under our domestic legislation if we have a right to tax the income under a DTA. The rule proposed in the discussion document was limited to income covered by the PE and royalty articles of our DTAs. We should extend the rule to all types of income that we can tax under a DTA – as Australia does. This ensures we can exercise a taxing right that we have negotiated under a DTA. We will consult further on this wider proposal in the next round of consultation.

13\. Officials are available to discuss this report at your joint Ministers’ meeting on 29 June. Further information about the next steps is set out in the cover report included in this package (_BEPS – submissions on March 2017 discussion documents – covering report_ T2017/1578 / IR2017/329).

### Recommended action

We recommend that you:

(a) **Agree** that the proposal in the discussion document to require large multinationals to pay disputed tax upfront should **not** proceed as it is not necessary given that Inland Revenue already charges “use of money interest” on tax owing.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(b) **Note** that the recommendations below agree to implement all the other proposals in the discussion document, subject to some refinements in response to submissions (as identified in this report).

Noted   Noted

(c) **Note** that the recommended refinements will provide more certainty for taxpayers without reducing the overall effectiveness of the proposed reforms. Therefore agreeing to officials’ recommendations will not affect the estimated forecast tax revenue from implementing the transfer pricing and PE avoidance measures, which is $25m in 2018/19 and $50m per annum thereafter.

Noted   Noted

(d) **Agree** to introduce a new PE avoidance rule that will apply to large multinationals that structure to avoid having a permanent establishment (taxable presence) in New Zealand. The rule will only apply to multinationals with over EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover.[\[2\]](#footnote2)
 The rule will not apply if the relevant DTA already includes the OECD’s new widened PE definition.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(e) **Note** that, in designing the detail of the new PE avoidance rules, officials will consider options for narrowing the original scope of the PE avoidance rules without reducing their effectiveness. We will report back with our recommendations on this matter.

Noted   Noted

(f) **Note** that we will consult further on a new source rule which will deem an amount of income to have a source in New Zealand if New Zealand has a right to tax that income under any applicable DTA.

Noted   Noted

(g) **Agree** to introduce an anti-avoidance source rule which will broadly provide that, where another group member carries on a non-resident’s business in New Zealand, the non-resident will be deemed to carry on that business itself for the purpose of determining whether its income from New Zealand customers has a New Zealand source. (This is more narrowly targeted at the existing issues Inland Revenue has identified with the source rules than the original proposal.)

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(h) **Agree** to address a potential weakness of the life insurance source rules by ensuring that no deductions are available for the reinsurance of life insurance policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand including where the income is not subject to New Zealand tax under a DTA.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(i) **Agree** that the proposal to amend the FIF life insurance rules should not proceed as there is little revenue at risk and a significant likelihood of accidental non-compliance under the proposal.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(j) **Agree** that the time bar that limits Inland Revenue’s ability to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position should be increased to 7 years (in line with Australia).

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(k) **Agree** that the burden of proof for demonstrating that a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position aligns with arm’s length conditions should be shifted from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer (consistent with the burden of proof being on the taxpayer for other tax matters).

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(l) **Agree** to strengthen the transfer pricing rules so they align with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. This involves amending New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules so that:

*    they disregard legal form if it does not align with the actual economic substance of the transaction;
*   they provide Inland Revenue with a power to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational because they include unrealistic terms that third parties would not be willing to agree to;
*   the legislation specifically refers to arm’s length conditions and using the latest OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines as guidance material for how the rules are applied; and
*   the new legislation codifies the requirement that large multinationals will provide Inland Revenue with the information required to comply with the OECD’s country-by-country reporting initiative.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(m) **Agree** that New Zealand’s legislative test for reconstructing a transfer pricing arrangement should be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(n) Agree that in addition to applying to transactions between related parties, the transfer pricing rules should also apply when non-resident investors “act in concert” to effectively control a New Zealand entity, such as through a private equity manager.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(o) **Agree** that if a large multinational group (over EUR €750m worldwide revenues) does not cooperate with Inland Revenue, then Inland Revenue may more readily dispute the multinational’s tax position based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(p) **Agree** that tax owed by any member of a large multinational group can be collected from any wholly-owned group member provided the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself (this is slightly narrower than the original proposal in the discussion document).

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(q) **Agree** to extend Inland Revenue’s information collection powers so that in respect of large multinational groups, Inland Revenue can request information that is held offshore by a related group member.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(r) **Agree** to extend Inland Revenue’s information collection powers so that Inland Revenue can deem an amount of income to be allocated to a New Zealand group member or New Zealand PE of a large multinational group in cases where they have failed to adequately respond to an information request in relation to New Zealand-sourced income. (Currently the existing power only applies in respect of deductible payments.)

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(s) **Agree** to create a new civil penalty of up to $100,000 for large multinational groups which fail to provide requested information (which replaces the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty), but clarify that the taxpayer would be able to appeal this penalty.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

(t) **Agree** that advance pricing agreements (APAs) existing prior to the application date of these proposals should be grandparented.

Agreed / Not Agreed   Agreed / Not Agreed

### Background

14\. In March this year the Government released a tax discussion document called _BEPS – transfer pricing and permanent establishment avoidance_. This report provides advice on the 16 submissions (from 15 submitters) we have received on this discussion document. It also seeks policy decisions on the proposals, including a number of suggested refinements to address issues raised by submitters.

15\. We have met with six of the main submitters (CA ANZ, CTG, PwC, KPMG, EY, DEG) to discuss their submissions and explain the proposals. We will continue to work with these and other submitters to develop the detailed design of the legislation.

16\. This report advises on the important issues relevant to the main policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet in July. Following these decisions, we will design the detail of the proposals, on which there will be further targeted consultation in August to October of this year. A number of the submissions related to the detail of the proposals or to Inland Revenue’s operational approach. For example many taxpayers asked that Inland Revenue develop practical guidance on how the proposed new rules would apply. We will advise you on these detailed design and operational submissions following the next round of consultation.

### General views on the proposals

17\. The proposed transfer pricing and PE avoidance rules are targeted at countering large multinationals engaged in aggressive tax practices.

18\. Some submitters welcomed these proposals as a positive step by the Government to ensure that all large multinationals pay their fair share of tax (Oxfam and CTU).

19\. Most submitters accepted in principle the need for measures to address the transfer pricing and permanent establishment (PE) avoidance issues identified in the discussion document. However, they did raise issues with certain features of the proposed measures and made suggestions to make them more workable and better targeted. Many submissions focused on when the PE avoidance rule would apply and when Inland Revenue would reconstruct a transfer pricing arrangement.

20\. Other submitters argued that the proposals will have a detrimental effect on New Zealand being an attractive investment destination and should not be implemented (CTG, CA ANZ, and NFTC). These submitters argued that the proposals introduce complex and onerous rules which may incentivise foreign companies to remove their existing personnel from New Zealand, which would reduce GDP and lower employment levels.

21\. We disagree with these submissions. First, the majority of multinationals operating in New Zealand are compliant and the Government is committed to making sure New Zealand remains an attractive place for them to do business. However, there are some multinationals that set out to circumvent New Zealand’s tax rules. These multinationals should not be allowed to exploit weaknesses in the transfer pricing and PE rules to achieve a competitive advantage over more compliant multinationals or domestic firms. Second, it is highly unlikely that foreign companies will remove their existing personnel from New Zealand as a result of these proposals. Most of the affected foreign companies are dependent on having personnel in New Zealand to arrange their sales. Without personnel on the ground, they would not be able to service their New Zealand market. It is also unlikely that they would cease to operate in New Zealand altogether.

22\. The transfer pricing and PE proposals introduce a set of rules to reinforce the integrity and efficiency of the tax system so that there is a level playing field for multinationals and domestic firms.

### PE avoidance

#### Summary of proposed rule

23\. Where a DTA applies, New Zealand is only able to tax a non-resident on its income from sales to New Zealand customers if the non-resident has a PE in New Zealand. The discussion document proposed a rule to prevent non-residents from structuring their affairs to avoid having such a permanent establishment in New Zealand where one exists in substance.

24\. The rule proposed in the discussion document would deem a non-resident to have a PE in New Zealand if:

*   the non-resident supplies goods or services to a person in New Zealand;
*   the non-resident is part of a multinational group with more than EUR €750m of consolidated global turnover;
*   a related entity (either associated or commercially dependant) carries out an activity in New Zealand in connection with that particular sale for the purpose of bringing it about;
*   some or all of the sales income is not attributed to a New Zealand PE of the non-resident; and
*   the arrangement defeats the purpose of the relevant DTA’s PE provisions.

#### General reaction

25\. Submitters were not strongly opposed to a new PE rule in principle, with 2 submitters supporting the proposal (Oxfam and NZCTU) and the remainder mostly accepting the need (or inevitability) for some form of PE avoidance rule. However 7 submitters considered that we should not adopt any PE avoidance rule at this stage. These submitters argued that:

*   The OECD’s Multilateral Instrument (MLI)[\[3\]](#footnote3)
     includes a widened definition of a PE so any PE avoidance issues should be addressed under this. Alternatively, we should defer consideration of a PE avoidance rule until the impact of the OECD’s BEPS measures has been determined (EY, AmCham, DEG, CA ANZ).
*   The rule is unnecessary, as any current issues with PE avoidance can be addressed through our transfer pricing rules (NZLS, DEG, CA ANZ).
*   The rule will apply to non-abusive transactions, is outside the OECD’s BEPS initiatives, and will erode taxpayer certainty (CTG, NFTC, Deloitte).

26\. In response to these submissions, we consider that:

*   Where the widened definition of a PE in the MLI applies, a domestic PE avoidance rule would not be necessary. However the widened definition applies only under the MLI where both countries choose to adopt it. We are aware that most countries do not intend to adopt the widened definition under the MLI (including the US, the UK, and Australia). We note that the widened definition is being added to the OECD’s model treaty, and we expect it to eventually be incorporated into most of our DTAs (including DTAs with countries that did not elect to adopt the widened definition under the MLI) as each DTA is bilaterally renegotiated. However it will be many years before all our DTAs are bilaterally renegotiated. Therefore a domestic rule is necessary now to address PE avoidance by taxpayers resident in these countries.
*   The principles underlying transfer pricing and PE profit attribution, while similar, are not the same. The transfer pricing rules seek to determine an arm’s length price for transactions between related entities. The PE profit attribution rules seek to determine what part of an enterprise’s overall profit should be attributed to a PE in a particular country. The OECD guidance is clear that profit may still be attributable to a PE even after the correct application of the transfer pricing rules (depending on the circumstances). In addition, deeming a PE to exist will allow us to charge non-resident withholding tax on any royalties paid by the non-resident that relate to its New Zealand sales. This will not be possible under the transfer pricing rules. Accordingly application of the transfer pricing rules alone would not produce the correct amount of tax for New Zealand in many cases where a PE is being avoided.
*   Our proposed PE avoidance rule is broadly consistent with the OECD’s BEPS initiatives, as it should have a similar effect to the widened PE definition in the MLI. We recommend below some changes to our PE rule which should ensure it is better targeted at abusive transactions. Finally we acknowledge that the rule will reduce taxpayer certainty, which is undesirable. However we consider that this disadvantage is outweighed by the benefits of the proposed rule in terms of protecting the integrity of the tax system, fairness, revenue, and economic efficiency.

27\. We therefore recommend proceeding with the introduction of a PE avoidance rule.

#### Threshold for the application of the new measures

28\. The discussion document proposed that the PE avoidance rule would only apply to arrangements which defeated the purpose of the PE provisions in the applicable DTA. The explanation of this test in the discussion document focussed on the economic substance of the non-resident’s activity in New Zealand, and particularly whether a PE would arise if the non-resident and its local New Zealand subsidiary were treated as a single entity.

29\. A majority of submitters (EY, NFTC, DEG, Deloitte, CTG, CA ANZ, PwC, KPMG, Russell McVeagh) considered that this proposed PE avoidance test was too broad. They considered that it would widen the PE definition in substance rather than just prevent its abuse. They were also concerned that it could capture ordinary commercial arrangements and discourage foreign investment. Some submitters considered that the PE avoidance rule should either be targeted at abusive or artificial arrangements or should adopt the wording of the OECD’s widened PE avoidance definition in the MLI (CTG, PwC, Deloitte, CA ANZ, DEG).

30\. We agree with these submissions. We recommend that the rule be more narrowly targeted so that it does not apply to ordinary commercial arrangements, and so does not unduly discourage non-residents from doing business in New Zealand.

31\. Submitters suggested two options for narrowing the scope of the rule:

*   **Option 1:** Replace the current requirement that the rule defeats the purpose of the PE article in a DTA with a purpose of avoidance test. Under this new test, the rule would only apply if the relevant arrangement had a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. This would target the rule at avoidance transactions and align the rule with similar rules in Australia and the UK, each of which requires the taxpayer to have a purpose of avoiding tax. Because it is an express anti-avoidance rule, it would also be consistent with our DTAs. The rule would apply more broadly in the context of PE avoidance than our current general anti-avoidance rule.[\[4\]](#footnote4)
    
*   **Option 2:** Replace the PE avoidance rule proposed in the discussion document with the OECD’s widened definition of a PE, which we would add to our domestic legislation as a standalone rule. The OECD’s widened definition provides that a PE arises if a representative of the non-resident plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the non-resident. The widened definition also includes some supplementary provisions to counter particular avoidance strategies observed overseas. This rule is an objective test and it is the result of the OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, which included a report on “Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status” (Action 7). As indicated by the title of the report, the purpose of the rule is to prevent the artificial avoidance of PE status under various BEPS strategies. The widened PE definition would apply in respect of a DTA regardless of whether the other country elected to adopt it under the MLI. This test would be more certain for foreign investors than option 1 and would replicate the OECD’s recommended measure.

32\. We consider that either option would be effective in addressing the PE avoidance arrangements we have seen in New Zealand. Accordingly adoption of either option would not affect the previously forecast revenue estimates for the measures. We would like to further evaluate the merits of the two options before recommending one.

#### Interaction with MLI

33\. Several submitters questioned how our proposed PE avoidance rule would interact with the widened definition of a PE in the MLI. As noted above, some submitters considered that PE avoidance should be dealt with under the MLI (EY, AmCham, DEG, CA ANZ). Other submitters questioned how our domestic PE rule would work in relation to a DTA that included the MLI’s widened PE definition, or considered that any domestic rule should be consistent with the OECD’s BEPS actions (KPMG, CTG, NZLS, PWC).

34\. There is merit in these submissions. The widened PE definition from the MLI should address PE avoidance, provided it is included in the relevant DTA. Accordingly it is not necessary for our domestic PE avoidance rule to apply where there is an applicable DTA that includes the MLI’s widened PE definition. We also generally prefer to follow the OECD’s approach where that is practicable.

35\. Accordingly, we recommend that our domestic PE avoidance rule apply only in respect of DTAs that do not include the widened PE definition from the MLI (or an equivalent definition that is negotiated bilaterally).

#### Overriding DTAs

36\. A majority of submitters considered that our PE rule should not override our DTAs (CTG, KPMG, CA ANZ, NFTC, NZLS, EY, Russell McVeagh, DEG). This is because DTAs are important to international trade, and New Zealand exporters also need to rely on them. Submitters also considered that we should not depart from the OECD’s agreed BEPS measures, particularly where the country of the non-resident has declined to adopt the widened PE definition in the MLI.

37\. The OECD’s Commentary to the Model Tax Convention (the Commentary) states that, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between domestic anti-avoidance provisions and the provisions of a DTA. It also confirms that States are not obliged to grant the benefits of a DTA if the DTA has been abused (noting that this should not be lightly assumed). In the present case, our first option for a PE rule is an anti-avoidance measure that only applies if there is a purpose of tax avoidance. Accordingly it should not conflict with New Zealand’s DTAs in the vast majority of cases. The second option is also an anti-abuse measure however it functions as a black letter amendment to the terms of our PE articles. Accordingly we would like to further consider its consistency with our DTAs before deciding which option to recommend.

38\. In either case we consider that the PE rule should expressly override our DTAs. This is to simplify the application of the rule. Otherwise it would be necessary to show that the application of the rule was consistent with a DTA in each particular case. This would be a time-consuming and resource intensive exercise. It would significantly undermine the practical effectiveness of the rule. We also note that both the UK and Australian PE avoidance rules override their DTAs.

39\. We also consider that the PE rule should apply in respect of DTAs where the other country has elected not to include the widened PE definition from the MLI. The existing position is that anti-avoidance rules are generally consistent with DTAs. We do not consider that a country’s decision not to adopt the widened PE definition in the MLI changes this principle. In particular, we do not consider that such a decision evinces a common intent that a DTA can now be abused by the taxpayer of either jurisdiction.

40\. We note that in relation to the second option (which incorporates the OECD’s widened PE definition into our domestic legislation), the widened PE definition will be added to the OECD’s model tax treaty, and so represents what the OECD considers to be the current best practice. Countries may also not want to adopt such a provision multilaterally under the MLI, but may be happy to agree to such a provision in bilateral negotiations with New Zealand (such as Australia). Accordingly, the failure to adopt the widened PE definition under the MLI does not mean that they object to such a provision in their DTA with New Zealand.

### Source rules

#### PE avoidance source rule

41\. The rule proposed in the discussion document stated that an amount of income would have a New Zealand source if we had a right to tax the income under the PE or royalty article of a DTA. Only 2 submitters opposed this rule, on the basis that it was circular (CTG) and could result in a breach of our DTAs (EY). We do not consider there is any circularity to the proposal – the proposal will ensure that we are not prevented from taxing income under our domestic legislation where we have an agreed right to tax that income under our DTAs. Also, for this reason, the rule would never apply in contravention of our DTA rights.

42\. We note the rule proposed in the discussion draft applied only in respect of income covered by the PE article and the royalty article of our DTAs. This was because we were only aware of issues with our domestic legislation in relation to these kinds of income. On reflection, we consider the rule should apply in respect of all types of income we can tax under an applicable DTA (e.g. interest, dividends, income from alienation of property, etc.). This is sensible because it ensures that we do not negotiate taxing rights under a DTA that we cannot exercise because of differences in the formulation of the source rules in our DTAs and our domestic law source rules. This is the same position which Australia takes under its DTAs, and the proposed rule already applies to all income covered by an article of our DTA with Australia. Since we are broadening our original proposal we should consult further with stakeholders as part of the generic tax policy process (GTPP).

#### Anti-avoidance source rule

43\. The rule proposed in the discussion document provides that a non-resident’s income would have a source in New Zealand (and therefore give us a domestic law taxing right) if it would have a New Zealand source, treating the non-resident’s multinational group as a single entity. This would stop non-residents from dividing their activities between wholly-owned group members in order to prevent their income from having a New Zealand source.

44\. Some submitters considered that this rule should not proceed in its current form (CTG, EY, CA ANZ, Russell McVeagh). They considered that it was unnecessary, as our existing source rules were already adequate. Submitters also considered that the rule was too broad and struggled to understand how it would work in practice. Two submitters noted that a more targeted rule could be more appropriate (CA ANZ, EY).

45\. The rule was partly intended to address an existing technical issue with the source rules, and partly intended to prevent possible future attempts to circumvent the source rules. In light of submitters’ concerns, we consider that the rule should be more narrowly targeted at the existing issues with the source rules. In particular, the rule should broadly provide that, where a group member carries on a non-resident’s business in New Zealand, the non-resident is also deemed to carry on business in New Zealand to that extent. This will prevent non-residents from being able to avoid a New Zealand source for their income from sales to New Zealand customers by arranging for a wholly owned subsidiary to carry out their local business activities. If the rule applied, only the portion of the sales income that is attributable to the group member’s activities in New Zealand would generally be taxable here.

#### Life insurance rules / FIF rules

46\. Life insurance premiums can be used to shift income out of New Zealand. As such, the Income Tax Act denies a deduction for reinsurance premiums when the corresponding premium income is not taxable in New Zealand.

47\. Life insurance can also be used as a type of investment savings. For this reason, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules apply to life insurance policies owned by New Zealand residents.

48\. New Zealand’s DTAs typically preserve New Zealand’s entitlement to tax insurance premiums whether or not a permanent establishment exists. However, under New Zealand’s DTAs with Canada, Russia, and Singapore, New Zealand is unable to tax life insurance premiums if a resident of those countries does not have a permanent establishment in New Zealand. New Zealand’s inability to tax life insurance premium income under these DTAs means that the rules denying reinsurance deductions and the application of the FIF rules may not work as intended when the premium is paid to a non-resident life insurer or reinsurer from these countries. Furthermore, non-resident life insurers who are residents of Canada, Russia, or Singapore, are able to receive an unintended tax advantage by being able to deduct life reinsurance premiums.

49\. The discussion document proposed an amendment to the Income Tax Act to specifically provide that no deduction is available for the reinsurance of policies if the premium income on that policy is not taxable in New Zealand (including under a DTA). An amendment to the definition of a FIF was also proposed to specifically provide that New Zealand residents are subject to the FIF rules in respect of any policies that are not subject to New Zealand tax under the life insurance rules or any applicable DTA.

50\. Submitters argued that the life insurance proposals should not proceed as they represent an unfair and unilateral reconstruction of the tax treatment of life insurance premiums (KPMG, EY, Deloitte, CTG, CA ANZ). Submitters argued that during treaty negotiations with Canada, Russia, and Singapore, New Zealand must have either accepted to change its standard practice of taxing insurance premiums, or inadvertently made the change – neither reason providing sufficient justification for the proposals. The submitters considered that the correct approach would be for New Zealand to renegotiate the relevant provision with Canada, Russia, and Singapore.

51\. Submitters also argued that the proposals unfairly penalise the reinsured party by placing a significant burden on them to have completeness of information regarding their insurer’s place of tax residence and PE status in NZ (CTG and Deloitte). Should the proposals advance, Deloitte considers that appropriate grandparenting should be provided.

52\. We agree with the submissions in part. We consider that the proposed reinsurance amendments are necessary to ensure that they apply as intended. These proposals will also ensure that life insurance businesses operating out of Canada, Russia, and Singapore will no longer benefit from more favourable tax treatment compared with those operating in New Zealand or other countries. However, we recommend that the FIF life insurance changes do not proceed as there is little revenue risk involved and a significant likelihood of accidental non-compliance under the proposed changes. This means that any life insurance policies issued in New Zealand by life insurers from Singapore, Russia, and Canada would remain exempt from the foreign investment fund rules.

### Transfer Pricing

53\. Transfer pricing rules guard against multinationals using related party payments to shift profits offshore by requiring these payments to be consistent with an arm’s length/market price that unrelated parties would agree to. Chapter 5 of the discussion document outlined a package of proposals to strengthen the transfer pricing rules.

#### General reaction

54\. Three submitters (CTG, EY, KPMG) considered the transfer pricing proposals were unnecessary as the existing transfer pricing rules were sufficient. We disagree as New Zealand’s existing transfer pricing legislation would not allow us to fully implement the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines (that were developed to combat BEPS) as it does not explicitly require transfer pricing practices to align with the actual economic activity (if this differs from the legal contracts) and does not include a reconstruction provision.

55\. Other submitters generally accepted that there was a need to update New Zealand’s transfer pricing legislation so it aligns with the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines and Australia’s transfer pricing rules. However, as expected, there was strong opposition to the administrative proposals to extend the time bar for transfer pricing adjustments to 7 years and to shift the burden of proof onto the taxpayer for providing evidence that they comply with the transfer pricing rules.

#### Extending the time bar to 7 years

56\. Inland Revenue currently has 4 years from the end of the tax year in which a taxpayer files an income tax return to investigate and amend the tax position taken by the taxpayer in their return. This 4 year limit is known as the time bar. The discussion document proposed that transfer pricing issues should have a longer time bar of 7 years (consistent with fact that Australia and Canada have 7 year time bars for transfer pricing).

57\. Eight of the 15 submitters (CTG, PwC, KPMG, CA ANZ, EY, AMP (NZ), Russell McVeagh, NFTC, DEG, NZLS) opposed this proposal. The main reasons for opposing a longer time bar were:

*   A longer time bar increases uncertainty for taxpayers and does not promote efficiency in transfer pricing disputes (will delay timely resolution).
*   The discussion document argued that a longer time bar is needed because transfer pricing issues are complex and fact-specific, but this is also true of other areas of tax such as tax avoidance, the capital/revenue boundary and complex financial arrangements.
*   Most countries have the same time bar for transfer pricing and other tax issues, and in most cases this was less than 7 years.
*   If a transfer pricing dispute is resolved in favour of Inland Revenue, the taxpayer will be at risk of double tax in jurisdictions where the time bar has already passed.
*   Imposing a longer time bar is inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation goals of real-time review and helping taxpayers get it right from the start.
*   Inland Revenue should invest more resource into its transfer pricing team if the investigations are taking longer than 4 years.

58\. Officials are not convinced by these arguments and consider there is still a good justification for extending the time bar to 7 years for transfer pricing issues. There are a number of reasons why transfer pricing investigations can take more time than other types of tax investigation:

*   The factual review for transfer pricing cases is typically much more detailed than other tax issues and may involve discussions with numerous staff and the taxpayer, in addition to the usual review of legal documents etc. It may also involve wider industry interviews, e.g. with regulators, competitors, customers etc. to provide the necessary market context. The relevant documentation or information may be held outside New Zealand which can delay when this information is provided to Inland Revenue.
*   Assessing compliance with the arm’s length principle requires very detailed and specific information and analysis of how a comparable transaction between unrelated parties would have been conducted. This means there are effectively two parallel investigations – determining the facts of the actual related party transaction and identifying a comparable arm’s length arrangement.
*   Certain complex transactions require input from market experts typically based overseas. Vetting, engaging, and briefing an overseas expert takes time. Depending on the nature of the issues, the expert’s opinion may also take some time to prepare.
*   There is usually a range of possible answers in transfer pricing cases and this leads to more frequent and extensive discussions and negotiations throughout the process. Taxpayers generally wish to engage in discussions and negotiations (and exchange issues papers) prior to entering the disputes process. There are also often settlement discussions during the disputes process that can go on for many months at a time.
*   There may also be numerous and lengthy discussions with treaty partners in the course of a transfer pricing investigation to not only obtain additional information but also endeavour to resolve differences without double taxation arising.

59\. Currently, most transfer pricing investigations take less than 4 years and we expect this will continue under the proposed new rules. The longer time bar is therefore only expected to be relevant in a handful of complex cases. However, it is important to have more time available to identify, investigate and resolve these cases as they can involve very large sums of tax.

60\. One concern with a longer time bar is that it could lead to more years of income being part of a dispute, which could reduce incentives for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to agree on a settlement to the dispute. However, Inland Revenue is increasingly picking up the vast majority of the arrangements it wants to challenge on a relatively real-time basis (often year two, taking into account filing timeframes which generally mean a return is not filed until the start of year two) which should lead to fewer years being under dispute.

61\. New Zealand is adopting Article 17 of the MLI which will update our DTAs so that they require our DTA partners to make appropriate corresponding adjustments in transfer pricing cases. This will ensure that double taxation does not arise due to New Zealand making a transfer pricing adjustment, even if this is beyond the other country’s time bar.

62\. This also means that if New Zealand has a shorter time bar than other countries, we could be disadvantaged as we would be required to provide tax relief under our treaties, but would not be able to make tax positive adjustments in respect of those same years. In particular, Australia has a 7 year time bar for transfer pricing so New Zealand must provide up to 7 years of tax relief to Australian businesses, whereas we can only currently go back 4 years when adjusting the transfer prices of taxpayers that owe tax to New Zealand. Our DTA with Australia provides that both countries are allowed to propose transfer pricing adjustments up to 7 years after tax returns have been filed.

63\. Having a longer time bar for transfer pricing does not preclude having shorter time bars in other areas where there is less risk or complexity. The discussion document noted that Australia and Canada both have 7 year time bars for transfer pricing even though their standard time bars are 4 years. Australia also has a shorter 2 year time bar for individuals and small businesses. Therefore we consider that having a longer time bar for transfer pricing is not inconsistent with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation objectives.

64\. Many submitters have suggested that as an alternative to extending the time bar, Inland Revenue should look to better resource its transfer pricing team. Inland Revenue may need to recruit a larger team of transfer pricing specialists to investigate transfer pricing issues. However, we do not agree that additional transfer pricing specialists would eliminate the need for a longer time bar. The longer time bar will only be necessary in a small number of complex cases. These cases require commissioning of overseas experts and multiple rounds of site visits, interviews and negotiations with taxpayers. These tasks are best performed by a small project team working in a logical sequence. Trying to use a larger team to simultaneously perform each task would be unlikely to shorten the overall time needed to resolve the dispute. Finally, it can be difficult for Inland Revenue to recruit or retain the relevant expertise as there is high global demand for transfer pricing experts.

#### Shifting the burden of proof from Inland Revenue to the taxpayer

65\. The discussion document proposed shifting the burden of proof onto the taxpayer for providing evidence that their related party dealings are consistent with those that would be agreed by third parties operating at arm’s length.

66\. This proposal is consistent with the fact that burden of proof is already on the taxpayer for other tax matters. Self-assessment is at the heart of how New Zealand’s tax system works and helps encourage taxpayers to comply with the law and get it right from the start rather than having to subsequently amend their tax position as a result of an Inland Revenue investigation.

67\. Four submitters (CTG, KPMG, CA ANZ, Russell McVeagh) argued that the burden of proof for transfer pricing should remain with Inland Revenue. The main arguments raised by submitters were:

*   Shifting the burden of proof will increase compliance costs, especially in conjunction with the other transfer pricing proposals.
*   Inland Revenue should provide more guidance on what transfer pricing documentation they expect to be prepared (or explicitly mandate for transfer pricing documentation to be prepared), rather than shift the burden of proof.
*   The current ability for Inland Revenue to shift the burden of proof to the taxpayer when a transfer pricing position is undocumented is an effective way to encourage documentation.
*   Inland Revenue may have better information on comparables than the taxpayer and should not be able to use secret information (that it cannot share with the taxpayer) to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position.

68\. The burden of proof is on the taxpayer for transfer pricing matters in most OECD and G20 countries, including Australia. This means most multinationals already prepare transfer pricing documentation that satisfies the burden of proof for other countries. For this reason, the additional compliance costs that would be imposed under New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules from shifting the burden of proof onto taxpayers is not expected to be substantial.

69\. When New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules were introduced in 1995, most multinational transactions in New Zealand closely resembled easily observable market transactions. Two decades later, related party transactions and transfer pricing practices have become a lot more complex, specialised and sophisticated.

70\. Multinationals typically have better information than Inland Revenue on market prices in their industry and on their supply chains. For this reason they are better placed to identify a relevant uncontrolled comparable and apply the arm’s length principle.

71\. One submitter (KPMG) suggested the legislation should explicitly mandate the type of transfer pricing documentation that taxpayers have to prepare as an alternative to shifting the burden of proof. Others (EY, PwC, AmCham) suggested that Inland Revenue should prepare additional guidance on what documentation would be required to satisfy the burden of proof.

72\. We consider that taxpayers are best placed to consider the amount of documentation or evidence that is required to demonstrate compliance (as this will vary based on the tax effect or materiality of the transaction). Imposing a minimum standard for documentation could impose additional compliance costs in respect of lower-risk transactions (which may require no or little documentation) and may not lead to adequate documentation for higher-risk transactions (which should require a higher standard to discharge the burden of proof). The OECD has recently issued extensive international guidance on transfer pricing documentation, which New Zealand endorses, and Inland Revenue has issued some short supplementary guidance as well.

73\. Three submitters (CTG, KPMG, Russell McVeagh) raised concerns that Inland Revenue could potentially use information that it held on comparable transactions to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position and then not share this information with the taxpayer on the ground that it was tax secret. They considered this was a reason why the burden of proof should remain with Inland Revenue (either more generally, or just in this particular scenario).

74\. However, in the 22 years since the transfer pricing rules were introduced, Inland Revenue has never used a secret comparable to adjust a taxpayer’s transfer pricing position. In practice, because New Zealand is a small market, Inland Revenue mainly sources comparable information from commercial databases that can also be purchased/accessed by taxpayers (as opposed to its own tax information). In any case, if Inland Revenue did in fact ever make an adjustment based on information that was not accessible to the taxpayer, it would be able to anonymise the relevant information in order to share the basis for the adjustment with the affected taxpayer.

#### The test for reconstructing a transfer pricing arrangement

75\. Consistent with Australia’s rules and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines, the discussion document proposed providing Inland Revenue with a power to reconstruct transfer pricing arrangements which are not commercially rational because they include unrealistic terms that third parties would not be willing to agree to.

76\. Two submitters (TPEQ and Russell McVeagh) argued that New Zealand should not include a specific reconstruction rule in our transfer rules as New Zealand’s existing general anti-avoidance rule already allows the Commissioner to challenge and reconstruct tax avoidance arrangements. We note that the general anti-avoidance rule would be more difficult to apply as it requires an explicit purpose of tax avoidance, whereas the proposed rule (and the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines) would not. Therefore, we consider that a specific transfer pricing reconstruction rule is still necessary.

77\. Eight of the 15 submitters (CTG, KPMG, TPEQ, CA ANZ, EY, PwC, AMP (NZ), Deloitte) raised concerns about the potentially broad scope of the proposed reconstruction rule and submitted that the proposed reconstruction rule should only apply in the “exceptional circumstances” described in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.

78\. The discussion document proposed that we adopt Australia’s provision which allows transfer pricing arrangements to be reconstructed when: _“independent entities dealing wholly independently with one another in comparable circumstances would not have entered into the actual commercial or financial relations.”_

79\. Australia’s rule was developed in 2012 before the OECD’s new transfer pricing guidelines were published in 2015. The OECD guidelines suggest that tax authorities should only reconstruct those arrangements that: _“differ from those which would have been adopted by independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner in comparable circumstances, thereby preventing determination of a price that would be acceptable to both of the parties...”_

80\. Although Australia’s test is intended to be applied on a consistent basis to the test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines, Australia’s wording is potentially broader, which creates uncertainty for taxpayers. Unlike the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines, it doesn’t explicitly specify that the original arrangement should be commercially irrational to the extent that third parties wouldn’t be able to reach such an agreement.

81\. New Zealand endorses the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines. Therefore in order to provide more certainty for taxpayers, we recommend that New Zealand’s legislative test for reconstructing an arrangement should be based on the corresponding test in the OECD’s transfer pricing guidelines.

### Administrative measures

#### Summary of measures

82\. The discussion document proposed measures to help Inland Revenue investigate and assess un-cooperative multinationals. These included the following proposals:

*   If a large multinational (over EUR €750m worldwide revenues) does not cooperate with Inland Revenue, then Inland Revenue may more readily issue a notice of proposed adjustment, and any subsequent documents under the disputes process, based on the information available to Inland Revenue at the time.
*   Any disputed tax must be paid by a large multinational during the disputes process, rather than at the end of the final Court case. This only applies in respect of disputes over transfer pricing, the amount of New Zealand-sourced income, and the application of a DTA.
*   Tax payable by any member of a large multinational can be collected from any wholly-owned group member (or the related New Zealand entity in case of the new PE avoidance rule).
*   Inland Revenue will be empowered to collect more information from large multinationals, including information about its various non-resident group members. If the multinational does not provide the information, then penalties may be payable and Inland Revenue will be expressly authorised to assess the taxpayer based on the information available to it.

#### General reaction

83\. Submitters were generally accepting of some form of administrative measures in relation to uncooperative multinationals.

84\. Submitters did note that any legislation needed to make it clear when the measures applied, and there needed to be sufficient safeguards (both in terms of legislative requirements and Inland Revenue’s internal processes) to ensure the measures were not misapplied (KPMG, PwC, TPEQ, AMP (NZ), Russell McVeagh, NFTC, DEG). Some submitters also stated that the rules should be narrowly targeted (CTG, NZLS, DEG, NFTC, PwC), while others called for an increase in Inland Revenue’s resources to help taxpayers comply with the new BEPS measures (EY, CA ANZ, PwC). We note these concerns and will consider them when we design the detail of the measures.

#### Earlier payment of disputed tax

85\. Submitters strongly opposed the proposal to advance the time at which multinationals must pay any tax in dispute (KPMG, EY, Russell McVeagh, NFTC, DEG, NZLS, AMP (NZ), CTG). Some submitters argued that the proposal to make large multinationals pay disputed tax upfront was unnecessary. This was because Inland Revenue already charges “use of money interest” on tax owing, which provides a strong incentive for multinationals to pay any tax that is in dispute. In addition, the “use of money interest” paid by Inland Revenue to taxpayers on tax that is paid, but not legally owed, is significantly below market rates. This could unduly pressure taxpayers to settle.

86\. We agree with the views of submitters. The proposal was based on similar rules in Australia’s and the UK’s diverted profits taxes, and was intended to disincentivise taxpayers from deliberately prolonging disputes. However in light of the current “use of money interest” rates, we consider the rule is not necessary, and may instead unduly pressure taxpayers to settle. In addition such a rule appears better suited to a diverted profits tax regime, which is intended to incentivise taxpayers to pay the correct amount under the ordinary income tax rules. It seems less appropriate to include it in the ordinary income tax rules themselves.

87\. Accordingly we recommend that you do not proceed with the proposal.

#### Collection of tax from a local subsidiary

88\. Some submitters opposed the proposal to allow tax owing by a non-resident to be collected from a wholly owned subsidiary in New Zealand (or the related entity where the proposed PE avoidance rule applies) (CTG, PwC, Russell McVeagh). They questioned the practical need for such a rule, noted that it undermined the separate legal identity of corporate subsidiaries, and were concerned that it could cause risk assessment and banking covenant issues for lenders. One submitter (PwC) noted that if the rule was to proceed, it should apply only where the non-resident did not pay.

89\. We consider that such a rule is useful to allow the collection of tax from non-residents with no direct presence in New Zealand. We also think it is reasonable to apply the rule where the non-resident and the New Zealand subsidiary are part of the same wholly-owned group, as they are part of a single economic entity.

90\. Accordingly we recommend that the rule be retained. However we agree that the rule should only apply if the non-resident fails to pay the tax itself, and if the non-resident and the New Zealand entity are part of the same wholly-owned group. This should mitigate some of the submitters’ other concerns about risk assessment and banking covenant issues.

#### Collection of information

91\. A majority of submitters considered that the information collection powers should not proceed (CTG, Russell McVeagh, PwC, NZLS, NFTC, AMP (NZ), AmCham, DEG). Submitters variously considered that the rules were unnecessary in light of enhanced international information sharing protocols (such as country-by-country reporting), would be unworkable in practice, and unfairly penalised the New Zealand resident, who may not be able to get the information from their multinational group members. Some submitters also considered the issue should be addressed by Inland Revenue improving its relationship with other tax authorities (AMP (NZ), Russell McVeagh, AmCham, DEG, NZLS).

92\. Submitters raised further concerns about the new civil penalty of up to $100,000 for failing to provide requested information (which replaces the current $12,000 maximum criminal penalty) (CTG, CA ANZ, Russell McVeagh, PwC, NFTC, NZLS). Submitters considered the penalty should not be increased, given that the New Zealand subsidiary may not control the relevant information. If the penalty was to apply, they considered that only a court should be able to apply it. Finally they considered that directors and company employees should not be liable for the penalty personally.

93\. We recommend that the information gathering proposals proceed (with some changes), notwithstanding submitters’ views. In our view it is unacceptable for Inland Revenue investigations to be frustrated because a multinational group fails to provide information that is under its control.

94\. We do not think the New Zealand subsidiary’s difficulty in obtaining the information is a valid objection to the proposals. The New Zealand subsidiary is simply part of the multinational’s economic group. Therefore any consequences suffered by the New Zealand subsidiary are economically borne by the wider group and its shareholders. Accordingly our proposed measures effectively make the entity which controls the information liable for the economic consequences of its failure to provide that information.

95\. Further, the inability of the New Zealand subsidiary to legally require the information to be provided is the reason the proposed measures are necessary in the first place. There must be incentives for the multinational group to provide Inland Revenue with the required information in the absence of any legal ability to compel its provision. This means that any failure to provide the necessary information must be to the multinational’s detriment, not Inland Revenue’s. Otherwise multinationals will be incentivised not to provide such information.

96\. In relation to submitters’ other points:

*   The information shared under new international protocols, such as country by country reporting, is at a more general level and will not be sufficient for Inland Revenue to assess particular taxpayers. In fact, tax authorities are explicitly prohibited from using country-by-country reports as a basis for assessing taxpayers.
*   We are committed to improving our relationship with other tax authorities, but this will not practically address the current issue. The required information may not be held by the other tax authority, or it may be slow to obtain it.
*   The impracticality of a New Zealand subsidiary obtaining the required information from another group member seems to be caused by the internal processes and priorities of the multinational group. This impracticality may ameliorate once the inability to obtain the information starts having negative consequences for the group. In the event that it does not, it should be the multinational that bears the negative consequences arising from its own processes and priorities, rather than Inland Revenue.
*   Inland Revenue should be able to charge the penalty for not providing information, without requiring court approval. This is the normal position for civil penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994 and we do not see why an exception should be made here. Further, such a requirement would also significantly undermine the practicality of imposing the penalty, and it is difficult to see what additional benefit it would provide. We also note that Australia has recently introduced a similar penalty, with a maximum amount payable of $450,000. However we agree that taxpayers should be able to challenge the penalty once it is applied (in common with other similar penalties). We will ensure this is provided for when we design the detail of the measures.
*   We agree that the penalty should not apply to directors or employees of a company. We will clarify this when the detail of the rule is designed.

97\. We also want to ensure that the proposed information gathering powers and penalties are used by Inland Revenue in a reasonable manner. Accordingly we will consider ways to ensure this is the case when we design the rules in more detail.

### Application date and grandparenting APAs

#### Application date

98\. The planned application date for these measures is the income year starting on or after 1 July 2018.

99\. At the time the discussion document was released for public consultation, the planned application date was not publicly known.[\[5\]](#footnote5)
 For this reason, Inland Revenue has not received any submissions on the 1 July 2018 application date. However, some submitters expected the Government to seek an early application date and argued that it would be better to allow taxpayers time to consider the proposals and rearrange their affairs if necessary (PwC and CTG). PwC argued that the application date for these proposals should be no earlier than the first income year after 31 March 2019.

100\. Cabinet has already noted that the reforms are expected to apply from income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is based on the expectation that the legislation will be progressed to enactment before this date.

101\. We expect to receive more submissions on, and opposition to, the application date once the public becomes aware it is proposed to be 1 July 2018.

#### Grandparenting APAs

102\. A taxpayer is able to apply for an advance pricing agreement (APA), which is essentially a binding ruling confirming that the taxpayer’s planned transfer pricing positions are compliant with the transfer pricing rules for up to five years. Some submitters argued that existing APAs should be grandparented and allowed to run their course (PwC and CTG). This would reduce any uncertainty taxpayers may face in light of the changing environment. Without grandparenting, taxpayers may be disincentivised to engage with Inland Revenue in the interim as the high cost of obtaining an APA proportionally increases if the length of the APA is shortened.

103\. We agree with this submission. There is a high cost and a rigorous process involved in obtaining an APA and it would be unfair if the new proposals rescinded APAs issued before the 1 July 2018 application date – especially considering APAs only run for five years.

104\. We therefore recommend grandparenting all APAs existing prior to the 1 July 2018 application date.

2 The EUR €750m threshold has been chosen to align application of the proposed rule with the OECD’s threshold for requiring large multinationals to file country-by-country reports

3 The _Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures To Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting_. The MLI is a multilateral convention which is intended to prevent DTAs from being used to facilitate cross-border tax avoidance. The MLI amends a large number of each signatory’s DTAs at once, and so implements the OECD’s recommended DTA changes much faster than a succession of bilateral negotiations could. New Zealand signed the MLI on 7 June 2017.

4 This is because the general anti-avoidance rule applies only if an arrangement both uses the relevant provisions in a way that is outside of Parliament’s contemplation (the Parliamentary contemplation test) and has a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance. The proposed PE avoidance rule would not incorporate the Parliamentary contemplation test. Instead it would only require that an arrangement had a more than merely incidental purpose of tax avoidance.

### BEPS - Recommendations on addressing hybrid mismatch arrangements

* * *

### Executive summary

1\. This report seeks your:

*   agreement to detailed proposals for reforming the taxation of hybrid and branch mismatch arrangements, which implement in a New Zealand context Action 2 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) programme (“hybrid proposals”); and
*   approval to prepare a paper requesting Cabinet’s agreement to include the hybrid proposals in a BEPS tax bill.

#### Development of recommendations to date

2\. On 6 September 2016, the Government released a discussion document seeking feedback on proposals to address hybrid mismatch arrangements (T2016/1319 IR2016/342 refers). Broadly speaking, these are cross-border arrangements where the application of different countries’ tax rules results in either temporary or permanent non-taxation of income. Action 2 of the OECD BEPS Action Plan consists of recommendations for countries to address these arrangements. The discussion document proposals are closely modelled on the OECD recommendations as set out in its Final Report “Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements”.

 3. On 9 March we reported to you on submissions in response to this document, and sought your approval to undertake further consultation (T2017/406 IR2017/133 refers). We also sought your approval for that further consultation to include consultation on branch mismatches, which are closely related to hybrid mismatches and in relation to which the OECD has developed a report (the “Branch Report”) with recommendations closely based on the hybrid mismatch recommendations. The draft branch report was published in August 2016 and the final branch report is expected to be available shortly.

4\. We have now completed the further consultation. We have engaged in approximately a dozen workshops (with Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand) and attended various other meetings with private sector submitters (including the New Zealand Bankers’ Association). The consultation process was useful and we have made a number of changes to the proposals in the discussion document to take into account the concerns of submitters.

5\. In particular, we have given careful consideration to the position of New Zealand businesses with foreign branches, to ensure that the proposed hybrid rules do not deny these businesses the ability to use any foreign branch losses in New Zealand except where there is a high likelihood of double non-taxation.

6\. We have also consulted on the hybrid rules with counterparts in Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as the OECD secretariat, to ensure that the rules we propose work as intended, and do not give rise to inadvertent double taxation or non-taxation. Our proposals are very similar to Australia’s hybrid proposals. We note in this report any significant points on which we are aware of a difference.

#### Budget 2017 decision on foreign hybrid entity double deductions

7\. As part of Budget 2017, the Government decided to proceed with tax law changes to implement one aspect of the hybrid rules. This change is to restrict the ability of New Zealand businesses to use double deductions of foreign hybrid entities to reduce their tax liabilities in New Zealand (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This restriction is intended to apply to the most prevalent hybrid structure involving outbound investment by New Zealand based groups, which is the use of financing through Australian limited partnerships to achieve double deductions. It is intended to come into force as part of the general hybrid rules dealt with in this report. Nothing in this report is inconsistent with that decision.

#### Format of this report

8\. This report first provides a summary of the hybrids issue, the OECD solution, and officials’ recommendation that New Zealand should implement that solution. The most significant issues arising from the recommendations of this report are separately commented on starting at paragraph 23.

9\. The main body of the report goes through the OECD recommendations in numerical order. It discusses the general principles of each recommendation (or recommendations where they can logically be grouped) and then runs through a series of more detailed decisions that are consequential to the relevant principle. We consider these details will be important in creating a package that effectively counteracts the tax advantages of hybrid arrangements. There are some technical issues that we consider would still benefit from more consideration by officials before final decision are made. We have highlighted these areas both in the recommendations and in the body of the report.

10\. We have included two appendices which are respectively a tabulated overview of the OECD recommendations and a glossary of some of the technical terms of this report.

### Policy proposals

#### The issue: hybrid mismatches

11\. The objective of the OECD hybrid rules is to prevent double non-taxation which arises because countries tax entities or arrangements in different ways. Broadly speaking, this double non-taxation can arise because:

*   A payment is deducible to the payer in one country but not taxable to the payee in another country, if the reason for the mismatch is a conflict in tax rules. For example:
    *   The tax rules applying to a corporate payee may treat the payment as a dividend on a share (which in many countries is exempt if the payer is a foreign company related to the payee), even though the tax rules applying to the payer in its home country treat it as interest on a loan. This is a hybrid financial instrument mismatch, and is dealt with in OECD recommendations 1 and 2;
    *   The tax rules applying to the payee may treat the payer and the payee as a single taxable entity. An example of this is where a New Zealand unlimited liability company makes a deductible payment to its 100% US parent company. Under US tax rules, the New Zealand company can be treated as a branch of the US company, and therefore payments by the New Zealand company are disregarded for US tax purposes and so are not taxable. In this case the New Zealand company is a hybrid entity and the mismatch is dealt with by OECD recommendation 3; or
*   A single payment is deducted against different income in two countries. An example is where a company with a tax loss is treated as tax resident both by New Zealand and another country. Suppose that the company has a profitable sister company resident in New Zealand, and another profitable sister company in the other country. If the loss can be grouped against the income of the sister company in both New Zealand and the other country, then the loss has been used twice, which means the group has been taxed on less than its full amount of net income. This is a dual resident company mismatch, and it would be dealt with by OECD recommendation 7.

12\. Double non-taxation of this kind is difficult to deal with, because it arises even though both countries’ tax rules are being complied with. However, it clearly reduces fairness, causes harmful distortions in investment patterns, and results in an unintended reduction in aggregate tax revenues.

#### The OECD Action 2 response

13\. It is not feasible for all countries to have identical tax rules. Accordingly the only way to avoid double non-taxation of the kind referred to above is for countries to take a “tax without borders” approach by adopting, for cross border arrangements, tax rules which take into account in some way the tax rules of the other country involved. The OECD recommends two kinds of rules. The first kind are rules to reduce the likelihood of such mismatches arising. The second are “linking rules”, which apply only to arrangements between related parties (25% or more commonly owned) or structured arrangements (generally, arrangements between non-associated parties which intentionally exploit such mismatches). These linking rules apply to situations when there is a mismatch which has not been prevented by any other domestic rules, and provide for a primary and defensive response to the mismatch. This is explained further below.

14\. The OECD hybrid recommendations are as follows:

*   recommendation 1 deals with D/NI (deduction/no inclusion) payments under hybrid financial instruments which are either structured or between related parties;
*   recommendation 2 deals with deductible dividends, which can also produce a D/NI outcome;
*   recommendation 3 deals with D/NI payments by a branch or a hybrid payer entity to a person in the same control group (50% or commonly owned). A hybrid entity is treated as a separate person under its own tax rules, but disregarded/transparent under the rules of the payee country;
*   recommendation 4 deals with deductible payments to a reverse hybrid in an arrangement which is either structured or between members of a control group (a reverse hybrid is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in its own country but treated by an owner as a separate entity);
*   recommendation 5 proposes modifications to the existing domestic law rules to prevent reverse hybrid mismatches being available;
*   recommendation 6 deals with payments by branches or hybrid entities which are deductible in two countries;
*   recommendation 7 deals with payments by dual resident companies which can be deductible in two countries;
*   recommendation 8 deals with imported mismatch payments, which are ordinary payments that can be regarded as funding hybrid mismatch payments in the same group that do not directly impact on New Zealand;
*   Recommendations 9-12 support the earlier recommendations, and relate to design and definitions.

15\. An overview of the recommendations (with description and proposed counteraction) is in Appendix 1.

#### Submissions on the hybrids discussion document and our response

16\. In our previous report, we noted that while most submitters accepted the need for some hybrid rules, they also advocated a targeted or phased approach to New Zealand’s implementation of the OECD hybrids package, focussing on countering arrangements of the most concern to New Zealand.

17\. On balance, we are not convinced by these submissions, and recommend implementing the full suite of OECD rules, subject to modifications summarised below. We note that some of the rules only require minor legislative amendment, as they are already part of our law.

18\. The reasons for making this recommendation are set out fully in our report on submissions. In summary, we believe that enacting the OECD rules will:

*   improve fairness;
*   reduce harmful distortions in investment patterns; and
*   have a negligible effect on the cost of capital in New Zealand, particularly given the adoption of the rules by the UK, Australia and the EU;
*   (as compared to a partial adoption)
    *   avoid the need for further piecemeal amendments
    *   avoid giving the appearance of blessing those mismatches not dealt with;
*   involve acceptable compliance costs, particularly given
    *   the expectation that the effect of the rules in most cases will be to drive taxpayers to simpler non-hybrid arrangements (an important exception is branch structures, which are discussed in detail in this report);
    *   the adoption of similar rules by other countries.

19\. It is also important to appreciate that tax avoidance and tax planning using a range of hybrid structures is well known in New Zealand.

*   The bank conduit cases (_Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,834 and _BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR_ (2009) 24 NZTC 23,582), the optional convertible note structures (see _Alesco New Zealand Ltd v CIR_ (2013) 26 NZTC) and certain mandatory convertible note disputes are all examples of hybrid financial instruments, the subject of OECD recommendations 1 and 2. While they were all held to be ineffective under the general anti-avoidance provision, the process to get to that point was often protracted and economically inefficient. Hybrid rules would have made these transactions clearly tax-ineffective, and they would not have occurred if we had such rules;
*   Arrangements are currently in place which exploit hybrid mismatches but are not generally subject to the general anti-avoidance provision. Examples are:
    *   The deductible/frankable instruments issued by Australian owned banks out of New Zealand – again these are hybrid financial instruments subject to OECD recommendations 1 and 2;
    *   Financing through Australian limited partnerships, which generate double deductions – this is an example of a hybrid payer mismatch subject to OECD recommendation 6;
    *   Investment into New Zealand using New Zealand incorporated companies with unlimited liability. Unlimited liability companies can be treated as transparent for US tax purposes, leading to deduction/no inclusion mismatches dealt with under OECD recommendation 3;
*   Going further back, New Zealand has also experienced tax planning using dual resident company double deduction arrangements, subject to OECD recommendation 7. As a result we now have provisions which deal with most, but not all, of the hybrid mismatches which can arise from dual resident companies.

20\. Mismatches that we are not aware of being used more than rarely are structures that use:

*   payments to reverse hybrids subject to OECD recommendation 4, although under current settings there is no particular reason for Inland Revenue to look for them;
*   reverse hybrid entity mismatches to achieve double non-taxation of outbound investment (which would be subject to OECD recommendation 5.1);
*   imported mismatches (subject to OECD recommendation 8), where funding is channelled into New Zealand using a structure where there is a hybrid mismatch occurs higher up the funding chain, in a transaction not directly involving a New Zealand taxpayer. We are aware of one such structure and there may be more since, under current settings, there is no particular reason for Inland Revenue to look for them;
*   branch mismatches other than those subject to recommendation 6.

21\. Despite the fact that not all the types of mismatches dealt with in the OECD Report are currently seen in New Zealand, we consider that given the history touched on in paragraph 19, it is likely that some of the hybrid mismatches that are not addressed in New Zealand’s response will be exploited at some point in the future. Addressing everything comprehensively now means the process of amending the legislation will be a very large and complex project that will have to be undertaken alongside the other BEPS projects in a relatively short timeframe. However, as stated above, on balance officials recommend implementing a comprehensive set of hybrid rules.

22\. As will be evident from this report, the hybrid rules are complex, and require amendment to many aspects of our tax law. It is important to emphasise that for the vast majority of businesses they should have no impact whatsoever. The hybrid rules will have no impact on purely domestic firms owned by New Zealand residents. Even of those firms that are international, most do not enter into hybrid arrangements directly with New Zealand. Those who do have mostly done so because of the existing tax benefits. Once those benefits are removed, they will likely revert to much simpler and less costly structures. Where application of the rules is unavoidable, for example in relation to New Zealand businesses with foreign branches, we have paid particular attention to simplicity and compliance costs.

### Significant issues

23\. In this section we have highlighted the recommendations which are likely to attract most comment from submitters, and are therefore significant for more than merely technical reasons.

#### Application of hybrid rules to foreign branches

24\. Particularly in the course of our recent workshop consultations, submitters were very concerned about the fact that the hybrid rules can deny a New Zealand company the ability to reduce the tax on its New Zealand income by offsetting against that income the loss from a foreign branch.

25\. We have made various modifications to the OECD proposals to address this issue, including ensuring there is clearly no loss denial for taxpayers who have not entered into more complex structures. However, these modifications may not be to the satisfaction of all in the business or advisory community. In particular, some submitters wanted a de minimis rule of some sort, but we consider our suggested modification to make it clear that simple structures are not impacted by the hybrid rules makes this unnecessary.

#### Application of hybrid rules to foreign trusts

26\. We recommend that the hybrid rules should apply to income of a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust. This may make it less attractive for New Zealand residents to act as trustees of trusts with non-resident settlors and non-resident assets.

27\. As a result of the recommendations of the 2016 Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (Shewan Report), foreign trusts with New Zealand trustees have recently been required to comply with new and more thorough registration and disclosure requirements. This is likely to lead to a significant diminution in the number of such trusts, but we expect there will still be a sizeable number in existence – the number will not be known until 30 June, which is the due date for the new registrations.

28\. It is likely that the foreign trust service providers will object to foreign trusts being subject to the hybrid rules. This could be on:

*   a technical basis; and/or
*   the basis that they have now spent the time and effort to become fully compliant with internationally best-practice disclosure requirements. They may argue it would be unfair for the Government to then make a substantive tax change which for many would make their efforts redundant.

29\. We have outlined two options to address the potential hybrid mismatches arising from foreign trusts in paragraphs 123 to 128 below.

#### Imported mismatches

30\. The OECD recommends that countries include imported mismatch rules. These deny a deduction for a payment which is not directly a mismatch between the New Zealand payer and the payee, but which funds the payee (or a higher level “payee”) to make a payment in a hybrid mismatch to a person not directly transacting with the New Zealand taxpayer. Many submitters viewed this as over-reach, highly complex and impractical.

31\. We have responded to these submissions by recommending that the imported mismatch rule be enacted in full, but that its implementation be partially deferred.

*   When the payment from New Zealand is part of a structured arrangement which includes a hybrid mismatch, applying the imported mismatch rule is both more straightforward and more important to the integrity of the rules. We recommend that this structured aspect of the rule be implemented along with the rest of the hybrid rules.
*   When the payment from New Zealand is not part of a structured arrangement, applying the rule is more difficult and less important to the integrity of the New Zealand rules. Delaying the implementation of this rule until there are more countries that have hybrid rules would be sensible. We suggest a delay until 1 January 2020, by which date the EU countries, the UK, and Australia should all have hybrid rules.

#### Over-taxation by reason of the imposition of NRWT

32\. There is no doubt that if a deduction is permanently denied under the hybrid rules for a payment where New Zealand also imposes non-resident withholding tax, there is an element of over-taxation.

33\. The OECD does not recommend any adjustment be made to prevent this over-taxation. The UK has followed this approach, though it does not apply withholding tax as widely as New Zealand. Australia has not shown any interest in departing from the OECD approach. Accordingly, there are strong precedents for not addressing this issue.

34\. This approach can be justified on the basis that in the majority of cases there should be simpler alternatives to hybrid arrangements giving rise to NRWT. Furthermore, in the case of hybrid financial instruments, if the payee country adopts recommendation 2, there will be no denial under recommendation 1, and therefore no over-taxation. This is expected to resolve the issue in most cases where a New Zealand taxpayer makes a payment under a hybrid financial arrangement to an Australian payee.

35\. Nevertheless, we recommend that in the case of a hybrid financial instrument denial, we consider whether taxpayers could be permitted to treat the payment as a dividend. This would allow them to eliminate NRWT by attaching imputation credits to the payment. We need to give further consideration to the flow on effects of this recommendation.

36\. This recommendation is likely to go some way to addressing submitters’ concerns on hybrid financial instruments, if upon further consideration the measure proceeds. However, they may still be concerned about the treatment of other non-deductible amounts.

#### Grandparenting for certain instruments issued by banks to the public

37\. Generally the hybrid rules will apply to income and deductions arising after the effective date (expected to be some time on or after 1 July 2018), without regard to when the arrangement giving rise to that amount was entered into. This is the OECD recommendation, which was followed by the UK, and is proposed in the EU and Australia.

38\. We recommend an exception for certain hybrid instruments (“regulatory capital hybrids”) issued by banks and insurance companies either directly or indirectly to third party investors, mostly in Australia, in partial satisfaction of the capital requirements imposed on those companies by regulators. We recommend that instruments issued before the discussion document was released (6 September 2016) should not be subject to the hybrid rules until after the first date on which the issuer has an unconditional right to call or otherwise cancel the instruments without penalty.

39\. No special treatment was proposed for such instruments in our discussion document. However, we received submissions that such instruments either should not be subject to the hybrid rules at all, or that if they were so subject, there should be some grandparenting relief. Generally the latter submission was based on the publicly issued nature of the instruments. Mostly, the hybrid rules only apply to arrangements between parties who are related or in the same group.

40\. Australia announced that it would apply the hybrid rules to such instruments on its Budget day this year. For that reason, it has decided to grandparent regulatory capital instruments issued before 8 May 2017.

**\[Withheld under section 9(2)(b)(ii) of the Official Information Act 1982\]**

#### Opaque election for foreign hybrid entities

42\. The private sector has proposed that New Zealand investors in foreign hybrids be entitled to elect to treat the entity as tax opaque (like a company) in New Zealand. This would mean the New Zealand tax treatment would match the company treatment overseas. This opaque election would take the entity outside the scope of the rules and achieve roughly the same tax effect with lower compliance costs.

43\. This opaque election regime, if included in the rules, is most likely to be used by an Australian limited partnership, which is treated as flow-through by New Zealand such that its income and expenditure is attributed to its partners.

44\. Administratively, this would likely require some sort of declaration made to the Commissioner. Our current thinking is this declaration would be irrevocable and would continue to apply in the event of a change of ownership. Officials are still working through the details of this idea and whether to recommend its inclusion in the rules. If it does not form part of the final package, this may be viewed unfavourably by the private sector.

#### Application of rules to branch mismatch arrangements

45\. Taxpayers may be concerned to hear that “branch mismatches” are subject to the hybrid rules, since branches are relatively common for a business to have. Accordingly it may be important to be clear about the limits of branch mismatches.

46\. Branch mismatches arising from foreign branch losses are a double non-taxation risk. The remainder of the branch mismatch concerns are very unlikely to arise in a New Zealand context. They will apply mostly to deny a deduction for a payment made by a New Zealand taxpayer to a foreign member of the same control group, if that payment is not taxed to the foreign member due to conflicts in branch tax rules between two countries other than New Zealand.

#### De minimis rule

47\. Officials are not recommending a general de minimis for the hybrid rules. The reason for this is that we are comfortable that the proposals will ensure that simple offshore branch structures are not within the scope of the rules. In addition, a de minimis may cause additional complexity given that other countries are not proposing a de minimis in their hybrid mismatch rules.

48\. However, officials have provided for a specific de minimis-type rule for reverse hybrid entities established in New Zealand (likely to be limited partnerships and foreign trusts).

### Recommended action

We recommend that you:

(a) **Agree** that a Cabinet paper should be prepared recommending that the general principles of proposals to counteract hybrid mismatches in line with the recommendations in the OECD _Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements_ report are drafted into a bill, subject to the modifications and further detail contained in this paper.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

(b) **Agree** that the Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue for the detailed design relating to the general principles of the hybrid mismatch arrangements rules discussed in the recommendations below.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendations 1 and 2: general principles

(c) **Agree** the Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand implement the following general principles in accordance with OECD recommendations 1 and 2:

a. In relation to a payment under a financial instrument between related parties or that is a structured arrangement, and that results in a hybrid mismatch:

(i) deny a New Zealand payer a deduction for the payment to the extent it is not taxed to a non-resident payee (recommendation 1 primary rule);

(ii) if a non-resident payer has not been denied a deduction for the payment under similar rules, tax a New Zealand payee on the payment as ordinary income, with no entitlement to a tax credit (recommendation 1 defensive rule)

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

b. Expand the current rule which denies a dividend exemption to a deductible dividend paid by a foreign company to a New Zealand company so that it also applies if the foreign payer receives tax benefits similar in nature to a deduction (recommendation 2)

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendations 1 and 2: detailed design

(d) **Agree** to the following detailed rules to ensure that the general principles contained in recommendation (c) are effective:

a. A person who receives a payment which is deductible to the payer in another country should not be entitled to the benefit of any imputation credit attached to the payment.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

b. When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument issued by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency:

(i) the deduction denied should take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument which would otherwise be taken into account for tax purposes;

(ii) any net income from the instrument including any foreign currency fluctuations should be non-taxable.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

c. When the hybrid rules apply to a hybrid financial instrument held by a New Zealand taxpayer and denominated in a foreign currency, the person should not take into account any foreign currency fluctuations on the instrument, unless the instrument is an interest in a FIF which is subject to the comparative value method.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

d. To the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee country under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer should be allowed a deduction for the payment.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

e. If a New Zealand resident share lender lends shares in a transaction subject to the hybrid rules:

(i) Officials should give further consideration to whether the lender should be taxable on a dividend substitution payment (since such a payment will generally be deductible to the payer);

(ii) The lender not be allowed an imputation credit on any replacement payment in respect of New Zealand shares, if the share borrower is entitled to a deduction for that payment.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

f. If a person holds, pursuant to a share repo arrangement:

(i) a FIF interest, that person should be required to use the comparative value or attributed foreign income method to determine their income from the FIF interest;

(ii) New Zealand shares, where the borrower is a non-resident the person is not entitled to the benefit of an imputation credit attached to any replacement payment which is deductible to the borrower.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

g. OECD recommendation 1 should only apply to deny a deduction, or include amounts in income, as a result of a timing mismatch between resident and non-resident parties if:

(i) the mismatch arises on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or which has been extended to beyond 3 years; and

(ii) the mismatch is in relation to a payment which the lender is not accounting for, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and

(iii) it is not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

h. Officials give further consideration to the idea that, when a person makes a payment under a hybrid financial arrangement for which a deduction is denied under the hybrid rules, the person may choose at the time of making the payment to treat it as a dividend for purposes of both (but not one only) of the non-resident withholding tax and imputation credit rules.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

i. Amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is denied or deferred under OECD recommendation 1 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

j. Clarify, if necessary, that interest that is permanently denied a deduction under recommendation 1 and the debt under which that interest paid is disregarded for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules.

a. deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (recommendation 3 primary rule);

b. if the payment is made by a non-resident, who is not denied a deduction under similar rules, to a New Zealand resident, include the payment in ordinary income of the New Zealand resident (recommendation 3 defensive rule);

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendation 3: detailed design

(f) **Agree** to the following detailed rules to ensure that the general principles contained in recommendation (e) are effective:

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

b. dual inclusion income should be calculated in accordance with New Zealand tax principles on the income of the hybrid payer from activities that are taxed in New Zealand, except that it should not include income which is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

c. for purposes of the primary rule, full taxation of income under a CFC regime should:

(i) prevent income being treated as not taxable to a payee, and

(ii) qualify income as dual inclusion income where it is not otherwise taxed to the payee and is not sheltered from tax by a foreign tax credit.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

d. when an amount of deemed hybrid income is reversed in a later year because it is offset against dual inclusion income, that should be taken into account in determining the limit on the amount of foreign tax credit for which a New Zealand taxpayer applying the defensive rule is eligible

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

e. the ability to claim a deduction in relation to a later year due to future dual inclusion income should be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred (primary rule) or deemed expenditure arose (defensive rule)

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

f. amendments be made to the non-resident withholding tax rules so that in determining whether the rules require tax to be withheld on an accrual (rather than payments) basis, amounts for which a deduction is deferred under OECD recommendation 3 are not taken into account unless and until they are deducted

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

g. denial of a deduction for interest under recommendation 3 will not affect the amount of recognised interest or amount of debt for the purposes of the thin capitalisation rules;

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

h. a deduction be denied where a branch is treated in the branch country as making a deductible payment to its head office which is not a simple allocation of third party costs

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendation 4: general principle

(g) **Agree** that the Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand implement the following general principle, in accordance with recommendation 4, in relation to payments made to a reverse hybrid entity in the same control group as the payee or pursuant to a structured transaction, where the payment is deductible to the payer but not included as income under the tax law in the reverse hybrid establishment country or in the country of the entity or person investing in the reverse hybrid:

a. deny a deduction for the payment if made by a New Zealand payer (recommendation 4);

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendation 4: detailed design

(h) **Agree** to the following detailed rules to ensure that the general principles contained in recommendation (g) are effective:

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendation 5.1

(i) **Agree** that Officials give further consideration to whether New Zealand should modify its controlled foreign company (CFC) rules to include as attributable foreign income all income of the reverse hybrid which would have been taxed to the New Zealand investor had it derived the income directly but which is not taxed by the country of the entity because the entity is fiscally transparent (recommendation 5.1).

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendation 5.2

(j) **Agree** that the Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand restrict the tax transparency of reverse hybrids established under New Zealand law (recommendation 5.2) by taxing the partnership income of a non-resident partner of a New Zealand limited partnership if:

a. the total foreign-sourced income of the limited partnership exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total reverse hybrid income; and

b. the non-resident partner is in a control group with the partnership; and

c. the non-resident partner is not taxed on their share of the income of the partnership because their jurisdiction views the income as earned by the partnership and not the partner.

(k) **Agree** that:

_Inland Revenue recommendation_

The Cabinet paper in recommendation (a) should recommend that New Zealand restrict the tax transparency of reverse hybrids established under New Zealand law (recommendation 5.2) by taxing the foreign source beneficiary income of a non-resident beneficiary of a trust with a New Zealand trustee if:

a. the total foreign-sourced income of the trust exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the total reverse hybrid income; and

b. the non-resident beneficiary is in a control group with the trust; and

c. the non-resident beneficiary is not taxed on their share of the foreign source income of the trust in their residence country because that country views the income as earned by the trustee and not the beneficiary.

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

Or

_Treasury recommendation_

New Zealand should tax the New Zealand and foreign sourced income of a trustee if either the settlor is resident in New Zealand or the trustee is resident in New Zealand, subject to transitional relief for a foreign trustee that migrates to New Zealand to give time to arrange a new trustee for the trust.

Agreed/Not Agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

Or

The tax treatment of trusts should stay as it is.

Agree/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

#### OECD recommendation 6: general principles

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

e. the ability to claim a deduction in relation in a later year due to future dual inclusion income should be lost if there is a more than 51% change in a company’s ownership since the time the relevant deduction was incurred (recommendation 6 primary rule) or deemed expenditure arose (recommendation 6 defensive rule)

Agreed/Not agreed   Agreed/Not agreed

### Detailed recommendations

49\. We now set out our recommendations for implementing hybrid rules in New Zealand.

#### Hybrid financial instruments (OECD recommendations 1 and 2)

##### General

50\. We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules, in line with OECD recommendations 1 and 2, to prevent double non-taxation arising from hybrid financial instruments. The following diagram illustrates a typical hybrid financial instrument.

![A typical hybrid financial instrument issued between related parties A Co and B Co](-/media/8478fa9f7fcf4773bd706c7aa4f30e36.ashx)

Double non-taxation arises because the payment on the hybrid financial instrument is deductible (as interest) in Country B but not taxable (because it is treated as dividend) in Country A.

51\. The OECD recommends that in relation to payments made in connection with financial instruments, countries (in the following order):

*   tax dividend payments as ordinary income, if the payments are deductible to the foreign payer (recommendation 2);
*   deny a deduction for a payment which is not taxed as ordinary income to the foreign payee and therefore subject to no or a reduced amount of foreign tax (recommendation 1 primary rule); and
*   if a payment which is not taxed as ordinary income is deductible to the payer in another country (i.e. that country has not implemented the primary rule), impose tax on that payment as if it were ordinary income (recommendation 1 defensive rule).[\[1\]](#footnote1)
    

52\. Recommendation 1 applies only to arrangements between related parties, or which are structured.

Recommendations relating to OECD recommendation 2

53\. New Zealand already has a rule achieving most of the OECD recommendation 2. This rule denies the general exemption for dividends received by a New Zealand company from a foreign company, if the dividend is deductible to the payer. To ensure that this rule is fully effective, we recommend that it be expanded to:

*   tax a dividend if the payment of the dividend triggers a tax credit for the payer in its country of residence, giving the same effect as a deduction, This is proposed in the OECD Final Report[\[2\]](#footnote2)
     and our discussion document; and
*   where a deductible dividend has an imputation credit attached, deny the payee the ability to use the imputation credit to reduce their tax liability. The Australian Government announced in its recent Budget that it would also be making this change.

##### Instruments denominated in a foreign currency

54\. We recommend that when the instrument is denominated in a foreign currency (e.g. a loan in a foreign currency), the amount of the recommendation 1 primary rule denial includes the effect of foreign currency gain or loss. Under New Zealand’s comprehensive financial arrangements rules, foreign currency gain or loss on a financial arrangement is taxable and (subject to the usual restrictions) deductible, often on an accrual basis. If the arrangement is a hybrid financial instrument in respect of which a deduction for interest is denied under recommendation 1 primary rule, we recommend that this also apply to the foreign currency loss or gain. In the case of a gain, this means the gain is tax exempt. This approach will simplify compliance and is consistent with the conceptual basis for financial arrangement taxation and the hybrid rules. This approach was widely supported in our workshop consultation.

55\. We do not recommend taking the same approach to income inclusion under recommendation 2 (except insofar as that will occur through application of the comparative value method under the FIF rules) or the recommendation 1 defensive rule. In those cases, only the actual amount of the deductible payment should be included in the payee’s income. Since the payee is not otherwise recognising income in these cases, there is no compliance saving from including foreign currency in the counteraction. Currently, when we apply our domestic rule that corresponds to recommendation 2, we do not include foreign currency, and this does not seem to have caused any difficulty. This approach was also widely supported in workshop consultation.

##### Whether CFC taxation in a third country is treated as income inclusion

56\. We recommend that to the extent that a payment on a hybrid financial instrument can be shown to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee under another country’s controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the payer should be allowed a deduction for the payment. This was strongly supported in consultation. However, given the complexity involved in demonstrating that this is the case, we recommend that taxpayers who believe a deduction is justified on this basis be required to indicate that (including stating the amount of the deduction so justified) when filing their tax return, so the Commissioner is alerted and can audit this claim if she wishes to do so.

##### Hybrid transfers

57\. OECD recommendation 1 is intended to apply to financial instrument lending and financial instrument repo arrangements. We recommend that New Zealand’s rules also apply to these transactions. This appears to require a number of technical amendments to the current rules.

58\. In relation to share lending (see glossary at Appendix 2) by a New Zealand resident share lender who lends shares in a transaction subject to the hybrid rules (which means it must be with a related party or be a structured arrangement):

*   we are considering whether to require that the lender be taxable on a dividend substitution payment, since such a payment will generally be deductible to the payer. This will require over-riding their current ability to use the fair dividend rate method, as if they continued to own the shares;
*   we recommend that the lender not be allowed an imputation credit on any replacement payment in respect of New Zealand shares, if the share borrower is entitled to a deduction for that payment.

59\. In relation to share repos (see glossary at Appendix 2) we recommend in particular that regardless of whether the transaction is structured or between related parties:

*   when the shares are subject to the FIF rules, the money lender (who acquires the shares under the repo, and must re-deliver them at the end of the arrangement) be required to use the comparative value method to determine its income from the shares. This is the same treatment as applies in other situations where shares produce a debt-like return; and
*   when the shares are New Zealand shares, the money lender not be entitled to an imputation credit with respect to the dividend. This is already the case as a practical matter, but it ensures that foreign borrowers are not subject to the hybrid rules with respect to any payment they are deemed to make to a New Zealand lender under a share repo.

60\. We have consulted on these recommendations both generally and with the Crown entities engaged in share lending. The Crown entities do not see any difficulty with them.

##### Timing

61\. A timing mismatch arises where payments under an instrument are taxable and deductible, but the payer is entitled to a deduction much earlier than the payee has to return income. The OECD recommendation is that timing mismatches should give rise to a hybrid counteraction under recommendation 1 only where the mismatch is not corrected within 12-24 months and there is no reasonable expectation that it will not be corrected within a reasonable period of time. Mismatches arising only from foreign currency movements will not bring an instrument into this rule.

62\. We recommend a more clear-cut, less discretionary rule. Under this rule, a timing mismatch would be counteracted under the hybrid rules if it is:

*   on an instrument with a term of 3 years or more or which has been extended to beyond 3 years; and
*   in relation to a payment for which the lender is not accounting, for tax purposes, on a reasonable accrual basis; and
*   not reasonable, having regard to the terms of the instrument and the payments made to date, to believe that the expenditure will be included in income in the payee’s accounting period beginning within 24 months of the end of the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

63\. If these criteria are met, any timing mismatch will be counteracted, but the counteraction will be reversed as the mismatch reverses. So, for example, a deduction denied under the primary rule will be allowed if and when the income is recognised in the payee country.

64\. Our timing approach was widely supported in consultation, and is broadly in line with what we understand Australia is currently proposing.

##### Interaction with non-resident withholding tax

65\. When non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) (generally at a rate of 10%) is imposed on an interest payment which is non-deductible as a result of the application of OECD recommendation 1, there is an element of double taxation. Taxpayers can avoid this by not issuing hybrid financial instruments. In consultation, this was not regarded as an adequate response to the issue. Accordingly, we recommend that we give further consideration to the idea of allowing taxpayers to choose to treat such a payment as a dividend for withholding tax purposes. The rate of NRWT on a dividend is generally 15%, but this can be reduced or eliminated by attaching imputation credits to the dividend. There are some cases where the rate is as low as 0%. This treatment will have to be elected before the payment is made.

66\. We also recommend amending the rules, enacted this year, which prevent deferral of NRWT. These rules apply if a New Zealand borrower from a related party foreign lender calculates its interest expense on an accrual basis, but the relevant interest is not paid for some time, leading to a deferral of the corresponding NRWT. The most significant amendment we propose to this rule is that where interest expense is not deductible under recommendation 1, that interest should not be taken into account when deciding whether or not to apply the anti-deferral rule. This amendment was widely supported in consultation.

##### Interaction with thin capitalisation regime

67\. The thin capitalisation regime denies deductions for a proportion of a group’s interest expenses if the group has debt-funded its New Zealand operations above a permissible level. Debt funding will only be taken into account to the extent it gives rise to a deduction. Accordingly, we recommend that where payments under a hybrid financial instrument are subject to permanent deduction denial under recommendation 1 primary rule, they will not be treated as debt for the purpose of this rule. Instruments where there is a timing mismatch would still be treated as debt, but the interest expense would only be subject to the thin capitalisation rules in the year it is deductible under the hybrid rules. This was supported in consultation, and our initial assessment is that it requires no amendment to the law.

##### Application to regulatory capital issued by banks and insurance companies

68\. Some of the Australian owned banks with New Zealand branches have undertaken significant issues of hybrid financial instruments. These are generally treated as debt in New Zealand but equity in Australia. Although the dividend is taxable in Australia, that tax is generally eliminated because the dividend carries a franking credit which is generated by the payment of Australian tax on other income. These instruments have generally also counted towards the bank’s regulatory capital requirements for Australian or New Zealand purposes.

69\. We recommend that the New Zealand hybrid rules not exclude regulatory capital (i.e. that required to be issued by banks and insurance companies). The OECD Final Report notes that countries may choose to have such an exclusion. The UK has chosen to do so, though it has other anti-tax arbitrage rules that have applied to bank regulatory capital for some time. Australia has decided not to exclude regulatory capital from its hybrid rules, in its recent Budget. The EU requires member states to include regulatory capital in their hybrid rules by 1 January 2022. Our discussion document also recommended no exclusion.

70\. We received several submissions in favour of an exclusion. These submissions and our reasons for not accepting them are contained in Tax Policy Report: Consultation on Addressing Hybrid Mismatches (T2017/406 IR2017/133). Given Australia’s decision, New Zealand’s position is now largely moot in relation to the trans-Tasman hybrid issues referred to above (with the exception of transitional issues). Because Australia will tax the return on such instruments with no allowance for an imputation credit, New Zealand will continue to allow a deduction.

71\. We recommend grandparenting from recommendation 1 for deductions claimed in New Zealand by banks and insurance companies in respect of certain capital issued before the release of the discussion document on 6 September 2016. This is discussed more fully under the heading _Effective Date and Implementation_.

#### Hybrid entities – disregarded payments (OECD recommendation 3)

##### General

72\. We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 3 to prevent double non-taxation arising when a hybrid entity makes a payment which is deductible to the payer but disregarded by the payee. A hybrid entity is an entity which is transparent for tax purposes in the country of an investor but opaque for tax purposes in another country, generally where it is established. A diagram follows, where A Co is the investor and B Co is the hybrid entity.

![An example of a hybrid entity](-/media/4e6dd71b84d346269204bdf026f1aaf0.ashx)

73\. The interest payment by B Co is deductible in the hybrid entity country but disregarded in the investor country. In the New Zealand context, B Co could be a New Zealand company with unlimited shareholder liability, and A Co could be a US company which has chosen to treat B Co as fiscally transparent.

74\. Because the interest payment by B Co is deductible in Country B, if B Co has no other income, the payment produces a tax loss, which can be grouped with the income of B Sub 1. The payment can therefore reduce taxable income in Country B without giving rise to any income in Country A, because of the different treatment of B Co in each country. This is a deductible/non-includible mismatch.

75\. OECD recommendation 3 is that Country B should defer a deduction for such a payment until it is offset by dual inclusion income (discussed immediately below). This is the primary rule. If it does not defer the deduction, Country A should tax the payment, under the defensive rule. Neither rule applies unless the payer and payee are in the same control group (50% or more commonly owned) or the arrangement is structured.

76\. Unlike recommendations 1 and 2, recommendation 3 can apply to any kind of deductible payment, e.g. rent, royalties, payments for services, etc.

77\. Denial of a deduction under recommendation 3 should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income. Dual inclusion income is generally speaking income that is taxable in Country A and Country B. If B Co in the above diagram in the same year earns a separate stream of dual inclusion income equal to the amount of the interest payment, it would have:

*   no gain or loss in Country B (since the income and interest offset each other); and
*   income equal to the amount of the interest payment in Country A (since the income is taxable with no deduction for the disregarded payment).

78\. The existence of taxable income in Country A would mean that the tax result is appropriate without the need to apply any hybrid counteraction.

79\. The same outcome should apply if the dual inclusion income is earned in a later year. Accordingly the OECD recommends that deductions denied under recommendation 3 be able to be deducted in a later year if there is dual inclusion income. Accordingly, denial under recommendation 3 is in fact only deferral, though the deferral may be permanent if no dual inclusion income ever arises.

##### Application to deemed payments by branches

80\. In line with the OECD branch mismatch report, we recommend that recommendation 3 also apply where a branch is treated in the branch country as making a deductible payment to its head office which is not a simple allocation of third party costs. So far as policy officials are aware, New Zealand allows a deduction for a deemed payment only in relation to interest on deemed loans by non-resident banks and insurance companies to their New Zealand branches. Where the taxpayer is resident in Australia, our understanding is that the deemed payment is recognised for Australian tax purposes. From a practical perspective, the application of the primary rule of recommendation 3 in a branch context is therefore unlikely.

##### Carry forward of recommendation 3 defensive counteraction

81\. The OECD Final Report does not discuss the possibility of allowing a reversal of amounts of income deemed to arise under the defensive rule in recommendation 3. However, for reasons of principal and consistency, we proposed in our discussion document that where a New Zealand taxpayer has recognised income as a result of receiving a disregarded payment from a foreign hybrid entity, that income should be reversed in a later year when there is dual inclusion income earned through the hybrid entity. We recommend that this reversal be part of the New Zealand hybrids legislation. This is a taxpayer friendly measure, though we do not anticipate the defensive rule often applying in New Zealand.

Foreign currency loans

82\. We recommend a similar approach to foreign currency loans subject to recommendation 3 primary rule as the approach set out above in relation to recommendation 1. If the loan is to a New Zealand hybrid, the amount of the deduction subject to denial should take into account foreign currency fluctuations. In this case though, any net income to the NZ hybrid borrower due to foreign currency gain will be taxed as dual inclusion income, rather than exempt.

83\. We recommend a different approach to foreign currency loans subject to the recommendation 3 defensive rule to the approach set out above in relation to recommendations 1 and 2. Consistent with the primary rule recommendations, we recommend that foreign currency fluctuations should be taken into account in determining the amount of additional income arising under the defensive rule counteraction. That is because they will also be recognised in determining dual inclusion income, as discussed further below.

##### Simple implementation solution

84\. Foreign currency loans are one aspect of a larger issue in implementing OECD recommendation 3, which arises from the fact that different countries have different rules for calculating income and expense. This poses a challenge for recommendation 3, in particular in relation to the measurement of dual inclusion income.

85\. We recommend that dual inclusion income be determined in such a way as to simplify the application of recommendation 3 as far as possible. This means that when applying the primary rule in recommendation 3, dual inclusion income would include all income earned by the hybrid entity from activities the income of which is taxable in the investor country. This income would be calculated in NZ$ and using New Zealand tax principles, without regard to the amount of income actually returned in the investor country from those same activities.

86\. Similarly, when applying the defensive rule, New Zealand would treat as dual inclusion income all income from the hybrid as calculated for New Zealand tax purposes, except where that income is protected from New Zealand tax by a foreign tax credit.

87\. This simplifying approach was widely supported in consultation.

##### Whether CFC taxation in a third country is treated as income inclusion

88\. As for the OECD recommendation 1, we recommend that to the extent that a payment by a hybrid entity which is disregarded by the payee can be proven to give rise to taxation of an investor in the payee under another country’s CFC regime, the payer should be allowed a deduction for the payment. Similarly, amounts which are included in income under another country’s CFC regime can qualify as dual inclusion income. However, because of the complexity of CFC taxation, in these cases, we propose that the taxpayer would have to demonstrate that the amounts are fully taxable for CFC purposes in the relevant period.

89\. We do not propose that CFC taxation be taken into account when New Zealand is applying the defensive rule in recommendation 3. That is because in that case any taxation imposed in New Zealand under the hybrid rules should be available as a credit against CFC taxation.

##### Effect of deferred deductions on foreign tax credit limitation

90\. A person’s ability to claim a credit against New Zealand income tax for foreign income tax imposed on foreign source income is limited to the amount of New Zealand income tax imposed on the net foreign income, i.e. taking into account deductions claimed in New Zealand in relation to that income.

91\. This will naturally mean that when a deduction which has been deferred under recommendation 3 primary rule is later allowed, it will lower the foreign tax credit limitation. We recommend that the same outcome should apply when a New Zealand taxpayer has income under the defensive rule in recommendation 3, and that income is reversed in a later year by virtue of dual inclusion income arising in the hybrid entity.

92\. The effect of reversing the recommendation 3 counteraction on the foreign tax credit limitation was discussed in consultation, and generally accepted. Submitters did comment that there are already similar existing anomalies in the calculation of foreign tax credits, some of which give results which are unfavourable to taxpayers, and suggested that a more general policy review of the foreign tax credit rules would be appropriate. However, this would have to be undertaken as a separate policy proposal.

##### Effect of loss of ownership continuity on carry forwards

93\. As set out above, deductions deferred under the recommendation 3 primary rule should be carried forward and allowed when and if there is dual inclusion income in a future year. However, we recommend that if the taxpayer is a company, and there is a 51% or greater change in the taxpayer’s ownership after the time when the deduction would ordinarily be claimed, the deductions would not be able to be claimed in the future. The same rule would apply to income deemed to arise under the recommendation 3 defensive rule.

94\. This is the same rule as applies to deductions for carried forward losses. It ensures that it is not possible for owners of a company to profit from the sale of the company as a tax shelter. That rationale applies in the case of deductions denied under the hybrid rules in just the same way as it applies to deductions which are unusable in the year incurred because they exceed current income. While such deductions are able to be carried forward and used in future years for the benefit of the shareholders who owned the company when the expenses were incurred, they should not be able to be used for the benefit of other shareholders.

95\. One of the reasons for making this recommendation is that in some cases, deductions denied under the recommendation 3 primary rule would, if allowed, have formed part of a net loss to carry forward in any event, and thus been subject to elimination on an ownership change in the ordinary way. It would be anomalous in that case for the hybrid rules to have the effect of protecting the carry forward of those expenses from elimination.

96\. While officials’ position was understood in consultation, it was not entirely accepted by all parties, and may be subject to a degree of criticism. Submitters felt the deferral of a deduction was more like a timing rule (e.g. cash deduction for an accrued expense) which is not subject to carry forward elimination if there is an ownership change between accrual and deduction.

##### Interaction with NRWT

97\. When a payment for which a deduction is deferred under recommendation 3 is subject to New Zealand NRWT, we do not propose that any adjustment be made for that. Recommendation 3 does not permanently deny the deduction – it defers it until there is income in the hybrid. So it would not be appropriate to adopt the same solution being considered for a payment in a recommendation 1 hybrid financial arrangement mismatch and allow the payer to eliminate the NRWT permanently by treating the payment as a dividend. An alternative would be to reflect the imposition of NRWT by allowing a portion of the payment to be deducted. But this would create further complexity, particularly if the payee country has hybrid rules.

98\. Accordingly we do not recommend any amendment to the NRWT rules or the hybrid rules to adjust for the imposition of NRWT on a payment for which a deduction is denied under OECD recommendation 3. This may be a point which parts of the private sector will be unhappy with. However, we believe it will generally be possible for businesses to plan around the issue.

99\. As for the new rules imposing NRWT on an accrual basis, we propose a similar modification to that proposed as a consequence of enacting OECD hybrid recommendation 1. That is, expenditure for which a deduction is deferred under recommendation 3 would not trigger application of NRWT on an accrual basis.

##### Interaction with thin capitalisation

100\. We recommend that denial of a deduction under recommendation 3 should have no effect on the thin capitalisation regime. Because interest deductions are only deferred under recommendation 3 rather than denied, there is less reason to amend the application of the thin capitalisation regime than there is in recommendation 1. In addition:  
• when a hybrid entity has both interest and non-interest disregarded expenses, only some of which are deferred, an apportionment rule would be necessary to determine the amount of the deferred interest;  
• taxpayers will generally manage their thin capitalisation position to avoid any interest denial under the regime.

#### Deductible payment to a reverse hybrid (OECD recommendations 4)

##### General

101\. We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules, in line with OECD recommendation 4, to prevent double non-taxation arising from a payment to a reverse hybrid where payer, payee and the relevant investor are in a control group. The following diagram illustrates a typical example of the situation proposed to be addressed.

![An example of a reverse hybrid](-/media/8543630d30ba4e42a24cb1b8347beead.ashx)

If B Co (the payee) is a reverse hybrid, double non-taxation arises because the interest payment is deductible to C Co (the payer) and not taxable to either B Co or A Co (the investor). Even on distribution by B Co to A Co it may not be taxable, if protected by an exemption for cross border intra-group dividends. The double non-taxation is due to a hybrid mismatch if the payment would have been taxable had it been made directly from C Co to A Co. In this diagram, New Zealand is Country C, and would apply the recommendation 4 counteraction to deny a deduction for the interest payment.

102\. OECD recommendation 4 is that countries deny a deduction for a payment to a reverse hybrid if:

*   the payment would have been taxed if made directly to the investor (A Co in the case above); and
*   the payer, payee and investor are all in a control group or the payment is pursuant to a structured arrangement.

##### Application to payments to branches

103\. In line with the recommendations in the OECD branch mismatch report, we recommend that recommendation 4 also apply to a payment to a control group member which is not taxed to the payee because:

*   the payment is a “diverted branch payment”. As defined in the OECD branch report, this is a payment which is treated:
    *   in the payee country as attributable to a branch in another country and therefore not taxed
    *   in the branch country as not attributable to the branch; and
*   the payment is to a “disregarded branch”. As defined in the OECD branch report, a disregarded branch arises when a payment is treated in the payee country as attributable to a branch in another country, but the branch country does not treat the payee as having a branch which would give the branch country a right to tax.

104\. We are not aware of such structures being used in New Zealand. However, UK and OECD officials advised us that structures making use of these types of branch mismatches were widely used in Europe, and that the effectiveness of a country’s hybrid measures would be significantly compromised if they were not addressed.

105\. Applying the recommendation 4 counteraction to these branch mismatches was accepted in consultation.

##### Instruments denominated in a foreign currency

106\. As for recommendation 1 we recommend that when the payment is on a loan denominated in a foreign currency, the amount of the recommendation 4 denial includes the effect of foreign currency gain or loss.

##### CFC inclusion

107\. As for recommendations 1 and 3 primary rule, we recommend that to the extent that a payment to a reverse hybrid can be proven to give rise to taxation under the owner country’s CFC regime, or the CFC regime of a higher tier owner, a deduction should be allowed.

#### Interaction with non-resident withholding tax

108\. As noted in relation to recommendation 1, denial of a deduction under recommendation 4 is permanent, and accordingly the imposition of non-resident withholding tax on the payment will involve a degree of over-taxation. However, because the mismatch does not necessarily arise in relation to hybrid financial instrument (indeed, it may arise on a royalty payment, which is not in relation to a financial instrument at all), there is no basis for recharacterising the payment as a dividend for withholding tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not recommend any adjustment to the imposition of NRWT. This is the approach taken by other jurisdictions. In general the outcome can be avoided by not using reverse hybrid entities.

##### Interaction with thin capitalisation regime

109\. To the extent that a deduction is denied for a payment of interest under recommendation 4, we recommend that the debt corresponding to that deduction, and the payment itself, be treated in the same way as if the deduction were denied under recommendation 1, i.e. it will not be treated as debt for purposes of the rules. .

#### Reverse hybrids – recommendation 5

110\. OECD recommendation 5 is in three parts.

*   Recommendation 5.1 suggests countries consider changes to their domestic law so that they tax residents on income which is not taxed in another country due to its being earned by a reverse hybrid;
*   Recommendation 5.2 suggests countries consider changes to their domestic law so they tax income which is earned by a reverse hybrid entity established in their country; and
*   Recommendation 5.3 suggests countries consider improvements to record keeping and disclosure rules for tax transparent entities established in their country.

111\. We propose making changes consistent with recommendation 5.2 and considering further recommendation 5.1. In respect of recommendation 5.3, we believe that New Zealand’s record keeping and disclosure rules meet current international standards noting that our rules for foreign trust disclosure have recently been strengthened following the recommendations of the Shewan Report in 2016.

112\. However, we note that Australia has indicated that it is unlikely to implement recommendations 5.1 and 5.2 at this point. In respect of recommendation 5.1 this is largely because they see their existing rules as adequate. For recommendation 5.2, we understand that Australia does not see a significant domestic problem that needs to be addressed. By contrast, we consider that the existence of New Zealand limited partnerships and foreign trusts (discussed below) means it is preferable for New Zealand to follow the OECD recommendations.

##### Reverse hybrids with a New Zealand investor – recommendation 5.1

113\. New Zealand already has a CFC regime which applies to a New Zealand resident holding 10% or more of a foreign company which is controlled by New Zealand residents. Under the CFC regime, such a shareholder is taxed on its share of the foreign company’s income of certain kinds, referred to as attributed income. Attributed income includes interest income and certain other passive income, but excludes active income. Accordingly, where a New Zealand resident is an investor in a reverse hybrid, non-taxation by reason of reverse hybridity would only arise in relation to such active income.

114\. In consultation, submitters observed that in most cases, active income would already be taxed by the source/establishment country. They therefore questioned the need for any change. However, they accepted that adding to the definition of income subject to attribution under the CFC regime income which is not taxable to the CFC because it is treated by the CFC country of establishment as earned by the New Zealand investor could be the outcome of this project.

115\. We note also that there is a de minimis rule in the CFC regime (generally, there is no attribution of income unless potentially attributable income is more than 5% of total income), so attribution will not in most cases be triggered by a relatively small amount of untaxed reverse hybrid income.

116\. A rule which taxed CFC income in these circumstances would also apply to a New Zealand resident who uses the attributable FIF income method to calculate FIF income. This method uses the same mechanics as the CFC regime.

117\. Although recommendation 5.1 is recommended by the OECD, it is not expected to be adopted by Australia, and it raises some conceptual and practical issues. We would like to consider this matter further and report back.

##### Reverse hybrids established in New Zealand – recommendation 5.2

118\. There are two entities in New Zealand which present a real risk of giving rise to non-taxation as a result of reverse hybridity. They are:

*   New Zealand limited partnerships; and
*   Trusts with a New Zealand trustee and a foreign settlor or beneficiary.

119\. Although a look through company (LTC) may also be a reverse hybrid, the risk of non-taxation is already addressed. A company cannot be an LTC if its foreign income exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 20% of the company’s gross income, if more that 50% of the LTC’s shares are held by non-residents.

120\. In relation to limited partnerships, we recommend that income which is earned by a limited partnership and attributed to a partner who is not taxable on that income and who is in the same control group as the partnership, should be taxable in New Zealand , on the same basis as if the non-resident partners were resident in New Zealand. This liability should be on both the limited partner and the general partner (who will have a right of indemnity against the limited partner). We recommend a de minimis at the same level as the LTC de minimis referred to above.

##### Foreign trusts

121\. Foreign trusts have been controversial recently because New Zealand’s regime for taxing them is unusual internationally and they have been used as a vehicle for investing offshore by some non-resident settlors and the income was not taxed (nor disclosed) anywhere. This was the topic of the Shewan Inquiry which made recommendations (adopted by the Government) to greatly strengthen disclosure requirements. This addressed the use of foreign trusts to disguise illegal activity, but tax advantages through their hybrid nature remain.

122\. We describe below two options for addressing the hybrid mismatch. However, given that the Shewan Inquiry found no conceptual basis to disagree with the fundamental tax treatment of foreign trusts, Ministers could want to retain the current treatment. That said, the frame of reference for the Shewan Inquiry was New Zealand tax principles and international disclosure principles, while the reference for the hybrids mismatch proposals is closing arbitrage options between tax treatments of different countries without inquiring whether any country’s treatment is correct from its own domestic perspective.

Hybrid mismatch for beneficiary and trustee income (Inland Revenue recommendation)

123\. In relation to foreign trusts a reverse hybrid mismatch can arise in relation to beneficiary income in the same way as it can arise for a limited partnership, if income which is treated for New Zealand tax purposes, and on which the beneficiary would be taxed in its country of residence if it derived the income directly, is not taxed because the residence country regards the income as derived by the trustee. Accordingly, if the beneficiary who is not taxable on beneficiary income due to a reverse hybrid mismatch is in the same control group as the trust, and the trust derives more than the greater of $10,000 or 20% of its income from foreign sources, we recommend that the beneficiary income be subject to New Zealand taxation, in accordance with recommendation 5.2.

124\. A reverse hybrid mismatch can arguably also arise in relation to trustee income New Zealand does not impose tax on the income of a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust because of what is often referred to as a settlor approach to trust taxation. We tax foreign source income earned by the foreign trustee of a trust with a New Zealand settlor, on the basis that the income is more appropriately treated as belonging to the settlor (who is a New Zealand resident taxable on worldwide income) than the trustee (who is ordinarily not subject to New Zealand tax on foreign source income). Similarly we do not tax the foreign source income earned by the New Zealand trustee of a trust with a foreign settlor, on the basis that the income is more appropriately treated as earned by the foreign settlor, who is not subject to New Zealand tax on non-New Zealand source income.

125\. Since the trustee income of a New Zealand trustee of a foreign trust is taxed as if it were derived by the foreign settlor, there is arguably a hybrid mismatch if the income is not taxed to the foreign settlor in its residence jurisdiction, and the reason for that non-taxation is that the income has been derived by the New Zealand trustee rather than the settlor directly. Accordingly, if the settlor who is not taxable on trustee income due to a hybrid mismatch is in the same control group as the trust, and the trust derives more than the greater of $10,000 or 20% of its income from foreign sources, we recommend that the trustee be subject to New Zealand taxation in accordance with recommendation 5.2.

Hybrid mismatch comprehensive foreign trust proposal (Treasury recommendation)

126\. New Zealand is relatively unusual in having a settlor regime for trust taxation. As far as we know from research undertaken during the Shewan Inquiry, the settlor basis for trust taxation applies only for settlors resident in New Zealand, Japan, and the United States (for some trusts only) (there could be some other jurisdictions that we are not aware of). This means that there may be many cases where recommendation 5.2 applies.

127\. A simpler option would be for New Zealand to tax the New Zealand trustee of all trusts with a New Zealand resident trustee, as well as retaining the settlor regime. This would apply a taxing nexus for trustee income that almost all other countries that recognise trusts apply. It would be a simpler test than having to inquire what the settlor and beneficiary tax regimes are for all trusts with a resident trustee, and would largely pick up the same income.

128\. Some form of transitional rules may be required in relation to these rules, to deal with events such as trustees who migrate to New Zealand or who become trustees of testamentary trusts. For example, the rules may allow a foreign trustee who migrates and becomes resident in New Zealand up to two years to find a substitute foreign trustee to keep the trust out of the New Zealand tax base. This situation is common internationally for trustees who migrate to another country.

129\. In relation to these rules implementing OECD recommendation 5.2, both Inland Revenue and the Treasury recommend that the implementation date be later that for the other measures. Submitters suggested that the private sector may not fully appreciate that trust and partnership structures are within the terms of the hybrid rules. In order to ensure that those affected have adequate time to deal with the proposals, we suggest an implementation date of income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

#### Hybrid entities – double deductions (OECD recommendation 6)

##### General

130\. We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules, in line with OECD recommendation 6, to prevent double non-taxation arising when a hybrid entity makes a payment that is deductible in two countries against non-dual inclusion income. (As discussed elsewhere in this report, this kind of mismatch is currently being used to reduce New Zealand tax, in the Australian limited partnership structures which the Government has already decided to address). A diagram illustrating this possibility follows, where B Co is the hybrid entity.

![An example of a hybrid entity used to generate a double deduction mismatch](-/media/8f159a30e4bd496db9ce7bec7cf1ba3d.ashx)

131\. Because A Co treats B Co as fiscally transparent, in Country A the interest paid by B Co is deductible against A Co’s other income. In Country B the interest payment is treated as made by a separate company, which is in a tax consolidated group with B Sub 1. Accordingly the interest payment can offset income earned by B Sub 1. This means that each $1 of interest payment can offset $2 of income. The outcome is similar to the outcome of a deductible/non-includible mismatch countered by recommendation 3, but in this case it is caused by a payment being deductible in two countries, rather than deductible and disregarded.

132\. OECD recommendation 6 is that:

*   The investor country (Country A in the diagram) should deny a deduction for the interest payment (the primary rule); and
*   If Country A does not do so, then Country B should deny the deduction (the defensive rule).

133\. As noted above, Cabinet has already agreed to implement the primary rule (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers).

134\. Recommendation 6 applies to any kind of expenditure, including allowances such as depreciation.

135\. As with recommendation 3, denial of a deduction under recommendation 6 should be reversed to the extent that the hybrid entity has dual inclusion income, either in the same period or a later one.

##### Application to branches

136\. The OECD Hybrids Report was explicit that recommendation 6 applies to expenses incurred by a branch if those expenses are deductible in both the branch and parent countries. For many branches, that is not the case, because the legal entity is established in a country (such as Australia) which exempts active branch income. However, expenses incurred by foreign branches of New Zealand companies will be deductible in two countries. Accordingly, this recommendation is particularly relevant to New Zealand companies.

137\. The OECD proposes that recommendation 6 apply if there is any potential for expenditure to be offset against non-dual inclusion income, whether or not it is so offset. This could have made foreign branch losses unavailable to be used against New Zealand source income. A blanket denial of deductions for foreign branch losses would not be a comfortable fit with our current policy settings for taxing branch income, and officials have put considerable effort into consultation designed to ensure that recommendation 6 can be implemented in a way that ensures it does not affect the vast majority of New Zealand companies which have foreign branches that are in loss, but are not using the deduction in the branch country against non-dual inclusion income.

##### Recommendation for scope of recommendation 6 primary rule

138\. Officials accordingly recommend that the primary rule in recommendation 6 apply to expenditure of a foreign branch/hybrid entity with a New Zealand parent/investor only where there is another entity with income that is not taxable in New Zealand but able to be offset in any way by any branch/hybrid entity loss (including where such offset requires an election or other similar step having tax significance only).

139\. This restriction means that a New Zealand company with a foreign branch would in most circumstances not be denied a deduction in New Zealand for any branch/hybrid loss under recommendation 6. There would be no denial, for instance, in the case of a New Zealand company with one or more Australian branches if:

*   the New Zealand group does not own any other Australian entities; or
*   if it does own other Australian entities, those entities’ income cannot be offset by any branch loss. We understand that in Australia a loss incurred by an Australian branch of a non-resident company cannot offset income earned by a resident company. On that basis, ownership of an Australian company by the New Zealand group also would be consistent with the non-application of recommendation 6 primary rule.

140\. The restriction explained above was generally accepted in consultation, and officials believe that it produces a sensible policy outcome. It does not go so far as denying the branch/hybrid loss only to the extent it is used against non-dual inclusion income. Consultation established that such a rule, though also potentially producing an appropriate outcome, would be much more complex to design and administer.

##### Recommendation for transitional situations

141\. This recommendation means that a rule is required to deal with the situation where a New Zealand resident with a loss-making foreign branch or hybrid at some point becomes subject to recommendation 6 primary rule by virtue of acquiring an interest in an entity in the branch country whose income is not taxable in New Zealand but can be offset by the branch losses. Officials recommend that:

*   if the branch loss arising before the acquisition of the interest in the second entity cannot be offset against the new entity’s income (as will often be the case, including we understand in Australia), then the only consequence is that subsequent branch losses are subject to the recommendation 6 primary rule; and
*   otherwise, all losses of the branch which have been used against New Zealand income should be recaptured, since they are now available to be used against non-dual inclusion income.

142\. Officials do not believe this rule will often apply, but it is important for the integrity of the hybrids package.

143\. We also recommend a similar rule to operate in favour of a New Zealand resident with a hybrid entity or branch which has been subject to loss denial under recommendation 6. If it becomes impossible for the loss to be used in the branch/hybrid jurisdiction, then it should be allowed in New Zealand. This could occur if, for example, the hybrid is wound up in the foreign country, or if the entity with non-dual inclusion income is sold. In that case the suspended losses would be deductible in New Zealand to the extent of the carried forward loss, as calculated under the rules of the hybrid or branch country, that has become unusable in that country.

##### Simple implementation solution

144\. As with recommendation 3, in order to simplify compliance, we recommend that the amount of double deductible expenditure and dual inclusion income be the amount calculated under New Zealand tax principles, without close regard to whether such amounts match the amounts which are deducible or taxable in the other country. This possibility is referred to in the OECD final report and was strongly supported in consultation.

145\. As with recommendation 3 defensive rule, we recommend that when New Zealand is applying the primary rule, income protected from tax by a foreign tax credit would not be dual inclusion income.

##### CFC taxation in investor country can give rise to dual inclusion income

146\. We recommend that income which can be shown to be taxable both in the branch/hybrid country and under CFC rules in the investor country should be able to be treated as dual inclusion income. Again this would not be the case if the CFC taxation is reduced by a credit for tax paid in the branch/hybrid country.

##### Effect of deferred deduction on foreign tax credit limitation

147\. Deductions deferred under recommendation 6 will under existing law reduce the foreign tax credit limitation in the year the deductions are allowed. No change is required.

##### Effect of loss of ownership continuity on carry forwards

148\. As for OECD recommendation 3, we recommend that if a taxpayer subject to recommendation 6 denial is a company and there is a 51% or greater change in its ownership after the time when the deduction would ordinarily be claimed, the deductions would not be able to be claimed in the future.

##### Interaction with NRWT

149\. In relation to the new rules imposing NRWT on an accrual basis, we recommend a similar modification to that recommended for OECD recommendation 3.

##### Interaction with thin capitalisation

150\. We make the same recommendation as for OECD recommendation 3.

##### Opaque election

151\. In consultation, there has been a strong submission that a New Zealand owner of a foreign hybrid entity should be permitted to treat the hybrid as a company, in line with its foreign treatment. Recommendation 6 would then no longer apply to it. This submission was based on a desire for simplicity.

152\. Officials understand the reasons for the submission. However we are concerned that it might lead to significant administrative and legislative complexity, for what might be a small handful of taxpayers. Accordingly, we recommend that we consider further whether it is possible to design a tightly targeted and simple opaque election, with a view to reporting back on our recommendations before the proposed bill is finalised.

#### Dual resident entities (OECD recommendation 7)

##### General

153\. OECD recommendation 7 is that countries should deny a deduction to dual resident companies except to the extent of dual inclusion income. We recommend that New Zealand amend its existing rules relating to losses incurred by dual resident companies, to ensure they are fully effective to prevent deductions being taken against non-dual inclusion income.

154\. Dual resident companies give rise to the same double deduction possibilities as hybrid entities. Expenditure incurred by such a company may be able to be used in each residence country to offset non-dual inclusion income, i.e. income taxed only in that country.

155\. New Zealand’s rules already prevent dual resident companies from grouping their losses or forming part of a tax consolidated group. However, it does not prevent them offsetting expenditure against non-dual inclusion income earned through a reverse hybrid, such as (in many instances) a New Zealand limited liability partnership.

156\. Submitters made the point that dual residence can arise inadvertently. For example, a corporate group in New Zealand may incorporate a subsidiary in Australia (which would therefore be an Australian tax resident company) but exercise sufficient director control in New Zealand that the company is arguably also New Zealand tax resident. Officials observe that if this is indeed a problem, it is a problem under the existing rules denying dual resident companies the ability to group losses, be part of a tax consolidated group, or even maintain an imputation credit account.

##### Similar rules to that applying to changes implementing OECD recommendation 6

157\. The following recommendations made in relation to OECD recommendation 6 also apply in relation to recommendation 7:

*   simple implementation solution;
*   the effect of deferred deductions on the foreign tax credit limitation;
*   the effect of loss of ownership continuity on carry forwards; and
*   interact with thin capitalisation.

#### Imported mismatches (OECD recommendation 8)

##### General

158\. We recommend that New Zealand introduce rules in line with OECD recommendation 8 to deny a deduction for a payment between members of a control group that funds a payment under a hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch. This is referred to as an imported mismatch rule. An example follows.

![A hybrid mismatch, including a branch mismatch](-/media/12f72b9a7f594741aaa253990ccb3144.ashx)

159\. The interest payment by Borrower Co to B Co does not in isolation give rise to a hybrid mismatch. The loan is treated the same way in both Country B and Country C (which could be New Zealand). However, B Co makes payments to A Co under a hybrid financial instrument. The tax mismatch is not counteracted, because neither country has hybrid rules. If Country C makes no hybrid counteraction in such a case, the hybrid rules are ineffective to deal with arrangements between Country A and Country C. Businesses can avoid the rules simply by going from A to C via B.

160\. In order to prevent its hybrid rules being circumvented, Country C can treat the loan from B Co to Borrower Co as an imported mismatch arrangement, and deny a deduction for the interest payments by Borrower Co to the extent that they do not exceed the payments under the hybrid financial instrument between B Co and A Co.

161\. The OECD imported hybrid mismatch rule applies to both structured and unstructured imported mismatches.

*   A structured imported mismatch arises when a deductible payment is part of a structured arrangement involving a hybrid mismatch – for example if the funding chain the above diagram was entered into deliberately, in order to move money from A Co to Borrower Co. A structured imported mismatch rule prevents a country’s hybrid mismatch rules being deliberately circumvented.
*   An unstructured imported mismatch arises when there is no such intention. There is simply a deductible payment by a person resident in a country with hybrid rules, where the payee in turn makes a deductible payment under a hybrid mismatch arrangement (which may itself be an imported mismatch arrangement). The unstructured imported mismatch rule is intended to extend the reach of the hybrid rules, rather than to prevent their deliberate circumvention.

162\. The OECD proposes complex apportionment rules which may need to be applied to determine the amount of denial in an unstructured hybrid mismatch.

163\. The imported mismatch rule will not need to be applied in respect of payments to a person in a country with the hybrid rules. The payee’s country can be relied on to address any hybrid mismatches in that case. Furthermore, as more countries adopt hybrid rules, there should be fewer hybrids and hybrid mismatches in existence, and so less need for the imported hybrid rule to apply.

164\. Those we consulted were not generally in favour of countering imported mismatches, on the basis that the hybrid mismatch was not directly with New Zealand. That said, they generally understood the need for a structured imported mismatch rule, but were concerned about the complexity and uncertainty around the unstructured rule. We recommend that this concern be addressed by deferring the application date for the unstructured imported mismatch rule. This recommendation is discussed in more detail under the heading Effective date.

##### Foreign currency instruments

165\. When an imported mismatch payment is a return on a foreign currency loan, the issue of how to deal with foreign currency fluctuations arises as it does for the other recommendations. In this case we recommend that the foreign currency is not taken into account. The basis for the counteraction is that the New Zealand payment is funding in some way a hybrid mismatch payment by another entity. The extent of this funding may differ from year to year. Thus it is best measured by reference to the amount of the coupon payment alone, rather than including as well any foreign currency movements, which will generally have no cash flow impact in the relevant year..

##### Interaction with non-resident withholding tax

166\. We do not recommend adjusting any non-resident withholding tax on a payment for which a deduction is denied under the imported mismatch rule. Because the payment will be treated as ordinary income in the payee country, any withholding tax will generally give rise to a tax credit in the payee country.

167\. As with the other mismatch denial rules, we recommend that deductions disallowed under the imported mismatch rule not be taken into account when deciding whether or not to apply the anti-NRWT-deferral rule.

##### Interaction with thin capitalisation regime

168\. As with a recommendation 1 (non-timing) and recommendation 4 denial, to the extent that interest on a financial arrangement is subject to denial under the imported mismatch rule we recommend that it not be treated for purposes of the thin capitalisation regime as debt.

#### Co-ordination rule

169\. We recommend that the hybrid legislation includes a rule to deal with the situation where a hybrid mismatch arrangement which is subject to counteraction in one country (say New Zealand) ceases to be so subject, for example because the other country introduces hybrid rules, and is responsible applying taking the primary response. We recommend that this rule be consistent with the approach taken to this issue in the OECD Final Report. We did not receive any submissions against this approach.

#### Definitions

170\. The hybrid rules may require some new definitions to be added to the Income Tax Act, and the amendment of some existing definitions. In particular, a definition will be required of a structured arrangement, and the importance of this was stressed in submissions. We did not receive any submissions against the definitional approach proposed in the discussion document, and recommend that we approach the tax of drafting supporting definitions in line with what was proposed there.

#### Specific anti-avoidance rule

171\. We recommend that the hybrid rules include a specific anti-avoidance rule, allowing the Commissioner to counteract arrangements having a purpose or effect of defeating the intent or application of the hybrid rules.

#### Effective date, transitional and grandparenting

172\. Cabinet has already agreed that OECD recommendation 6 primary rule should apply to New Zealand residents for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2018 (CAB-17-MIN-0164 refers). This is on the basis that a bill is introduced to Parliament before the end of 2017, and in force before 1 July 2018. We recommend the same start date for all of the hybrid recommendations in this report other than that relating to unstructured imported mismatches and reverse hybrids, discussed below.

173\. This may be:

*   a similar timetable to that in the UK (where the effective date was 8 months after introduction of the legislation into Parliament); and
*   shorter than that proposed in Australia, which has announced that its effective date will be at least six months after its legislation is enacted.

174\. In general, we do not see any need for a longer lead time than that we propose. The target and effect of the hybrid rules is has been identified with some specificity, and has not changed in any significant way (other, perhaps, than the addition of branch mismatches beyond those in recommendation 6). Parties should be able to plan their affairs already with a high degree of confidence as to what the effect of the rules will be.

175\. In relation to unstructured imported mismatches:

*   there is still considerable uncertainty as to how this rule should apply, given that it requires a co-ordinated counteraction of mismatches that may themselves be difficult to find and to quantify;
*   there will be less need to apply the rule as the hybrid rules are enacted in more countries. The unstructured imported mismatch rule does not apply to payments to a country with hybrid rules, and the adoption of the rule by more countries will reduce the number of hybrids in any event;
*   the adoption of the rules by more countries may assist in developing an understanding of how the unstructured imported mismatch rule should apply; and
*   the rule is more about extending the reach of the hybrid rules than ensuring their integrity.

176\. The UK has introduced hybrid rules including an unstructured imported mismatch rule effective 1 January 2017. Australia has not made any announcement. The EU directive includes an unstructured imported mismatch rule which must be effective from 1 January 2020.

177\. We recommend that the effective date of the unstructured imported mismatch rule be delayed until 1 January 2020. By that time, all of the EU member states are expected to have hybrid rules, and so the application of the unstructured imported rule will be both less frequent and, we expect, better developed. We do not make the same recommendation for the structured imported mismatch rule, as that would create an integrity issue for the rules.

178\. We also recommend a delayed implementation date for the recommendations relating to limited partnerships and foreign trusts which are reverse hybrids. As discussed above, the private sector may not fully appreciate that trust and partnership structures are within the terms of the hybrid rules. In order to ensure that those affected have adequate time to deal with the proposals, we suggest an implementation date of income years beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

##### Transitional and grandparenting

179\. All of the OECD Final Report, the Australian Board of Taxation report, and our discussion document, do not recommend any general transitional relief for existing arrangements. The hybrid rules generally apply to transactions between parties at least 25% commonly owned, or deliberately structured arrangements. They produce tax benefits that generally were not intended, but flow from the unintended interaction of different countries’ rules. The effect of the rules will be to remove inappropriate benefits. They will not have a punitive effect (except in relation to the imposition of NRWT), and except to the extent that they do, no exception can reasonably be taken to their application to existing transactions.

180\. The absence of transitional relief is the same approach as was taken, without adverse reaction, to certain related party NRWT minimisation structures in the recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016–17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act

181\. We recommend no transitional relief from the hybrid rules, subject to an exception for certain capital issued by banks (and insurance companies – for purposes of discussion we refer only to banks, but similar rules apply to both), as discussed further below.

182\. A number of banks operating in New Zealand have issued debt instruments which are both:

*   hybrid mismatch arrangements (or imported hybrid mismatch arrangements), in the sense that the return on the instruments is deductible in New Zealand but treated as a dividend in Australia or elsewhere; and
*   regulatory capital for capital adequacy purposes, either in New Zealand or Australia.

183\. Many of these issues have been made directly to the public in Australia. In some cases the instruments have been issued to a foreign branch of the New Zealand bank’s foreign parent Most of them are able to be repaid by the issuer after 5 years.

184\. The fact that these instruments raise regulatory capital does not in our view justify any grandfathering. In discussions with the Reserve Bank, they have told us that there is no particular benefit in these instruments from a regulatory perspective, and that they would be comfortable with the banks replacing these instruments with ordinary shares to the extent that the capital they raise is required for regulatory purposes. Accordingly, in our discussion document we did not recommend any special treatment for these instruments.

185\. However, these instruments do differ from most hybrids insofar as they are held by third party investors, often retail rather than wholesale (the hybrid rules apply to them because they are structured, rather than related party). This in turn means that if the hybrid rules were to apply to them so as to:

*   impose additional tax on the investors, the investors may have a right to be indemnified by the bank (this would be the case if recommendation 2, or recommendation 1 defensive rule applied to the investors); or
*   increase the after-tax cost of the funding to the issuer (which might be the result if any of the rules applied), the issuer may have a right to terminate the investment early.

186\. The banks have submitted that subjecting regulatory capital to the hybrid regime with no grandparenting would be inappropriate because:

*   restructuring such capital would require regulatory approval, possibly from more than one regulator; and
*   such restructuring might be disruptive to the financial markets in which bank capital is raised, especially if all the banks were looking to replace their existing issuances at the same time.

187\. Different banks made different submissions on the date from which grandparenting should cease to apply, ranging from the date of release of the OECD Final Report (October 2015), through the date of release of the Government discussion document (6 September 2016) to the date of enactment of New Zealand’s hybrid legislation. Co-ordination with Australia was also encouraged. In this respect we note that Australia announced in its 2017 Budget that it will:

*   apply recommendation 2 to dividends on hybrid regulatory capital, thus denying the payee the benefit of an imputation (or franking) credit; and
*   grandparent instruments issued before 8 May 2017.

188\. There are some grounds for treating the publicly issued instruments differently from most hybrid instruments. Australia’s decision to grandparent also puts a heavy burden of proof on New Zealand to justify a decision to do otherwise. Accordingly we recommend providing some grandparenting. The issues then are:

*   which transactions should be grandparented; and
*   from what date.

189\. As to the first of these, we recommend that only transactions which are directly to the public, or which are traceable to an issue to the public, should be grandparented. However, we have not yet had the opportunity to discuss this in detail with the banks, and may refine or expand this core recommendation as we do so.

190\. As to the date, we recommend that grandparenting apply only to transactions entered into before the release of our discussion document on 6 September 2016. That document announced the Government’s intention to enact hybrid rules with no regulatory capital exception. It was also a date that was indicated as acceptable in some written submissions, and in consultation.

### Appendix 2: Glossary

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| CFC rules | New Zealand has a controlled foreign companies (CFC) regime that attributes the passive income of CFCs to New Zealand owners. New Zealand’s CFC rules are an important part of our international tax rules and are generally considered to be robust. |
| Deduction/ no inclusion (D/NI) | A hybrid result where a member of a group can claim a deduction for an intra-group payment and that deduction is not balanced by income inclusion for the recipient. |
| Double deductions (DD) | A hybrid result where a group can claim tax deductions against two different amounts of income for one item of expenditure. |
| FIF rules<br><br>*   fair dividend rate<br>*   cost<br>*   deemed rate of return<br>*   comparative value method<br>*   attributed FIF income method | New Zealand has a foreign investment fund (FIF) regime which seeks to tax New Zealand residents on their portfolio income from foreign share investment in a practical way. There are a number of methods to calculate FIF income, including:<br><br>*   The fair dividend rate (FDR) and cost methods which approximates total annual return as 5% of an investor’s holding and taxes on that basis;<br>*   The deemed rate of return (DRR) method which approximates total annual return as a rate set by Order in Council each year; and<br>*   The comparative value (CV) method which measures change in value across the relevant year plus any other gain such as a dividend and taxes that amount.<br>*   The attributed FIF income method, which taxes the resident on a share of the underlying income of the |
| Foreign branch | A New Zealand company that operates in a foreign country through a permanent establishment in that country. Because New Zealand taxes the worldwide income of its residents, a New Zealand company with a foreign branch operation that is in loss has the potential to create a hybrid outcome as the loss can be used against New Zealand as well as (potentially) offshore income which New Zealand does not tax. |
| Foreign tax credit | New Zealand’s tax law allows its residents to claim a foreign tax credit for tax paid overseas on a segment of foreign-sourced income. If that income is taxable in New Zealand, residents can claim the foreign tax credit against New Zealand tax to prevent double taxation. |
| Hybrid entities | An entity that is treated for tax purposes as transparent or disregarded (its income and expenditure is attributed to its owners or (in the case of payments to an owner) ignored) in the jurisdiction of its parent/investor and opaque (it is taxed as a separate entity on its income and expenditure) in the jurisdiction it is established in. This type of entity can produce double deductions and deduction/no inclusion outcomes. |
| Hybrid financial instrument (permanent) | A financial arrangement between two parties (e.g. a convertible note) that is regarded as debt in one country and equity in another. The effect of this misalignment in characterisation is that payments under the arrangement are treated as tax deductible interest to the payer and (generally) tax exempt dividends for the recipient. |
| Reverse hybrid entity | The reverse of a hybrid entity; an entity that is treated for tax purposes as transparent in its establishment jurisdiction and as opaque in the jurisdiction of its parent/investor. This type of entity has the potential to create a double non-taxation result. |
| Share lending | A transaction where the owner of a share lends that share to another person. Typically the share borrower will transfer collateral to the lender and will pay the share lender a replacement or substitute payment for any dividends rpaid on the shares during the term of the share lending arrangement (which is often very short) if applicable. Share lending has the potential to fall within the hybrid mismatch rules if the arrangement is between related parties or is a structured arrangement, is cross-border, and the two jurisdictions involved take inconsistent views of the substitute payment.  <br>Share repos are similar transactions and can produce similar results. |
| Share repo | Similar to share lending, but this time the shares are provided as collateral for a loan from the share borrower to the share lender. A share repo differs from secured lending because the money lender can sell the shares during the term of the loan, remaining subject of course to an obligation to redeliver them. |
| Tax consolidation / loss grouping | Tax consolidation refers to the ability of related party entities to consolidate their tax returns. This can have the effect of enabling hybrid outcomes, as hybrid losses (double deductions and unbalanced deductions) can be consolidated with the ordinary income of a related entity.  <br>Similarly, loss grouping rules allow a hybrid loss to be transferred into a related party entity that is in profit, thus reducing their taxable income. |

1 If a country has enacted recommendation 2, the defensive response under recommendation 1 would only apply in relation to mismatches where the payee is not treated as receiving a dividend. An example is a sale of property with deferred payment, where the buyer is entitled to a deduction for deemed interest, but the seller is not taxable on that amount as ordinary income.

2 We understand this is based on a tax treatment that applies in Malta.
