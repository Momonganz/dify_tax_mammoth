Child Support Amendment Bill (No 4) Officials’ Report to the Social Services Committee on Submissions on the Bill 3 May 2006 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department 2 CONTENTS Introduction 1 Part 1: Departure from formula assessment of child support initiated by Commissioner (proposed new Part 6B) 3 Overview 5 Effectiveness/purpose of proposal 10 Proposal is not needed or should be limited to beneficiary custodians 11 Legitimate tax structures 12 Matters to be considered by Commissioner 13 Special circumstances 14 Commissioner’s powers 15 Custodian’s rights 17 Information provided to custodian 18 Investigation process 19 Automatic investigation 20 Review current administrative review process 21 Timeframes and other administrative issues 22 Part 2: Other matters in bill (arranged by submission) 25 Part 3: Issues raised by officials 83 1 INTRODUCTION The Child Support Amendment Bill (No 4) amends the Child Support Act 1991. The principal changes are: • new provisions for the write-off of penalty debt; • the introduction of two new exemptions from liability and the restructuring of the exemption provisions in a new Part 5A; • the introduction of a new administrative review procedure; • the introduction of new appeal rights; and • new provisions relating to the acceptance of overseas birth documentation. When the child support scheme was introduced to replace the previous systems of court-ordered maintenance and the liable parent contribution scheme, it was the intention of the government that it would be a simple scheme, and relatively easy to understand and administer, using taxable income as a consistent basis on which to assess the capacity of a liable parent 1 to provide support for their children. As a safeguard for liable parents who consider that the amount they are expected to pay, or for custodians who consider the amount they are entitled to receive, is unfair, either party could seek consideration by the Family Court of the special circumstances of their case. The administrative review process was subsequently introduced as a more informal, low-cost means of obtaining individual consideration. Many of the submissions on this bill advocate a reversal of that position. The proposals submitted would, in many cases, require individual consideration of the appropriate level of support with consequent high compliance and administrative costs. Thirty-four written submissions were received on the Child Support Amendment Bill, of which 18 were supported by oral submission. Very few of the submissions relate to specific provisions in the bill. Several submitters oppose the reporting of the bill back to the House. Instead they advocate a full review of the child support scheme. Of the submissions that do relate to specific provisions in the bill, the majority relate to the proposed new Part 6B of the Act. The report on that Part and the related submissions is contained in Part 1. Other matters raised are contained in Part 2, which is arranged by submission. Part 3 contains issues raised by officials. 1 The term “liable persons”, when it is used, is inclusive of payers of child support and domestic maintenance, whereas liable parents are payers of child support only. 2 3 Part 1: Departure from formula assessment of child support initiated by Commissioner (proposed new Part 6B) 4 5 OVERVIEW Clause 24 The bill introduces a new Part 6B to the Child Support Act 1991 which will allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to initiate a departure from a formula-based child support assessment. Apart from the initiation being made by the Commissioner rather than the liable parent or custodian, all other aspects of the administrative review process remain unchanged. Court decisions have already established precedents that “look through” legitimate tax structures adopted by liable parents if the effect has been to significantly reduce the amount of child support payable. The purpose of the change is to ensure that liable parents’ capacity to financially support their children is based on the income, earning capacity and/or assets they have available to them. As the child support formula is based on taxable income it provides an incentive for liable parents wishing to minimise their child support liability to reduce their taxable income. Most liable parents receive a salary, wages or a benefit and thus, apart from exchanging salary or wages for a fringe benefit, such as a car, or employer superannuation contributions, or deliberately giving up or reducing their employment, have limited opportunity to manipulate their income in order to minimise their child support liability. However, the way in which other liable parents, for example, business people and those with investment income, can structure their financial affairs means that the amount of child support they pay may not reflect their capacity to pay. If the structures are legal for income tax purposes, they cannot be challenged by the Commissioner. The structures may have been adopted for legitimate reasons, such as separating business and private assets. Equally, they may have been adopted to minimise child support liabilities. While there may be good reasons for liable parents to have a reduction in their income following separation (for example, additional debt may have been incurred to retain business assets or investments may have been transferred to the custodian as part of the matrimonial property settlement), the following graph shows that liable parents are over-represented in lower income levels and under-represented in higher income levels. 6 COMPARISON OF NON-SALARY AND WAGE EARNER TAXPAYERS A GED 18 – 65 FOR THE 2004 TAX YEAR 0.0% 5.0% 10.0% 15.0% 20.0% $0 or less <$10k< $20k< $30k< $40k< $50k< $60k< $70k< $80k< $90k over $90k All Liable Parents Percentage of Taxpayers Income Whatever the reason for the way in which liable parents structure their financial affairs, if they have the effect of reducing the person’s own taxable income, and thus their child support liability, the intent of the Child Support Act that parents contribute to their children’s support according to their capacity to pay is defeated. The Child Support Act allows either parent to seek a departure from the formula assessment on the basis that it results in an unjust or unfair level of financial support because of the income, earning capacity, property or other financial resources of either parent or the child. (There are nine other grounds upon which a departure may be sought.) However, many custodians are unable to seek a departure owing to lack of information of the liable parent’s financial affairs. This lack of information has also been raised in submissions. Liable parents can choose not to participate in the review, and this includes choosing not to supply any information regarding their income and/or assets. As the onus of proof is on the party applying for a departure, if the other party is uncooperative, the applicant may be unable to establish his or her case. In this situation the Review Officer may seek the assistance of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to obtain information from tax records and/or third parties. However, if the liable parent’s tax records are not up to date, there may be little information to pass on to the Review Officer. Even when the liable parent’s tax records are up to date, it may not be obvious from the liable parent’s own tax return that assets have been diverted to another tax structure, such as a trust. If the liable parent does participate in the review, the information supplied may not be complete. Review Officers need to be able to justify the level at which they set a liable parent’s income and they are therefore limited to the information available to them. 7 Proposal for Commissioner-initiated reviews The intention behind the proposed Part 6B is to allow the Commissioner to identify cases where he considers that liable parents have a greater capacity to contribute to their children’s financial support than that arising from basing their liability on their taxable income. The Commissioner will thus be considering just one of the ten grounds on which a departure may be granted. However, both the liable parent and the custodian could make an application under the existing provisions in Part 6A on any of the other grounds, and the liable parent could also raise the financial position of the other parent and/or child. Case selection will be by applying set criteria (which will not be made publicly available) against information held by Inland Revenue. No distinction in case selection will be made on the basis that the custodian is, or is not, a beneficiary. While information from custodians will be accepted, and fed into the case selection process, it will not be the single determinant of whether a liable parent is selected for review. Likewise, information referred by staff or Review Officers will also feed into the selection process. It is expected that self-employed liable parents will form the bulk of those investigated. However, salary and wage earner liable parents will be included if any evidence is received of a significant employer superannuation contribution for salary substitution being made, or of a large fringe benefit being enjoyed which the liable parent has a choice in receiving. The Commissioner will use the existing powers he has under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to establish what he considers to be a liable parent’s full financial position. These powers include: • requiring liable parents to provide any information that the Commissioner requires, such as details of any financial interest in any entity which is not reflected in their own income tax return, recent dispositions of assets, etc.; • if there are doubts about the veracity of the information supplied, requiring the liable parent to make a statutory declaration; and • if the information is not supplied, seeking a court order to require the liable parent to supply the information. From the information gathered, plus anything else that the Commissioner has access to, a summary (the “statement of reasons” referred to in the proposed section 96T) of the liable parent’s income, assets, liabilities, any indirect interests in other tax entities and any other relevant information (such as whether a new partner is financially independent of the liable parent) will be prepared. This summary will be supplied to the liable parent and a period allowed for the liable parent to raise any concerns he or she has with the Commissioner. An amended summary will be issued if the Commissioner agrees with the liable parent. Should liable parents not accept that the summary truly represents their financial position, their reasons for this may be set out in writing and this will be attached to the summary. Once the information is agreed (or a statement of disagreement is received from the liable parent), a notice will be sent to both the custodian and the liable parent advising that the Commissioner intends to initiate the review process. The liable parent (but not the custodian) will also receive a summary of the information on which the Commissioner has based his decision. At this stage, the custodian will have three choices: to ask the Commissioner not to proceed (non-beneficiary custodians only); to 8 become a party to the proceedings; or to accept the outcome of the review without becoming a party to the proceedings. The usual review process will then follow. Review Officers will consider the summary provided by the Commissioner, together with any submissions made by the liable parent and/or the custodian, and reach a conclusion based on existing case law as to whether the child support assessment ought to be amended. As with any administrative review, the liable parent and the custodian will each have the opportunity to appear before the Review Officer in person (or by telephone if this is more convenient). The liable parent will still have the choice of not participating but, should this happen, the Review Officer will be able to recommend a departure on the basis of the information contained in the summary. The Commissioner will not make any further representations to the Review Officer, but Review Officers will be able to seek clarification of any item included in the summary and/or further information from the Commissioner. As with any other administrative review, the first step will be to establish that “special circumstances” exist. Once that test has been met, any adjustment to the child support liability will still need to be “just and equitable” and “otherwise proper”. As with the existing review process, if it is relevant to the decision, information (other than that relating to a third party, such as the income of the liable parent’s new partner) on which the decision is based will be included in the information supplied to both the liable parent and the custodian. As departures from the formula assessment are not limited to just the current year, it is envisaged that any departure made under the proposed Part 6B will usually be made for a number of years to avoid the Commissioner having to review the same cases year after year until child support ceases to be payable for the child(ren). If a liable parent or custodian is unhappy with the outcome of the review, he or she will be able to lodge an appeal in the Family Court against the Commissioner’s decision (with the usual appeal rights to a higher court). However, the Commissioner will not be able to lodge an appeal but will automatically be a party to the proceedings. Examples The following examples are some of the situations which are likely to be reviewed. Example 1 A salary and wage earner has income of $90,000 and enters into an arrangement with his/her employer to reduce that to $60,000 with $30,000 being paid into a superannuation fund. The $30,000 is subject to tax (specified superannuation contribution withholding tax), but not at the employee level. In this case child support would have been reduced by between $5,400 and $9,000. This person’s choice to substitute income for savings should not be to the detriment of his or her child(ren). 9 Example 2 A salary and wage earner has income of $60,000 and enters into an arrangement with his/her employer to reduce that to $40,000 in return for an interest-free loan of $250,000. The value of the loan is subject to fringe benefit tax, again not at the employee level. In this case child support would have been reduced by between $3,600 and $6,000. Example 3 An independent contractor changes from being a sole trader to a company and owns all but one share. The company, after legitimate business expenditure, has a net profit of $60,000. The contractor decides to draw a salary of $38,000. The balance is taxed at the company rate of 33 cents in the dollar. If the contractor had drawn the full $60,000, his or her child support would have been between $3,960 and $6,600 higher. Note: In each of the examples the lower amount is where child support is payable for one child and the higher, for four or more children. Also, each example assumes that the liable parent does not have shared custody. Submissions Eleven submissions were made on the proposal to allow the Commissioner to initiate a departure from a formula-based child support assessment. Support and opposition were roughly equal. 10 EFFECTIVENESS/PURPOSE OF PROPOSAL Submission 1 (13W – Judge P F Boshier) The proposal is likely to be ineffective as it does not address the issue of the Commissioner or a Family Court being able to set aside any scheme or device which has the effect of reducing a liable parent’s child support obligation. Comment The proposal intends that there be another avenue into the review process. The courts have shown that they will “look through” structures which have the effect of reducing child support. Officials are not aware of any problem where a Review Officer or a court has had difficulty in setting an income amount for a liable parent which takes into account income or assets available to the liable parent in another tax entity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal should provide a rule or series of rules that better target the mischief that Inland Revenue is seeking to address. Comment The proposal has the very simple objective of ensuring that liable parents contribute to the financial support of their children according to their capacity to provide such support. The Tax Information Bulletin which will be published following enactment of the legislation will explain both this and the process the Commissioner will follow. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 PROPOSAL IS NOT NEEDED OR SHOULD BE LIMITED TO BENEFICIARY CUSTODIANS Submission 1 (21 – Parents for Children) The proposal is unnecessary as custodians may already make an application for a departure. The proposal will create conflict. Submission 2 (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal should be limited to circumstances when the qualifying custodian is in receipt of a social security benefit. Comment One of the problems that the proposal is intended to address is that many custodians cannot or will not make an application for a departure, often because they lack the information on which to do so. Non-beneficiary custodians can always ask the Commissioner to discontinue proceedings. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission 3 (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Information which is subject to the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 may be released to the custodian. Comment This is already the situation. For example, if a liable parent chooses not to participate in the administrative review process, information that is supplied from Inland Revenue’s tax records may be included to justify the decision recommended by the Review Officer. Sections 96P and 124 and proposed section 96ZF place restrictions on the publication of information in a decision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 LEGITIMATE TAX STRUCTURES Submission 1 (16 – Andy Lewis and Shelley Windley-Lewis) Individuals should be allowed to organise their financial affairs to their best advantage. Levels of child support are the reason liable parents may be utilizing structures such as loss attributing qualifying companies. Comment Provided the custodian is not in receipt of a benefit, liable parents and custodians are able to ignore the amount of child support which would be payable under a formula assessment and come to their own arrangement regarding the level of child support to be paid. Legitimate tax structures should not be able to be used to the detriment of children. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) All administrative reviews (not just the ones to which this proposal relates) must follow standard accounting practices. Comment Legitimate tax structures should be following standard accounting practices. However, the proposal does not attempt to change legitimate tax structures or standard accounting practices, but rather to address the issue of structures which are legitimate for income tax purposes but have the effect of unfairly reducing a liable parent’s taxable income, and thus his or her child support liability. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED BY COMMISSIONER Submission 1 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) The ability for the Commissioner to act on the basis of any information in his possession should be removed. Comment This provision is essential to the proposal and mirrors that which currently applies to administrative reviews. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Commissioner should have regard to the financial position of the custodial parent. Comment The formula assessment does not take into account the custodian’s income. The proposal is attempting to address the issue of the liable parent’s taxable income being an inadequate measure of the liable parent’s ability to financially support his or her children. Proposed section 96R(1)(a) requires consideration of “...the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of either parent or the child...”. This mirrors existing section 105(2)(c)(i). At present, if a liable parent does not participate in the administrative review process, the Review Officer is limited to the information that can be obtained from Inland Revenue’s tax records or from third parties, such as banks, using the powers the Commissioner has to seek information under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Officials envisage that the reverse will apply in Commissioner-initiated reviews if the custodian does not participate and the liable parent raises the issue of the custodian’s own financial position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Submission (26 – Child Advocacy Services) The Commissioner’s determination of special circumstances should be subject to appeal and special circumstances must be established prior to any preliminary enquiries. Comment A significant disparity between a liable parent’s taxable and economic income/assets is likely to be the special circumstance. It will take the preliminary enquiries to establish this. Special circumstances will have to be established before a departure from the formula assessment can be made. Any appeal will be to the Commissioner’s determination regarding the finding that special circumstances do exist, and will be through the Family Court in the first instance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 COMMISSIONER’S POWERS Submission 1 (20W – Solo Women as Parents Christchurch Inc) The Commissioner should not be able to refuse to make a determination because the issues are too complex. The Commissioner should have the power to investigate beyond complexities created by liable parents who are able to make themselves appear cash poor with the assistance of skilled accountants. In complex cases the onus should not be on the custodian to make an application to the court for an order. Submission 2 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) The provision which allows the Commissioner to refuse to make a determination because the issues are too complex should be removed. Comment The Commissioner will have the powers in the Tax Administration Act to investigate and determine a position on the income and assets available to a liable parent. This power extends to seeking a court order to require the liable parent to supply the information. However, issues may arise which are so complex that the Review Officer considers they should be best considered by the courts. This mirrors the current provisions relating to administrative reviews. Situations where the Commissioner might currently refuse to make a determination on these grounds include complex property matters that are before a Court. Allowing the Commissioner to take complex cases to the courts in the place of the custodian is likely to create a significant imbalance between the resources available to the Commissioner and those available to the liable parent. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission 3 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) The provision which permits the Commissioner to conduct a hearing, enquiry or investigation in such manner as he thinks fit, and not be bound by any rules of evidence should be removed. 16 Comment This provision mirrors the existing provision which currently applies to administrative reviews. Its removal would impact on the informal manner in which administrative reviews are held. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 4 (28W – Angela Gail Church) The submitter questions Inland Revenue not appearing before a Review Officer and not being able to lodge an appeal. Comment As with the current administrative review process, Review Officers will be contracted to hear cases and recommend to the Commissioner whether to make a determination. However, it is the Commissioner who will determine whether there should be a departure from the formula assessment. This submission would therefore require the Commissioner to lodge an appeal against his own decision. With regard to Inland Revenue appearing before a Review Officer, this would create the imbalance between the resources available to the Commissioner and those available to the liable parent referred to above, and could impact adversely on the informal nature of the proceedings. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 17 CUSTODIAN’S RIGHTS Submission 1 (9 – The Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) Custodians should not be able to ask the Commissioner to discontinue proceedings if the review is likely to produce a reduction in the amount of child support payable by the liable parent. Comment Cases selected for review will be where the Commissioner considers that liable parents have a greater capacity to contribute to their children’s financial support than that arising from basing their liability on their taxable income. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that the Commissioner would initiate a review if there is likely to be a downward movement. If this were to be the case, and the non-beneficiary custodian did ask for the proceedings to be discontinued, there would be nothing to stop the liable parent seeking his or her own departure from the formula assessment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (9 – The Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society Custodians should be a parties to the proceedings unless they elect not to be a party. Comment The submission is the reverse of that proposed. Officials consider that custodians having the choice to opt in is preferable to making them a party unless they choose to opt out. Also, this mirrors the existing administrative review process which allows the party other than the one seeking a departure the choice as to whether to participate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 INFORMATION PROVIDED TO CUSTODIAN Submission (9 – The Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society, 13W – Judge P F Boshier) Custodians should be informed of the reasons for proceedings and all the information upon which the Commissioner intends to rely. Without this, there could be a breach of the principles of natural justice. The lack of information hinders both the custodian and the courts. If custodians had access to this information they would be able to take proceedings themselves. Comment It is accepted that custodians are sometimes unable to initiate the review process themselves owing to lack of information regarding the liable parent’s financial affairs. Indeed, this is one of the main reasons for the proposal. However, there needs to be a balance between a liable parent’s right to privacy and the custodian’s right to a fair level of child support. Some information, such as that relating to a liable parent’s new partner, while it may be relevant to the decision reached by a Review Officer, should not be available to the custodian. It is expected that the proposal will result in greater information feeding into the review process, thus providing a better basis for a Review Officer to recommend a departure from the formula. The information relevant to the decision reached by Review Officers will be contained in it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 INVESTIGATION PROCESS Submission 2 (25 – Nik Renwick) The proposed changes do not specify what an investigation would entail. To allow a public authority the right to carry out an investigation without any definition of the limitations is dangerous. Comment The investigation will be akin to ones that Inland Revenue already carries out for the purposes of revenues such as income tax and GST, albeit with a different focus. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 AUTOMATIC INVESTIGATION Submission (11 – Birthright New Zealand Incorporated National Executive) There should be an automatic investigation of any liable parent who seems to be evading child support. Comment The Commissioner does not have the resources for this proposal to be adopted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 REVIEW CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS Submission 1 (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There needs to be a substantial correction to the current administrative review process as the current framework is insufficient to adequately deal with the financial and commercial aspects of child support decisions, and this will be worse once extended to deal with Commissioner-initiated determinations. As child support determinations involve the consideration of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the parent or child, and not other factors, Review Officers should have commercial experience and some knowledge of family law (rather than the current emphasis on family law experience). Submission 2 (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Administrative reviews for child support should be carried out by the Adjudication Unit of Inland Revenue, and not review officers contracted to the Child Support Agency. Comment The submitter’s position that child support determinations involve consideration of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of a parent or the child, and not other factors ignores the fact that determinations often need consideration of factors governed by one of the other nine grounds. Although each ground does have a fiscal element, an opinion may need to be formed on such matters as how both parents wish their child to be educated or what constitutes special needs. A large body of expertise has built up in the nearly 12 years that Review Officers have been recommending departures from formula assessments. Under the proposal, Review Officers will have not only the Commissioner’s findings, but also any representations that the liable parent chooses to make. While parties to an administrative review are not able to have professional representation at the review hearing, it could be sought in the preparation of any reasons why a liable parent considers that the Commissioner’s findings of income and/or assets are incorrect. Determination of income by Inland Revenue’s Adjudication Unit would be better placed in a regime that allows the Commissioner to simply modify the taxable income parameter in the standard formula, with the liable parent having objection rights to the quantum of income thus determined. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 22 TIMEFRAMES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES Submission 1 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) The response times for a liable parent or custodian to make written representations should be increased from 14 days to at least 28 days. Comment The proposed response times are the same as those which currently relate to administrative reviews. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) A requirement should be inserted that all actions and decisions must be clearly explained to the liable parent. Comment The bill specifically provides for liable parents to be notified of the reasons the Commissioner considers that a departure from the formula assessment might be appropriate and, if the Commissioner does decide to initiate proceedings, a summary of the information on which the Commissioner has based his decision. In addition, Review Officers are required to explain the position they have reached in making their recommendation. Any deficiency in Review Officers’ recommendations would not be addressed through this suggestion. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Submission 3 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) The ability for the Commissioner to refuse to hear a custodian (who has elected to become a party to the proceedings) if written representations are not made within the prescribed time should be removed. Comment This provision mirrors the existing provision which currently applies to administrative reviews. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 4 (26 – Child Advocacy Services) That the provision relating to making a determination retrospective should be removed. Submission 5 (13W – Judge P F Boshier) The submitter questioned whether the provisions relating to making a departure from the formula assessment retrospective are in harmony with the other departure provisions in the Child Support Act. Comment Case law indicates that departure orders made under existing provisions cannot be made retrospective. The Commissioner therefore does not make a retrospective determination in relation to current departures from the formula assessment. This will also be the position under the proposal to allow the Commissioner to initiate the administrative review process. Officials consider that the proposed new section 96ZE mirrors the existing provision which currently applies to retrospectivity of administrative reviews, and that there is therefore harmony with the other departure provisions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 24 Submission 5 (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should issue a standard practice statement with guidelines on the use of the power to initiate determinations on child support, and the commencement date for Commissioner-initiated administrative reviews should be deferred until Inland Revenue has consulted on this. Comment Inland Revenue will issue a standard practice statement on the process it intends adopting in advising liable parents if, after preliminary enquiries have established that the liable parent’s financial affairs should be subject to an investigation, of its intention to commence an investigation. However, the standard practice statement will not prescribe when, and in what circumstances, the Commissioner will commence an investigation. Nor will it prescribe the information which the Commissioner may provide to Review Officers. To attempt to draw up a prescriptive list of what can be investigated and/or used to initiate a review runs the risk that the list would be incomplete. Recommendation Note that Inland Revenue’s normal practice before issuing a standard practice statement is to release a draft publicly for comment. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants will be able to comment on the proposed standard practice statement at that stage. 25 Part 2: Other matters in bill (arranged by submission) 26 27 Submission (1W – Eugenie Hellewell) Submission 1 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 2 Measures should be introduced which would prevent a parent on a Domestic Purposes Benefit for no legitimate reason other than a desire not to work, receiving Child Support when both parents share equal custody of their child. Comment Child support is not generally paid to a custodian in receipt of a Domestic Purposes Benefit, unless the amount paid exceeds the amount of the net benefit. The bill does not deal with the criteria for receiving a Domestic Purposes Benefit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 Submission (2W – Paul A Doyle) Submission 1 The increase in the living allowance of $60 per month to include a dependent spouse or partner is insufficient to support another person. Comment The living allowance increases from $13,149 2 a year for a single liable parent with no dependent children to $17,772 a year for a person who is married or has a civil union or de facto partner. The increase is $4,623 a year ($385 a month). The living allowance rate for a couple with no children is based on the gross married rate of the unemployment benefit, which has been designed to provide a modest standard of living. The benefit rates and living allowances are adjusted annually based on movements in the Consumer Price Index. Submission 2 Inland Revenue is ruthless in collecting child support. Inland Revenue should collect court fines. Comment This bill does not deal with the collection of court fines, and consideration of the appropriate collection agency for court fines is not within the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 2 Rates for 2006-07 child support year. 29 Submission (3 – Robert Kilkolly) Submission 1 “Contribution” should entail a fair and equal share of child-related expenses from both parents, by taking into account the income of both parents. Comment Recently proposed changes to the child support scheme in Australia recognise the income of both parents and an estimate of the costs of children. However, it should be noted that those proposed changes have been developed within a broader context of change in family law generally. The need has been identified for New Zealand-based evidence of the real costs of children. Both the Families Commission and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) have explored developing a budget standards approach (one of the methodologies that contributed to the estimate of the costs of children in intact Australian families) 3 to estimate the costs of children and have recommended against progressing this approach. Instead, MSD will be using living standards data to estimate equivalence scales. 4 MSD will also be exploring the topic further as part of qualitative research to be carried out as part of the evaluation of the Working for Families package. When the results of that research are available, the information may contribute to any future consideration of a different basis on which to assess child support liability. The Minister of Revenue has instructed officials to consider whether recognition should be given to lower levels of shared care than the current 40% of nights threshold. That work will also consider the proposed changes in the Australian child support scheme. Submission 2 All income and allowances should be calculated upon net earnings, not gross earnings. Comment The child support percentages were set at a level that produces a certain level of child support payable, based on taxable income. If the formula were to move to an after-tax income base, those percentages would need to be increased and there would have to be a different formula for each tax rate, adding considerably to the complexity of the system. 3 Report of the Australian Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support 4 Equivalence scales permit the comparison of living standards among households of different size and composition. They usually take a two-adult household as the base and apply an appropriate ratio to the income of a household of a different size or composition – producing a measure called “equivalised income”. 30 Submission 3 The contribution should be calculated upon the actual and reasonable costs for raising the child or children concerned, rather than based upon a liable parent’s earnings and financial status. Comment The relevant data is not immediately available as contended by the submitter. It should also be noted that a “cost of children” approach to establishing child support liability would not necessarily produce a simpler system as there is no fixed “cost of children”. The costs of children vary in relation to a range of factors, such as the level of income of their parents, the age of the children, location of the family and the gender mix of the children. The sample calculation provided by the submitter takes into account the incomes of both parents but assumes that the cost of the child is fixed. Submission 4 All actual and reasonable costs, including any changes to those circumstances, for contribution should be agreed to by both the custodian and liable parent. Comment Any changes in costs incurred by a custodian do not currently affect the level of support to be provided by the liable parent, unless those changes arise through special circumstances that provide a basis for an application for an administrative determination of the level of child support to be paid. If the submitter is suggesting that child support should be adjusted administratively in relation to cost changes incurred by both parents, this would impose high compliance costs on both parents and high administrative costs for Inland Revenue. In particular, it would be difficult to estimate the child-related portion of fixed household costs such as power, rates, mortgage payments or rent, and insurance. Submission 5 The custodial parent must account for all contribution payments received for the support of the child or children and present this information at a yearly reassessment. Comment The submission is somewhat inconsistent with the previous submissions as it suggests that only one parent should be accountable for costs incurred in relation to the children. The submission implies that there should be an end-of-year adjustment if actual costs are higher or lower than allowed in the assessment. This would create end-of-year debts for custodians, if proven costs are lower; or for liable parents if proven costs were higher. This would impose high compliance and administrative costs. 31 Submission 6 Contribution for child support by both parents should be calculated upon the ratio difference between both the liable and custodial parent’s actual net income and household earnings. Comment The proposal would, if accepted, involve a major re-structuring of the child support scheme. If the government were to agree to consider the proposal it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Submission 7 The income and household earnings of both the liable and custodial parent should be based upon actual figures for a full PAYE financial year, rather than temporary assessments being actioned in February of each year. Comment The changes to the year of assessment for child support were introduced with effect from 1 April 2001. They were intended to facilitate a better alignment between the year in which taxable income is earned and the year in which it is used as the basis of a child support formula assessment, for most liable parents. Because child support assessments must be issued in time for liable parents and, where appropriate, employers to adjust payment arrangements before the start of the child support year, awaiting full-year income details as suggested by the submitter would require a change to the child support year so that it would start from 1 July, instead of 1 April as at present. This possibility was considered at the time of the policy change, but was rejected by the government because the scope of the information technology work involved in implementing the change would have posed a significant risk to the child support system and other major information technology projects that Inland Revenue had planned or underway at that time. Approximately one-third of assessments that have been based on a partial estimation are adjusted in July each year when finalised actual income for the year ending the previous 31 March comes available. No adjustment is made if the income variation is less than $500 more or less than the estimation. For the year ended March 2004, 63% had an increase in their assessment, while 37% had a reduction. Of the increased assessments, 74% were for amounts less than $500 for the whole year. 32 Submission 8 In assessing contribution payments, the cost of raising children in another relationship must also be fairly included to ensure that no family receives less support for their child or children than the custodial or liable parent receives under assessment. Comment It is a principle underpinning the Act that obligations to birth and adopted children are not extinguished by obligations to stepchildren. However, a person’s responsibility for children in a subsequent family is recognised through the living allowance. The difference in the current child support year between the living allowance for a couple with no children and that for a couple with one child is $7,147. It is not until a liable parent’s income reaches $65,000 that the amount of child support payable for one child exceeds the marginal increase in the living allowance for one child. Recognition that some economies of scale can be achieved for second and subsequent children is built into the formula, both in the living allowances and the child support percentages. Submission 9 The administrative review process should be amended to provide a fairer forum for all matters to be considered and to seek fair assessments based upon the input and needs of both parents and their families. Comment The submitter suggests a number of changes to the administrative review process that would, in his view, be of benefit to the process. The administrative review process was introduced in 1994 to address perceived barriers of access to the Family Court. A significant barrier for both liable parents and custodians was the cost of legal representation. A further inequity arose when one party could afford to be legally represented and the other could not. Among other concerns was the relative formality of the courts – even though the Family Court is less formal than other courts, an appearance can be intimidating for those unused to the court process. However, an applicant for an administrative review who is not satisfied with the outcome has a right to take the case to the Family Court for more formal consideration. Under a proposed amendment contained in clause 25, respondents who are dissatisfied with the outcome of an administrative review will also be able to take an appeal to the Family Court. In a speech delivered to a child support conference in November 2005, principal family court judge Boshier commented that the process is generally considered to be working well. That perception is supported by the low numbers of cases being taken to the Family Court since the process was introduced. The highest number of cases heard by the Family Court was 44 in the 1998-99 year. In that year there were 3,465 applications for administrative review. 33 Submission 10 The management and administration of credit and arrears issues should be overhauled to provide a more effective, supportive and responsive method in which to manage arrears payments and gain the acceptance and co-operation of all parties. Comment The proposed changes in clause 32 are intended to provide relief to liable parents (and those liable for domestic maintenance) who have incurred incremental penalty debt. Under the new provisions, it will be mandatory for Inland Revenue to write off accrued incremental penalties (imposed for earlier non-payment of financial support liability), when payments in accordance with an agreement to pay ongoing liability together with amounts in repayment of arrears have been maintained for 26 weeks. The write-offs will be based on a pro-rata percentage of the arrears, including initial late payment penalties, which have been paid. Inland Revenue has in place a debt management strategy for dealing with child support cases in arrears. This involves close case management of individual cases and timely contact with employers, when appropriate, to commence automatic deductions from wages and salary. Recommendation Note in relation to submissions 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. That submissions 2, 5, 7, 9 and 10 be declined. 34 Submission (4W – J K V Von Hooker) Submission 1 Changes should be made to deal with hardship faced by liable parents. Comment The submitter cites the stress associated with a missed payment as a result of the timing of deductions from a benefit made by Work & Income. The problem has been identified and has occurred in years in which a benefit payment due in early January is brought forward and paid out in December. The extra child support deduction created a credit in the December period, which, under the payment allocation rules, was credited to past arrears. However, the subsequent shortfall in January would have generated an arrears notice for that month and the imposition of a late-payment penalty. It has in past years been necessary to manually identify the affected customers, re- allocate their payment to the correct month and reverse the penalty. However, agreement has now been reached with Work & Income to include such “early” deductions in the schedule for the month to which they relate. In general, liable parents who consider their child support liability is contributing to hardship can negotiate with Inland Revenue, if the amount they are required to pay includes arrears, to seek a reduction in the level of arrears recovery. Alternatively, if they consider there are special circumstances in their situation such that the level of liability is inappropriate, they can seek a departure from the standard formula assessment through an administrative review. In addition, the provisions in clause 32 for the write-off of incremental penalties will provide some relief to liable parents through the progressive write-off of those incremental penalties as the arrears of liability are reduced. Submission 2 There should be a cut-off point above a certain income level for tax rises. Comment The bill does not deal with tax rates. Therefore, the submission is not within the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 35 Submission (5 – Douglas MacCredie) Submission 1 An exemption to undertake education should apply to anyone regardless of age. Comment The policy reason for introducing a new exemption for under 16-year-old liable parents was not to provide a choice between undertaking further education or parenting. It reflects their compulsory participation in the education system until they reach age 16, and places young people in a similar position to other liable parents who are prevented from earning an income from which they could meet their obligation to support their children. Adult choices as to lifestyle and provision for future needs should not come before current liability to support their children. Submission 2 The assessment formula itself is in need of redevelopment. The formula needs to be relative to the actual reasonable costs of supporting a child, and not just automatically increased as the liable parent earns more. Comment The need has been identified for New Zealand-based evidence of the real costs of children. Both the Families Commission and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) have explored developing a budget standards approach (one of the methodologies that contributed to the estimate of the costs of children in intact Australian families) 5 to estimate the costs of children and have recommended against progressing this approach. Instead, MSD will be using living standards data to estimate equivalence scales. 6 MSD will also be exploring the topic further as part of qualitative research to be carried out as part of the evaluation of the Working for Families package. When the results of that research are available, they could contribute to any future consideration of a different basis for calculating child support liability. However, it should also be noted that a “cost of children” approach to establishing child support liability would still require some regard to the income of the parents as there is no fixed “cost of children”. The costs of children vary in relation to the level of income of their parents. 5 Report of the Australian Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support. 6 Equivalence scales permit the comparison of living standards among households of different size and composition. They usually take a two-adult household as the base and apply an appropriate ratio to the income of a household of a different size or composition – producing a measure called “equivalised income”. 36 Submission 3 The Child Support Bill must be developed in a way that properly acknowledges its inseparability from the role of the Family Court and often the domestic purposes benefit arm of Work & Income. Comment The agencies responsible for the administration of the Family Court and the domestic purposes benefit were both consulted in the development of policy proposals given effect through this bill in acknowledgment of the wider policy context in which changes to the child support scheme should be considered. However, the bill does not deal with the role of the Family Court or the administration of the domestic purposes benefit. Submission 4 The bill should make provision for the best use of money for the needs of the child, in the present and future, and allow parents to perform whatever role they are best at regardless of whether they are the custodial or non-custodial parent. Comment Decisions relating to expenditure in relation to the day-to-day care of children and the roles of their parents are private matters beyond the scope of the bill or the Child Support Act. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 37 Submission (6 – Murray Coppen) Submission 1 The timeframe for appeals in proposed section 103B(3)(a) should be amended to impose no time limit, to be consistent with the timeframe applications to the Family Court for a departure, following an unsuccessful application for an administrative review. Comment The inclusion of a time limit for appeals is consistent with the Legislation Advisory Committee’s Guidelines on Process & Content of Legislation. Time limits provide certainty to those affected and speed up the process without denying review. It is considered advisable to confer a power to extend the time limit on the appellate body, as has been done in this case. This mitigates the harsh inflexibility a strict time limit can cause, and allows the court to extend the time limit to one that would be available if the application was for a departure under section 104 of the principal Act, if it considers that to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. Submission 2 The bill should address the difficulties facing liable parents with substantial access. Comment The “cliff effect” as described in the submission inevitably occurs when limitations are imposed on access to a right. In the situation where the care of a child is shared between parents the policy intent was that there would be some relief from liability if the liable parent was substantially equally sharing the care of the child. The threshold of 40% of the nights in a child support year provides a degree of tolerance around equal or 50:50 sharing. The bill does provide for other aspects of care arrangements to be taken into account when the level of care falls short of 40% of nights, such as: how the responsibility for decisions about the daily activities of the child is shared; who takes the child to and from school and supervises leisure activities; or how decisions about the education or health care of the child are made. Officials acknowledge that where there is regular overnight contact the total costs of children tend to increase significantly because of the duplicated infrastructure costs of running two households. The “shading approach” suggested in the submission has been adopted to some extent in Australia, where there is currently a two-tier reduction starting when care is provided for 30% of the nights in a child support year. The Australian Government has also announced that from July 2008 this threshold will be lowered so that recognition will be given in the formula to a liable parent who has care of the child for 14% or more nights. This may soften the “cliff effect” for the liable parent, but may reduce income into the custodian’s household by a greater amount than costs are reduced. To produce equitable outcomes for the parties involved, recognition of shared care arrangements in child support formula 38 assessments requires a balancing of the needs of liable parents with those of custodians. The Minister of Revenue has instructed officials to consider the issue of whether and to what extent recognition should be given to lower levels of shared care than the current 40% of nights threshold. That work will consider the proposed changes in the Australian child support scheme, noting the broader context of change in family law generally in which those changes have been developed. Submissions 3 and 4 A provision should be introduced relating to retrospectivity of administrative determinations that clarifies the position and ensures consistency with the provisions relating to departure orders; in particular, to “tidy up” the perceived tension between sections 96O and 106(2) of the Act. Comment Inland Revenue acknowledges that on the basis of case law precedents there is uncertainty about the ability for the Commissioner or the Family Court to make administrative determinations or departure orders with retrospective effect. The advice of the Solicitor-General has been sought on the appropriate means of obtaining clarification through the courts. A response has not yet been received. Submission 5 Inland Revenue should be directed to update its information/publications before the bill comes into force. Comment The publications provided by Inland Revenue to support the administration of the child support scheme are not provided for in the Act. The updating of those publications is outside the scope of this bill. However, as advised to the Committee in our memorandum of 27 March 2006, the relevant publications have been scheduled for updating to reflect legislative changes as a result of the passage of this bill. Recommendation That submissions 1 and 5 be declined. Note in relation to submission 2 that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. That submission 3 and 4 be noted pending advice from the Solicitor-General. 39 Submission (7 – Dr Vivian Paul Roberts) Submission 1 The submitter supports exemption for victims of sexual offences. Submission 2 There should also be exemptions for other aspects, such as breach of contract, fraud, psychological or verbal abuse. Comment The need for an exemption from child support liability for victims of sexual offences arose in the context of the gender neutralisation of the sexual offence rules under the Crimes Act 1961. Government considered that making victims of sex offences liable for child support was unjust because a victim should not be held responsible for legal obligations resulting from a sexual offence that was committed against him or her. In addition, the obligation to pay child support as a consequence of sexual activity that he or she had been forced to participate in may compound his or her victimisation. This was considered to be a justified departure from the general principle that underpins the Child Support Act that all children have a right to be maintained by their parents. Apart from the proposed exemption for victims of sexual offences, the only other circumstances in which an exemption from liability for child support has been allowed are those in which the liable person is prevented from earning an income from which they could meet their obligation to pay child support. Those circumstances are long-term imprisonment or hospitalisation, or compulsory attendance at school. Submission 3 There should be a refocusing of the child support system so that money does go to children. This was clarified in the oral submission – that the money should go into a trust fund and the custodian should keep receipts for expenditure. Comment All payments of child support are initially paid into the Crown Bank Account. Payments that are not retained to offset the cost to the State of providing a social security benefit to custodians and children are transferred to the Child Support Trust Bank Account, which is held and administered in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Public Finance Act 1989. Payments to custodians are made out of the trust account. 40 The submitter’s proposal would necessitate the establishment of individual trust funds, raising the issue of who would bear the cost of establishing and administering such funds. Further, the proposal that custodians should be required to produce receipts for all expenditure on behalf of the children would impose high compliance costs on custodians and very high administrative costs on Inland Revenue. Submission 4 There should be an upper limit of liability for each child. Comment Under the current scheme the amount of child support for each child is “capped” relative to the capacity of the liable parent to provide support. When the results of proposed research on the costs of children in New Zealand become available that information could contribute to any future consideration of a different basis for calculating child support liability. Submission 5 Neither parent should be required to pay child support when shared care is close to 50:50. Comment When parents share substantially equally the care of their children and neither parent is in receipt of a social security benefit, they already have the option to enter into a voluntary agreement to each bear their own costs of care, or to determine what quantum of support should be exchanged. It is only when one parent applies for a social security benefit that an application for formula assessment of child support becomes mandatory. There is an adjustment to the standard formula in cases of substantially equal sharing of care. For instance, the child support percentage for one shared child is 12% compared with 18% for a fully supported child. Submission 6 There should be an exemption from liability for child support for a person who can produce medical evidence of psychological ill health. Comment A person who is hospitalised as a result of psychological ill health would be entitled to an exemption from liability for child support if the period of hospitalisation is 13 weeks or more, subject to meeting the relevant income criteria. 41 Recommendation Note in relation to submission 5 that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. That submissions 2, 3, 4 and 6 be declined. 42 Submission (8 – Chuck Bird) Submission 1 The submitter supports the proposal for an exemption for victims of sexual offences. Submission 2 The whole Act has to be rewritten recognising that a formula cannot deal adequately with the many variables that are involved in determining a fair amount of child support, particularly without taking into account the financial position of the custodial parent. Comment The introduction to this report summarises the intent of the government of the time in introducing the child support scheme. This submission, if accepted, would completely reverse the basis on which the Act was developed. The introduction of further variables, including consideration of the financial position of custodians would impose high compliance costs on all parties and high administrative costs for Inland Revenue. If the government were to agree to consider the proposal it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Submission 3 There should be amendments so there are either no penalties or there are penalties for the custodial parent as well as the non-custodial parent. This should particularly apply where the custodial parent has obtained child support by dishonest means. Comment Penalties are not applied to amounts recoverable from custodians because these are not obligations to pay by a specific date. 43 Submission 4 Men should not be obliged to pay child support for a child who is not theirs unless they have accepted responsibility by adopting the child. Comment The Act makes a presumption of dependency only when a child was conceived or born during a legal marriage. In that case, the birth mother and the other party to the marriage are presumed to be the parents of the child. In all other cases formal documentary evidence of the birth and parentage is required. By way of exception, there are special rules in relation to children conceived as a result of any Assisted Human Reproduction procedure to which Part 2 of the Status of Children Act 1969 applies. When a person named as a liable parent considers that he is not the other parent of the child he has a right of objection to the acceptance of the application for child support under the Act. Submission 5 If a man suspects he is not the father of a child for whom he is paying child support, he should be allowed to get a DNA test without being obliged to notify the mother or the child. Comment The submitter clarified during his oral submission that in his view the mother should not even have knowledge of a DNA test in a case of disputed paternity. The provisions relating to parentage testing are contained in the Family Proceedings Act 1980 and are not within the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 44 Submission (9 – The Family Law Section of the New Zealand Law Society) Submission 1 Section 89E should be amended to exclude persons under 17 years of age. Comment Clause 17 inserts a new part 5A that introduces new exemptions for liable parents under the age of 16 years and victims of sexual offences, and restructures the existing provisions for exemptions from liability for financial support. Young parents under 16 years have limited ability to earn income for the period that they are compulsorily required to attend school. In addition, they are generally not eligible for social security benefits. The exemption is to be subject to the same income criteria as the existing exemptions. It is also consistent with wider policy objectives of encouraging young people to focus on educational achievements during the years of compulsory attendance at school and is likely to be in the long-term interests of both the young parent and their child. Once young people reach 16 years of age, they can choose whether to continue their education. They will become liable for at least the minimum amount of child support. Beyond the age at which compulsory attendance at school ceases, it could be considered discriminatory to determine an exemption from liability for child support on the basis of age. Submissions 2 to 5 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 6 Clause 26(1) should be deleted. Comment Under the current law a respondent to a successful application for an administrative determination is unable to take an application to the Family Court for a departure order without proving his or her own “special circumstances”. The fact of the administrative determination itself is not considered by the court to be a special circumstance. The respondent, therefore, is at a disadvantage before the court compared with an unsuccessful applicant for a determination who can rely on the same grounds that were rejected by the Commissioner. Clause 25 inserts a new appeal right in section 103B to rectify that situation. The amendment to section 104(20(b)(i) in clause 26(1) is necessary to clarify that the existing right to apply to the Family Court for a departure order is restricted to persons who have applied for a determination. 45 Submission 7 The bill should be amended to provide for the full involvement of the qualifying custodian, and the independent custodian in particular, in the process of writing off penalties. Comment The status of the relevant custodian is not a factor for Inland Revenue in deciding whether to apply resources to the collection of outstanding financial support liabilities. However, under the current law, arrears when collected, are applied to the oldest period of outstanding liability. Those arrears are retained by the Crown if the custodian was in receipt of a sole parent benefit during that oldest period for which the arrears are owed. The effect of the provisions in clauses 33 and 34 will be to change the order in which arrears of liability, when collected, are allocated. Priority will be given to making payments for any periods in which a custodian was not a beneficiary over payments owed to the Crown. Penalties are owed to the Crown. They are not passed on to custodians when collected. In addition, the new provisions in clause 32, particularly new sections 135J and 135K, are intended to encourage non-compliant liable parents to meet their payment obligations. Submission 8 That any payments by the liable parent who is in arrears should be credited first against the current child support instalment due, and secondly to offset instalments in arrears. That could be the oldest arrears or the most recent arrears. Either way the independent custodian should receive all payments made by the liable parent, including penalty payments, until their payments are up to date. Comment As already commented, the effect of the provisions in clauses 33 and 34 will be to give priority to payments owed to custodians over payments owed to the Crown, as recommended in the submission. The feasibility of compensating custodians for late payments of child support has been raised recently. Issues which would require further consideration include the high transaction and administration costs of such a measure; the appropriate targeting of passing on the initial 10% penalty, for example, to all custodians or just non- beneficiary custodians; whether such a proposal might be better met through a use-of- money interest provision; the impact on the child support penalty system; and the impact on the wider social security benefit system. It is also likely that administrative costs would be significant as a result of the systems changes that would be required. The government decided not to pursue the matter. 46 Submission 9 The State should be entitled to seek costs awards from the court for costs that are incurred through the recovery of penalty payments. Comment The Act already provides for the court to make such order as to costs as it thinks fit. The retention of penalty payments by the Crown does go some small way towards meeting the costs of the Crown in its agency role of collecting and passing on financial support. If Inland Revenue were to seek costs for the recovery of penalties, that would impose an additional cost on liable persons without any corresponding benefit to payees or to children. Submission 10 The independent custodian should be entitled to engage a private debt collector should they wish to do so. They should still be permitted to return to Inland Revenue for assistance in collection and enforcement at any time. The costs of such collection should be added to the sums due by the liable parent. Comment The Act already provides for a payee (other than for periods in which the payee was receiving a social security benefit) to be able to uplift the whole or any part of arrears of financial support owed to him or her, and to pursue the collection of such amounts on their own behalf. Such an election is irrevocable in respect of the periods uplifted but the payee may continue to have Inland Revenue pursue collection of any periods not uplifted. Submission 11 Inland Revenue should be required to account to the qualifying custodian for any of the payments made by the liable parent that are kept by the Crown for collection and enforcement costs. Comment Inland Revenue publishes in its Annual Report the costs of administering the child support scheme. However, costs of collection vary from case to case depending on the nature of the enforcement activities undertaken and the ease with which a source for compulsory deductions is found. If Inland Revenue were to be required to apportion total costs to individual cases, this would add further to those costs. 47 Custodians are entitled to receive, on request, information about payments, not including penalties, made by the relevant liable parent. The purpose of providing this information is to provide certainty for non-beneficiary custodians about payments that can be expected, and to assist beneficiary custodians to make decisions about whether to go off a benefit. Information about penalties is not provided because penalties are not passed on to custodians. Submission 12 Section 39(1) of the Act should be amended to: a. remove, from the definition of “child support income amount” the following sentence: “or, if less, an amount equal to 2.5 times the yearly equivalent of the relevant average weekly earnings amount for the most recent tax year”, and b. change the definition of “child support percentage” to include an increase for every further child for whom child support is sought. Comment The maximum income amount was increased from two times the relevant average earnings to 2.5 times the average with effect from 1 April 2002. It was considered that liable parents with incomes above that level should be able to choose how they provide any additional support to their children. The amount is adjusted each year in response to increases in the relevant average weekly earnings amount. For the 2006-07 child support year the maximum income amount is $100,157. Increasing the range of the child support formula to include increased percentages for 5 th and subsequent children would be likely to have a significant impact on low- and middle-income liable parents. Submission 13 Section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended or a new section added that permits the Commissioner to deduct or extract a sum from a liable parent’s account to offset the child support and penalties overdue for payment by that parent. Comment A person who defaults on a payment due under the Act is required to make future payments by automatic deduction in accordance with section 130. That is given effect through section 154, which authorises the Commissioner to require a person to make automatic deductions from monies payable to a liable person, including salary, wages and bank accounts. 48 Submission 14 Liable parents should be required to provide the Commissioner with sufficient information about their account(s) to enable the Commissioner to deduct or extract the overdue funds. Comment A person named as a liable parent on an application for child support is required to complete a registration form (IR103) that includes details of a current bank account. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 49 Submission (10W – Michael Roy Freeman) Submission 1 The maximum income amount should also reflect the cost of bringing up children. Comment The maximum income amount represents a threshold above which liable parents with higher incomes can choose how they provide additional financial support to their children. The amount is adjusted each year in response to increases in the relevant average weekly earnings amount. Basing the formula on taxable income ensures that children can benefit from increases in the income of their parents in the same way that they would if they were in an intact family. The rates of living allowance equal relevant social security benefit rates applicable on 1 January immediately preceding the start of the child support year: for a single liable parent – the gross single rate of an invalid's benefit; for a liable parent with a partner, but no dependent children – the gross married rate of an unemployment benefit; and for a liable parent with dependent children – the gross married rate of an invalid's benefit plus, from 1 April 2005, $2,522 for each child. Those benefit rates have been designed by the government to provide a modest standard of living and are adjusted annually based on movements in the Consumer Price Index. It is generally accepted that expenditure on children rises as household income rises. Submission 2 All calculations should be based on a percentage of disposable income, something everyone has some control and choice over. Comment The introduction to this report summarises the intent of the government of the time in introducing the child support scheme. The formula assessment provides a consistent, easily understood calculation of liability that provides an appropriate level of support and certainty for both liable parents and custodians in the majority of cases. The proposal, if accepted, would require each case to be assessed individually, a process that would involve unacceptably high compliance and administrative costs. 50 Submission 3 The bill needs to review the initial clause 29 formula. A better formula would have: • a maximum amount required to be paid by the liable parent that reflects the cost of bringing up children; • a living allowance as at present; and • be based on a percentage of disposable income. Comment See comments above in relation to the suggested components of a better formula. If the government were to agree to consider the development of a new formula for calculating child support liability, it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals. This would include extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before a decision could be made. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 51 Submission (11 – Birthright New Zealand Incorporated National Executive) The submission supports changes that improve the financial situation for children, and changes that would support the authorisation of Inland Revenue undertaking reviews. Submission 1 Child support should be automatically deducted from salary and wages (at the source) or included in business tax payments. Submission 2 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Comment Involving third parties would be an unnecessary intrusion into the private affairs of liable persons who do choose to voluntarily comply with their obligations to pay financial support. Compliant liable persons should not be penalised for the actions of those who choose not to comply. If a liable parent does not comply, a deduction order is placed on salary or wages as a matter of course. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 Submission (12 – Murray Bacon and Mark Shipman) Submission 1 Family Court should have to evaluate parenting skills and resources and not just decide on the basis of deciding care to maximise child support/benefit recovery payments, to maximise the benefit cost to the government, as at present. Comment This bill does not deal with the role of, and procedures in, the Family Court. Therefore, the submission is not within the scope of the bill. Submission 2 The Domestic Purposes Benefit should be funded by government on the basis of the needs of the parent. In particular, not providing full support when only partial support is warranted – for example, for a single child. Comment This bill does not deal with the basis of funding for social security benefits, including the Domestic Purposes Benefit. Therefore, the submission is not within the scope of the bill. Submission 3 The non-custodial parent should be given all information relating to benefit applications and have the right to be heard. Comment This bill does not deal with the administration of social security benefits. Therefore, the submission is not within the scope of the bill. Submission 4 When children are abducted, then child support should not be collected and forwarded to the abductor. Any assets of the abductor remaining in New Zealand should be made available to the remaining parent to assist in finding the children and returning them to New Zealand. Comment The Act defines a qualifying custodian as one who is the sole or principal provider of ongoing daily care for the child or who shares ongoing daily care substantially equally with another person. The Act does not require Inland Revenue to consider whether children are in the care of a custodian in contravention of a Court Order or parenting order, when determining whether to enforce the obligations of a liable parent under 53 the Act. The relevant offences and consequent penalties for removal of a child from New Zealand are provided for in the Care of Children Act 2004. The obligation to pay child support for such a child would terminate if the child ceased to be a New Zealand citizen or was no longer ordinarily resident in New Zealand. Submission 5 Child support payment should be based on the degree of care in each household and the fixed cost of the essential needs of the children to be shared equally by both parents. The formula should take into account the child-care and household income of both parents, on equal terms. Comment The Act does recognise substantially equal sharing of care through an adjustment to the standard formula. The threshold in the Act of 40% of the nights in a child support year provides a tolerance around equal sharing. When the level of care falls short of 40% of the nights, the Act also provides for other aspects of care arrangements to be taken into account, such as: how the responsibility for decisions about the daily activities of the child is shared; who takes the child to and from school and supervises leisure activities; and how decisions about the education or healthcare of the child are made. The Minister of Revenue has instructed officials to consider whether and to what extent, recognition should be given to lower levels of shared care. That work will take into account the proposed changes in the Australian child support scheme, noting the broader context of change in family law generally in which those changes have been developed. In relation to the issue of New Zealand-based evidence of the real costs of children, both the Families Commission and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) have explored developing a budget standards approach (one of the methodologies that contributed to the estimate of the costs of children in intact Australian families) 7 to estimate the costs of children and have recommended against progressing this approach. Instead, MSD will be using living standards data to estimate equivalence scales. MSD will also be exploring the topic further as part of qualitative research to be carried out in respect of the evaluation of the Working for Families package. When the results of that research become available, the information could contribute to any future consideration of a different basis on which to assess child support liability. 7 ibid 54 Even in two-parent households it cannot be assumed that the parents contribute equal financial resources or provide equal levels of care. The development of an administrative formula that attempts to reflect the relative contributions of the parents to the household would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals. This would include extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before a decision could be made. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. It should be noted that involvement in the child support scheme is voluntary unless the custodian is in receipt of a social security benefit, when an application for child support becomes compulsory. In the absence of benefit receipt by one of the parties the way is open for them to come to a private arrangement that avoids the need for State intervention. Submission 6 Inland Revenue should provide statements, which clearly communicate the spousal support and child support components, the raw data from which the payments have been calculated, and provide confirmation that the monies have been paid to the recipient. Comment The Act provides for the assessment and collection by Inland Revenue of child support, but the collection only of domestic maintenance. 8 The jurisdiction for assessing the quantum of domestic maintenance lies with the Family Court. When a person is liable for both child support and domestic maintenance the amounts are identified separately on notices of assessment and statements, as they are on notices of entitlement. Confirmation to the liable person that monies have been paid to the payee is not possible as to do so would, by implication, reveal whether or not the payee is in receipt of a social security benefit. Recommendation Note that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. 8 The term “spousal maintenance” was replaced with “domestic maintenance” in the Child Support Act 2005 to reflect that under the Family Proceedings Act 1980 or in accordance with a maintenance agreement, maintenance may be payable to a former spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. 55 Submission (13W – Judge P F Boshier) Submission 1 It is unclear why objections can be made to appealable decisions under subpart 2 – section 89I and subpart 3 – section 89Z but not under subparts 4 and 5. My impression is that there should be a uniform procedure for dealing with all objections relating to decisions made by the Commissioner in respect of those matters contained in section 89A to 89ZE. As the Act now operates under section 93(c) where an objection has been disallowed in whole or in part, an objector can appeal to the Family Court against that decision. Comment Objections can be made to appealable decisions under subpart 2 – section 89I (prisoners, hospital patients, persons under 16) and subpart 4 – section 89Z (victims of sex offences). There are no rights of objection to administrative determinations under the Act. An appeal process is provided for the new determinations under section 103A that is consistent for the appeal process against a determination under Part 6A or Part 6B. Because determinations are made by the Commissioner on the recommendation of an independent review officer, it would be inappropriate for the Commissioner to also decide on an objection to that determination. In addition, the particular appeal provisions provided for in relation to subpart 3 are more tailored to the grounds for determining that the exemption does not apply. Subpart 5 provides for the actions that the Commissioner must take in order to give effect to decisions or determinations made under subparts 2, 3 or 4. It does not contain any power for the Commissioner to make decisions that need to give rise to a right of objection or appeal. Submission 2 I am unclear what section 96L(4) means – the extent of the Commissioner's knowledge is not defined. It appears the Commissioner has complete discretion as to what knowledge is imputed. It is unclear how such knowledge is acquired in the first place – there is no obligation on the Commissioner to disclose all matters which could be argued to be within the "knowledge" of the Commissioner. Comment The Commissioner is bound by the secrecy provisions in Part IV of the Tax Administration Act 1994, unless specifically provided otherwise, in relation to information that is held. 56 Submission 3 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 4 Section 103D(3) is vague when it refers to different child support years. Does this mean the court can make retrospective orders which cover a number of years? To avoid uncertainty section 103D(3) should be made more specific. Comment The drafting of section 103D(3) is consistent with that in existing sections 96O (in relation to determinations under Part 6A) and section 118 (in relation to orders that may be made by the court). Inland Revenue acknowledges that on the basis of case law precedents there is uncertainty about the ability for the Commissioner or the Family Court to make administrative determinations or departure orders with retrospective effect. The advice of the Solicitor-General has been sought on the appropriate means of obtaining clarification through the courts. A response has not yet been received. It would create further uncertainty if the new provision were to be drafted differently. Recommendation That submissions 1 to 3 be declined. That submission 4 be noted pending advice from the Solicitor-General. 57 Submission (14W – Stuart Birks) The submission supports the proposed changes for young liable parents, liability by a victim of a sex offence, and in relation to penalties. There should be a comprehensive review of the child support legislation so that assessed child support liabilities can be clearly demonstrated to be fair and equitable and that the objectives of the Act are made consistent with other aspects of family law. Comment Officials do not consider that there is strong evidence that the current scheme, with its simple formula, does not produce an appropriate level of support and certainty for both liable parents and custodians in the majority of cases. As a safeguard for liable parents who consider that the amount they are expected to pay, or for custodians who consider the amount they are entitled to receive, is unfair, either party could seek consideration by the Family Court of the special circumstances of their case. The administrative review process was subsequently introduced as a more informal, low-cost means of obtaining individual consideration. If the government were to agree to consider the proposal it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 Submission (15W – Paul McManaway) Submission 1 Thought should be given to making more basic changes; changes that would support the equal and shared parenting of children and strong parent-child relationships in separated families. Submission 2 This bill should not proceed and a complete public review should be undertaken of the child support law and administration. Comment The Act already makes provision for a variation to the standard formula in cases of substantially equal sharing. However, the proposals go beyond the scope of the Act, involving broader considerations in relation to family law generally. If the government were to agree to consider the proposals it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation Note that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. 59 Submission (16 – Andy Lewis and Shelley Windley-Lewis) Submission 1 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 2 The capped income level should be reduced to bring contributions in line with the realistic costs of raising a child. Submission 3 The living allowance provided in the formula should be altered to reflect the actual cost of raising children. Submission 4 A mechanism for review of the custodial parent’s allocation of contributions should be urgently implemented. Comment It is not clear whether the submissions 2 to 4 are limited to determinations that might be made by the Commissioner under new Part 6B. If they are intended to apply more generally to the Act they would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 60 Submission (17 – Don Rowlands) The bill should include provision for an additional exemption based on day-to-day care responsibilities between 20% and 40%. Comment The Minister of Revenue has instructed officials to consider the issue of whether and to what extent recognition should be given to lower levels of shared care. That work will take into account the proposed changes in the Australian child support scheme, noting the broader context of change in family law generally in which those changes have been developed. An issues paper on the subject is likely to be circulated for consultation later this year. Recommendation Note that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. 61 Submission (18W – Raymond S Newman) Submission 1 Child support payments should be capped for workers remunerated hourly at 50 hours per week. Comment A principle underpinning the Act is that the level of financial support is determined according to the capacity of the parents to provide. For a liable parent the basis of determining that capacity is taxable income. The Act already provides a “cap” through the maximum income amount. It would be inequitable to set different maximum income amounts according to the means by which liable parents receive their remuneration. Submission 2 Costs of travel should be recoverable. Comment The Act already provides a ground for departure from the standard formula when the costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected because of high costs incurred by a liable parent or a custodian in enabling that liable parent access to the child. Costs of access are not considered to be high if they are not more than 5% of the child support income amount for the year. Submission 3 A proportion of the liable parent payment should be accrued to assist in tertiary education. Comment Imposing conditions on the way in which child support is expended for the support of a child goes beyond the scope of the current scheme. It is intended to provide for the current needs of a child. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 62 Submission (19 – Martin Ryman) The submitter proposes a system that starts from a basis of presumptive shared parenting. Comment The proposal goes beyond the scope of the Act. Although the Care of Children Act 2004 includes shared responsibilities for parenting within the principles relevant to a child’s welfare and best interests, it does not go as far as making a presumption of shared parenting. If the government were to agree to consider the proposal as a basis for a change in the child support scheme it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 63 Submission (20W – Solo Women as Parents) The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. 64 Submission (21 –Parents for Children) Submission 1 The only way to remove the root cause of the problems found in the Act is for a complete review of the current child support regime. Such a review should encourage widespread public debate as to what child support model will best provide for New Zealand’s children. Comment Officials do not consider there is strong evidence that the current scheme, with its simple formula, does not produce an appropriate level of support and certainty for both liable parents and custodians in the majority of cases. However, they do acknowledge the need for a means of independent consideration for liable parents or custodians who feel that the amount they are expected to pay, or entitled to receive, is unfair. This is provided for through the administrative review process. Out of approximately 175,000 liable parents in the year ended 30 June 2005, 2,417 took an application for administrative review. Similarly, 1,558 out of approximately 185,000 custodians applied for an administrative review. In 33 cases the further right to have the case considered by the Family Court was exercised, with the decision of the Commissioner being upheld in 75% of cases. If the government were to agree to consider a complete review of the current child support regime, it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Submission 2 The “Donkin Method” for calculating child support provides a real solution for kiwi kids and parents that tinkering, yet again, with the Child Support Act 1991 cannot deliver. Comment The suggested “Donkin Method” assumes that each parent has independent means of support, so it does not address the situation where a family is without independent means of financial support, and the government accepts a shared responsibility for the care of the family by payment of a social security benefit. This was acknowledged by the submitters during their oral submission, and that it is not suitable for low-income families. Since almost three-quarters of custodians are in receipt of a sole parent social security benefit and there are many other low-income families represented in the scheme, it would be necessary to develop two systems. 65 If there is significant disparity between the financial positions of the parents it would not be possible for one to make their 50% contribution without some assistance from the State. Providing a flat rate of child support based on the living allowances for children in the current child support formula would mean that many children would suffer a significant drop in living standards if high-income parents separate because they would no longer benefit from the full capacity to provide support of one of their parents. Submission 3 The bill should not proceed and a public review of the current child support regime should take place. Comment The bill contains several important improvements to the child support scheme. Officials recommend that the bill proceed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 66 Submission (22W – New Zealand Father and Child Society) Submission 1 Waive liability for child support for liable parents under 21 years old if they are studying full time. Comment The exemption for liable parents is being made available not because they are merely participating in full-time education, but because their participation is compulsory until they reach age 16 years. They are unable to earn an income from which to meet their obligations to provide financial support. Once young people reach age 16 years they can choose whether or not to continue in education. Beyond the age at which compulsory attendance at school ceases, it could be considered discriminatory to determine an exemption from liability for child support on the basis of age. Submission 2 DNA paternity testing should be made available for men who are incurring a child support liability. Comment The provisions relating to parentage testing are contained in the Family Proceedings Act 1980 and are not within the scope of this bill. Submission 3 There should be across the board halving in the rate for penalties imposed in cases of unpaid child support. Comment The initial late payment penalty for financial support is significantly higher than that for tax because there is no use-of-money interest charge. Considerations for and against a use-of-money interest charge have been explored previously. Use-of- money interest would be complex and difficult to calculate and explain because of the frequent reassessments in some liable parents’ accounts. For that reason it would also be highly resource-intensive with consequent high administration costs. Officials consider that a penalty for late payment of child support obligations is necessary to provide an incentive for liable persons to pay in full, on time, so that no penalties are incurred. 67 Submission 4 There should be reconsideration of the child support formula to consider circumstances of both the caregiver and the liable parent and to recognise direct costs incurred by both parties in relation to the children. Comment The proposal would, if accepted, involve a major re-structuring of the child support scheme. If the government were to agree to consider the proposal it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 68 Submission (23W – Daryl Strachan) The submission seeks clarification of the situation relating to departures from the formula assessment with retrospective effect. Comment Inland Revenue acknowledges that on the basis of case law precedents there is uncertainty about the ability of the Commissioner or the Family Court to make administrative determinations or departure orders with retrospective effect. The advice of the Solicitor-General has been sought on the appropriate means of obtaining clarification through the Courts. A response has not yet been received. Recommendation That the submission be noted pending advice from the Solicitor-General. 69 Submission (24 – Peter Burns) The submission does not specify in which aspects of the bill change is sought, and the submitter did not appear before the Committee to clarify his position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 Submission (25 – Nik Renwick) Submission 1 The bill should be clear that it is for the financial operation of the Child Support Act and avoid any claim of “support of children”. Comment Despite the submitter’s perception, $136.2 million was paid out to non-beneficiary custodians in the year ended 30 June 2005. Requiring Inland Revenue to monitor the expenditure of those monies would impose high administrative costs on the department and high compliance costs on custodians. Submission 2 Address the financial inequities of shared or split care that arise under the Child Support Act to align with the original CS Act itself: “h) To ensure that equity exists between custodial and non-custodial parents, in respect of the costs of supporting children”. Comment The Minister of Revenue has instructed officials to consider the issue of whether and to what extent recognition should be given to lower levels of shared care than the current 40% of nights threshold. An issues paper on the subject is likely to be circulated for consultation later this year. Submission 3 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 4 Remove the two-month limitation to appeals. Comment The inclusion of a time limit for appeals is consistent with the Legislation Advisory Committee’s Guidelines on Process & Content of Legislation. Time limits provide certainty to persons affected and speed up the process without denying review. It is considered advisable to confer a power to extend the time limit on the appellate body, as has been done in this case. This mitigates the harsh inflexibility a strict time limit can cause, and allows the Court to extend the time limit to one that would be available if the application was for a departure under section 104 of the principal Act, if it considers that to be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 71 Submission 5 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 6 Allow applicants both options to have their case heard as a question on the original case or as a new case. Comment It is the view of the Principal Family Court Judge that the new appeal rights in clause 25 will allow the Family Court on hearing an appeal to make such order correcting the assessment to which the appeal relates as the circumstances require. Submission 7 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 8 Custodial parents who are meeting the primary purpose of providing for their children should not be levied Child Support, let alone penalties. Comment Custodial parents become liable for child support only in situations of split or shared care. Their obligation to contribute is consistent with the principles that underpin the Act. When parents have a liability to each other the amount payable by one is offset against the amount payable by the other so that only the parent with the higher liability has an amount to pay. Submission 9 Recommend the bill be abandoned and a full review of the Child Support Act 1991 carried out. Comment If the government were to agree to a full review of the Act it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation Note in relation to submissions 2 and 8 that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. That submissions 1, 4, 6 and 9 be declined. 72 Submission (26 – Child Advocacy Services) Submission 1 Rewrite section 10 and 11 to reflect that where shared care of children is involved there should be no involvement in Child Support by either parent. Submissions 2 to 6 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Comment The provisions in clauses 10 and 11 amend the existing provisions relating to split and shared care of children. They allow the offsetting of the liability of one parent against the liability of the other parent to continue when one parent goes onto a social security benefit. It is only when a custodian is in receipt of a social security benefit that an application for child support is mandatory. Otherwise, parents do have a choice as to whether they are involved in the child support scheme. The Minister of Revenue has instructed officials to consider the issue of whether and to what extent, recognition should be given to lower levels of shared care. That work will have regard to the proposed changes in the Australian child support scheme, noting the broader context of change in family law generally in which those changes have been developed. An issues paper on the subject is likely to be circulated for consultation later this year. Recommendation Note that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. 73 Submission (27 – Families Apart Require Equality) Submission 1 If the government wished to solve the child support debt problem it would introduce true equality between biological parents, i.e. Equal Shared Parenting providing for preferential equal physical custody. Comment The submission goes beyond the scope of the Child Support Act. Although the Care of Children Act 2004 includes shared responsibilities for parenting within the principles relevant to a child’s welfare and best interests, it does not go as far as making a presumption of shared parenting. If the government were to agree to consider the proposal as a basis for a change in the child support scheme it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Submission 2 The government must introduce free paternity testing immediately for all fathers who have been, or will be, liable to pay Child Support. Comment The provisions relating to parentage testing are contained in the Family Proceedings Act 1980 and are not within the scope of this bill. A person named as the other parent in an application for child support has the right, under the Act, to object to the decision if he disputes that he is the other parent. Recommendation Note that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. 74 Submission (28W – Angela Gail Church) Submission 1 The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. Submission 2 Why is the figure for shared care 40% and not 50%? Comment The submission takes a contrary position in relation to shared care from most other submissions, which advocate a lowered threshold from 40%. The Act requires “substantially equal sharing of care”, but the 40% threshold provides a tolerance of around 50:50 sharing to allow some flexibility for situations where it is not possible for the care arrangements to be made that are absolutely equal. Recommendation Note that work is being undertaken on shared care, however, no changes are recommended in this bill. 75 Submission (29 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submissions relating to clause 32 Submission 1 The rate of initial penalty in section 134(1)(a)(i) of the Child Support Act 1991 should be reduced from 10% to 5%. Comment The initial late payment penalty for financial support is significantly higher than that for tax because there is no use-of-money interest charge. Considerations for and against a use-of-money interest charge have been explored previously. Officials believe that use-of-money interest would be complex and difficult to calculate and explain because of the frequent reassessments in some liable parents’ accounts. For that reason it would also be highly resource-intensive with consequent high administration costs. Submission 2 Section 134(10)(a) of the Child Support Act 1991 should be amended to structure the penalty for late payment of financial support in the same way as for income tax, with the initial penalty applied in two stages: 1% applied immediately once overdue then the balance applied incrementally after the payment is seven days overdue. Comment Partially deferring the imposition of the late payment penalty was one of the policy options considered when officials were considering ways to deal with the growth of penalty debt. It was not possible to obtain accurate data on the number of liable persons who pay late but within seven days of the date on which payment is due. However, the information that was available suggested that the number is very low. A limited survey of liable persons who paid late but by the end of the month, that is, not necessarily within seven days, suggested that less than 0.6% pay late but within seven days. Officials also considered it likely that more liable persons, rather than being deterred by the 1% penalty, would change their payment behaviour to partial compliance by paying on or before the sixth day after the due date. The potential reduction in potential Crown revenue was estimated at that time to be $1 million, while costs of implementing the necessary systems changes were estimated at between $250,000 and $350,000. 76 Submission 3 The rate of incremental penalty in sections 134(1)(b) and (c) of the Child Support Act 1991 should be reduced from 2% to 1%. Comment A reduction in the incremental penalty would reduce the burden on liable persons who are non-compliant in the future but would do nothing to encourage liable persons who have already incurred those penalties to get back into the payment system. The proposed write-off provisions will relieve liable parents who enter and comply with a payment arrangement of some of their existing penalty debt and encourage future compliance, so that no further incremental penalties are incurred. Submission 4 Inland Revenue should issue a standard practice statement with guidelines on the application of the write-off provisions. Comment The proposed write-off of incremental penalty debt will be mandatory for liable persons who meet the requirements. Since Inland Revenue will not be exercising discretion, a standard practice statement would not appear to be necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions relating to clause 24 are dealt with in Part 1 Submissions relating to clause 25 Submission 1 The right of appeal in relation to child support determinations should be to the Taxation Review Authority and not the Family Court. Comment The issue is covered in Part 1 of this report. 77 Submission 2 A child support dispute should be heard in the first instance by the Court (Family Court or Taxation Review Authority). Comment The administrative review process was introduced into the child support scheme in 1994 to address the perceived barriers of access to the Family Court. A significant barrier for both liable parents and custodians was the cost of legal representation. A further inequity arose when one party could afford to be legally represented and the other could not. Among other concerns was the relative formality of the courts – even though the Family Court is less formal than other courts, an appearance can be intimidating for those unused to the court process. The process was also successful in significantly reducing the delays that had been experienced by the parties in having their cases heard. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 78 Submission (30 – Mark Shipman) The Select Committee should recommend that this bill does not proceed and that instead a complete public review be undertaken of the child support law and its administration. Comment Officials do not consider that there is strong evidence that the current scheme, with its simple formula, does not produce an appropriate level of support and certainty for both liable parents and custodians in the majority of cases. However, they do acknowledge the need for a means of independent consideration for liable parents or custodians who feel that the amount they are expected to pay, or entitled to receive, is unfair. This is provided for through the administrative review process. Out of approximately 175,000 liable parents in the year ended 30 June 2005, 2,417 (1.4%) took an application for administrative review. Similarly, 1,558 (0.84%) out of approximately 185,000 custodians applied for an administrative review. In 33 cases the further right to have the case considered by the Family Court was exercised, with the decision of the Commissioner being upheld in 25 cases. If the government were to agree to consider a complete review of the child support law and its administration, it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 79 Submission (31 – Paul Rodney Sapsford) The entire child support scheme should be overhauled in the interests of the child with both parents being recognised for their input into that child’s development. Comment It is not clear from the submission which specific amendment in the bill is opposed. If the government were to agree to the submission, it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 Submission (32W – Jim Bailey) The committee should return the bill to Parliament with the recommendation that it does not proceed and a complete public review be undertaken of the current child support regime and its administration. Comment If the government were to agree to the recommendation, it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 81 Submission (33W – John Potter) The committee should recommend that this bill does not proceed and that a complete public review be undertaken of the child support law and administration. Comment If the government were to agree to the recommendation, it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 Submission (34W – Jan Thomas) The committee should recommend that this bill does not proceed and that instead a complete public review be undertaken of the child support law an administration. Comment If the government were to agree to the recommendation, it would need to follow the Generic Tax Policy Process for considering major policy proposals, including extensive research, analysis and formal consultation before it would be in a position to make a decision. Such a review would have a significant impact on the government’s tax policy work programme, which is already substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 Part 3: Issues raised by officials 84 85 ISSUES RAISED BY INLAND REVENUE Clauses 33 and 34 Issue: Changed implementation dates for some of the provisions that have become necessary as a result of the delays in the introduction and first reading of the bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) Comment The majority of the provisions in the bill, as introduced, are to come into force on the day after the date on which it receives Royal assent and this application date remains appropriate. However, two provisions cannot be implemented concurrently with other provisions in the bill due to the complexity of developing the IT system that supports child support delivery. The bill provides that these two provisions (relating to allocation of payments to custodians as a priority over payments due to the Crown), were to come into effect on 1 April 2006, but that application date is no longer possible. Officials recommend that these provisions be implemented two months from the first of the month following the date of assent. Recommendation That the provisions for allocation of payments to custodians as a priority over payments due to the Crown in clauses 33 and 34, commence from the date that is two months from the first of the month following the date of assent. Clause 32 Issue: Formula for calculating mandatory write-off of incremental penalties Submission (Matter raised by officials) Comment The detailed design of the implementation of the provisions in the bill has revealed that the formula for the mandatory write-off of incremental penalties contained in the bill will, in some cases, produce a small credit balance at the end of the repayment arrangement that will have to be allocated to another period in a liable person’s account. These transfers will cause confusion when they appear on statements and will increase system transaction costs. 86 A revised formula has been designed that will ensure there are no residual credits at the end of repayment arrangements. The revised formula is: r = (a x c) - d b r is the amount of incremental penalty that is to be written off a is the amount of the initial debt that has been paid since the payment agreement was entered into b is the initial debt c is the total amount of incremental penalties related to the initial debt of the liable person that were unpaid at the time that the payment agreement was entered into; or the total amount of incremental penalties related to the initial debt of the liable person that were unpaid at the commencement of the section d is the total amount of incremental penalties related to the initial debt of the liable person that has already been written off under the arrangement. Recommendation That the formula in proposed subsections 135J(4) and 135K(6) for calculating the write-off of incremental penalties be replaced with the above formula as appropriate to avoid a residual credit at the end of some repayment arrangements that would have to be transferred to another period in the liable person’s account. Clauses 10 and 11 Issue: Enhancement to offsetting provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Comment The detailed design of the implementation of the provisions in the bill has revealed an opportunity for an enhancement to the offsetting provisions in clauses 10 and 11. It was intended that the new offsetting arrangements would be implemented manually as it was still not possible to automate the process. However, in the course of the analysis and design work necessary for implementation of the proposal, an automated system solution has been identified that will allow offsetting to occur without any manual intervention. 87 There are currently approximately 3,900 cases where parents are liable to pay child support to each other and one is a beneficiary, but there has been no application for offsetting. It is proposed to convert all these cases so that the non-beneficiary parent can gain the advantage of offsetting rather than pay the full amount and receive a small payment from the beneficiary parent. The conversions would have to be effective from the beginning of a calendar month. Recommendation That clauses 10 and 11 be amended to allow full automation of offsetting when both parents are liable for child support and one parent is in receipt of a social security benefit, with existing cases to be converted from the beginning of the month following Royal assent. Clause 9 Issue: Meaning of term “living allowance” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Comment The changes in clause 9 to the living allowance provisions in the principal Act were introduced to correct amendments to the living allowance provisions in the principal Act made by the Taxation (Working for Families) Act 2004. Those changes were included in the Statutes Amendment Bill (No 5) and enacted as the Child Support Amendment Act (No 2) 2005, as they were necessary to validate child support assessments for the current child support year and assessments soon to be issued for the 2006-07 child support year. However, the amendments in the Child Support Amendment Act (No 2) 2005 fall short of achieving the full intent of ensuring that the living allowances are correctly inflation-adjusted in future child support years, as provided for in clause 9 of the bill. A further amendment to the living allowance provisions in the principal Act is necessary to ensure that living allowances will be correctly inflation-adjusted in the 2007-08 child support year and subsequent child support years. Recommendation That the bill be amended by substituting clause 9 with a new provision, which will build on amendments in the Child Support Amendment Act (No 2) 2005 to ensure that the living allowances are correctly inflation-adjusted in future child support years.

2 3 OVERVIEW Clauses 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 80, 151, 168, 169 and 194 The bill and Supplementary Order Paper No. 382 introduce a number of changes to the tax depreciation rules. The key changes have been the subject of earlier public consultation, in an officials’ issues paper released in July 2004. The purpose of the changes is to: • reduce the impact that tax depreciation rates may have on investment decisions, by changing the methods of calculating tax depreciation rates so they more closely match estimates of economic depreciation; and • reduce compliance costs associated with the current tax depreciation rules. Economic theory suggests that tax depreciation rates should mirror how an asset actually declines in value. Having tax depreciation rates that mirror economic depreciation avoids the situation whereby tax depreciation rates artificially encourage or discourage investment in particular types of assets. Below is a summary of the key changes in the bill as introduced: Clause 53 maintains the old depreciation rates for plant and equipment acquired before 1 April 2005 and for buildings acquired before 19 May 2005. Clause 54 sets out the proposed amendment for how the tax depreciation rate for an item of plant and equipment is calculated. The amendment introduces the formula for double declining balance (2 / estimated useful life of an asset). This formula creates a tax depreciation rate that is generally likely to provide better estimates of how plant and equipment decline in value. Applying the new formula will increase depreciation rates for shorter-life plant and equipment and will not change depreciation rates for longer-life plant and equipment. The Supplementary Order Paper sets depreciation rates for certain motor vehicles and aircraft. These changes affect assets acquired from 1 April 2005 and the new rates will apply from the 2005–06 and subsequent income years. Clause 54 also sets out the proposed amendment for how tax depreciation rates for buildings are calculated. The amendment introduces the straight-line depreciation formula. This formula and its diminishing value equivalent are likely to produce a present value of depreciation deductions that more closely mirror how buildings decline in value over their useful life. Applying the new formula decreases depreciation rates for buildings. These changes will affect buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, and will apply from the 2005–06 and subsequent income years. Clause 55 is a compliance cost-saving measure. It is aimed at allowing taxpayers the option of continuing to depreciate plant and equipment acquired after 1 April 2005 at the current depreciation rates for the 2005–06 income year and beyond. Without this clause, taxpayers would be required to depreciate these assets at the proposed new rates from the beginning of their 2005–06 income year. 4 Clause 56 proposes changes to the low-value asset thresholds. The first threshold allows an immediate deduction for capital expenditure that is less than $500. The second threshold, known as the single supplier rule, allows an immediate deduction for capital expenditure of up to $500 on items that have the same depreciation rates and that are purchased at the same time from a single supplier. Clause 57 proposes that the cost of selling or disposing of an asset is fully deductible. This change ensures that when the cost of selling an asset exceeds the amount received, any resulting loss is fully deductible. This change applies to asset disposals from the 2005–06 income year. There are some consequential proposed changes because of the new methods for calculating tax depreciation rates. Together the bill and Supplementary Order Paper No. 382 provide the following amendments to definitions: • Clause 58, as amended, includes references to the new sections EE 25 to EE 25D in the definition of economic rate. • Clause 143 amends the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 to also include reference to the new sections EE 25B, to EE 25D. Clause 80 extends section GC 6 to allow a deduction to be denied when the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is of the opinion that certain arrangements are intended to allow the taxpayer to apply the new higher depreciation rates to existing assets. The concern is that the introduction of the new higher depreciation rates will provide taxpayers with an incentive to sell and re-acquire assets for the benefit of the higher depreciation rates. Clause 151 inserts new Schedule 11B. The Schedule specifies the new depreciation rate bands (both straight line and diminishing value) for plant and equipment, and buildings. For administrative reasons, the legislation groups a band of depreciation rates into a single depreciation rate. Having depreciation bands reduces the number of depreciation rates that taxpayers and the department have to consider. Clauses 168 and 169 propose amendments to sections 91AAF and 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These amendments result from the new methods for calculating the tax depreciation rates. The proposed amendments require the Commissioner to have regard to the proposed new methods when determining an asset’s depreciation rate. These changes apply to plant and equipment acquired after 1 April 2005 and for buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. Eight submissions have been received on the changes to the tax depreciation rules introduced in the bill. The overall tenor of submissions is: • general support for changes that increase tax depreciation rates; • general criticism of the changes that seek to reduce building depreciation rates; and • that the changes to the low-value asset thresholds do not go far enough. 5 CHANGE TO THE METHOD OF CALCULATING DEPRECIATION RATES FOR PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Issue: Scope of change Clause 54 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Taxpayers should have the option to apply the new depreciation rates to all plant and equipment, without reference to the date that the asset was purchased. Comment Allowing taxpayers to apply the proposed depreciation rates for all existing plant and equipment will add significant cost to the proposal. The revenue cost over the next five years of the gradual introduction of double declining balance depreciation rates for plant and equipment is approximately $720 million. The revenue cost of allowing the total stock of plant and equipment (between $130 and $150 billion) to apply double declining balance depreciation rates from 1 April 2005 is estimated to be $1,200 million for the next five years. Allowing higher depreciation rates would arguably provide existing owners of plant and equipment with a windfall gain. Not extending faster depreciation rates to plant and equipment is the mirror image of not providing slower depreciation rates to existing buildings. The general approach is aimed at ensuring that taxpayers acquiring assets are as informed as possible about future depreciation on these assets. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application dates Clause 54 Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Taxpayers should be able to apply the new depreciation rates for short-lived assets from 1 April 2005, regardless of the taxpayer’s balance date. The submitter also suggests that the new depreciation rates should be mandatory only from the 2006–07 income year. The submission believes these suggestions would make the rules less complex and reduce compliance risks with the transition from the old to the new depreciation rates for plant and equipment. 6 Comment The proposed application date rules for plant and equipment are somewhat complex. The complexity is increased by the requirements that the new provisions apply to assets acquired from 1 April 2005, but from the start of the 2005–06 income year. This complexity is the result of managing competing objectives. The first objective is to ensure that the new rules do not create tax incentives to delay investment decisions. This is a reason for not making the higher depreciation rates apply only to assets acquired after the start of the 2005–06 income year. The proposal to introduce double declining balance depreciation was announced by the government in the 2005 Budget. Making the proposed change apply to assets purchased after 1 April 2005 reduced a concern that most late balance date taxpayers (those whose 2004–05 tax year ends between 31 May and 30 September 2005) would have incentives to delay capital expenditure if the change was to apply to assets acquired at the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. As suggested by the Corporate Taxpayers Group an alternative would have been to apply the new higher rates to all assets from 1 April 2005 and to allow late balance date taxpayers higher depreciation rates in their 2004–05 income tax years. However, this proposal is not without problems. By the time this bill is enacted almost all late balance date filers will have already filed their 2004–05 income tax returns based upon the current law. They would need to apply to the Commissioner to have their assessments amended in order to apply any new depreciation rates. This imposes its own compliance issues and costs. In addition, the Corporate Taxpayers Group submission points out that there are difficulties changing depreciation rates mid-way through an income year. The problems with mid-year changes are increased risk of errors and the additional compliance costs of monitoring fixed asset registers. Officials believe that the proposed application date is the one that best manages these concerns and that changing the application date at this stage is likely to lead to additional compliance costs. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants in their oral submission to the Committee asked that the application dates not be changed, as taxpayers understand the current proposed application dates. The proposal that the new depreciation method apply to plant and equipment acquired from the beginning of the 2006–07 income should be accepted. This measure would reduce the compliance cost of having to re-enter the new higher depreciation rates for assets already in the books for the 2005–06 income year. Such a rule would reduce the transition costs from the old rules to the new rules for some taxpayers. This option is revenue positive for the government and is optional, as taxpayers would elect in their 2005–06 tax return to apply the old depreciation rates to plant and equipment acquired in the 2005–06 income year. Recommendation That the submission be partly accepted, as detailed above. 7 Issue: Catch-up for partial deductions Clause 54 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules ought to provide taxpayers with the ability to catch up for any deductions that they were not in a position to apply at the time of preparing their 2006 income tax return. Comment The submitter’s concern is that taxpayers with early or standard balance dates may not be in a position to claim depreciation deductions in accordance with the new depreciation rates that Parliament enacts. This issue applies equally to increases or decreases in asset depreciation rates. The Commissioner has the discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend an assessment to ensure its correctness. The Commissioner has agreed to amend 2006 income tax assessments for taxpayers who have not been able to apply changes to the tax depreciation law as a result of the taxpayer’s return filing date being too close to, or prior to, the date that the bill is enacted. However, we note that it will be very unlikely that any 2006 income year tax returns will be filed before this tax bill is enacted. In part, this is because Inland Revenue will only provide 2006 tax returns to taxpayers in March 2006. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 8 LOWER DEPRECIATION RATES FOR BUILDINGS Issue: Depreciation rates for buildings Clause 54 Submission (11W – Business New Zealand, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The pace of change (including technological and consumer preferences) means that the estimated useful life of some buildings is shorter than the 50 years currently used. This supports the view that building depreciation rates ought to be higher than what is provided for in current legislation rather than lower. Comment Most submissions do not support a reduction in depreciation rates for buildings. How best to allow for depreciation on structures is a more complex problem and involves balancing conflicting considerations. An important class of structure is residential rental housing. It might seem that the most direct way of checking whether current depreciation rates are reasonable would be to use data on government valuations. Officials have examined government valuations for houses, as published between 1995 through to 2002. 1 The data reflect unweighted average valuations across the different local authorities and are presented in the table below. Between 1995 and 2002 the average capital value of a house rose from $105,594 to $142,791, a 35.2 percent increase. It is possible that capital values might rise, even if buildings fall in value, if land is appreciating sufficiently quickly. Between 1995 and 2002 land rose from $32,548 to $51,021 (a 56.8 percent increase) and improvements rose from $73,046 to $91,770 (a 25.6 percent increase). Thus, even if one focuses solely on the value of improvements, government valuation data would seem to suggest that housing is appreciating, not depreciating. Moreover, the appreciation in the value of improvements appears higher than inflation. For example, the CPI rose by only 12.2 percent between December 1995 and June 2002. 1 Note that publication dates include a three-year spread of valuations. For example, the 1995 publication has valuation dates from 1993 to 1995. The valuation dates differ between local authorities, but are always within a three-year band. The publication dates selected reflect the three-year valuation cycle and are based on July end, with the exception of 1995, which is December year-end. 9 Table 1: Data from Valuation New Zealand and Quotable Value 1995 1998 2000 2002 Average capital value $105,594 $121,994 $130,480 $142,791 Average value of improvements $73,046 $82,166 $86,027 $91,770 Average land value $32,548 $39,829 $44,453 $51,021 At first sight, this data would appear to provide a case against allowing any depreciation deductions for residential rental accommodation. However, there are at least two qualifications. First, there may be important cyclical elements in building prices. For example, variations in supply and demand for construction could affect construction prices and the value of improvements, and this may be a partial explanation for the increased value of improvements in table 1. Second, and more fundamentally, there is an obvious problem arising because the government valuation data reflects average values of buildings. Even if buildings depreciate, the data may increase through time because of higher value new homes or because of extensions and capital improvements to existing homes. Nonetheless, the data provide us with concerns that current depreciation rates for housing may be set too high. Another approach is to look at research on building depreciation. Perhaps the most well-known studies of economic depreciation are by Hulten and Wykoff, 2 who estimated declining balance (a diminishing value equivalent) rates of depreciation for various building types, but excluding rental housing. Their best geometric approximations to economic depreciation were 2.02 percent for retail stores, 2.47 percent for offices, 2.73 percent for warehouses and 3.61 percent for factories. A study by Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) extended the analysis to owner-occupied housing, finding a rate of economic depreciation of 1.3 percent. 3 Based on the results of empirical studies on the prices of used structures in the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis has estimated economic depreciation rates which include 1.14 percent for new residential buildings with one to four-unit structures (with an 80- year economic life), 1.40 percent for new residential structures with more units (with a 65-year economic life), 4 3.14 percent (31-year economic life) for industrial buildings and 2.47 percent (36-year economic life) for office buildings. In our view, the Hulten and Wykoff studies do not provide strong enough grounds for providing taxpayers with a less favourable treatment than straight-line depreciation for structures. Nor, however, do they support the status quo. 2 The measurement of economic depreciation using vintage asset prices: An application of the Box-Cox power transformation, Hulten, Charles R. and Wykoff, Frank C. Journal of Econometrics 15 No. 8 (April 1981). 3 Inflation and corporate capital recovery, Jorgenson, Dale W. and Sullivan, Martin A in Depreciation, Inflation and the Taxation of Income from Capital, edited by Hulten, Charles R. 1981. 4 The measure of depreciation in the US national income and production accounts, Fraumeni, Barbara M. Survey of Current Business, July 1997. 10 Currently, the 13.5 percent assumed residual value formulation comes close to allowing double declining balance depreciation for long-lived assets such as most structures. To our knowledge, unlike the case of plant and equipment, the empirical evidence does not suggest that allowing straight-line depreciation over an asset’s life would lead to an inappropriately low present value of depreciation deductions for buildings and other structures. Thus for buildings and other structures, we suggest there is a prima facie case for allowing straight-line deductions over their economic life. This would be consistent with the current tax treatment of intangible property. At present, taxpayers investing in structures could be given the choice of a diminishing value alternative where the diminishing value rate was chosen to lead to a present value of deductions similar to that which straight-line depreciation would provide. Most buildings currently have an estimated economic life of 50 years. This is consistent with the requirement for the structure of a building to last no less than 50 years or the specified intended life (section B2.3 of the Building Code 1992). The Building Act 2004 (section 113) also requires that when it is the intention that the building will last for less than 50 years, a building consent must say how the building must be altered, removed, or demolished on or before the end of the specified intended life. Without these conditions the consent cannot be issued. This has been a requirement since 1991. Anecdotal evidence from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch City Councils suggests that very few building consent applications specify an intended life of less than 50 years. Using a 50-year estimated useful life would convert to a straight-line depreciation rate of 2 percent per annum. The diminishing value equivalent rate would be approximately 3 percent. Although economic depreciation rates will never be measured with precision, these rates do not appear to us to be out of line with international studies of economic depreciation for buildings. In cases when the Commissioner is satisfied that a building does have an intended useful life of less than 50 years the Commissioner may issue a special depreciation rate. If the estimated useful life is clearly incorrect on average, or is clearly incorrect for a particular building, the Commissioner can consider the issue. When a taxpayer is able to justify to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that a different estimated useful life ought to apply to a building, the Commissioner may issue a special rate for this building or revise the general rate. This flexibility deals with the concern being raised. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 Issue: No change to building depreciation rates Clause 54 Submissions (11W – Business New Zealand, 18W – Metro Law, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Building depreciation rates should not be reduced for the following reasons: • changing the rates will result in two classes of building owner, one getting a higher depreciation rate than the other; • changes to building depreciation rates are designed to encourage taxpayers to invest in other assets rather than buildings and residential investment properties; • newer buildings tend to be less durable than older buildings; and • that this is being done to offset the fiscal costs of introducing the double declining balance depreciation method to setting the depreciation rates for plant and equipment. Comment The government does not want to affect past investments. This is why there is no proposed change to the tax treatment of buildings acquired before 19 May 2005. To change the tax treatment of these buildings could undermine investor confidence. Consequently, there will be for the foreseeable future, building depreciation rates that differ for identical buildings because of the building purchase date. Officials do not see this as being particularly problematic. There will also be different depreciation rates for otherwise identical items of plant and equipment depending on the date of purchase, yet no one has raised this as a concern. The proposed change to building tax-depreciation rates is to reduce an investment distortion by providing rates of depreciation that are thought to better reflect how buildings depreciate. It is very difficult to determine how long a building will be useful. However, for the purposes of the Building Act 2004 and the Building Regulations 1992, the presumption is that buildings will typically last more than 50 years. Anecdotal evidence from Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch City Councils suggests that very few building consent applications specify an intended life of less than 50 years. The government always considers fiscal matters. However, this was not the reason for reducing building depreciation rates. The purpose of this proposal is to better reflect how buildings are likely to depreciate. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 12 Issue: Definition of a building Clause 54 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The term “building” should be defined for income tax purposes. Comment Officials want to ensure that New Zealand’s tax rules are clear and create certainty. In cases when there is a general sense of ambiguity or uncertainty with a term or phrase, it is often helpful for Parliament to define what is meant. However, it is extremely difficult to provide a definition of many assets and doing so may create scope for litigation. We are not aware of any general uncertainty around what is a “building”. This suggests that the law as to what is a building is reasonably settled. For these reasons, we do not consider that the term “building” needs defining in the Income Tax Act 2004. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Delay application date Clause 54 Submission (18W – Metro Law) If the changes to building depreciation rates are enacted, they should apply only to buildings acquired after the date the new legislation receives Royal assent. Comment The submission suggests that some taxpayers who acquire a building after 19 May 2005 and before the date that the bill is enacted may be disadvantaged because they will be oblivious to any proposed changes to building depreciation rates. The changes announced by the government as part of Budget 2005 were consulted on as part of the generic tax policy process. Officials considered and analysed over 2,000 submissions during the policy development process. The proposed changes were also widely reported, together with other announcements in Budget 2005. 13 Officials would have concerns with the proposed changes applying from the date of enactment. The concern is that this timing would provide scope for taxpayers to bring forward the date of building investments to benefit from the higher depreciation rate. This is likely to distort investment decisions and artificially encourage building investment up to the date of Royal assent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transfers of buildings between associated parties Clause 54 Submission (18W – Metro Law) A concession should be provided for transfers of buildings between associated persons, which occur after 19 May 2005, to preserve the current building depreciation rates for buildings transferred to associated persons. Comment As the bill is drafted, the transfer of a building to another person means that the new owner uses the proposed lower building depreciation rate. However, the current law prevents an increase in depreciation rates when assets, other than buildings, are transferred between associated persons. Thus, there appears to be a lack of even- handedness with this proposal. The proposed legislation may lead to economic inefficiencies. The change to the building depreciation rates triggered by the transfer of an asset from one taxpayer to another may affect the reorganisation of assets within a group of companies. Some companies may not reorganise or only partly reorganise. On the other hand, it is our view that it would not be appropriate, for example, to allow a daughter who buys a rental property that was previously owned by her parents to continue to depreciate the building at the current depreciation rates. To do so would provide an artificial bias towards property being traded within a family. Officials therefore recommend that the submission only be accepted in part, with relief allowed only in limited circumstances. We suggest that relief be allowed in the case of transfers between companies where there is 100 percent common ownership. For individuals we suggest that relief only be allowed for transfers of relationship property between wives and husbands, de facto couples or same-sex partners. The transfer of property from a mother to a daughter (as noted above) would not be eligible for relief. 14 The fiscal cost of allowing rollover relief is difficult to determine. Officials have no data on transfers of buildings between associated persons. However, we do not think that the costs will be material. It is likely, as is generally the case with this type of relief, that there will be some added complexity to the tax depreciation rules. Recommendation That the submission be partially accepted, as detailed above. Issue: Scope of savings provision Clause 54 Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 47 – New Zealand Law Society) The bill should be clarified to more clearly identify those contracts for buildings that are covered by the savings provision in section EE 25C(6). Comment The intention of all of the proposed changes is, as far as possible, not to interfere with earlier investment decisions. For example, when a taxpayer has legally committed to purchase a building, whether the building is built or is to be constructed, and the commitment was made before 19 May 2005, the policy intention is that the building depreciation rate at that time ought to apply. Any sale, after 19 May 2005, of the building or the right to own a building yet to be built should be subject to the building depreciation rates proposed in the bill. Further clarification of the policy intent will be published in the Tax Information Bulletin article on the proposed new rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 CHANGES TO THE LOW-VALUE ASSET THRESHOLDS Issue: Further increases to low-value asset thresholds Clause 56 Submission (11W – Business New Zealand, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submitters support the increase in the low-value asset thresholds from $200 to $500. However, they consider that the proposed thresholds of $500 do not go far enough. The suggestions for the low-value threshold range from $1,000 to $5,000 and for the single supplier threshold from $5,000 to $10,000. Comment As discussed earlier, the proposed tax rules will be neutral for investment when deductions for capital expenditure are based on the fall in an asset’s market value (economic depreciation). In the case of low-value assets, the proposed tax rules depart from this important principle because of the compliance costs of requiring taxpayers to capitalise and depreciate all capital expenditure. The proposal to increase the low-value assets threshold arose because the $200 threshold was not achieving the same compliance cost savings as it did in 1993. The proposed $500 threshold more than doubles the present level and is also more than an inflation adjustment. 5 It also makes sense for the low-value asset threshold and the single supplier-rule threshold to remain aligned. This is because it would be difficult to manage the risks of a single asset being purchased from a single supplier at the higher threshold. The proposed threshold of $500 compares well with Australia’s immediate deduction thresholds. The Australian threshold for immediate deduction for assets used to produce non-business income is $300 and for business income it is $100. However, Australia uses a low value asset pool for equipment. The low value pool allows a 37.5 percent diminishing value deduction for equipment that has a book value of less than $1,000. New Zealand also allows for pool depreciation but the rate is based on the rate of the slowest depreciating asset in the pool. The single supplier threshold requires the costs over a certain total value, for purchases of assets with the same depreciation rate, from a single supplier at the same time to be capitalised. This threshold is designed to counter a tax avoidance opportunity that arises because of the low-value asset threshold. The concern is that taxpayers may be able to structure capital expenditure into $200 units, when they are in fact purchasing a single, more expensive asset. 5 Indexing the low-value asset thresholds, based on the average inflation rate of 2.1 percent for the period 1993 to 2005, suggests thresholds of approximately $260. 16 Officials suggest that further raising the thresholds would lead to the following concerns: • Significantly higher thresholds create a greater risk of taxpayers breaking assets down into sub-components. For example, with a $1,000 threshold, a $3,000 computer could be broken down into a $950 LCD monitor, a $1,000 CPU, and the balance in sundries, such as keyboard and mouse. While the present legislation is designed to guard against this, it is difficult to ensure its effective application. • Higher thresholds may also increase incentives for taxpayers to make inefficient purchases of single assets when, in the absence of tax, it would make more sense to bulk purchase. • The fiscal costs of the suggested thresholds are likely to be large. The cost of increasing the thresholds from $200 to $500 was estimated to be $350 million over the next five years. We estimate that increasing the threshold from $500 to $1,000 would add a further $450 million over the next five years to the cost of the current proposal. • A significant increase in the low-value asset thresholds may encourage inefficient investment. At the margin this may bias investment away from more costly to less costly capital goods. A significant increase in the thresholds may also favour industries that tend to employ lower cost capital goods. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Assets with tax book values below the thresholds Clause 56 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The rules should allow an immediate deduction when the tax value of an asset falls below the low-value asset threshold. Comment The submitter’s argument is that if such a rule were introduced it would reduce the compliance costs of having to track large numbers of low-value assets. 17 Officials understand that most compliance costs are incurred at the time a business acquires the asset. Once an asset has been acquired, the business must record the asset and set up the asset register to ensure the correct amount of depreciation is deducted. From this point on the process is largely automated. Periodic checks of assets may occur from time to time, but over time assets become less important and less valuable to the business and checks are less frequent. The result is that some assets remain in asset registers and are a source of annoyance, rather than a compliance cost, for most businesses. However, there is a cost for firms that periodically clean out their asset register. Officials do not have sufficient information to provide a reasonable estimate of the cost of this proposal. However, we believe that allowing an immediate deduction when the tax value of an asset falls below the low-value asset threshold policy would have a fiscal cost greater than the cost of the proposed increase to the low value asset thresholds. In the first year, the existing stock of assets with book values below the low value asset threshold would be immediately deductible. Officials consider that the cost of this proposal outweighs any benefits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Regular reviews of the thresholds Clause 56 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The level of the low-value asset thresholds should be regularly reviewed. Comment Officials agree that the low-value asset thresholds should be regularly reviewed. The process for changing the level of the low-value asset thresholds is relatively simple. The government changes the thresholds by Order in Council. Determining the timing of any review is more difficult. One option is to review the thresholds say, every 10 years. Alternatively, the timing of a review could be based on taxpayers’ concerns that the low-value asset thresholds are no longer providing compliance-cost savings. The threshold has been reviewed periodically based on taxpayers’ concerns. For example, the issue of raising the “low-value” asset thresholds was considered by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in 1998. The committee concluded that although the benefit of raising the threshold for immediately expensing “low-value” assets would be a reduction in compliance costs, it considered that the revenue costs 18 of such a measure, although transitional, would be significant. Further, an increase in the “low-value” asset threshold could increase the possibility that the rules could be abused. Finally, the committee considered that the pool method of depreciation could be used for assets valued between $200 and $2,000, thereby resulting in simpler depreciation rules. The current process appears to work. The current change to the threshold was prompted by taxpayer concerns that the current thresholds were too low. Recommendation That this submission be noted. Issue: Allow catch-up adjustments Clause 56 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) That taxpayers should be able to have a catch-up adjustment in their 2006 income tax return when, in their 2005 income tax return, they did not apply any increases in the low-value asset thresholds. Comment The concern raised is that taxpayers with 31 May to 30 September balance dates (taxpayers with late balance dates) will not be able to apply the new low-value asset thresholds for assets acquired between 19 May 2005 and their 2005 balance date because their 2005 tax return is due by 31 March 2006 at the latest. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend an assessment to ensure its correctness. The Commissioner has agreed to amend 2005 assessments for taxpayers who have not been able to apply any changes to the tax depreciation rules due to the taxpayer’s return filing date being too close to, or after the date that the bill receives assent. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 19 OTHER CONCERNS Issue: Use of the term “negative consideration” Clause 57 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EE 38(1) should be amended to remove the nexus to negative consideration. Comment While the submitter agrees with the intention of the change, they suggest it would be easier to allow a deduction for costs incurred in the disposal of an asset. Section EE 38(1) defines consideration for the purposes of working out whether the disposal of an asset generates a depreciation recovery or a depreciation loss. The submission suggests a different way of reaching the same goal. The purpose of this amendment is to allow nil or negative consideration for the purpose of sections EE 41 to EE 44. Officials believe that the suggestion relates to the style of the change and can see no advantage. The wording in the amendment is consistent with this part of the Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Retrospective application date Clause 57 Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed rule that clarifies that disposal costs are fully deductible should apply retrospectively rather than from the 2005–06 income tax year. Since the proposal is a clarification, it should be allowed for earlier income years. 20 Comment This amendment changes the current law so that a deduction for the cost of demolition or disposal of an asset can be claimed. The law has been clarified to allow the economically correct outcome. Changing the law so that it is clear that this can now happen may remove an artificial impediment to more environmentally friendly asset- disposal practices. This proposal was designed to be prospective and is consistent with other changes to income tax legislation. Retrospective law changes occur infrequently as they can raise equity issues by creating new tax liabilities or windfalls. Identical concerns are what cause us to not want to change past investments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Changing depreciation methods in mid-useful life Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The straight-line depreciation rate should be higher when a taxpayer changes from the diminishing value to the straight-line depreciation method. This is because the asset is depreciated for a period longer than its estimated useful life. Comment The submission notes that when a taxpayer changes from the diminishing value to the straight-line depreciation method the result is that the asset is depreciated for a period that is longer than its remaining estimated useful life. The current rules for switching between depreciation methods (and the calculation of straight-line equivalents) reflect the necessity to prevent taxpayers gaming the diminishing value/straight-line choice of depreciation rates and taking advantage of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 DRAFTING ISSUES Clause 54 Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The opening words of section EE 25C(3) should read, “To set the straight line rate for a kind of item of depreciable property”. Comment This submission corrects a drafting mistake. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 55 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to “sections EE 25B” in section EE 26B should refer to “section EE 25”. Comment The current wording requires the taxpayer to elect to apply the proposed law. The correct approach is for taxpayers to elect out of the proposed rule because of the compliance cost of having to recalculate asset depreciation rates. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 22 Clause 80 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section GC 6 should be redrafted to restrict its scope to the depreciation rules only. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 151 and Schedule 1 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The wording in Schedule 11B, “Other assets (excluding intangible depreciable property and buildings)” should be amended to read: “Other assets (excluding depreciable intangible property and buildings)”. Comment The submission suggests wording that is consistent with terms already in use. Officials suggest for completeness that “excluded depreciable property” ought to be added to the list. We recommend that the wording change to: “Other assets (excluding depreciable intangible property, excluded depreciable property and buildings)”. Recommendation That the submission, as amended by officials, be accepted. 23 ISSUES RAISED BY OFFICIALS Issue: High residual value assets Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be allowed to set a depreciation rate using the depreciation formula in section EE 25(4) for assets with an estimated residual or scrap value greater than 13.5 percent that are acquired on or after the application date of the proposed changes. This proposal would apply in certain limited circumstances and ensures that such assets are afforded a more economically correct depreciation rate, than would apply under the proposed changes. Comment Using double declining balance depreciation for equipment may provide better measures of economic depreciation for assets with negligible residual value at the end of their economic lives. However, this approach is likely to overstate economic depreciation for assets with substantial residual values. Currently, equipment with an estimated residual value of more than 13.5 percent can be depreciated at a diminishing value rate, which leads to book value being equal to the estimated residual value at the end of the economic life. The current method of calculating depreciation for such assets seems to be most appropriate in these cases. Under normal circumstances this issue does not affect assets currently in Depreciation Determination 1. However, under certain conditions, an asset may have a higher residual value at the end of its useful life than the average asset. A case in point is when an asset is purchased and the vendor guarantees to buy the asset back at a set price. The buy-back price can sometimes be very high. We have heard of buy-back prices being as high as 80 percent of the asset’s original cost after nearly 75 percent of the asset’s estimated useful life. To set a tax depreciation rate that closely approximates economic depreciation, the Commissioner may sometimes need to use a depreciation formula that contains a residual value term. Section EE 25(4) provides such a formula, but the application dates in the bill mean that this section applies only to assets acquired before 1 April 2005 or 19 May 2005 for buildings. To allow the Commissioner to set an economically correct depreciation rate for assets that are expected to have a residual or scrap value greater than 13.5 percent of cost, the Commissioner should be allowed to apply the depreciation formula in section EE 25(4) in the following limited cases: • following an application by a taxpayer for a special depreciation rate; 24 • when determining the depreciation rate for an asset where there currently is no general depreciation rate; or • when reviewing the existing general depreciation rate for a type of asset. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Redundant change Clause 143 Submission (Matter raised by officials) It was proposed to amend the definition of “finance lease”. However, the definition of finance lease does not need changing to reflect the proposed changes to depreciation methods. This change is redundant. However, the reference to section EE 53 in the definition of finance lease should be changed to “EE 54”. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 25 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Depreciation loading for second-hand assets Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Second-hand assets should be entitled to the 20% depreciation loading, according to the suggestion in the officials’ issues paper. Comment There is an argument for extending depreciation loading to second-hand assets. However, this has a significant fiscal cost. The original estimate was approximately $340 million over three years. Moreover, there was a concern that if this change occurred at the same time as the change to double declining balance depreciation, the incentives would be greater for businesses to turn assets over merely to access higher depreciation rates. Accordingly, the government decided not to proceed with extending loading to second-hand assets at this time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Variable loading Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The 20% depreciation loading should be replaced with a variable rate loading system that increases the amount of loading for short-lived assets and decreases loading for long-lived assets. Comment Variable loading was raised in the officials’ issues paper but drew little support. Both variable depreciation loading methods discussed in the officials’ issues paper would have been more costly than the status quo. Other less costly variable loading options can be considered. More work is planned on issues associated with depreciation loading and less costly options of variable loading could be reconsidered at that time. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 26 Issue: Losses on buildings Submission (11W – Business New Zealand, 24 – Federated Farmers, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Losses incurred on the sale or disposal of buildings should be allowed for taxpayers that use buildings in the course of carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving assessable income. Comment This submission is outside the scope of the bill. However, officials have previously agreed to do further work on this issue and other issues associated with non- deductible and non-depreciable expenditure. Recommendation That this submission be declined. Issue: Depreciation and other policy goals Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Consideration should be given to how the tax depreciation rules can be used to achieve other policy goals. Comment Such an approach goes against the basic policy framework that drives New Zealand’s tax laws. New Zealand’s tax system is based on a broad base, low-rate model. Under such a model, the legislation attempts to tax most activities in an evenhanded way. This allows a lower across the board tax rate. On occasions market failures may provide grounds for considering cash or tax subsidies for particular activities. But these need to be considered on a case by case basis. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 27 Aligning the payment of provisional tax with GST and basing provisional tax payments on a percentage of GST taxable supplies 28 29 OVERVIEW Changes are proposed to the way provisional tax and GST payments are made as a result of market research undertaken with small and medium-sized enterprises. The Inland Revenue survey identified two main contributors to tax compliance costs faced by small businesses, namely the time needed to fill out forms, and the fact that provisional tax payments were not aligned with cashflow. To address these problems the government’s discussion document, Making tax easier for small businesses, proposed aligning the payment dates for GST and provisional tax and to base provisional tax on a percentage of GST taxable supplies. Currently provisional tax payments are due three times a year on the 7th of the month. GST payments are due monthly, two-monthly, or six-monthly on the last working day of the month. The bill introduces changes to allow provisional tax to be paid on the same dates as GST payments are made, thereby reducing the compliance requirements of the two taxes to one date. Both tax payments can be made on one form, thereby reducing the number of interactions taxpayers have with Inland Revenue. The due date for the payment of provisional tax and GST will change from the 7th of the month and last working day of the month respectively to the 28th of the month. The 28th was chosen as it is common to all months, and because it falls near the end of the month, would be easy for taxpayers to remember. Most GST taxpayers who are subject to provisional tax have their GST taxable periods aligned to their balance date. However, there are 13,000 taxpayers (13 percent of GST-registered taxpayers) whose GST taxable periods are not aligned with their income tax balance date. These taxpayers will need to align their GST taxable periods so their provisional tax payments can be paid along with GST. The changes also provide an option for provisional taxpayers who qualify to base their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST taxable supplies, which allows them to pay their provisional tax at the same time as they earn their income. Eleven submissions were received, with more than half supporting the proposed changes to align provisional tax with GST, change the GST due date and the introduction of another method of calculating provisional tax by basing it on a percentage of GST taxable supplies. 30 Issue: Support for aligning provisional tax payments with GST payments Clause 100 Submissions (11W – Business New Zealand, 20 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 24 – Federated Farmers, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The alignment of tax dates is supported as this will assist small business taxpayers to complete their returns for both provisional tax and GST at the same time. As GST is related to turnover, the payments should, therefore, be made at a time when the cash flow of the business is at its most positive. Doing both calculations and completing the returns at the same time should also achieve reductions in the cost of compliance. (New Zealand Retailers Association) We support the GST ratio proposal and commend the government on its innovative approach to addressing the fact that provisional tax payments often do not match a business’s income-earning process. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The involuntary exposure to use-of-money interest through uncertainty as to the final tax liability at the time provisional payments need to be made will be improved by the proposal. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 31 ALIGNING THE PAYMENT OF PROVISIONAL TAX WITH GST PAYMENT DATES Issue: Paying provisional tax along with GST and aligning taxable periods with balance dates Clause 100 Submission (3W – Webster and Company Ltd, 3WA – Gordon S Tye, 3WB – Richard Herbert, 5W – Cockcroft ATS Ltd, 26W – National Council of Women of New Zealand, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Four accountants submitted that the current situation where some clients whose taxable periods are aligned with their balance date and others whose taxable periods are not aligned allows accountants to spread their work load and should be retained. Aligning provisional tax with GST is also opposed as this will lead to a significant increase in workload in generating provisional tax reminders for taxpayers and recording that payments have been made. The reminders will in future be linked to GST return frequencies rather than the current three fixed payment dates. One submission proposes that only provisional taxpayers who use the GST ratio method should have to align their GST taxable periods with their balance dates. Those taxpayers who are not using the GST ratio method or who are not provisional taxpayers will not receive the benefits from alignment. Also, alignment may preclude some taxpayers who are currently part of a GST group from continuing to be part of a group because aligning their taxable periods may mean their new taxable periods are out of alignment with those of the group. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants submitted that the forced alignment of taxpayers’ GST taxable periods to their balance date would have a significant impact on the work flow of many tax agents because clients’ workloads were previously spread evenly throughout the year. Following the changes, the workload would be at three peak dates during the year. They have suggested that Inland Revenue relaxes the restrictions on taxpayers adopting a non-standard balance date to enable taxpayers to operate a non-standard balance date and ease agents’ work flows. It is also submitted that businesses may incur costs in complying with the new requirements or changing their systems because provisional tax is currently calculated by the tax agent and GST returns are done by the taxpayer. Comment The first issue deals with the concentration of accountants’ workload as a result of the alignment of a taxpayer’s GST taxable periods to their balance date. There are 13,000 taxpayers who pay both GST and provisional tax and who will be required to align their taxable periods to their balance dates. 32 Aligning GST taxable periods with balance dates is central to the proposal as it reduces the number of payments and concentrates the compliance activity for two taxes at one time of the month. Alignment is required only for those taxpayers who are liable for both provisional tax and GST. Those taxpayers who are not liable for both provisional tax and GST will not be aligned. Officials expect that, for the majority of tax agents, the alignment of GST taxable periods to balance dates for their clients will not unduly concentrate their workload. However, there may be some smaller tax agents for whom the number of clients changing their taxable periods relative to the agent’s overall client base could result in the agents’ workload being unduly concentrated around a few dates. In these situations Inland Revenue will consider relaxing the balance date policy (by a month) for the agent’s clients who will be forced to align, to ease the agent’s workload. The second issue relates to tax agents providing a reminder system for provisional tax payments. Those clients who are liable to pay both provisional tax and GST will pay their provisional tax on their GST return. The GST return will provide a reminder that the provisional tax is due. This should reduce agents’ workloads. For those taxpayers who pay provisional tax, but who are not subject to GST, the accountants can continue to use the reminder system for provisional tax. Taxpayers who are part of a group and whose taxable periods will be aligned have the ability to change their balance date (and therefore their GST taxable periods) to coincide with the group’s taxable periods. If this remains a problem then officials propose to consider the issue as part of a review of the grouping rules. The last issue relates to increased compliance costs for business. There will be costs associated with: • aligning GST taxable periods to balance date; • changes to taxpayers’ and tax agents’ systems; • taxpayers losing the use of the GST money for up to three days. However, these costs are likely to be offset by: • reducing compliance costs for businesses as a result of rationalising their tax payments; • having fewer tax payment dates and fewer contacts with Inland Revenue; • taxpayers being able to match their provisional tax payments to their income stream; • having an additional 52 days to calculate and pay provisional tax, and use of the provisional tax money. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 33 Issue: Application date of the proposal to align provisional tax payments with GST payments Clauses 2 and 100(2) Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Institute submits that the application date of the proposal be delayed for one year to enable further consultation so that the rules can be developed further. If the introduction is not delayed then the introduction of the ratio method should be delayed a year to enable the proposal to base provisional tax payments on a percentage of GST turnover to be extended to all taxpayers. Comment Officials have recommended later in this report that a change be made to the application date of the GST/provisional tax provisions to give effect to the government’s decision to delay the application date of the proposal by a year. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Amend rules to determine how many instalments of provisional tax a new provisional taxpayer must pay Clause 100 (MB 8(8)(a)) Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The provision that refers to when a new provisional taxpayer begins paying provisional tax should be amended to provide for the payment of two instalments of provisional tax when the taxpayer starts business after the first instalment but before the second instalment. Comment In section MB 8(8) the situation of a new provisional taxpayer paying only two provisional tax instalments during the year has been dealt with by providing a cross- reference to section MB 13. Section MB 13 deals with paying two instalments of provisional tax in a year. Therefore, the provision as currently drafted addresses the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 34 Issue: Offsetting GST refunds against provisional tax Clause 100 (MB 11) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill proposes that a taxpayer who has a GST refund can offset the amount against their provisional tax liability. However, where the GST refund is reduced, due to an error in the return, the amendments are silent on whether the shortfall relates to GST or provisional tax. Comment An underlying objective of the reforms was that a GST refund should be allowed to be offset against a provisional tax liability that is due on the same due date. When the taxpayer makes a mistake in the computation of the GST refund, which the taxpayer has directed be transferred to pay their provisional tax debt, additional time should be allowed to pay the resulting provisional tax debt. Officials propose that the debt remain with provisional tax because it is easier for taxpayers to understand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Due date for payment of GST Clause 100 (MB8) Submission (3W – Webster and Company Ltd, 3WA – Gordon S Tye, 3WB – Richard Herbert, 5W – Cockcroft ATS Ltd, 26W – National Council of Women of New Zealand, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) One submission proposed that the due date for the payment of terminal tax, FBT and PAYE payments also be aligned to the 28th of the month, along with GST and provisional tax. Five submissions proposed that the due date should remain at the last working day of the month because of the significant increase in workload they would experience. One submission suggested moving the due date to the 1st of the month and was also concerned about the size of the payment due for GST and provisional tax if both are due on the same day. 35 Comment The policy rationale behind the due date change was to align similar taxes on the same dates. For example, PAYE and FBT are payroll taxes that are due on the 20th of the month. The bill proposes to align the due dates for business taxes (GST and provisional tax) on one date, being the 28th of the month. Having two payment dates, the 20th and the 28th of the month, resulted from consultations with businesses that identified cash flow concerns with having one payment date for all payroll and businesses taxes. Consideration will continue to be given to aligning all payments of tax (GST, provisional tax, FBT, and PAYE and withholding payments) on the 28th of the month. However, officials want to consult further with businesses and tax agents to ensure that such a change does not put financial strain on businesses. It is recommended that any changes following consultation be incorporated in a later taxation bill. The four tax agents who made submissions stated that moving the due date from the last working date to the 28th of the month would put undue pressure on them to collate and prepare returns in time. They also pointed out that the 28th is difficult to remember. The issue of tax agents’ increased workload seems to stem more from two issues – moving the due date forward by three days and the alignment of taxpayers’ GST taxable periods to their balance date. The alignment issue is discussed in more detail later in this report together with a possible solution to tax agents’ concerns. Concerns relating to moving the due date forward by three days will result in work being undertaken by agents earlier. This may be a problem for some agents, although under the current due date they are required to file earlier if the last working day falls on a weekend. Also although agents will have to file GST returns earlier they will also get at least 52 additional days to file provisional tax payments, which could offset the bringing forward of their GST workload. Results of market research undertaken with small and medium-sized businesses shows that the majority of businesses consulted either liked or did not mind the due date changing to the 28th. There was little support shown (just 2 percent) in the market research for the 1st of the month as a due date. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Officials will consult with businesses further on the merits of having one due date for the payment of all taxes. 36 Issue: Income tax – due date for payments over the Christmas period Clauses 100 (MB 20(2)(3)), 152(1) and 212(2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill outlines the due dates for the payment of provisional tax and GST payments. When the due date for payments falls within the Christmas period, the bill provides that the due date will be the following 20th of January. Comment The 20th of January was chosen as it was one date on which all provisional tax, terminal tax, GST and PAYE payments could be made when the payments fell over the Christmas period. However, having all payments due on one date over the Christmas period would have a significant impact on Inland Revenue and the Westpac bank that processes Inland Revenue payments, resulting in a backlog of payments. Taxpayers would also be required to find a significant amount of money for payment of provisional tax, GST, terminal tax, and PAYE, all of which would be due on the 20th of January. It is therefore recommended that the due date for the payment of provisional tax and GST payments remains on the 15th of January. This will stagger the payment of GST/provisional tax and the payment of PAYE to smooth workflows and the financial impact on taxpayers. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 37 BASING PROVISIONAL TAX PAYMENTS ON A PERCENTAGE OF GST TAXABLE SUPPLIES Issue: Qualifying criteria for using the provisional tax ratio method Clause 100 (MB 15) Submission (20 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission proposed several amendments to the eligibility criteria for using the provisional tax ratio method. Two suggestions were made concerning the upper limit for qualifications. One submission proposed that taxpayers should qualify where they meet either the previous year’s residual income tax liability of $150,000 or whose prior year’s turnover is less than $5 million. Another submission suggested there should be no upper limit and that the ratio should be extended to all provisional taxpayers liable to file a GST return. It was also submitted that taxpayers who have made a loss for the previous year should be able to use the provisional tax ratio method. Another submission suggested that six-monthly GST payers should be entitled to use the ratio method. Lastly, one submission recommended that the ratio method should be extended to all groups of taxpayers – including partnerships, close companies, trusts and new businesses. Comment The provisional tax ratio method aims to strike a balance between accuracy and compliance costs. Therefore, as the upper limit for qualification increases there is a corresponding increase in the risk to the revenue. Also, the more qualifying criteria there are, the greater the compliance costs a taxpayer faces in determining whether they qualify to use the ratio method. Officials originally proposed a $1.3 million turnover threshold. This was later changed to a residual income tax threshold of $100,000 as, during consultation, it was submitted that this would better reflect the differing profit margins of businesses. Also, the residual income tax figure is readily available because it is calculated by the tax agent as part of the income tax return process. The residual income tax threshold was subsequently increased from $100,000 to $150,000 (which could be a $1.5–$2 million turnover) following further consultations. The current $150,000 threshold enables 95 percent of businesses to potentially qualify to use the ratio method. 38 The threshold provides a balance between enabling the vast majority of businesses to use the ratio method while limiting risk to the revenue and keeping compliance costs to a minimum. It is therefore recommended that the submission to extend the ratio threshold be declined. The second submission proposes to extend the ratio method to taxpayers who have made a loss in the previous year. Those taxpayers would use the tax and GST figures for the year prior to the year of loss to calculate the ratio. Generally, the further back in time you go to determine the figures to use to calculate the ratio, the more likely that the ratio calculated will not reflect the current tax liability of a business, due to business and market changes over time. Currently, the provisional tax rules allow businesses with extensions of time to file tax returns using figures from the year before the last year to determine their provisional tax liability. Allowing a taxpayer who made a loss to use the loss year’s figures to determine the ratio will extend the period to four or more years when the taxpayer has had multiple loss years. Officials have concerns about the accuracy of using figures which are three or more years old to determine the ratio calculation and recommend that the submission be declined at this point. It is proposed that a review of the ratio method be undertaken to consider how the method could be extended and it would be appropriate to consider the proposal to include businesses that have made a loss at this time. The third submission proposes that six-monthly GST payers be able to use the ratio method. To qualify as a six-monthly GST payer, a taxpayer must have taxable supplies of $250,000 or less. Six-monthly GST payers moving from three provisional tax payments to two payments a year does not assist in addressing cash flow difficulties for small businesses as although they have fewer payment dates, the payment amounts may be significant. Six-monthly GST filers would only benefit from the ratio proposal when they earn a significant amount of their income in the later part of the year. Allowing taxpayers choices can increase compliance costs as taxpayers determine the best option for them to use. Six-monthly GST filers only have two payments and accessing the ratio would only benefit taxpayers who earn a significant proportion of their income in the later half of the year. If there are significant benefits to taxpayers from using the ratio option they could become two-monthly filers and pay the majority of their GST and provisional tax on the last provisional tax/GST payment date. The last submission proposes that the ratio method be extended to partnerships, close companies, trusts and new businesses. This issue will be considered as part of a future review of the ratio method. Recommendation That all four submissions be declined and that the proposals to extend the ratio method to partnerships, close companies, trusts, new businesses and businesses in a loss situation will be considered when the ratio method is reviewed. 39 Issue: Method by which taxpayers are notified of the ratio percentage Clause 100 (MB 7(4)) Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission requests that either: • the requirements for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to notify the taxpayer of their ratio percentage on their GST return, in writing, by telephone, or any other means is unnecessary as section 14 of the Tax Administration Act outlines how the Commissioner should notify the taxpayer; or • the methods above should be extended to all circumstances in which the Commissioner is required to give notice, not just for advising of the ratio. Comment The current methods of advising taxpayers may not be suitable for the ratio option as they can be time consuming and can lead to further contacts by phone (as the receipt often generates a phone call). Given that there are less than three months from the beginning of the year to the first payment for Inland Revenue to process the application, advise taxpayers of their ratio and for the taxpayer to calculate and pay their provisional tax, the method chosen to advise taxpayers of the ratio must be one that suits individual taxpayers – hence the proposed choices. Officials do not consider that phone contact should be extended to all circumstances where the taxpayer interacts with the department. There are instances when notification must be in writing for evidential reasons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 40 OTHER Issue: Communicating the provisional tax changes Clause 100 Submission (11W – Business New Zealand, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submitters request that the provisional tax changes are effectively and clearly communicated to businesses and tax agents. The proposed changes should be widely advertised in the business community. (Business New Zealand, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Because the legislative changes are quite complex, clear guidelines would help to avoid any penalties that businesses may incur for incorrect implementation. (Business New Zealand) Comment Inland Revenue will be consulting with tax agents and industry organisations on the implementation of the GST/provisional tax changes. This consultation will seek feedback on the best way to publicise the changes to businesses. The methods likely to be used include advertising in target audience publications and major newspapers, presentations to industry organisations, seminars, including information in industry and trade newsletters, online newsletters, and on related websites such as the Ministry of Economic Development website. Inland Revenue will also use its own communication products to advertise the changes, such as GST newsletters and returns, and tax agent newsletters. The staggered implementation of the proposals will enable simple and clear messages to be delivered to the businesses affected. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 41 Issue: Due date for the payment of terminal tax Clause 101(1)(b) Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The terminal tax due dates should be aligned with provisional tax and GST payment dates (the 28th of the relevant month). (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the terminal tax due date is not changed, the incorrect reference in the legislation to when terminal tax is payable when the due date falls within the Christmas period should be amended. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Currently, the due date for the payment of terminal tax falls on the 7th of the month, with the date being extended to the 15th of January if the due date is the 7th of January. Shifting the terminal tax date from the 7th of the month to the 28th of the month would have a significant cost to the government and is outside the scope of these proposals. The bill, as drafted, incorrectly refers to terminal tax payments that are due in December now being due on the 20th of January. Officials recommend that the Committee agrees to amend the bill to ensure that when terminal tax payments are due in January they will be due on the 15th of January. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, namely, the recommendation to amend the legislation to ensure that when terminal tax payments are due in January they will be due on the 15th of January, be accepted. 42 Issue: Other measures to reduce exposure to use-of-money interest Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submission suggests that other measures be introduced which will reduce taxpayers’ exposure to use-of-money interest, for example: • aligning the use-of-money interest rates so that both rates are equal; • improving the estimation process; • allowing unequal instalments; • allowing for one-off items as an exception to the use-of-money calculation. The submission also requests that a full review of how provisional tax works and is administered should be undertaken. Comment The issues raised are outside the scope of the current provisions included in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Income tax – student loan repayments for provisional taxpayers Clause 221 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Incorrect section references in the new provision give the impression that provisional taxpayers are only required to make two student loan repayments during the year. Comment The policy intent of the proposal is that provisional taxpayers who are liable to pay student loans continue to make three student loan repayments, regardless of when they pay their GST. As the due date for provisional tax is to shift, the date for student loan repayments would also shift from the 7th to the 28th of the month. Officials propose that the provision be amended to ensure that provisional taxpayers would continue to pay student loan repayments on the 28th of August, 20th of January and 28th of April. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 43 Issue: Late filing of GST returns by ratio taxpayer Clause 100 (MB 15 (6)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed section MB 15(6) states that if a taxpayer uses the ratio method of paying provisional tax and does not provide a GST return, they will cease to be entitled to use the ratio method. This section does not provide any flexibility for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to accept a late GST return. The Commissioner should also have the power to reinstate the ratio option when the failure to file was due to reasonable cause. The section wording is confusing because the methods used to calculate the outstanding payment amount are also applied to the remaining provisional tax instalments for the year. Comment Officials consider that the Commissioner should have the discretion to accept a late return (which is not unduly late) without the taxpayer being removed from the ratio method. If the taxpayer fails to provide the return within a reasonable period following the due date they cease to be entitled to use the ratio method. Officials recommend that this section should be amended to clarify that if the taxpayer using the ratio method of paying provisional tax does not provide a GST return within 60 days of the due date for filing the GST return, they will cease to be entitled to use the ratio method. Officials also recommend that the Commissioner should be given the discretion to reinstate the ratio method if the non-filing has been caused by an event or circumstance that provides reasonable justification for non-filing and the non-filing was rectified as soon as possible. Examples of such events are an accident, disaster, illness, or emotional or mental distress. This would be consistent with the policies for the remission of penalties. Also, if a taxpayer has been removed from the ratio method they will be required to estimate their provisional tax instalments for the remainder of the year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 44 Issue: Ability to change GST taxable periods, request a refund, or provide a provisional tax estimate by phone, electronic or other means Clauses 100 (MB 6(2), MB 16(2), MB 36(2) & (3)) and 211 (156 (1) & (2)) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Currently, where a taxpayer: • requests a change in GST taxable periods (for example, from two-monthly to six-monthly); or • requests a refund of the amount of provisional tax paid; or • wants to make an estimate of their provisional tax liability; the request must be in writing. Also, to elect to use the provisional tax ratio method the taxpayer’s election must be either in writing or by phone. Comment More taxpayers are interacting with Inland Revenue by phone and electronic channels. Requiring taxpayers to notify Inland Revenue in writing or have Inland Revenue notify them in writing, limits Inland Revenue’s ability to interact with taxpayers in the most efficient way. Officials propose that taxpayers be given the option of advising Inland Revenue by phone when requesting a change in a GST taxable period, seeking a refund of the amount of provisional tax paid, or providing an estimate of their provisional tax liability. Officials also propose that taxpayers should be given flexibility to use whatever means Inland Revenue provides to elect to use the ratio – for example, advising an Inland Revenue officer during an advisory visit. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 45 DRAFTING Issue: Minor drafting amendments Clauses 100, 172, 173, 177, 180, 211, 212 and 213 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission proposes a number of drafting changes relating to the aligning of provisional tax payment dates with GST, including: • alignment of the drafting of proposed section MB 8(3) and MB 8(4); • updating the legislative reference table in section MB 8; • amending the reference to the number of days in the example in section MB 13; • rewording the example in section MB 14; • reformatting the formulas in sections MB 21(2) and (4) and MB 22(2); • rewording the examples in sections MB 26 and MB 27; • correcting a cross-reference error in section MB 28(2)(c); • minor drafting changes to sections MB 30(2) and MB 34; • a minor drafting change to section 16B of the GST Act; • filing of final GST returns in December, section 16(2) of the GST Act; • correcting a cross-reference error in section 15D of the GST Act; • enabling credit use-of-money to be paid for voluntary provisional tax payments – section 120C(1) of the Tax Administration Act; • minor drafting changes to section 120KC and 120KD of the Tax Administration Act; • clarifying the amendments to the late payment and shortfall provisions. Officials agree with the amendments proposed in the submission. 46 Issue: Minor legislative changes/cross-references Clause 100 Submission (Matters raised by officials) A number of minor drafting changes should be made to improve the accuracy of the legislation. Sections MB 2(1)(a) and (3), MB 5(4)(b), MB 8(3), MB 8(9), MB 13(1)(b)(ii), MB 14(1)(b)(ii) and clause 117 (MZ 8(2)) These sections refer to the threshold level at which a taxpayer becomes liable for provisional tax. The threshold levels need to be clarified to ensure that a taxpayer only becomes liable for provisional tax when residual income tax exceeds $2,500 (and they are not liable if their residual income tax is $2,500 or less). Section MB 7(8) This is a drafting error. The reference in section MB 7(8) to “total value of supplies” should have been to “total value of taxable supplies”. Other changes should be made to ensure that the reference is to “total supplies” rather than “taxable supplies”. Section MB 9 The drafting of section MB 9 should be amended so that it is clear that this provision deals with calculating the amount of provisional tax for a tax year. Section MB 12 A drafting error has resulted in the new section MB 12 not fully reflecting recently legislated changes. The section should be updated. Section MB 15(6) The section currently makes use of a GST ratio conditional on a taxpayer providing a GST return. It should also be conditional on the GST return being provided by the due date. Also, the words “that remain for the tax year or corresponding income year” should be deleted for greater clarity. Section MB 19(1) The section should be clarified to ensure that it applies when “last year” or the “year before last” is a transitional year. Section MB 20(5)(b) The reference to “new return date” in section MB 20(5)(b) should be replaced by “new balance date”. 47 Section MB 33(4)(c) The drafting section does not reflect the current legislation and should be amended to allow a company to provide a notice to the Commissioner within the timeframe for filing a return or such other time as the Commissioner may allow. Section MB 38 The drafting of the amendment to section MB 38 of the Income Tax Act unintentionally narrows the application of the relief provision to farming, agricultural and fishing businesses. It is recommended that the provision be amended to reflect the application of the current “adverse event” provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application dates of GST/provisional tax provisions Clauses 2, 100(2), 119(3) and 221 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date of the GST/provisional tax proposal should be deferred. Comment Officials have reported to the government on the application date of the GST/provisional tax proposal. GST/provisional tax Currently the GST/provisional tax changes have a staggered application date of: • 1 April 2006 for the GST due date change; • the 2007–08 income year for provisional tax payments to be paid on GST due dates. For Inland Revenue to implement the GST/provisional tax changes by 1 April 2006, legislation would need to have been enacted by January 2006 to enable Inland Revenue to make system changes and to notify taxpayers, and for taxpayers to make the necessary changes to their systems by 1 April 2006. 48 The government has therefore agreed to delay the application date of the GST/provisional tax proposals by one year. The new application dates will be: • 1 April 2007 for the GST due date change; • the 2008–09 income year for provisional tax payments to be paid on GST due dates. The wording of the application date provision could also be made more specific by stating that the provisional tax changes “apply to provisional tax payments made for the income year corresponding to the 2008–09 and subsequent tax years”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 Subsidy for payroll agents 50 51 OVERVIEW The PAYE subsidy proposal is a tax simplification initiative outlined in 2003 in the government discussion document, Making tax easier for small businesses. Under this proposal, the government will subsidise or partly subsidise the cost of an employer engaging a payroll intermediary. The subsidy will be available to an employer for up to five employees per month. To obtain the subsidy an employer must engage a listed payroll intermediary. The listed payroll intermediary will also be eligible to receive a subsidy from the government. Under the proposed rules, payroll service providers who are accredited payroll intermediaries may apply to become listed payroll intermediaries. To receive the subsidy, a listed payroll intermediary must provide Inland Revenue with an employer monthly schedule and PAYE payment for each employer and a subsidy claim form. A decision on the final amount and structure of the subsidy will be made early in 2006 and will be authorised by Order in Council. Two out of five submissions support the initiative but suggest that the number of employees for whom a subsidy can be paid be increased. One submission is generally supportive of the proposal, but considers that the subsidy will have a limited appeal. This submission makes suggestions on how to improve the proposal. Two submissions oppose the proposal. One of these expresses the view that a subsidy is not the way to reduce compliance costs placed on employers. The other considers that it is not Inland Revenue’s role to provide subsidies to private businesses. 52 SCOPE OF THE SUBSIDY Issue: Number of eligible employees Clause 119 Submission (20 – New Zealand Retailers Association) The subsidy should apply to full-time equivalents or for the first eight employees. (11W – Business New Zealand) The payroll subsidy should be paid for the first 10 employees. Comment The New Zealand Retailers Association is concerned that the payroll subsidy applies only to the first five employees. It states that it is a common feature of the retail industry to employ part-time personnel. It is therefore possible for a retailer to have more than five employees, but five or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Accordingly, either extending the subsidy to the first eight employees or applying the subsidy to full-time equivalents would overcome this problem. Business New Zealand recommends that the subsidy should be extended to include ten employees, rather than the proposed five so that 93 percent of small businesses are potentially eligible for the subsidy. Officials consider that while these arguments have some merit, they are insufficient to justify a change to the number of eligible employees for the following reasons: • Applying the subsidy to full-time equivalents would require employers to determine the hours of every employee and for Inland Revenue to check the information provided. This would increase employers’ and payroll agents’ compliance costs and Inland Revenue’s administrative costs. • Increasing the number of eligible employees would correspondingly increase the cost of the proposal to the government. • Seventy-one percent of all employers have five or fewer employees and would receive the full subsidy for each of their employees if the number of eligible employees were capped at five employees. The subsidy payment would continue to be paid once an employer took on more than five employees. Twenty-two percent of employers have more than five employees but are not large employers. These employers would receive the subsidy for their first five employees and would be required to pay the payroll agent only the balance of any costs. It should be noted that the proposed subsidy will be subsequently reviewed. There is a possibility that, in the future, the scope of the subsidy will be extended to include other types of employers and non-PAYE compliance obligations. 53 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The government should not introduce the subsidy Submission (22W – National Council of Women of New Zealand) The subsidy should not be introduced for the following reasons: • Inland Revenue’s role is to administer taxation legislation and ensure compliance to protect the tax base, and not to provide taxpayer-funded subsidies to private businesses. • The subsidy will be available for small employers whose total PAYE liability is less than $100,000 annually. The NCWNZ believes that businesses whose annual PAYE liability is around $100,000 are not small businesses, and therefore can afford the cost of PAYE preparation. Comment Officials believe that the benefits of providing the subsidy to private businesses outweigh the costs of funding it. The benefits of the subsidy include: • Reduced compliance costs for small businesses. • Improvement of the PAYE system – payroll intermediaries would provide services to a larger number of employers, using their skills and technology to increase the accuracy and timeliness of returns. Better PAYE compliance will benefit employers, whose exposure to penalties for non-compliance will be reduced. • Outsourcing of compliance obligations faced by small businesses will allow small employers to focus their efforts on their business, rather than compliance activities. • Lower administrative costs for Inland Revenue as a result of dealing with payroll specialists who use automated systems rather than small employers who use manual systems. • Improved timeliness of payments and better quality of information supplied to Inland Revenue and an anticipated reduction in penalties imposed. In relation to the second issue, there is no uniform definition of a small employer. Officials estimate that making the subsidy available to employers with a PAYE liability under $100,000 should cover a large number of smaller employers. 54 It is possible to make it more difficult to qualify as a small employer. However, the need to monitor compliance with the requirements would impose extra compliance costs on payroll intermediaries and employers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue, which would undermine the effectiveness of the subsidy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The scope of and the need for the subsidy Submissions (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The criteria for determining which employers will be eligible to benefit from the subsidy are too narrow. The proposal will not assist small employers who decide not to use a payroll agent or medium-sized and larger employers. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The PAYE system should be reviewed, given the complexity of the rules. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment PricewaterhouseCoopers state that the objective of reducing employers’ compliance costs could be achieved by other means. It is suggested that the government could subsidise the costs of payroll software for those employers who choose to retain control of their payroll rather than engage PAYE intermediaries. Alternatively, PricewaterhouseCoopers contends that the government could repeal the 39% personal marginal tax rate to reduce the complexity of the PAYE rules and thus reduce compliance costs to employers. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants contends that simplifying the PAYE system would be more helpful to small businesses than encouraging them to engage payroll intermediaries. The main purpose of the proposal is to reduce compliance costs imposed on smaller employers, who are less likely to have established and efficient payroll systems. By using a payroll agent, small employers will be able to focus their efforts on their core business, and reduce their exposure to penalties and interest related to late or inaccurate return filing. The proposal will also result in better timeliness and accuracy of payments received by Inland Revenue. 55 These benefits would not be available if the government subsidised payroll software and the employer undertook the obligations. The reduction of tax rates and the simplification of the PAYE system are beyond the scope of this proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Subsidy should be available to all employers Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Instead of providing a subsidy to payroll intermediaries in respect of small employers, the subsidy should be available to employers (large or small) who complete PAYE returns. Comment The current proposal stipulates that the payroll subsidy will be granted only to payroll intermediaries dealing with small employers. The reason behind the limited application of the subsidy is because small employers, particularly new employers, need more assistance with meeting their PAYE obligations than more established employers who already have established PAYE procedures in place. Proportionally, payroll costs are higher per employee for smaller employers than for larger employers. The subsidy will increase the time that small employers spend on their business rather than on complying with their PAYE obligations. It should be noted that the proposed subsidy will be subsequently reviewed and assessed. Therefore, there is a possibility that, in the future, the scope of the subsidy could be extended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 Issue: Self-assessment, identical rules and contracts Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) To simply the administration of the subsidy: • Instead of the subsidy being paid by Inland Revenue to payroll intermediaries, payroll intermediaries should be able to self-assess the subsidy and deduct it off the PAYE due for the period. This will relieve payroll intermediaries from having to apply for a subsidy in a subscribed form. • There should be the same set of requirements for all payroll intermediaries. • There should be only one set of rules for accreditation and revocation of accreditation for payroll intermediaries, without making a distinction on accredited and listed payroll intermediaries. Any further rules in relation to those payroll intermediaries who wish to register to receive a subsidy can be imposed through a contractual arrangement. • The rules governing the process of claiming the subsidy, such as filing a claim form, amending a claim form, withholding the subsidy and so forth, should be imposed through a contractual arrangement and not by way of legislation. • The rules governing administrative processes that are to be followed when an arrangement between an employer and intermediary is terminated should be specified in a contractual arrangement between Inland Revenue and a payroll intermediary. Comment Officials believe that a self-assessment system is not suitable for administering the subsidy. Inland Revenue would want to be certain that a payroll intermediary supplied it with correct payroll information and that the employer was still eligible to receive a subsidy before making a subsidy payment. By allowing payroll intermediaries to offset the amount of subsidy against the gross PAYE liability of employers, Inland Revenue would lose the ability to test the amount of the subsidy prior to its payment. To become an accredited payroll intermediary, a person will have to comply with the current rules for payroll intermediaries specified in subpart NBA of the Income Tax Act 2004. A payroll intermediary who wishes to become a listed payroll intermediary in order to receive a subsidy will still have to comply with subpart NBA. The only new rules imposed by the proposed legislation are those necessary for administering the subsidy, such as the requirement to file a claim form electronically. Officials consider that the additional rules are essential for administering the subsidy and should not significantly complicate the PAYE rules. 57 Officials do not consider that removing the rules governing the subsidy from the legislation and transferring them to contractual arrangements with payroll intermediaries is a better way of managing the subsidy. • Including the rules governing the administration of the subsidy and behaviour of listed payroll intermediaries in the legislation will make it consistent with the way the existing payroll intermediaries are regulated. Currently, all rules in relation to payroll intermediaries are contained in the legislation. • Legislation is more transparent than a contract. Any person who is considering becoming a listed payroll intermediary will have a clear understanding of all requirements, rights and obligations by simply checking the publicly available legislation. • It could be claimed that by entering into a contractual arrangement, Inland Revenue has “appointed” a payroll intermediary as its agent. This puts Inland Revenue at risk that the actions of the payroll intermediary are, if effect, the actions of Inland Revenue. Therefore, officials consider that the subsidy rules should be set by legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of payroll subsidy Clauses 2 and 119(3) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date of the payroll subsidy proposal should be deferred. Comment Officials have reported to the government on the application date of the payroll subsidy proposal. The payroll subsidy provisions will require regulations to give full effect to the policy intent of the proposal, and enactment of the legislation in March 2006 will not give sufficient time for the necessary regulations to be prepared and promulgated 28 days before the intended commencement date of 1 April 2006. There are also indications that a 1 April 2006 commencement date will not provide sufficient time for all the system changes that payroll intermediaries and Inland Revenue need to make. 58 The government has therefore agreed that the commencement date be deferred. The new commencement date is 1 October 2006. It is recommended that the application date of the proposal in the bill be amended to reflect the government’s decision to defer the application date and to clarify the wording of the application provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 MINOR DRAFTING CHANGES Submission (Matters raised by officials) A number of drafting changes need to be made so the subsidy functions as intended. Clause 119, section NBB 6(2)(b) The reference to “pay frequency” in the proposed section NBB 6(2)(b) needs to be replaced by a provision allowing the Commissioner to include on an electronic notice any other information that Inland Revenue deems necessary. Clause 119, section NBB 6(2)(c) A drafting error has resulted in the proposed section NBB 6(2)(c) referring to “PAYE period”, which is not relevant for payroll subsidy purposes. The reference should be changed to “period”. Clause 143(28)(d) A drafting error has resulted in clause 143(28)(d) referring to “pay period”, which is not relevant for payroll subsidy purposes. The reference to “pay period” should be replaced by “period”. Clause 143(28)(e) Clause 143(28)(e) refers to “pay frequency” which is irrelevant for payroll subsidy purposes. The clause should be amended to refer to the number of payments made by the listed PAYE intermediary to each employee for a particular subsidy period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 60 61 Fringe benefit tax 62 63 OVERVIEW Clauses 14 to 16, 24 to 33, 40, 81, 121 to 132, 143, 145 and 148 The bill includes a range of changes to fringe benefit tax (FBT). The changes arise from a review of FBT and were signalled in the government discussion document, Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, released in December 2003. They are designed to reduce compliance costs and remove anomalies in the rules while maintaining the objectives of FBT. This includes changes to motor vehicle fringe benefits, although the underlying presumptions used in calculating the value of the benefit have been retained. The main changes are: Motor vehicles • Owners will have the choice of calculating the benefit based on the vehicle’s depreciated tax value (with a minimum value) or, as at present, its cost. 6 • The rate applying to either the cost price or tax value is being reduced in recognition of lower real motoring costs since the rate was set in the early 1980s. This reduces the rate from 24% to 20% of the cost of the vehicle. (The equivalent rate under the new tax value option is 36%.) • The treatment of leased vehicles is being aligned with that of owned vehicles so that the fringe benefit from a leased vehicle is based on either its cost or tax value, rather than its market value as at present. • To remove the potential for private use of a motor vehicle within a 24-hour period being treated as two days’ private use, employers will be able to elect the start time for an FBT day. The election would last for two years. • To overcome the avoidance of FBT by employees leasing their own vehicles to their employers and “suspending” the leases when private use occurs (known as 9 to 5 or flip-flop leases), the “suspension” is being legislatively overridden for FBT purposes so that private use is treated as a fringe benefit. Other issues • Employers will have the option of valuing their loans to employees at a market rate as an alternative to the current prescribed rate of interest. The market rate will be the rate that the lender is charging to other comparable groups of an adequate size on an arm’s-length basis, which need not be a rate that is available to the public. • The minimum value thresholds that apply to unclassified fringe benefits are being increased. The employee threshold is being increased from $75 to $200 per quarter and the employer threshold is being increased from $450 per quarter to $15,000 per annum. 6 The tax value method is designed to more appropriately value the benefit when the car has been owned for more than five years. 64 • The private use of employer-owned or leased business tools such as cellphones and laptops will be exempt from FBT when they have been provided to the employee primarily for business purposes, subject to the cost price of a tool not exceeding $5,000. • Benefits that arise in relation to employer health and safety obligations will be exempt from FBT irrespective of whether provided on or off-premises. • The general anti-avoidance rule for income tax is to apply to FBT. • The provision of credit cards and other short-term credit facilities by a charity to an employee will be subject to FBT when the value of the benefit exceeds 5% of the employee’s salary. • An exemption from FBT will be available when an employer pays for an employee’s family to travel to visit the employee, provided the employee would have been eligible for a tax-free reimbursement of their travel expenses had the employee instead visited his/her family. This exemption will be limited to the amount that would have been reimbursable. • Employees will be able to claim a deduction against their income for income protection insurance premiums paid by their employer on their behalf. Submissions were generally supportive of the changes – in particular, the reduction in the valuation rate for motor vehicles (from 24 percent to 20 percent of the vehicle’s cost price), the alternative of valuing the benefit as a percentage of the vehicle’s tax value, and making more unclassified fringe benefits exempt from FBT. However, several submitters favoured retaining the current treatment with regard to 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases because they considered such leases enabled shareholder-employees to achieve the same business/private cost allocation as sole traders and partners. There was also some concern that the legislation was unclear about how re-leased vehicles could be valued for FBT purposes. A range of minor technical amendments were also suggested. Officials consider that the changes to 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases are necessary to achieve the intention of the current legislation that shareholder-employees should come within the ambit of the FBT rules rather than the rules applying to sole traders and partners. While submitters have raised a broader issue regarding the relative treatment of shareholder-employees, this is outside the scope of the FBT review. We do recommend, however, that a full deduction of fixed and variable private motoring costs should be allowed in relation to the vehicles covered by the 9 to 5 leases, the same as occurs in other situations when FBT is applied. Other changes officials recommend as a result of submissions are: • That the cost price of a previously leased vehicle would be its market value at the start of the new lease provided the lessee and any previous lessee (or owner) of the vehicle are not associated persons. • That there should be an FBT exemption for income protection insurance premiums paid by an employer rather than, as originally proposed, the employee receiving a deduction in respect of those premiums. 65 • That any member of a group of companies containing a person who is in the business of providing public transport can value any transport benefits that they provide their staff at the same rate as the public transport provider would be able to use in relation to its staff for FBT purposes. • That the fringe benefits that arise from advances against salary and wages be exempt from FBT when the aggregate amount advanced to an employee does not exceed $2,000 and the advances are not part of an employment package. • Several technical and drafting changes to improve the clarity of the legislation’s intent and to better align it with the intended policy objective. Otherwise, officials recommend adoption of the changes set out in the draft legislation. Several submissions suggested that there should be transitional arrangements for year by year leases already in operation at the time the legislative changes come into effect (1 April 2006). Officials do not recommend any transitional arrangements given that the changes have been known for at least 10 months and the leases in question have been structured with the principal purpose of minimising the FBT payable. 66 MOTOR VEHICLES Issue: 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases Clause 25 Submission (3W – Webster & Company Ltd, 3WA – Gordon Tye, 3WB – Richard Herbert, 5W – John Cockcroft, 7W – Murray Pashby, 11W – Business New Zealand, 20 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 43W – Deloitte, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 49 – Stephen Lace & Co) The treatment of 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases should not be changed. The change biases the tax system in favour of operating under a self-employed structure. Comment Over the past decade an increasing number of employees (usually shareholder- employees) have entered into arrangements to lease their own vehicles to their employers for business use during specified hours in exchange for a market rental. The leases enable the employees to enjoy private use of the vehicles when they are not being used for business purposes. Because the leases are in effect “suspended” when the private use occurs, there is no FBT liability. In earlier cases, Inland Revenue was able to apply FBT to 9 to 5 leases when there was evidence that the vehicle was available for private use during the “business lease” period (for example, evidence that taxpayers have used the vehicle to pick up children from school). The arrangements then evolved into “flip-flop” leases, where the lease agreement does not specify a “business lease” time, but instead says that the vehicle is not available for private use whenever it is being used for business purposes, and vice versa. This has the effect of creating a legal fiction that technically gets around the concept of availability for private use that underpins the FBT rules, to allow unlimited private use and the apportionment of fixed costs between private and (alleged) business use. 7 Although the vehicle is owned by the employee, this is an undesirable policy outcome because the arrangement allows the employer to subsidise the fixed costs of the employee’s vehicle and therefore provide a form of untaxed remuneration to employees. Officials contend that the economic outcome of a 9 to 5 or flip-flop lease is the same as if the employer had either leased the vehicle from a company specialising in leasing cars to businesses, or had purchased the vehicle, and in both cases made it available to the employee for their private use. This is because in all these scenarios the employer receives the use of a vehicle for business purposes and the employee is also able to use the vehicle for private purposes. 7 The fringe benefit received from a motor vehicle takes into account the private benefit that an employee gets from avoiding having to incur fixed costs such as depreciation and interest (known as the benefits from availability for private use) as well as the running costs, such as fuel, arising from actual use of the vehicle. In contrast, under an apportionment approach, the approach (favoured by submitters), these fixed costs are pro-rated between business and private purposes so that a portion of the fixed costs can be deducted. 67 The proposed solution provided in the bill involves the ability to “suspend” the lease, which allows the lease to run for only specified periods. This “suspension” would be legislatively overridden for FBT purposes so that the lease would be continuous for its full term (unless ceased earlier) and the employee would then receive a fringe benefit from the private use. While this would make 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases unattractive, officials argue that the change is only restoring what Parliament originally intended. The submitters’ main concern is that this change inappropriately biases the tax system in favour of operating under a self-employed structure, such as a sole trader or partnership, compared with the business incorporating as a company. They would prefer that the self-employed model also applies to shareholder-employees, which is what the 9 to 5 and flip-flip leases achieve. Under that model, there is a straight apportionment of expenses between business and private purposes, with only the business portion being able to be deducted against income. A company can deduct all expenditure against its income but FBT is applied to any private benefit that the company provides. 8 The FBT rules cover all employees, including shareholder-employees of close companies. This means that from a tax policy perspective employers of shareholder- employees are supposed to pay FBT whereas partners and sole traders apply the apportionment approach to their expenditure. Hence, someone such as a plumber, who moves from being a sole trader to setting up and working in their own plumbing company, has to deal with fringe benefit tax. This is simply a result of corporatising. Officials acknowledge that this does create some boundary issues, but unless one treatment is applied in all situations, the problem of a boundary is unavoidable. 9 Currently the boundary has been drawn to incorporate shareholder-employees within FBT. The reason for bringing shareholder-employees within the net arose from a concern in the late 1980s about the use of the major shareholder-employee in close companies to overcome FBT in circumstances when it should apply, and as a means of bolstering the dividend rules. Most non-cash benefits received by shareholder- employees are subject to FBT rather than being treated as a dividend because of the difficulty in deciding whether the benefit has been received in a shareholder or employee capacity. The Valabh Committee considered this issue in the 1990s in the context of the treatment of shareholders of close companies. Although the committee recommended that the profits and losses of companies with few shareholders should be able to be allocated to individual shareholders, as is the case for partners and sole traders, it concluded that FBT should continue to apply to in-kind benefits provided to shareholder-employees by both qualifying companies and non-qualifying companies. Officials do accept, however, that a full deduction of all costs, not just the business portion, should be allowed when FBT is paid. This would replicate the treatment applying when a company owns or leases the vehicle and pays FBT on making it available to an employee for their private use. 8 Quite apart from the boundary arguments raised by submitters, there has also been an underlying dislike of the FBT approach from many accountants ever since the introduction of FBT as they would prefer the motor vehicle benefit generally to be based on actual use rather than availability for use. FBT based on actual use would result in some form of apportionment. 9 In this context the difference in tax treatment is just one factor to be taken into consideration. There are a range of benefits from adopting a company structure. If one approach had to be applied across all situations, then arguably it is the FBT treatment rather than the apportionment model that should be more widely applied. 68 Recommendation That the submission be declined, but agree to a legislative amendment that ensures that for 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases, the full costs (both business and private) of operating the motor vehicle can be deducted by the lessor when FBT is paid by the lessee. Submission (3W – Webster & Company Ltd, 3WA – Gordon Tye, 3WB – Richard Herbert) The proposed change should be confined to non-shareholder employees. Comment The submission argues that this limitation is necessary to maintain the relative treatment, in the case of leased vehicles, between shareholder-employees and the self- employed. However, the submission acknowledges this would exclude around 99 percent of 9 to 5 or flip-flop lease agreements. As discussed in the previous submission, officials consider there are good reasons for the change and that continuation of the current situation would undermine compliance with FBT. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (43W – Deloitte) As a minimum, there should be transitional provisions for 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases which are part-way through their term when the amending legislation is enacted. Comment A transition that excluded 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases that are in operation on 1 April 2006 from the proposed change in treatment of such leases would in effect nullify the change because it would enable the tax advantages from such arrangements to be locked in. By the time the change applies, businesses will have had ten months in which to plan for it. Moreover, since the vast majority of these arrangements involve shareholder- employees it seems that they could be fairly readily terminated if the participants found that the tax changes made them no longer economic. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 69 Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) Where a fringe benefit arises as a result of a close company making a motor vehicle available for the private use of a shareholder-employee, the employer should be given the option of not claiming the proportion of the motor vehicle expenses that relate to the private use by the employee of that motor vehicle, rather than accounting for fringe benefit tax. (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Close companies should be treated as “look-through” entities for the purposes of the FBT rules or, alternatively, the value of the fringe benefit could be based on an amount that is the now-deductible private-related portion. Comment These submissions amount to applying the same treatment to shareholder-employees as currently applies to sole traders and partnerships. As noted in an earlier submission, officials suggest that if there was to be an alignment of the treatment of the self-employed with that applying to shareholder- employees, then arguably it is the FBT treatment rather than the apportionment of expenses that should apply more widely. This is because, by taking into consideration the fixed cost savings, the FBT approach better reflects the benefit that someone gets from the private use of a motor vehicle. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) “Suspension” of right to use a motor vehicle should be defined in section CX 6C. Comment The submitter is concerned that there is no limit on the length of suspension covered. The problem with introducing a time limit on the length of suspension is that it is relatively arbitrary where to draw the line and provides a possible loophole for exploitation. It would still be possible to avoid FBT and, in effect, the application of apportionment by entering into a lease and suspending it for the rest of the year or even indefinitely. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 Submission (Matter raised by officials) • that the legislative changes in new sections CX 6B and 6C with regard to 9 to 5 and flip-flop leases should be clarified to ensure that they include such leases involving persons associated with either the employer or the employee; and • that the section OD 8(3) definition of “associated person” applies for the purposes of those provisions. Comment These changes relating to associated persons are anti-avoidance in nature. Draft sections CX 6B and CX 6C specifically refer to a lease of a motor vehicle between an employer and an employee. But it is possible for the lease to be arranged, for example, between the employee and a person associated with the employer or between the employer and a person associated with the employee. The provisions should also encapsulate these alternative scenarios to reinforce their effectiveness. The Income Tax Act contains anti-avoidance provisions designed to capture associated person scenarios. However, a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust are currently not included in the general definition of “associated persons” that currently applies in the case of the FBT rules. This means that an obvious way to circumvent the proposed change that is being made to ensure that FBT applies to 9 to 5 and flip- flop leases is for the employee to transfer the vehicle to a trust under which the employee is a beneficiary. The lease agreement is then between the employer and the trust rather than between the employer and the employee. To rectify this problem officials suggest that the more comprehensive definition of “associated persons” in section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act should be used when the FBT rules are applied in the context of sections CX 6B and 6C. That definition specifically associates a trustee of a trust with a beneficiary of the trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Re-leased vehicles Clauses 121 and 148 Submission (10 – Financial Services Federation (FSF), 21W – Flexi Lease Limited, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 38W – Esanda Fleet Partners, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) That a lessee who leases a previously leased vehicle should be able to use, for the purposes of determining its cost price, its market value at the start of the new lease provided the lessee is not associated with the previous lessee. 71 Comment The submitters are concerned to ensure that the policy intent of aligning the treatment of leased vehicles with that of owned vehicles is achieved for re-leased vehicles. The general proposal for leased vehicles is that they must be valued for FBT purposes at either 20% of their cost price or 36% of their depreciated tax value. This is the same treatment as proposed for purchased vehicles. But the submitters are concerned that in the case of re-leased vehicles this change will bias decisions about whether to buy or lease an older vehicle in favour of buying. The Financial Services Federation has indicated that about 15 percent of its members’ leases involve vehicles that have previously been leased, although this percentage varies widely from member to member (Flexi Lease has indicated that around 90 percent of its business involves previously leased vehicles). The submitters’ concern arises partly from unclear wording in the draft legislation about what valuation options are available to a lessee of a previously leased vehicle (see later submission). But there is also concern because a purchaser can use the cost of the vehicle to them as the basis for their FBT calculations, which in normal circumstances would be the market price, whereas that option is not open to a lessee of a re-leased vehicle. A lessee of a re-leased vehicle must use either the lessor’s cost price or tax book value as the basis for their calculation. It is not the intention that a subsequent lessee be required to continue to use the valuation method chosen by an earlier lessee – they can, for example, use the tax value in the lessor’s books at the time of the new lease. Officials agree that the legislation should be clarified. Whether the changes favour purchasing over leasing in the case of older vehicles will depend on such factors as the age of the vehicle when it is re-leased and its market value relative to its depreciated value at that time. Given that the tax depreciation on motor vehicles can, given the 20% loading on the rate, exceed the reduction in market value, it is possible for the tax value method to produce a lower FBT liability even though that method requires a higher valuation rate to be used. The submitters suggest that the best solution is for lessees be able to use the market value of the vehicle at the time the re-lease begins. Provided the market value is independently derived, it would produce the same answer as if the lessee had purchased the vehicle. But, in the case of previously leased vehicles, this means retaining the current treatment which has been exploited to produce a lower FBT liability than the government intended. Many leases have been structured so that they become renewable each year. These are known as 1x1x1 leases and result in a new market value each year and a progressively lower FBT liability. The majority of leases are now on this basis, and hence the proposed change to remove the market value option. As a safeguard, the submitters have suggested a requirement that the market value could only be used when the two lessees are unassociated. Officials agree that this would stop the most blatant rollover of short-term leases. Conceivably this would still allow the rules to be circumvented – for example, by unassociated parties swapping vehicles or the use of structures such as trusts which are not included in the definition of “associated persons”. Some reliance would need to be placed on the Income Tax 72 Act’s anti-avoidance rules as a backstop for overturning such arrangements. These potential problems are not, however, confined to lease situations; they are also relevant for purchased vehicles. Recommendation That the submission be accepted so that the cost price for a re-leased vehicles would be its market value at the start of the lease, provided the lessee and any previous lessee (or owner) of the vehicle are not associated persons. Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) When calculating the value of the fringe benefit, the lease payments made by an employer to an employee should be taken into account, so that FBT is imposed on the value of the benefit only when it exceeds the amount of the lease payment. The submitter further suggests that the FBT liability be scaled back so that it covers only the part of the day that the vehicle is used for private purposes to more accurately reflect the private-use portion of the vehicle. Comment The submitter is concerned that under the current rules and in conjunction with the proposed amendment for 9 to 5 leases, FBT would potentially arise for every day that the vehicle is leased, irrespective of the amount of actual private use that occurs on any particular day. Officials do not agree with the submission as it ignores the fact that the business use of the vehicle does not generally impede the employee’s ability to use the vehicle for private use. In other words, the vehicle is available for private use by the employee when the employee needs to use it. The fact that the lessor (employee) is taxed on the lease payments they receive is irrelevant. An equivalent vehicle could have been leased from an independent party and the value of the fringe benefit in such a case would not be reduced. Officials have recommended that a legislative amendment be made for 9 to 5 and flip- flop leases that ensures that the full costs (both business and private) of operating the motor vehicle can be deducted. This deals with any potential over-taxation from applying FBT to these leases. Also, if the vehicle is not available for private use on a particular day, then FBT does not apply on that day. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 Issue: Treatment of leases already in operation Clause 148 Submission 1 (11W – Business New Zealand, 21W – Flexi Lease Limited) There should be a transition period for leases that have not completed their term, during which the old rules would apply until the leases expire. Comment The intended application date for the changes to the treatment of leases has been known from at least May this year and the possibility of change was first raised back in December 2003. This has given employers time to plan when entering into such leases. The lowering of the valuation rate from 24% to 20% helps to reduce some of the impact of the increased FBT liability. Given that many leases are technically renewed annually, being 1x1x1 leases, they would have at most a year to run when the legislative changes come into effect. This would mean that a transition period would in most cases be less than a year. In these circumstances officials cannot see any benefit from a compliance perspective from grandparenting the change. Rather, the request for a transition appears to be based on saving lessees from paying more FBT in the interim. The submission from Business New Zealand acknowledges this when it refers to the cost in the final year of a 1x1x1 lease being high-based on its cost or tax value rather than its market value. This is exactly the reason for the change. Flexi Lease suggests that without a transition the change would in effect be retrospective. This is not the case, as even though it would apply to some lease contracts entered into before 1 April 2006, it applies only to fringe benefits that arise in relation to those leased vehicles from 1 April 2006. It is commonplace for tax changes to impact in this way on arrangements entered into before the change is made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) With the likely timing of the enactment of this legislation, if the changes apply from 1 April 2006, this will penalise many with vehicle leases in place that are unable to be changed for the 2007 year. 74 Comment The reasons outlined in the comments on the preceding submission apply here too. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Valuation options Submission (38W – Esanda Fleet Partners) Clause 121 should be redrafted to make it clear that if the value of the benefit is calculated using the cost price of the vehicle in a return relating to that vehicle, this valuation method does not have to be used following disposal of the vehicle or when the vehicle ceases to be leased. (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Whether the second lessee has the ability to use the tax value method in a next-lease scenario when the original lessee chose to use the original cost method should be clarified. Comment The submissions are concerned that the changes to section ND 1A do not explicitly allow a new lessee to choose a valuation method for the vehicles that they are leasing and they may be locked into the valuation choices of an earlier lessee and governed in terms of switching between the two valuation methods as if they were the previous lessee. It is not the intention that a subsequent lessee should be required to continue to use the valuation method chosen by an earlier lessee – they can, for example, use the tax value in the lessor’s books at the time of the new lease. Officials agree that the legislation should be clarified. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and the legislation clarified to confirm that the lessee of a previously leased vehicle starts afresh when determining which valuation method they can use and their ability to switch between valuation options. 75 Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Lessors should not be required to disclose to lessees the cost price or book value of the vehicles being leased, but rather the valuation of motor vehicle benefits should be based on the market value of the vehicle. (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) That successive leases should be treated as one lease. Comment The Corporate Taxpayers Group is concerned that the provision in clause 148 that requires a lessor to disclose to a lessee the cost price or book value of the leased vehicles is unworkable and requires the disclosure of commercially sensitive information. Both submissions prefer to correct the problem of 1x1x1 leases by allowing lessees to continue to use market value but ensure that sets of leases are treated as one lease in the legislation. In the case of re-leased vehicles, where there is a distinct difference in the proposed treatments, officials are now recommending the use of market value to better align the two treatments. The change proposed by the submissions would not align the treatment of leased and owned vehicles as it would preclude lessees from using the tax value method. Officials sought feedback on the disclosure requirement from the Financial Services Federation as it represents the major lessors who would be affected by this change. The Federation’s response, after canvassing its members, was that while a vehicle’s cost price could be in theory regarded as commercially sensitive because it allows the lessor’s purchasing discount to be derived, “actual cost price” (being an accepted taxable value for FBT on a new vehicle) has been widely disclosed by lessors to lessees since the existing FBT rules were enacted. Consequently, they see little compromise to the existing situation from the proposal. Moreover, the alternative suggestion of using the market value at the start of the first lease entered into by the lessee could result in a higher FBT liability for lessees. This is because the market price charged to the general public could well be higher than the cost price for the lessor, given the lessor’s ability to often negotiate a discount on the market price. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 76 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clause 121 The new subsections ND 1A(1B)-(1E) are unclear and confusing and should be redrafted so their intention is clear and unequivocal. It is unclear from the wording of the provisions how they will apply to second-hand motor vehicles. Comment Officials agree that some drafting changes should be made to these provisions to clarify their intent, which is to set out the circumstances in which an employer can use the tax value and cost price options. For second-hand motor vehicles, the intent is that the new owner will not generally be bound by the valuation choices of any previous owner(s). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There appears to be a cross-referencing error in section ND 1A(1E). The references to subsection (1C) and (1D) should be (1D)(a) and (1D)(b) respectively. Comment This section is being revised to clarify its meaning. The reference is correct but the meaning has been lost. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 77 Submission (43W – Deloitte) Clause 148 The provision should be clarified to the effect that the tax value should be updated annually with the taxpayer having the option of doing the update as at either 31 March or the taxpayer’s balance date. Comment This is a technical change to clarify when the tax value is updated. The intent is that the tax value is the depreciated value, as determined under subpart EE of the Income Tax Act, at the beginning of the relevant period covered by the FBT return. Usually the depreciated value of an asset is adjusted under subpart EE annually, at the taxpayer’s balance date. This means, for example, that if a taxpayer has an annual balance date of 30 June and can file an annual FBT return for the period 1 July 2005– 30 June 2006, then the tax value of the vehicle will be the value as at 1 July 2005, or as at the date of purchase if the vehicle is purchased after that date but before 30 June 2006. If the same taxpayer has to file an FBT return for the year to 31 March, then for the year to 31 March 2007, the tax value would also be the depreciated value as at 1 July 2006. If the same taxpayer with a 30 June balance date pays FBT quarterly then the value of the vehicle would be different for the September FBT return compared with the June return. Currently the draft legislation refers only to “the value ...as determined under subpart EE”, which could be interpreted as the value at either the beginning or at the end of the reporting period. While officials agree with the submitter that it needs to be clarified that the update is done annually, we do not agree that taxpayers should have the option of doing the update as at 31 March or their balance date. Rather, it should be related to their FBT- return period (whether annual or quarterly). This approach limits compliance costs and is, in practice, likely to have the same outcome suggested by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be partly accepted and agree that the tax value be the depreciated value as determined under subpart EE of the Income Tax Act, at the beginning of the relevant period covered by the FBT return or at the time of purchase of the vehicle if the vehicle is acquired during the FBT-return period. 78 Submission (1W – H P Hanna & Co Ltd) Clause 121 For vehicles owned before 1 April 2006, employers should not have to wait five years before they can switch to the tax value option. Comment The policy intent is that the valuation rules should apply equally to all vehicles irrespective of whether they were acquired before on or after 1 April 2006. This means for a vehicle that is in an employer’s books on 31 March 2006, that the employer can switch to the tax value method if the vehicle has already been in the employer’s books for five years. To allow employers to switch earlier than that would enable them to reduce the amount of FBT that they pay over the first five years relative to what they would have paid had the tax value option (as well as the cost price option) been available when they acquired the vehicle. It is not consistent with the policy intent that the employer should be in a neutral position under either option after the first five years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (47 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the taxpayer chooses the option to use the adjusted tax value rather than cost, and if the vehicle is sold or destroyed within five years, the taxpayer should be allowed to adjust FBT to what they would have paid if they had used the 20% rate, if the FBT paid exceeds that under the cost option. Comment Officials consider that the submitter’s suggestion would add unnecessary complexity to what are already complex rules. Furthermore, officials do not expect many new vehicles to be valued under the tax value method as this would result in the payment of more FBT in the early years of ownership. The submitter is particularly concerned about the treatment of vehicles that are disposed of after, for example, being written off in an accident. If a vehicle is written off, the insurance company usually funds a replacement with a vehicle of comparable value. This means that the employer has the choice, from an FBT perspective, of using the cost price or tax value of the new vehicle at that point. The employer will be either better off or neutral relative to the vehicle not having been written off as the cost price will be lower and should be around the same value as the tax book value of the written-off vehicle. Hence there should be no over-taxation. Similarly, if a taxpayer self-insures (does not have motor vehicle insurance) and purchases a 79 replacement vehicle, the employer again has the choice of using both valuation options. If the vehicle has to be sold, say after two years because the business is downsizing, then this is a normal business risk and no ex-post adjustment should be provided. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (47 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amount of $8,333 in clause 8 of Schedule 2, Part A, be deleted. Comment The submitter expresses concern that the $8,333 minimum value that applies in the tax value method will result in over-taxation. This threshold equates to $3,000 of benefits, which covers the average on-going savings that employees make each year from having an employer-provided vehicle, irrespective of the vehicle’s value. It is therefore appropriate to have this minimum value. The savings represented by this amount cover warranting, registration, insurance and running costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (20 – New Zealand Retailers Association) The principle of having the option between book value or the cost for motor vehicles is sound but the rates proposal does not produce the desired outcome. (11W – Business New Zealand) That the 36% rate should be lowered. Comment The submitters noted that the book value approach results in more FBT being paid over the first four to five years of the life of the vehicle and it is not until the life of the asset goes beyond this timeframe that some savings accrue. As many companies have a policy of turning vehicles over every three years, the submitter considers that the book value approach offers no benefit. The New Zealand Retailers Association suggests the risk is that FBT could become a driver for having a fleet with a higher average age. 80 It was not the intention that the tax value option should provide a lower FBT impost over that period relative to the cost price option. This outcome was acknowledged by the McCaw Committee when they developed their methodology for valuing a motor vehicle fringe benefit in the early 1980s. Officials consider that methodology to still be valid. As a result, officials anticipate the tax value method to be mainly of benefit to those employers who have owned a vehicle for more than five years. Officials consider that the practice of employers’ retaining vehicles for just three years is not necessarily relevant as the book value calculations are trying to measure the benefit to the employee. Our calculation is driven by the Automobile Association’s published figures on motoring costs, which are based on the first five years of ownership because the costs are reasonably predictable over that time. Submissions suggest that individuals tend to hold vehicles bought new for longer than businesses would as businesses often hold a vehicle just for the three-year warranty period. However, for the reasons given we therefore consider that there is insufficient reason to change the basis on which the book value rate is calculated. This is the same methodology adopted by the McCaw Committee when they were considering how to value motor vehicle fringe benefits. If the calculations were based on three years rather than five years, then the rate used under the cost price option would rise from the proposed 20% to 22%. 10 The tax book value rate that produces the same FBT payment at the end of the three-year period would be around 32%. Consequently, if most employers continue to use the cost price option, as we suspect will be the case, they will pay more FBT if a three-year basis is adopted because the rate will be higher. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) If an employee reimburses their employer for the private use of the employee’s motor vehicle at the same mileage rate (62c a kilometre) that the employer would have reimbursed the employee for business use of the employee’s motor vehicle, then the taxable value of the fringe benefit provided should be nil. Comment Fringe benefit tax focuses on the benefit that the employee is likely to receive rather than the costs that the employer incurs in providing the benefit. Consequently, the fringe benefit received from a motor vehicle takes into account the private benefit that an employee gets from avoiding having to incur the fixed costs (known as the benefits from availability for private use) as well as the running costs, such as fuel, arising from the actual use of the vehicle. This benefit can be offset by the employee paying the employer a lump sum which includes this availability benefit. 10 The reason for the increased rate is that the depreciated value of the vehicle in year 1 rather than in year 2 (being the mid-point of three years rather than five years) is used when calculating the average interest and depreciation charges. This means that the fixed costs represent a higher proportion of the cost price. 81 In contrast, the submitter’s suggested approach, which involves the employee reimbursing the employer a fixed amount for each kilometre of private travel, would make reimbursement of fixed costs very much dependent on the actual amount of private motoring undertaken. If there were little private use of the vehicle then there would be little reimbursement of the fixed costs and hence the fringe benefit would be significantly understated. Depending on the per kilometre reimbursement rate and the type of vehicle used, the employee might have to do around 50,000kms per annum before fixed costs were covered, which would be far more than the average annual private motoring (14,000kms) assumed by the Automobile Association. A per kilometre charge would therefore be a very poorly targeted method for reimbursing the value of the benefit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Work-related vehicles Submission 1 (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The work-related vehicle exemption should be reviewed as a matter of priority. Submission 2 (37W – Toovey Eaton & MacDonald Ltd) A legislative discretion should be provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to waive the logo requirement for work-related vehicles in certain circumstances. Comment Currently, most cars that are provided to employees are subject to FBT even if the cars are only available for very limited private use. In contrast, work-related vehicles such as trucks and utilities are exempt from FBT provided private use is restricted to home-to-work travel and the vehicle has the employer’s identifier (logo) attached. Officials recognise that this distinction, which was set 20 years ago doesn’t necessary reflect businesses’ current vehicle needs, can distort business decisions, and result in over-taxation in some cases. The government discussion document, Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, explored a number of options to deal with this problem, including an option to replace the work-related vehicle exemption with a wider category on which FBT would be charged at a low rate. Entry into this category would not be based on the appearance of vehicles as it is currently, but rather on the primary use to which they are put. Private use would still be restricted to home-to-work travel. 82 The government announced in April 2005 that it would not change the boundary for vehicles used for both business and private purposes at this stage. It was noted that the overwhelming view of submissions favoured the most fiscally expensive option – that is, to retain the exemption for work-related vehicles but also halve the FBT rate on other vehicles used primarily for work purposes. The government considered that given the high fiscal cost of this option further consultation should be undertaken. But in recognition of this being a major area of concern for submitters, the government instructed officials to undertake further policy work in the future to achieve the best balance between the appropriate recognition of the business use of a vehicle and the need to tax the private benefit element. Submission 1 The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants was disappointed that the submissions they made on work-related vehicles in the earlier stages of policy development have not been reflected in the bill. Those submissions proposed a broadening of the range of vehicles that would be exempt from FBT. This would be achieved through widening the work-related vehicle category so that it focussed on the use to which the vehicles were put rather than the type of vehicle. Officials agree that further work should be undertaken on the issue and will report to the government accordingly. Submission 2 A specific proposal explored in the discussion document involved allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to waive the logo requirement when the employer could demonstrate that it would seriously compromise the nature of their business. Officials view an Inland Revenue discretion over the work-related vehicles logo requirement as being inappropriate at this time for two reasons. First, it would be a piecemeal change that softens the boundary between work-related and other employer-provided vehicles. In the context of the further policy work that may be done in this area in the future, such a change may itself be subject to further change. Secondly, there are sound policy arguments against the use of discretions. The primary one is the potential for inconsistency when exercising the discretion, even with the development of guidelines. This could result in unfair outcomes for some taxpayers. Recommendation That submission 1 be noted. That submission 2 be declined. 83 APPLICATION OF GST TO FBT Submission (1W – H P Hanna & Co Ltd) GST should not be applied to FBT. Comment The submitter suggests that adding GST to the value of a fringe benefit is unreasonable and should be abolished as it is really a tax on a tax, and notes that the value of a fringe benefit is already calculated on the cost of the car inclusive of GST. The reason for using the GST-inclusive cost of the car as the basis for calculating the benefit is that this is the price the employee would normally pay if they had to purchase the vehicle. Basing the value of the benefit on what the employee would normally pay is a reasonable approach to its worth to the employee. The justification for applying GST to the taxable value of the fringe benefit is that the employer, by providing the employee with a private benefit, is in effect making a taxable supply to a final consumer. The way the GST system works is that GST is ultimately paid by the private/final consumer. This means that the employer can claim a GST input tax credit against the GST paid on the car (and on running costs), and GST output tax is subsequently paid when a taxable supply is made by the employer. Taxable supplies can take many forms, including fringe benefits supplied to employees and products supplied to the public. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 84 START OF FBT DAY Clause 122 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement to make an election in clause 122 for private use of a motor vehicle for a 24-hour period should be removed. Comment FBT is charged on a daily basis, with any private use or availability for private use in a day incurring one day’s worth of FBT. Currently the FBT day starts from midnight. This can be a problem if a vehicle is taken home only periodically because even though the vehicle may be taken home in the evening and returned the next morning (within 24 hours) two days’ worth of FBT is due. To overcome this over-taxation, an employer will be able to elect a start-time for their FBT day other than midnight. The election will last for a minimum of two years and apply to all of the employer’s vehicles. Employers will be required to notify Inland Revenue if they make an election. The reason for requiring notification is that it serves as a useful check that a decision has been made and when it was made. There are a number of similar election requirements already in the Income Tax Act. The submitter considers that this new election requirement is cumbersome and could penalise those who neglect to make it. The submitter would prefer a general 24-hour test. Officials do not agree that the election is cumbersome. Once a decision to make a change has been made, the employer simply indicates their choice with the FBT return first affected by the change. If an employer neglects to advise Inland Revenue of their election, then the default situation applies – in other words, their FBT continues to start from midnight. Our expectation is that most employers will continue with the default option and will therefore not need to provide notification. The new option and the associated notification requirement will be well advertised. The submitter’s suggestion of a general 24-hour test would be unworkable as it would provide no firm basis on which to calculate the benefit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Rather than making a written election, an election should be treated as being made by filing the FBT return or by simply noting in the taxpayer’s records – for example, in their logbook, when the 24-hour period begins. Comment As noted earlier, the reason for requiring notification is that it serves as a useful check that a decision has been made and when it was made. If the taxpayer simply notes it in their records, this would provide less of an independent check from an auditing perspective. Likewise, the suggestion that an election is treated as being made by simply filing the FBT return provides no indication of the employer’s decision and would give rise to confusion for those employers who decide to continue with the default option. However, officials do suggest a small change be made to clause 122. New section ND 1AB requires that the notice of election be given in the first FBT return to which it applies. Officials have been advised that this would require modifying the FBT return as well as other systems changes to capture the extra piece of data provided on the return. This process can be streamlined by allowing the election to be made with the return. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that a minor technical change be made to clause 122 to enable the election to be made with the return rather than in the first FBT return to which it first applies. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) Subsection ND 1AB(3)(a) should be redrafted so that it refers to a person choosing an hour as the start point of the day. Comment The submitter is concerned that the wording “choose an hour in the 24-hour period starting at midnight as the starting point of the day” is too confusing and should be simplified. Officials agree that the relevant wording can be made clearer and recommend an appropriate alteration to the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 86 INCOME PROTECTION INSURANCE Clauses 15, 16, 26 and 40 Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 43W – Deloitte, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Income protection insurance premiums paid by employers on behalf of their employees should be exempt from FBT rather than employees getting income tax deductions for the premiums paid by their employers. Comment The proposed legislation allows employees to claim a deduction against their income for income protection insurance premiums paid by their employer on their behalf. The draft legislation also includes a consequential change to specifically include the amounts derived under a policy of income protection insurance as income of the employee rather than leaving it to be considered as income under ordinary concepts. The purpose of these changes is to put the employee in the same position as they would have been had their employer paid them a cash amount and the employee had then paid the premium directly. This is not the case currently. Employees who pay the premium directly can be eligible for a deduction for the premium paid, to the extent that any payout on the policy would be taxable income, but employees do not receive a deduction when the employer pays the premium on their behalf. The 2003 discussion document, Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, proposed that the premium be exempt from FBT, as recommended by the submitters, but on further analysis officials concluded that this did not produce a neutral outcome in all situations relative to the employer paying the employee the equivalent amount in salary and the employee then paying the premium themselves. This means that in some situations employers pay more FBT and in other cases less FBT than they theoretically ought to, although we acknowledge the differences are relatively small. On the other hand, there are more compliance costs associated with providing employees with a deduction as the employer has to include the relevant premium amounts in their FBT return and notify the employee of how much it has paid on their behalf, and the employee then has to claim the deduction. In some cases this may mean employees have to file a tax return when they currently have no need to do so, and having two parties make adjustments increases the chance of errors. With an FBT exemption, the employer simply does not include the premium amount as a benefit in their FBT return, and the employee does nothing. The submitters are clearly of the view that the extra compliance costs outweigh any accuracy benefits from the deduction approach. They also indicate that there is potentially a significant number of employees who could be eligible to claim deductions. Officials understand that income protection insurance is now commonplace for professional firms such as accountants. The Investment Savings & Insurance Association estimated that there were around 300,000 income protection insurance policies as at 31 March 2005. If the premiums on just 10 percent of these 87 policies were paid by the employer, it would mean that 30,000 employees would be eligible to claim deductions, which would involve significant compliance and administrative costs. In these circumstances we agree that providing an FBT exemption would be preferable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) New section CX 15B should be redrafted to state that a fringe benefit arises when an employer pays or contributes to the payment of a premium for income protection insurance for the benefit of the employee. Comment As section CX 15B is currently drafted, a fringe benefit arises when an employer has a liability to pay or contribute to the payment of a premium for income protection insurance for the benefit of an employee. This reference to an employer liability is deliberate to ensure that there is no overlap with the employment provisions of the Income Tax Act. Take, for example, the situation where an employee takes out income protection insurance but their employer pays the premium on their behalf. In this case, the liability to pay remains with the employee and it is our understanding that the payment would be treated as employment income under section CE 1(b) – expenditure on account of an employee that is expenditure on account of the person. This income is then included in the employee’s income. Therefore, adopting the change suggested by the submitter would lead to confusion in these cases as potentially both the employer and the employee would face a tax impost on the same amount, one under the FBT rules, the other under the employment rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 88 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) With regard to the previous NZICA proposal that income protection insurance premiums paid by employers on behalf of the employee should be excluded from FBT, income protection insurance premiums should also be excluded from the definition of expenditure on account of an employee. Comment Officials do not agree with this submission for, as noted earlier, the crucial test of whether an item falls within the employment income provisions or the FBT provisions rests on who has the liability to pay. Given that the FBT exemption will not apply to all situations when an employer pays the premium on the employee’s behalf, a blanket exclusion from the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” is inappropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Non-filing taxpayers should be entitled to claim the proposed deduction in relation to income protection insurance premiums by way of a separate claim form similar to the donations rebate claim form. Alternatively, the deduction entitlement could be allocated to the employee via the PAYE system. Comment This submission is aimed at reducing compliance costs for those employees that no longer have to file income tax returns. We recommended acceptance of the solution suggested in an earlier submission that the premium should be exempted from FBT rather than the employee receiving a deduction. This would make the change suggested by this submitter unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 OTHERWISE DEDUCTIBLE RULE Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) An “otherwise deductible” rule similar to that in Australia should be adopted. Comment This rule would exempt from FBT expenditure by the employer on behalf of the employee if the employee would have been entitled to a tax deduction if they had incurred the expenditure themselves. The submitter sees this approach as a generic solution to concerns such as the treatment of employer-paid income protection insurance premiums. An “otherwise deductible” rule was considered as part of the review of fringe benefit tax. The concern had also been previously considered by officials in 1994–95 in the context of employee share loan benefits. At that stage it was rejected, largely on compliance cost grounds, in favour of a specific exemption from FBT for low interest loans provided by employers to enable employees to purchase shares in the employer company. Officials consider that there are no new grounds for introducing an “otherwise deductible” rule. The compliance burdens would still be present with a general rule. These compliance costs arise because of the potentially very wide nature of such a rule. Not only would it cover, for example, employer-paid income protection insurance premiums, but it could also potentially exempt from FBT any employer- provided low-interest loans that were made to employees to acquire any income- earning asset. This is on the grounds that the funds from the loan are used in the production of gross income and the employee would, had they paid interest on the loan, be entitled to deduct that interest. Because of this potentially wide nature, there needs to be clear confirmation that the benefits are associated with income earning activities. In Australia, where such a rule exists, the employer has to obtain a declaration from employees stating the percentage to which the benefit has been used for income- producing purposes, to qualify for the FBT exemption. This results in significant compliance costs for both employers and employees. Furthermore, the definition of what an income earning asset is may change from situation to situation. The Australian Tax Office has also found that the rule has produced additional administrative costs, mainly through increased auditing of both employers and employees. In contrast, specific limited exclusions or deductions suffer less from these problems. For example, in the case of low-interest loans in respect of employee share loan benefits, the employer would hold the substantiating documentation relating to the loan and the employee share purchase, making verification relatively easy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 90 CHARITIES PROVIDING SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES Clauses 31 and 124 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 31, which deals with benefits provided by charities, requires some further guidelines. Comment Clause 31 limits, in certain circumstances, the current exemption that charities have from FBT. Those circumstances are when a charity provides credit cards and other short-term credit facilities to an employee and the value of the benefit from those facilities for the employee in an income year exceeds 5% of the employee’s salary or wages for that income year. The value of the benefit, as set out in new section ND 1IB, is essentially the amount that the charity pays towards the purchase or hire of the goods or services obtained by the employee under the short-term credit facility, plus any interest and account fees incurred. The submitter is seeking further clarity on when the benefits should be included in FBT returns. The intention is that the benefits should be included in FBT returns as and when they are provided. As the benefits are cumulative, this means that once the 5% threshold is exceeded in the year, the benefits must be included in the charity’s FBT return at that stage. If further benefits are provided in the next quarter and the charity has to file quarterly FBT returns, then those additional benefits must also be included in the next quarter’s FBT return, and so forth. Officials agree that the legislation could provide more guidance on this timing aspect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed limitation to the charities’ exemption from FBT needs to include debit cards. Comment The limitation focuses on short-term credit facilities, but this term is something of a misnomer as there are also debit cards which would provide employees with a similar ability to charge day-to-day items to an account that the employer would be liable to pay. To ensure that the limitation cannot be readily circumvented through switching to these debit card-type arrangements, officials recommend a minor wording change so that the limitation also applies to them. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 91 APPLICATION OF GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULE TO FBT Clause 81 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The anti-avoidance provision in clause 81 is not required. Comment The change in clause 81, to enable the Income Tax Act’s general anti-avoidance rule to be applied to FBT, is being made to correct a technical anomaly. The submitter is concerned that this change has not been thought through and may have unintended consequences. Officials see no reason for the change not proceeding. While FBT has its own anti- avoidance rules, unlike many other specific anti-avoidance rules elsewhere in the Act, it is not bolstered by the Act’s general anti-avoidance rule (which enables a tax avoidance arrangement to be voided and any associated tax advantage to be counteracted). The benefit of the change is that it would increase the chances that an arrangement that survived a specific anti-avoidance rule on a technicality would be nevertheless caught as avoidance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 FRINGE BENEFIT FILING Submission (16W – Small Business Advisory Group) With respect to motor vehicle fringe benefits, employers should have the option of including the FBT calculation directly into their annual tax return so that it is included in provisional tax calculations, as an alternative to filing separate FBT returns. Comment The Small Business Advisory Group (SBAG) approach is designed to reduce compliance costs by removing the need to file quarterly FBT returns. Return filing is considered more costly for small businesses because they need to use accounting firms to complete the returns when they do not have their own in-house accounting resources. The SBAG submission raises several practical and conceptual concerns: • It covers only motor vehicle fringe benefits so that employers providing non- vehicle benefits would still need to complete FBT returns and pay FBT. SBAG’s response is that the FBT return data suggests that only about 25 percent of returns showing an FBT liability have non-vehicle benefits so that 75 percent (some 16,500 businesses) have only motor vehicle benefits and could therefore save having to file an FBT return under its proposed approach. • Employers would also still need to keep adequate records and calculate the value of the benefit over the reporting period – for example, to deduct any days on which the motor vehicle benefit was not provided. SBAG has suggested that a test period could be used to establish when a vehicle is not available for private use. This facility is already available so the recommendation does not appear to lower compliance costs. • It is not clear whether the end-of-year calculation of actual benefits envisaged by SBAG would take account of employees’ individual marginal tax rates as currently occurs under the multi-rate square-up calculation. Applying a single tax rate to vehicle benefits would have equity as well as revenue implications, with some employers over-paying tax and others under-paying. On average it would likely result in an underpayment, particularly if employers can choose which approach they use. • It would further muddy perceptions about why tax is paid on fringe benefits. FBT is, in effect, a tax on employees in relation to the non-cash remuneration they receive, but for compliance cost reasons this is collected by way of a final withholding tax paid by employers. Including the payment in employers’ tax returns would give the impression that it is a direct tax on employers. If the return had to be amalgamated, it would be better conceptually to include it in the PAYE return/employer monthly schedules. 93 • The SBAG focus is on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), but ideally any scheme should be open to any employer unless it can be demonstrated that SMEs face higher relative compliance costs. Also there is no universal definition of a SME. • There would be cashflow implications from the SBAG recommendation: – It would result in some deferral of tax payments because provisional tax would be paid either twice or three times a year, whereas currently many taxpayers are paying FBT every quarter. – Entities making losses or who have accumulated losses against which to offset profits would also get a deferral of tax payments. – More generally, it would add to the bunching of tax liabilities so that some employers would ultimately pay GST, plus their standard provisional tax, plus the FBT add-on all at the same time – causing some employers cash- flow difficulties. These arguments suggest that it is not clear that the compliance savings from the SBAG recommendation outweigh the various costs. Officials’ preferred approach Officials have looked at alternative ways of addressing SBAG’s underlying concerns. The aim of reducing the number of interfaces between employers and Inland Revenue can be driven by not only compliance cost concerns, but also by concerns about getting calculations wrong or making errors on the return. On-line calculator The on-line calculator put forward in the 2003 discussion document was aimed at alleviating such concerns through Inland Revenue providing a calculator that would accumulate fringe benefit data from the quarterly returns and undertake the end-of- year multi-rate calculation. This option is still being explored. Raising the threshold for paying FBT annually Another way to alleviate SME concerns would be to allow more employers to file FBT returns just once a year. Currently employers whose deductions of PAYE and specified superannuation contributions withholding tax (SSCWT) do not exceed $100,000 can file just one FBT return a year. Raising this threshold to $250,000 or even $500,000 should produce compliance cost savings at least comparable to those from the SBAG proposal for up to 10,000 employers and 12,000 employers respectively, without the drawbacks associated with the SBAG proposal. 11 Even better, advertising of the current limit would produce compliance savings as there appears to be confusion about it – for example, some assume that it is $100,000 of wage payments rather than the tax on those payments. 11 These numbers include approximately 7,000 employers who currently file quarterly FBT returns even though their PAYE and SSCWT payments do not exceed $100,000. 94 Given that any change in this area would require advance notice, it should be consulted on with the aim of introducing it in a later tax bill. The measure would need to give taxpayers time to consider the changes and to file elections if they wished to change from quarterly, to once a year filing. Inland Revenue would also need more time to allocate resources to publicising and processing the change. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the Committee note that officials are exploring other ways of further reducing FBT-related compliance costs for small businesses, in particular: • the option of significantly raising the threshold for annual filing; and • the feasibility of an on-line calculator. 95 CAR PARKS No clause Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 11W – Business New Zealand, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) All car parks should be exempt from FBT. Comment Although submissions generally welcomed the government’s decision not to bring all employer-provided car parks into the FBT net, three submissions preferred that all car parks be exempt from FBT. Currently, car parks provided to employees on an employer’s premises are exempt from FBT through the general exemption of benefits provided on an employer’s premises. This extends to leased car parks because a lease is legally treated as an interest in land. A leased car park may, however, be far removed from the physical premises of the employer. In contrast, licensed car parks are subject to FBT if provided to an employee, even though they may be right alongside the leased parks. The Corporate Taxpayers Group submitted that the FBT boundary between leased and licensed car parks is arbitrary and unnecessary and that the tax treatment should be the same regardless of whether a car park is leased or licensed. The submission further argued that most car parks provided to employees are not in substitution of wages that would otherwise be payable, so all car parks should be exempt. NZICA’s proposed solution to the leased/licensed boundary was that employer- provided car parks should be deemed to be part of the employer’s premises. Business New Zealand submitted that car parks are “a necessary condition of employment and are in some instances a health and safety obligation”. The discussion document, Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, included a proposal that employer-provided car parks should generally be subject to FBT on the basis that car parks have economic benefit to employees by saving them from having to pay for a car park themselves. However, submissions on the discussion document highlighted concerns about how the proposal would work in practice. These concerns were also expressed in subsequent consultations with interested parties. The government then considered three options: • making all employer-provided car parks subject to FBT; • making all employer-provided car parks exempt from FBT; • making no changes to the current FBT treatment of employer-provided car parks. 96 The government decided to make no change to the FBT treatment of car parks. Officials do not believe there are any arguments in the submissions that have not been previously considered by the government, and would therefore warrant the government reconsidering its decision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 97 TRANSPORT BENEFITS No clause Issue: Subsidised transport provided by group companies Submission (27W – Air New Zealand, 33W – KPMG, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “subsidised transport” should be amended to include an employer who is a member of a group of companies that contains a person in the business of providing public transport. Comment FBT on the provision of subsidised transport to an employee by an employer who is in the business of providing such transport is limited to 25% of the highest fare for that travel. However, if the transport provider offers subsidised travel to an employee of another company that is in the same group, full FBT applies because the other company is not in the business of providing transport. The general “on-premises” exemption in section CX 20 is being extended by clause 29 of this bill to include the premises of other companies in the same group of companies who share 66 percent or greater common ownership with the employer company. This change recognises that entities within a group may operate more like a single economic entity. For example, an employee can be employed by one member company, but receive a benefit on the premises of another member company while on a secondment. This benefit would currently be subject to FBT, but for the changes made by clause 29. The submissions argue that the principle behind the extension of the on-premises exemption should be applied to subsidised transport. That is, the business structure chosen by a business should not affect the FBT outcome. Officials agree the approach taken in extending the on-premises exemption should be also applied to subsidised transport. Officials note that the 25% valuation rate may be outdated and further work should be done to review it, taking into account the range of discounted fares now available to the public, and the number of transport options to which the rate applies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 Issue: Transport benefits provided instead of allowances Clause 27 Submission 1 (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 27 should be extended to allow the cost of visits of the whole family in certain circumstances. Comment If an employer pays for an out of town employee to return home to visit his or her family, this payment may currently be exempt from FBT. This is on the basis that the payment removes a need to pay the employee a reimbursement allowance for additional travel costs the employee incurs because of a temporary change in the employee’s place of work. For example, the employee may have been seconded overseas. If the employer incurs the cost of a family member visiting the employee instead, the FBT outcome should arguably be the same and the benefit should be exempt. Accordingly, new section CX 17(2) provides that a benefit that an employer provides to an employee is not a fringe benefit if it is an allowance that: • is in substitution for an allowance that reimburses the employee for certain transport costs; and • is brought about because the employee has a temporary change in their place of work while in the same employment; and • reimburses the employee for transport costs that would have been incurred relating to travel by the employee’s spouse or partner or relative for the purpose of visiting the employee in the temporary place of work. NZICA submits that the proposal should be extended to allow the cost of visits of the whole family to be exempt from FBT in certain circumstances: “This area has huge shades of grey and requires wider considerations than just looking at the spouse. For example, there would be some circumstances where it would be appropriate for the spouse/partner and children to be transported to the temporary place of work, and these should be included in the exemption, provided that the cost does not exceed that which would be incurred in transporting the employee home.” Officials agree with this approach. It is not intended that only one family member should be allowed to travel under this exemption. Rather, the constraint is on the value of the travel not exceeding that which would be incurred in transporting the employee home. A minor modification to section CX 17(2) is suggested to put this beyond doubt. 99 Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. Submission 2 (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The word “partner” used in new section CX 17(2)(c) should be clarified. Comment PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that new section CX 17(2)(c) should be consistent with changes made to the Income Tax Act 2004 by the Income Tax Amendment Act 2005. The amending act enacted the changes in terminology introduced in the Relationship (Statutory References) Bill bringing into effect, as from 26 April 2005, the concept of civil union partners and, from 1 April 2007, the concept of de facto partners. The use of the word “partner” in section CX 17(2)(c) is intended to include civil union and de facto partners to broaden its application beyond spouses and relatives. Given this intention, officials agree with the submission that the word “partner” in new section 17(2)(c) should specifically incorporate both these relationships. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Goods provided at discount by third parties Clause 32 Submission 1 (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement that a group of employees being offered a discount by a third party must be comparable in size to another group of persons also being offered the discount to be exempt from FBT is unnecessary and unduly restrictive. Comment Normally, if an employer arranges for a third party to provide their employees with a benefit, such as a discount, the employer is regarded as having provided the benefits and FBT applies. 100 However, the government has agreed that FBT should not apply to benefits that arise when an employer has secured a bulk discount for its staff from a third party merely because they represent a significant group. If the discount were available to the employees as members of some other group unrelated to their employment, it would be difficult to consider the discount a fringe benefit. The key element to the proposed change in new section CX 27B is therefore whether the group of employees would otherwise be able to get the discount for some other reason unrelated to employment. If so, the third party discounter must be offering the discount to other groups as well. To qualify for the exemption the other group of persons has to be comparable in size to the group of employees. The submission views this requirement as making the concession “unduly restrictive” and that the requirement of comparability imports an unnecessary element of subjectivity. However, officials believe that the majority of discounts offered by third parties will be on the basis of a group’s size and that size is most likely to influence the availability and extent of the discount. The submission supports this view by stating that “the likelihood of the discount offeror also offering the discount to a group comparable in size to the group of employees would be high...” The use of the phrase “comparable in size” is a deliberate measure to broaden the scope of the exception beyond what it would be if the words “a group of the same size” were used. Bona fide discounts provided by third parties to a group of employees based on the group’s size should easily meet this requirement. Furthermore, the requirement also serves to ensure that the discount is genuinely provided to others in that it cannot be provided to just one or two other people. This is reinforced by the further requirement that the discount offered to the other group must have been negotiated on an arms-length basis. For the above reasons officials do not agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (47 – New Zealand Law Society) That the phrase “comparable in size to the group of employees” should be changed to “comparable in number to the group of employees”. Comment Officials consider that “size” in the context in which it is used only meaningfully means the number of employees but nevertheless recommend making the suggested change to put the matter beyond doubt. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LOANS Issue: Exemption for short-term advances Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A minimum threshold of $5,000 when an employer provides a loan to an employee should be introduced under section CX 9. Comment The FBT review has strived to remove compliance costs in situations when those costs exceed the small value of the fringe benefits involved. The issue raised by NZICA is such a case, and it is reasonable to try to resolve this issue. A key requirement of any solution, however, is that it should not provide a loophole for widespread avoidance of FBT on loans. The current definition of “loan” used in the FBT rules has been set deliberately wide for this reason. This issue was originally raised with officials in the context of short-term advances against salary and wages. It is not uncommon for employers to provide low/nil interest advances against salary and wages on a temporary basis to assist employees to meet short-term commitments. Currently these advances would be subject to FBT but the compliance costs can be high compared with the size of the fringe benefit and associated FBT involved. Likewise, the administrative cost associated with charging interest on such advances is high relative to the amount of interest involved if an employer were to charge a market interest rate to avoid FBT. In this context officials considered whether the benefits from loans made as advances against salary and wages could be exempt from FBT in particular circumstances, such as when provided in emergency situations. This immediately raised the question of defining what qualifies as a financial emergency. It would seem to require something unexpected which could be purely financially related or caused by an unforseen event. This concept is used in section 177A of the Tax Administration Act, which allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to waive a tax liability in cases of serious hardship, such as arises from the taxpayer being unable to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards, or the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury. These criteria are likely, however, to cover a far narrower set of circumstances than used by employers when providing short-term cash advances to employees against future salary. Also, there is still a degree of subjectivity inherent in these criteria so that clear guidelines would need to be provided to reduce wide interpretations being taken by employers. This then brings into question whether there are compliance savings from taking this approach. Officials also considered the alternative approach of applying a cap to the amount exempted, as suggested by the submitter. This would involve setting a minimum value threshold before FBT applied, similar to that already applying to unclassified benefits. Given that the aim of the exemption would be to exclude small benefits that create disproportionate compliance costs, it would focus on benefits that are more 102 likely to arise in the case of one-off or intermittent short-term loans. This would suggest that the threshold should be set quite low, particularly as it covers only one type of benefit compared with the unclassified benefits threshold which potentially covers a wide range of miscellaneous benefits. The simplest cap would be to exempt loan benefits for advances up to a certain amount per employee rather than express the cap in terms of the value of fringe benefits as this would require the benefit to be calculated. Therefore, officials consider that a realistic threshold is $2,000 rather than the $5,000 suggested by the submitter. If a $2,000 loan were to run for a full year it would, based on a prescribed rate of interest of around 9%, equate to benefits of around $180 per annum. 12 We also consider that it should only apply to loans made as advances against salary or wages that, to avoid widespread advantage being taken of the threshold, were not part of the employment package. Loans secured against real property, for example, would be likely to involve substantially larger amounts and even when the balance of those loans falls below $2,000, employers will generally have systems already established to account for them. $2,000 equates to around 2 to 3 weeks’ after-tax pay for workers on the average wage. This would mean that provided the total amount advanced to an employee against their salary and wages does not exceed $2,000 it would be excluded from being a fringe benefit in terms of section CX 9 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Recommendations That the concept of a minimum value threshold for employer-provided loans be agreed, but that the $5,000 threshold proposed by the submitter be declined, and instead the threshold be set to exempt fringe benefits that arise from advances against salary and wages when the aggregate amount advanced to an employee does not exceed $2,000 and the advance is not part of an employment package. Issue: Ability to use market rate Clause 123 Submission 1 (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As currently drafted, section ND 1D(4) restricts the market interest option to employers that are financial institutions. The option should also be available to other employers. To correct this, the word “means” should be replaced by “includes”. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 12 If, however, the alternative was that the employer had to use a credit card then the benefit would be double this as the interest rate on credit card advances is generally around 20%. 103 Submission 2 Subsections ND 1D(4)(a),(b) and (c) are unnecessary, unduly restrictive and should be deleted. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Submission 1 New section ND 1D allows employers the option of using market interest rates rather than the prescribed interest rates when determining the fringe benefit value of an employment-related loan. Officials agree that the provision as drafted effectively confines its application to situations where the employer offers loans in the ordinary course of business. This is because in practice it is financial institutions who would want to use this option. Other employers are likely to find the compliance costs associated with the option too great to be worthwhile. This is because market interest rates can vary over a quarter and unless the rate being charged employees is kept up-to-date it would be easy for an employer to unwittingly incur an FBT liability, subjecting them to possible penalties. Monitoring market movements is relatively easy for someone in the business of lending but far more difficult for those who are not. Hence, officials do not agree with the submission that the option should be available to any employer. In fact we recommend that it be made more explicit that the employer must be lending more widely than just to employees to qualify for the option. Submission 2 Officials do not agree with the PricewaterhouseCoopers’ solution that subsection ND 1D(4) should be deleted. That subsection requires the group to which the third- party borrower belongs to: • have a comparable credit risk to the employee’s group; • be employed by a person who is not associated with the employer; and • be of a sufficient size to ensure a transaction on an arm’s-length basis. These requirements are necessary for a market rate to be determined as accurately as possible without contributing to an unreasonable compliance burden. Officials believe that the proposal would be open to abuse without these requirements since: • The requirement that there is another group of borrowers that is not associated with the employer ensures that an independent market actually exists. • Likewise, the requirement that the third party is of a similar size is to ensure that the market is of sufficient depth and breadth to be a true market. • The requirement that the third party is of a similar risk profile is the simplest way to ensure that the market rate chosen by the employer is accurate, as risk is the key determinant of the interest rate offered. 104 Officials do, however, recommend that section ND 1D(4) be modified to clarify that the market rate covers rates offered to the general public as well as discounted rates provided to employees that are also offered to other groups. The market interest rate need not be the “publicly available rate”. It could be a discounted rate that the employer provides to other groups for reasons other than employment. Currently, section ND 1D(4) particularly focuses on the latter situation and does not appear to sufficiently cater for market rates provided to the general public. Accordingly, officials’ suggested changes to section ND 1D(4) are: • that the third-party group should not be employed by a person who is associated with the employer; and • that the third-party group conceptually includes, or can be part of, the general public. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but agree to the clarifications to subsection ND 1D(4) recommended by officials. 105 BUSINESS TOOLS EXEMPTION Clauses 28 and 143 Issue: $5,000 threshold Submission 1 (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be no need to have a monetary limit of $5,000 to qualify for the exemption. Submission 2 (43W – Deloitte) It is unclear whether the “cost of the business tool to the employer” includes the costs of operating the tool, and examples should be published to clarify this point, incorporating both leased and owned scenarios. Submission 3 (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As currently drafted, it is unclear whether the $5,000 threshold is GST inclusive or exclusive, and the threshold should be GST exclusive. Comment Submission 1 The monetary threshold of $5,000 prevents the term “business tool” being interpreted too widely. It was set at a level officials believe accommodates tools such as cellphones and laptop computers. Officials do not agree that the threshold is unnecessary, as suggested by NZICA. Submission 2 Deloitte submitted that the proposal is unclear on whether the operating costs of a business tool would be included when determining whether the tool is under the $5,000 threshold. Examples of operating costs are cellphone and internet connections, and repairs and maintenance. The benefit that this proposal is intended to exempt is the use, or availability for use, of certain business tools. The requirements that must be satisfied to qualify for this exemption refer to the actual tool or capital equipment itself. A business tool must: • fit the definition of a business tool; • cost the employer no more than $5,000; and • be provided mainly for business use. 106 Although the commentary clearly states that new section CX 18B exempts the private use, and availability for private use, of business tools from FBT, officials recognise that the provision as currently drafted does not make it clear enough that the $5,000 threshold applies to the cost of the actual business tool itself (including the costs associated with getting the tool into a location and condition available for use), and not the ongoing costs of the business tool. The submitter points out that a similar phrase in the FBT rules, “cost price of the motor vehicle” generated similar confusion when it was introduced. Officials believe that the confusion is unlikely to be repeated, because similar principles can be used to interpret the phrases “cost to the employer of the business tool” and “cost price of the motor vehicle”. Interpretation of the latter phrase is now well understood, having been the subject of an Inland Revenue ruling. Nonetheless, officials agree with the gist of the submission, and accordingly recommend a redrafted version of clause 28. The rewritten provision would make it clearer that it is the private use and availability for private use that is exempted from FBT, and that the $5,000 threshold relates to the value of the tool, not the value of the exemption. This includes clarification that if an employer leases a business tool, then for the purposes of the $5,000 threshold, it is the cost price that the employer would have incurred had they purchased the tool at the start of the lease. Guidance on how taxpayers should interpret “cost to the employer” will be published at a later date. This will include examples as suggested by the submitter. Submission 3 The draft legislation does not explicitly state whether the $5,000 threshold is GST inclusive or exclusive, and the submitter suggests that it should be GST exclusive. It has always been intended that the $5,000 threshold be inclusive of all costs, including GST. To make the $5,000 business tools exemption threshold GST exclusive would be inconsistent with other parts of the FBT rules, causing confusion and possibly higher compliance costs. FBT is a tax on employees’ non-cash remuneration. Although the employer carries the burden of accounting for and paying FBT, it is in effect a tax on the employee. The employee would have to pay GST if they were to purchase the fringe benefits themselves because they would be the final consumer. This is why the GST inclusive price is used when calculating the value of benefits. Arguably, given that costs, prices and fees are explicitly GST-inclusive for the purposes of the FBT rules, this intended meaning can also be imported into the new section CX 18B threshold. Nevertheless, officials agree that it would be helpful to clarify the provision by explicitly stating that the $5,000 threshold is GST-inclusive. Recommendation That submissions 1 and 3 be declined and submission 2 be accepted. 107 Issue: Definition of business tool Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The portability requirement in the definition of “business tool” is unduly restrictive, and the definition should remove the portability requirement so that it includes all business tools, including items such as desktop computers that are not generally considered portable. Comment A prescribed list of what constitutes a “business tool” was considered in the policy development phase of this proposal. However, because technology and workplace developments would quickly make such a list obsolete, the definition of “business tool” has been designed so that it can be interpreted broadly, but within reason. The commentary to the bill indicates the type of business tools this exemption is aimed at by using laptop computers and cellphones as examples of business tools. Currently, the private use of these items would be considered an unclassified fringe benefit. When the section OB 1 definition of “business tool” was drafted, officials envisaged that the ordinary meaning of “portable” would be used in its interpretation. It was thought this would be sufficiently broad, while still placing some reasonable limits on how far the interpretation of the “business tools” definition could be stretched. It effectively excludes, for example, motor vehicles. Arguably, the ordinary meaning of “portable item” would incorporate printers, facsimile machines and desktop computers. However, officials agree that the provision as currently drafted risks creating an arbitrary distinction between business tools which perform the same or similar functions but which differ in their degree of portability. Accordingly, officials agree that the requirement of portability should be removed from the definition of “business tool” and, to ensure the original policy intent is preserved (for example, that cars would not be included), the exemption should be limited to business tools whose private use would otherwise be an unclassified benefit. Recommendation That the submission be accepted but that the exemption be limited to business tools whose private use would otherwise be an unclassified benefit. 108 Issue: Use of business tool away from employer’s premises Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section CX 18B(3) is a further test that is not necessary. Alternatively, guidance should be provided on what would constitute a “substantial” part of an employee’s duties performed away from the employer’s premises. Comment Officials do not agree with the submission that section CX 18B(3) should be removed. This section, which covers the situation where business tools are not taken to and used on the employer’s premises, is not intended to be a further test in addition to the “mainly for business use test”. It is designed to widen the scope of “mainly for business use” by illustrating that if a business tool is not taken to and used on the employer’s premises, it may nevertheless be provided mainly for business use if the employee performs a significant part of the employee’s employment duties away from the premises. In its submission, NZICA seeks guidance on what would constitute a “substantial” part of the employee’s duties away from the premises. The word “substantial” does not appear in the draft legislation. Officials assume this is a typographical error, and that the submission seeks guidance on what constitutes “significant”. Officials reiterate that section CX 18B(3) is not designed to be a further test to section CX 18B(1). Rather, the use of the word “may” shows that it is designed to broaden section CX 18B(1) and illustrate its meaning. It is noted that under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, the word “significantly” implies a lower test than “mainly”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 109 BENEFITS RELATED TO HEALTH AND SAFETY Clause 30 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 43W – Deloitte, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposal as currently drafted is too restrictive. Sub-section CX 20B(b) should be deleted or widened so that the exemption will apply to all benefits provided to employees which relate to their health or safety, regardless of whether they are aimed at the elimination of hazards in the workplace. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exemption should conceptually include benefits that isolate relevant hazards, and should include a list of specific benefits that are covered by it. (Deloitte) Comment Currently, benefits that might arise as the result of an employer carrying out health and safety obligations can fall within the scope of FBT, if they are not provided on the premises of the employer. There appears to be no good policy reason for basing exemption on location. This proposal is designed to exempt any benefits that may arise from the employer meeting their health and safety obligations irrespective of where they are provided. PricewaterhouseCoopers supports an exemption from FBT for benefits arising from employer health and safety-related obligations, irrespective of where they are provided, but is of the view that the exemption should not be restricted to benefits aimed at the elimination of hazards in the workplace. PricewaterhouseCooper’s reasoning is that although the term “hazard” is defined broadly in the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992, there are still health and safety benefits which could fall outside the exemption. They suggest it would be easier for employers to comply with a policy that exempted all benefits relating to employee health and/or safety. Similarly, NZICA submits that the exemption should be widened beyond an employee’s health and safety in relation to hazards. Deloitte submits that the exemption should conceptually include benefits that isolate relevant hazards and should in addition include a list of specific benefits that are covered by it. Officials’ believe that a general health and safety exemption is too wide, goes beyond the original scope, and would add to the fiscal cost of this proposal. There would be increased potential for the exemption to be abused. A number of fringe benefits may become exempt because they are under the guise of health and safety, when conceptually they are closer to salary or wage substitutes than an employer simply fulfilling its legal obligations. Officials also view a prescriptive exemption, by way of a statutory list of exempt items, to be undesirable because health and safety obligations are continually evolving and individual to each employer. A statutory list of exempt health and safety benefits is unlikely to keep pace with future changes. 110 Because of the weaknesses in both general and prescriptive health and safety exemptions, the current proposal relates back to the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992, which is where workplace health and safety obligations arise from. The link to health and safety legislation means that the FBT exemption will be able to adapt to changes in the health and safety expectations that employers face. Under that legislation, the definition of “hazard” is broad. Officials recognise that the current provision as drafted may be too restrictive. Employers are required by the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 to (among other things) systematically identify hazards and then manage them by (in order of preference) elimination, isolation, or minimisation. To recognise that not all hazards can be eliminated, officials propose to amend clause 30 by replacing “elimination of hazards” with “hazard management” to match the wording of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. This would broaden the exemption to encompass other aspects of dealing with hazards, such as minimisation. An example of minimisation is that protective clothing must be provided to employees when a hazard cannot be eliminated or isolated. Officials would consider that this change would also be wide enough to ensure the exemption of influenza injections and eye tests – for example, in appropriate circumstances. Examples of what would commonly qualify for the exemption will be published by Inland Revenue to provide further guidance to taxpayers. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, but that the reference to “elimination of hazards” be changed to “hazard management”. Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The phrase “health and safety” in sub-section CX 20B(a) should be replaced with the phrase “health or safety”. Comment Officials agree that there may be instances, such as the provision of influenza injections, when a benefit is provided for either the employee’s health or safety rather than both so that “and” should be changed to “or” as suggested by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 111 LOW-VALUE UNCLASSIFIED BENEFITS Clause 126 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The employer-related threshold for minor fringe benefits should be removed. Or, if this is not accepted, there should be a higher threshold for employers with a large number of employees. Comment Section ND 1Q is being amended to increase the minimum value thresholds that have to be exceeded before unclassified fringe benefits are subject to FBT. The employee- related minimum value threshold is being increased to $200 per quarter (from $75) and the employer-related minimum value threshold is being increased to $15,000 per annum. It was originally proposed in the discussion document, Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits, that the employer-related threshold be raised from $450 to $2,000 per quarter. Submissions on the discussion document, including one from NZICA, resulted in the proposed threshold being further increased to $15,000 per annum. The $15,000 threshold is designed to reduce compliance costs while ensuring that the tax base is not eroded and that the size of the associated fiscal cost is reasonable. While the aim is to reduce compliance costs for all employers, the new threshold particularly focuses on small to medium enterprises (SMEs) because they face a disproportionate share of the compliance burden in this area. It is based on the Ministry of Economic Development definition of a SME, being 19 employees or fewer. In this context, it is the view of officials that the benefits from eliminating the employer-related threshold, as suggested by the submitter, would be outweighed by the potential fiscal cost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 112 113 Taxation of share-lending transactions 114 115 OVERVIEW Clauses 13, 18, 35, 36, 39, 48, 50, 51, 63, 64, 67, 82, 91, 93, 104, 105, 107 to 109, 133 to 140, 143, 153 and 157 The bill proposes changes to income tax legislation to clarify and reform the tax treatment of share-lending transactions by: • introducing specific share-lending rules to allow the taxation of “qualifying” share-lending transactions on the basis of economic substance; and • strengthening the tax rules to ensure that non-qualifying share-lending transactions do not give rise to an unintended fiscal cost. Share-lending involves the lending of shares to another party for a fee and was developed to allow brokers to transact in shares in which they have a shortfall. Share- lending also provides a relatively risk-free way for larger holders of shares, such as banks, insurance companies, and funds managers to increase their overall portfolio returns. Internationally, share-lending represents a substantial part of the daily settlement value in many transaction systems and can play an important role in facilitating market liquidity. New Zealand does not have an onshore share-lending market, in part because of the current tax treatment of these transactions. New Zealand, unlike many other jurisdictions, does not have special tax rules for share-lending. For New Zealand tax purposes, these transactions are taxed on the basis of legal form (a sale of shares) rather than economic substance (a loan), meaning that entering into a share-lending transaction is a taxable event. There are several problems with the current New Zealand tax treatment of share- lending transactions: • it is inconsistent with international trends; • it is inconsistent with the economic and accounting treatment of these transactions; and • it is inconsistent with the treatment of other commercial transactions. There are also tax avoidance concerns with the current tax treatment of share-lending transactions. There is evidence that share-lending transactions are being used to trade imputation credits and take advantage of the absence of specific tax rules in this area in New Zealand. Proposed changes to the tax treatment of share-lending were set out in the government discussion document, Taxing securities lending transactions: substance over form, released in November 2004. 116 Summary of proposed amendments The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 will introduce specific share-lending rules to tax “qualifying” share-lending transactions on the basis of economic substance rather than legal form. They will also strengthen the imputation and non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules to ensure that non-qualifying share-lending transactions do not give rise to an unintended fiscal cost. These changes are being made to give greater consistency and more certainty to the tax treatment of share-lending transactions, and to protect the tax base by preventing taxpayers from using share-lending transactions to trade imputation credits and circumvent the NRWT rules. The new rules revolve around the definition of a returning securities transfer. A returning securities transfer is an arrangement where: • a person (the share supplier) disposes of a share which is listed on a recognised exchange or is ordinarily available for subscription or purchase by the public; • the person who obtains the share (the share user) agrees to transfer the original shares or replacement shares back to the share supplier; and • the share user makes replacement payments to pass on the rewards of ownership for any distributions paid on the original shares during the period of the transaction. Returning securities transfers which meet a number of criteria (known as share- lending arrangements) will be taxed on the basis of their economic substance rather than legal form. This means that they will not be treated as a taxable disposal. Share-lending arrangements Returning securities transfers (Taxed as loans) (Subject to the new imputation and NRWT rules) Scope of the proposed share-lending rules 117 A “share-lending arrangement” is defined as a returning securities transfer where: • the term of the transaction is no longer than 12 months; • the original shares or replacement shares are transferred back to the share supplier; • the share user maintains an imputation credit account (ICA); • the share user pays withholding tax required under section NF 2(1)(g) for any replacement payment; • the share user transfers to the share supplier any rights and options, or equivalent rights and options, granted or received in relation to the original shares during the period of the transaction; • the terms of the securities lending transaction are ordinary commercial conditions which are consistent with those that would apply between parties negotiating at arm’s length; and • the transaction is entered into in an income year after the new rules take effect. To ensure that a minor breach of the qualification criteria does not disqualify commercial transactions from the new rules, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be given a discretion on the term of qualifying transactions and what constitutes a replacement share. Returning securities transfers that do not qualify as share-lending arrangements will be subject to new imputation and NRWT rules. These new rules ensure that imputation credits remain with the economic owner of securities and that NRWT cannot be circumvented. They are designed to complement the new rules for share- lending arrangements and the existing anti-avoidance provisions. The new base maintenance rules will apply when: • A share user receives imputation credits as the holder of an original share acquired under a returning securities transfer. • A share user makes a replacement payment to a non-resident which is intended to be economically equivalent to a reward of ownership which would be taxable in New Zealand if derived by the share supplier. Under the new rules, the tax benefit obtained will be cancelled by a debit to the ICA account of the share user (if the tax benefit is in the form of imputation credits), or by denying the deduction for the replacement payment (if the tax benefit relates to the non-payment of NRWT). Application date The share-lending amendments will apply for income years beginning on or after the date of enactment. The associated base maintenance amendments will apply from the date that the amending legislation is enacted. 118 Submissions Seven submissions were made on the proposed changes to the income tax treatment of share-lending transactions. All of the submissions supported the introduction of a revised tax treatment for these transactions but made various recommendations on technical aspects of the proposals. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants supported the introduction of new rules for share-lending but opposed the introduction of the associated anti- avoidance rules. The Corporate Taxpayers Group made an oral submission supporting the introduction of the proposed rules. Officials have also made a number of recommendations to help clarify the proposed rules. 119 APPLICATION DATE Submission (28W – New Zealand Exchange Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association, 45W – Asset Management Advisory Board, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Several submissions have been made on the application date for the proposed share- lending rules, including: • that the application date for the share-lending legislation should be one set date; and • that the rules should grandfather all transactions existing at the time of introduction. Comment The proposed share-lending rules have two application dates. The base maintenance changes for non-qualifying share-lending transactions will apply from Royal assent. This date was chosen because Inland Revenue has evidence that such transactions are currently being used to exploit the lack of specific tax rules in this area in New Zealand. The other share-lending changes are intended to apply to income years beginning on or after enactment. This means that their application is dependent on a taxpayer’s balance date. Single application date The New Zealand Exchange Limited, Securities Industry Association and Asset Management Advisory Board have submitted that the new share-lending rules should have a single application date. They argue that it is impractical and not commercially sensible to have different application dates depending on a person’s balance date. They also argue that having an application date based on a taxpayer’s balance date would mean that certain taxpayers would be given a commercial advantage as they would be able to enter into qualifying share-lending arrangements at an earlier date. An application date based on balance dates was chosen to ensure that taxpayers had sufficient time to prepare for the change in tax rules. However, from a commercial perspective, officials can see the benefit of having the rules apply from a consistent date and recommend a single application date for share-lending rules of 1 July 2006. Grandfathering While the industry appears to favour a single application date, concerns have been raised about the impact of the new rules on existing transactions. The Securities Industry Association and New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants have submitted that the proposed share-lending rules should grandfather all existing transactions at the time of introduction. The Securities Industry Association is concerned that a compulsory regime (without grandfathering) will impose costs on 120 market participants and could have a negative impact on New Zealand’s financial markets. Officials do not consider that the grandfathering of existing transactions is appropriate. The lack of a New Zealand share-lending market has been raised by the industry as a reason for the introduction of special tax rules. With no existing market, there should be limited commercial transactions affected by the introduction of the proposed rules. In addition, the compulsory nature of the wider returning securities transfer rules is intentional. The proposed rules contain anti-avoidance measures to counter transactions aimed at trading imputation credits and avoiding NRWT. Industry participants were consulted (via a government discussion document in November 2004) on the proposed anti-avoidance rules to ensure these would not capture normal commercial transactions (other than those involving the trading of imputation credits or avoidance of NRWT). Officials recommend dealing with concerns over the scope of the proposed anti- avoidance rules by broadening the definition of share-lending arrangement and better targeting the definition of a returning securities transfer rather than grandfathering any existing transactions. These proposed changes are discussed in the next section. As discussed above, officials also recommend a deferred application date of 1 July 2006 to give the industry time to comply with the new rules. Recommendation That the submission on a single application date be accepted, but that a deferred application date of 1 July 2006 be used. That the submission on grandfathering be declined, but that changes discussed in the next section, on types of securities, be made to the definition of share-lending arrangement and returning securities transfer to deal with concerns over the scope of the proposed anti-avoidance rules. 121 TYPES OF SECURITIES Submissions (28W – New Zealand Exchange Limited, 31W – Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A number of submissions have been made about the types of securities covered by the proposed rules, including that: • The share-lending rules should be extended beyond listed shares. • A mechanism be introduced to allow other types of securities to be added to the rules over time. • The definition of a “listed company” should be amended. • The reference to an official list should be removed from the definition of a returning securities transfer. • The definition of a returning securities transfer should be narrowed. Comment Listed shares restriction A transaction will fall within the proposed share-lending rules only if it involves shares listed on a recognised exchange or ordinarily available for subscription or purchase by the public. The Securities Industry Association has submitted that the proposed share-lending rules should be expanded to cover other securities such as: • units, bonds, debentures, convertible notes, rights or options issued by a company, partnership or unit trust; • government bonds, debentures or similar securities; • commercial paper; and • rights, options, forwards, futures, coupon strips, swapations and other derivatives over government and local authority securities. This view is echoed in a number of other submissions. Officials do not support expanding the list of qualifying securities at this time. The government discussion document, Taxing securities lending transactions: substance over form, initially proposed applying the new rules to both debt and equity securities. However, following a review of submissions, it was decided to limit the proposals to equity securities. This is because the majority of lending arrangements should relate to listed shares. Extending the scope beyond these is likely to require substantial changes to the tax rules without a corresponding increase in the number of lending transactions. 122 Officials also consider that the alternative criterion (“ordinarily available for subscription or purchase by the public”) in paragraph (b) of the definition of a returning securities transfer should be removed. This criterion has a level of uncertainty which could give rise to debate over the parameters of the new rules. It has also been suggested that it is in conflict with the objective of improving market liquidity (as the equities are sold outside recognised markets). Limiting the new rules solely to listed shares will improve certainty around the breadth of the regime. There is potential that this change may disadvantage some participants by limiting the number of qualifying transactions. However, officials consider the impact to be minor and outweighed by the advantage of added certainty. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has asked for details on expanding the proposed share-lending rules to cover other types of transactions. It is difficult to estimate the fiscal cost of widening the share-lending rules. Tax lost to date from avoidance in this area is estimated to be $100 million. Given the technical nature of the proposals there is a risk of unintended tax consequences. While this has been countered in the design of the rules, the risk would be multiplied by attempting to expand the scope to cover debt and derivatives at this point. New Zealand already has a debt lending market ($NZ9 billion). This shows that the current tax rules do not provide a barrier to debt lending (generally because participants tend to already be on revenue account). Therefore, the decision to exclude debt does not prevent debt lending as there is already a well established market under the current rules. The only issue is therefore the exclusion of derivatives. The industry has confirmed that the current proposals will cover the vast majority of lending transactions that participants will want to undertake. Interest in the lending of derivates is only likely to develop once the market has been established for some time. As part of the generic tax policy process, the share-lending rules will be reviewed post-implementation and the scope of the rules could be covered in this review. Commissioner discretion Officials do not support submissions to give the Commissioner discretion to add qualifying securities over time. There is a concern that such a discretion would not be broad enough to cover amendments required to other tax rules. More importantly, officials consider that such regulatory changes would benefit from the wider discussion that would attend a legislative amendment. Any such changes should be open to proper consultation, based on the generic tax policy process. Listed company definition A transaction will qualify under the proposed share-lending rules if it involves a share listed on the official list of a recognised exchange. The New Zealand Exchange Limited and Securities Industry Association have both submitted that the use of the term “official list” is unclear. 123 Taking the New Zealand capital markets as an example, New Zealand Exchange Limited runs both the NZSX Market and the NZAX Market, both of which are official equity markets. However, the term “official list” does not contemplate multiple markets. Officials agree that there could be uncertainty and recommend that this term be amended. The definition of “listed company” (which also refers to an official list) should also be amended to ensure consistency. Recognised exchange The Securities Industry Association has submitted that the definition of “recognised exchange” needs to be amended. Officials consider that this will only be necessary if the proposed rules are extended to cover debt securities. Consistent with our earlier recommendation to limit the rules to listed shares, no change is required to the definition of recognised exchange. However, the definition will need to be reviewed should the types of qualifying securities be extended in the future. Definition of a returning securities transfer The Securities Industry Association, Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants are concerned that the definition of a returning securities transfer may inadvertently catch other commercial transactions such as share repurchase agreements, margin lending, instalment receipts, warrants, and the lodging of shares for collateral. They consider that these transactions fall outside the definition of a share-lending arrangement and as such would be subject to the proposed anti-avoidance rules. Specifically, they have suggested excluding transfers where the shares are held on trust for the benefit of the share supplier, or for security. Officials agree that certain of these commercial arrangements (such as warrants and instalment receipts) are not akin to share-lending and should be excluded from the definition of a returning securities transfer and the proposed rules. However, most of the transactions listed above are similar and should receive the same tax treatment. As normal commercial transactions, they should not be subject to the proposed anti- avoidance rules. Officials therefore recommend amending the definition of a share- lending arrangement to cover these arrangements. Officials note that unlike the initial position in the discussion document, this will mean that share repurchase agreements (as well as most of the other transactions listed above) will be covered by the proposed amendments. In discussions with the industry it became clear that share repurchase transactions and securities lending are virtually identical and should receive the same tax treatment. Recommendations Officials recommend that: • The submission on expanding the proposed share-lending rules to cover other securities be declined and the alternative in the definition of a returning securities transfer should be removed. 124 • The submission on including a mechanism (such as a Commissioner discretion) to allow qualifying securities to be added over time be declined. • The submissions on the term “official list” be accepted. • The submission on “recognised exchange” be declined. • In general, the submission regarding narrowing the definition of a returning securities transfer be declined. Instead, the definition of a share-lending arrangement should be amended to cover other types of similar arrangements. Officials also recommend that the term “returning securities transfer” is changed to “returning share transfer”. This will clarify that debt and other listed securities are not covered by the new rules and should help to alleviate concerns about the scope of the rules. 125 RELATIONSHIP WITH SUBPART CB Submissions (28W – New Zealand Exchange Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submissions have been made about the relationship between the proposed share- lending rules and subpart CB which treats disposals of revenue account property as assessable income, in particular that: • Section CX 44B(1)(a) should be deleted. • The reference to “consideration” should be removed. • The proposed rules should clarify whether a taxpayer undertaking a share- lending arrangement is automatically on revenue account. • The proposed rules should better clarify what happens when a share user returns shares to the share supplier. • Participants should not be required to track shares to determine if they are original or replacement shares. • The rules should clarify what is meant by “market value”. Comment Section CX 44B The aim of the proposed share-lending rules is to tax qualifying transactions as loans rather than as the sale and re-acquisition of shares. To achieve this, section CX 44B ensures that consideration derived by a share supplier under a share-lending arrangement on the disposal of an original share is excluded income. However, under subsection (1)(a) this exclusion only applies where the share supplier has acquired the share: • for the purposes of a business; • for the purposes of an undertaking or scheme that the person enters or devises with the purpose of making a profit; • for the purpose of disposing of the share; or • when in a business of dealing in shares. These criteria were included because only revenue account holders should be taxed upon the disposal of shares. The New Zealand Exchange Limited and the Securities Industry Association have submitted that it would make the rules clearer if the criteria in subsection (1)(a) were deleted. 126 Officials agree that the criteria in subsection (1)(a) are a duplication of other provisions in the Act which tax disposals of revenue account property. As such, it should not be necessary to specifically refer to these criteria in section CX 44B. Removing subsection (1)(a) would simplify the rules, while still making it clear that a share supplier is not taxable on the sale of shares under a share-lending arrangement. Reference to consideration received Concerns have been raised about the reference to “consideration” in section CX 44B. The New Zealand Law Society considers that the reference is not consistent with the concept of a share-lending arrangement as there is no “consideration” in the sense of cash movements when the shares are lent. Instead, they recommend amending the proposed rules so that the disposal and acquisition of shares under a share-lending arrangement is ignored for tax purposes. Officials disagree with the idea of ignoring the disposal and acquisition for tax purposes. In general, the tax rules follow the actual transaction (a disposal and reacquisition). Officials consider that the share-lending rules should continue to adopt this approach, only switching off those few provisions needed to ensure consistency with the economic substance of these transactions. The issue raised by the New Zealand Law Society could be dealt with by amending section CX 44B to treat the collateral received in respect of the shares as excluded income. This would eliminate the need to have a specific carve-out for share-lending fees and replacement payments. Capital vs revenue account The Securities Industry Association and New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants have submitted that the proposed share-lending rules should clarify whether a taxpayer who undertakes multiple lending arrangements will be in the business of trading in shares. The Securities Industry Association is particularly concerned about share-lending arrangements tainting treatment of shares otherwise held on capital account. The share-lending rules are not intended to determine whether a share supplier is on revenue or capital account as there are other provisions in the Act which tax disposals of revenue account property. The capital or revenue account status of a share supplier in relation to particular shares will be determined by applying existing law to the facts in each case. Returning shares The Securities Industry Association and the New Zealand Law Society have submitted that the proposed rules need to clarify the tax treatment of returning borrowed shares. Section CD 44 deems a share user who transfers a replacement share to a share supplier to derive assessable income “equal to the market value of the original share at the date of acquisition by the share user”. 127 The Securities Industry Association has submitted that section CD 44 should clarify when income is derived (in the income year in which the shares are transferred back to the share supplier), at what time market value should be determined (when the shares were transferred from the share supplier to the share user) and how the section links to section DB 12C (which allows a share user a deduction for acquiring a share under a share-lending arrangement). The industry is also concerned about the ability of participants to determine if shares are original or replacement as the draft legalisation is silent on returning original shares to a share supplier. In response to submissions, officials have reviewed the relationship between the proposed rules and existing revenue account property provisions. To tax these transactions like loans, a number of existing provisions need to be switched off. The following diagrams summarise the proposed interrelationship between the share- lending rules and existing revenue account property provisions. This is a simpler approach to that taken in the draft bill. Share Supplier Share User Market value of loaned share is excluded income Cost of share is replaced by right to reacquire share No deduction for cost of share obtained under share-lending arrangement (block deduction under ordinary rules) Market value of returning share is excluded income Right to reacquire share replaced by cost of original share Proposed structure: where borrowed shares are returned to supplier Share Supplier Share User 3 rd Party Purchaser Market value of loaned share is excluded income Cost of share is replaced by right to reacquire share Gain on selling share is taxable under ordinary rules No deduction for cost of share obtained under share-lending arrangement (block deduction under ordinary rules) Market value of returning share is excluded income Right to reacquire share replaced by cost of original share Proposed structure: where borrowed shares are on-sold to a third party Deduction for cost of share under ordinary rules Market 128 Following this proposed structure, officials recommend deleting section CD 44. Instead, a deduction should be denied for shares borrowed under a share-lending arrangement. This will be matched by treating the value of lent and returned shares as excluded income. These changes will resolve problems with the derivation of deemed income (timing and calculation) and remove the need for participants to track whether they are dealing with original or replacement shares. Officials also recommend deleting section DB 12C, as deductions for the cost of borrowed shares should already be available under the revenue account property rules. This will resolve problems raised about the links between sections CD 44 and DB 12C. Market value The Securities Industry Association and New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants have submitted that it would be helpful to clarify what is meant by “market value” (whether it is the weighted average price traded on the market, closing market price, the price agreed by the parties or some other price). The Securities Industry Association is concerned that the current wording does not take into account the normal commercial practice of adopting a valuation date three days before the actual transfer of the shares. Specifically, they have suggested that the rules be amended to use the price agreed by the parties as the price for tax purposes, provided this has relevance to market value at the time. The proposed changes to the interrelationship between the proposed share-lending rules and the revenue account property provisions will make this a much less significant issue. The revenue account property provisions use the terms “amount derived” and “cost”. Parties to a share-lending arrangement should be able to apply normal commercial practice in determining the “market value”, “amount derived” and “cost” of shares under a lending arrangement. This will be highlighted in any Inland Revenue Tax Information Bulletin article on these rules. Recommendations Officials recommend that: • The submission on removing the revenue account criteria be accepted as these are already established under existing rules. • The submissions on the reference to “consideration” and ignoring the disposal and acquisition for tax purposes should be declined. Instead, the collateral received in respect of the shares should be excluded income. This would eliminate the need to have a specific carve-out for share-lending fees and replacement payments. • The submission that the proposed share-lending rules should clarify whether a taxpayer who undertakes multiple lending arrangements will be in the business of trading in shares should be declined. Instead, Inland Revenue will provide guidance in a Tax Information Bulletin article which will follow enactment of any amending legislation. 129 • The submissions on clarifying what happens when a share user returns shares, and participants being required to track shares, should be accepted. These submissions should be addressed by amending the interrelationship between the proposed rules and the revenue account property rules. Section CD 44 should be deleted. Instead, a deduction should be denied for the cost of shares borrowed under a share-lending arrangement. This will be matched by treating the value of lent and returned shares as excluded income. Section DB 12C should also be deleted, as deductions for the cost of borrowed shares are already available under the revenue account property rules. • The submission on amending the proposed rules to clarify the meaning of the term “market value” be declined. However, any Inland Revenue Tax Information Bulletin on the proposed rules will highlight that parties to a share- lending arrangement should be able to apply normal commercial practice in determining the “market value”, “amount derived” and “cost” of shares under a lending arrangement. 130 DEDUCTIONS FOR EXCEPTED FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Submissions (40 – Securities Industry Association, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submissions have been made about the interrelationship between the proposed share- lending rules and the existing timing and deduction rules for excepted financial arrangements, in particular that: • The trading stock amendments should apply only to property held on revenue account. • The concept of a “right to acquire a share” should be dispensed with. • The reference to the end of a share-lending arrangement should be removed from subsection DB 12B. • The timing and value of deductions should be clarified and aligned with the share-lending income sections. Comment Trading stock amendments and the right to acquire a share The Securities Industry Association is concerned about the interrelationship between the proposed share-lending rules and the trading stock rules. They have submitted that the amendments to sections CH 1 and EA 1 should apply only to property held on revenue account. Section EA 1 applies to a person who holds excepted financial arrangements that are revenue account property under subpart ED. The year-end value of such property is included as income under section CH 1. Similarly, the opening value of such property is allowed as a deduction under section DB 40. The values for these adjustments are determined under section ED 1. The amendments to sections EA 1 and CH 1 are intended to ensure that there will be no tax implications for the share supplier in lending shares under a share-lending arrangement. The New Zealand Law Society considers that the concept of a “right to acquire a share” (which is included in sections EA 1 and CH 1 as a result of these amendments) is artificial and unnecessarily complex. The Society considers that it should be dispensed with by ignoring the disposal of the share for tax purposes. As discussed previously, officials consider that, as far as possible, the proposed share-lending legislation should follow the actual transaction. As such, it is not appropriate to simply “ignore” the disposal of the shares. 131 As the lending of shares is a disposal, it will affect the opening and closing value of excepted financial arrangements. To counter this, the amendments replace the value of the original shares with the right to obtain the original or replacement share. However, a taxpayer is only required to recognise this right if the original shares were revenue account property under subpart ED. As such, the amendments already apply only to revenue account property. The “right to acquire a share” will be extinguished when shares are returned to the share supplier or the share-lending arrangement comes to an end. The share supplier will normally replace the value of this right with the value of the replacement shares. The rules should ensure that this equates to the cost of the original shares. Section DB 12B The Securities Industry Association has submitted that the reference to the end of a share-lending arrangement should be removed from section DB 12B. Officials have reviewed the interrelationship between the proposed share-lending rules and the revenue account property provisions, and consider that section DB 12B is unnecessary as deductions are already available under existing provisions. Timing and value of deductions A number of submitters have raised the need to clarify and align the timing and value of deductions under the share-lending rules. In particular, the value of the deduction under section DB 12C should be the same as the income under section CD 44(2) (market value), that the timing of the deduction should be clarified, and that the wording of the various share-lending sections should be aligned. Officials have reviewed the interrelationship between the proposed share-lending rules and the revenue account property provisions, and consider that section DB 12C should be deleted. As the lending and returning of borrowed shares will be treated as excluded income, there should be no tax deduction for obtaining shares under a share- lending arrangement. There will be no deemed income arising under section CD 44 on returning borrowed shares. A deduction for purchasing replacement shares should be available under the normal revenue account property provisions. In adopting this revised treatment of share-lending arrangements, officials agree that the wording of the various share-lending sections should be aligned. Recommendations Officials recommend that: • The submission on the trading stock amendments and revenue account property be accepted. No changes are required to the proposed share-lending rules to achieve this result. 132 • The submission on replacing the concept of a “right to acquire a share” by ignoring the disposal of the share for tax purposes should be declined. • The submissions recommending clarification and alignment of the share-lending deduction sections be accepted in general. As a result of reviewing the interrelationship between the proposed share-lending rules and the revenue account property provisions, officials consider that sections DB 12B and DB 12C should be deleted. In adopting this revised treatment of share-lending arrangements, officials agree that the wording of the various share-lending sections should be aligned. 133 REPLACEMENT PAYMENTS Submissions (40 – Securities Industry Association, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A number of amendments should be made to the tax treatment of replacement payments, including that: • Only dividend substitutes should be captured in the definition of a replacement payment. • Unnecessary duplication around the definition of “replacement payment” should be removed from the proposed rules. • Any amounts netted against replacement payments should not be subject to the same tax treatment. • The requirement to transfer rights and options to the share supplier should be removed. • Share users should not be required to determine the tax status of an unrelated third party in relation to deductions for replacement payments. • The rules should address the treatment of taxable and non-taxable bonus issues. • Section CX 44C needs to be re-examined. Comment Definition of replacement payment A replacement payment is defined in section OB 1 as “a transfer of value, including any imputation credits, made under the returning securities transfer that satisfies paragraph (d)(ii) of the definition of returning securities transfer’’. Paragraph (d)(ii) of the definition of returning securities transfer requires a share user to make to the share supplier, transfers of value “intended to be economically equivalent in value to rewards of ownership to which the holder of the original share would be entitled during the term of the arrangement’’. The Securities Industry Association and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants are concerned that the current definition of replacement payment may capture payments which are not dividend substitutes. For example, this may include payments for movements in the share price and cash compensation for rights or options received on the underlying shares. They have submitted that the proposed rules should be amended to exclude amounts which are not dividend substitutes from the definition of replacement payments. Officials agree that the definition of “replacement payment” is intended to capture dividend substitutes. As such, the definition should be amended to ensure that other payments made under a returning securities transfer are not treated as replacement payments – for example, cash compensation for rights and options and payments for movements in share price. 134 In amending the definition of “replacement payment”, the duplicate references to replacement payments being “economically equivalent to a reward of ownership”, in sections CD 43, CX 44C, DB 12D(2)(b) and DB 12D(2)(a)(ii) should also be removed as it is unnecessary and potentially confusing. Net payments Under some share-lending arrangements, the parties will net dividend replacement payments on the original shares against collateral-related payments. It is important that any amounts netted against replacement payments are not subject to the same tax treatment. Officials agree that the rules should specify what happens when amounts are netted off under a share-lending arrangement. This could be achieved by amending the definition of “pay” to make it clear that an amount will still qualify even when it has been bundled with, or netted off, against other amounts. Transferring rights and options The definition of a “share-lending arrangement” requires a share user to transfer “to the share supplier the rights and options that the holder of the original share would be entitled to receive during the term of the financial arrangement, or rights and options that are equivalent to those rights and options”. The Securities Industry Association has submitted that some share-lending arrangements require the share user to make cash payments to the share supplier for rights and options issued on the underlying shares. As such, they have submitted that the requirement to transfer rights and options to the share supplier should be removed so that these arrangements will qualify for the proposed share-lending rules. Officials agree with this submission. Rights and options are not taxed as a dividend. Therefore, it is not necessary to include the requirement to transfer rights and options in the definition of a share-lending arrangement. Non-taxable distributions and bonus issues Under section DB 12D, a share user must know the tax status of the share supplier in order to determine the deductibility of a replacement payment. The Securities Industry Association has submitted that share users should not be required to determine the income tax status of an unrelated third party in order to determine the tax deductibility of their own replacement payment expenditure. The Securities Industry Association is also concerned that the denial of a deduction for the whole of the replacement payment seems an overly harsh punishment for what in principle is an attempt to collect NRWT on these payments. There are two parts to section DB 12D. Subsection DB 12D(2)(a) is part of the anti- avoidance rules introduced to protect the tax base by preventing taxpayers from using securities lending transactions to trade imputation credits and circumvent the NRWT rules. As discussed later on pages 148 to 149 of this report, officials are recommending that the NRWT anti-avoidance rule is removed until the NRWT treaty rates review has been completed. 135 Section DB 12D(2)(a) relates to the tax treatment of bonus issues. A taxable bonus issue is any bonus issue that the company elects to treat as a dividend or a bonus issue in lieu. A non-taxable bonus issue (which is not a dividend for income tax purposes) occurs when no election is made (other than a bonus issue in lieu). As discussed above, replacement payments should only include those amounts which are dividend substitutes (such as taxable bonus issues). Officials therefore recommend deleting sections CX 44C, DB 12D and the words from “if the replacement payment ... derived by the person” in section CD 43. Recommendations Officials recommend that: • The submissions on limiting replacement payments to dividend substitutes and removing unnecessary duplication from the definition be accepted. • The submission on ensuring that any amounts netted against replacement payments should not be subject to the same tax treatment be accepted. • The submission on removing the requirement to transfer rights and options to the share supplier be accepted. • The submissions on determining the tax status of an unrelated third party in relation to deductions for replacement payments, bonus issues and re-examining CX 44C be accepted. Replacement payments should only include those amounts which are dividend substitutes (such as taxable bonus issues). Sections CX 44C, DB 12D and the words from “if the replacement payment ... derived by the person” in section CD 43 should be deleted. Officials also consider that the following amendments would help clarify what is meant by the term “replacement payment”, and provide increased certainty for taxpayers: • Transferring the requirements for a replacement payment to the definition of a replacement payment. • Replacing the term “transfer of value” with the word “amount”. • Adopting concepts similar to those in the Australian definition of “replacement payment” 13 to ensure that all forms of dividend substitute are captured. 13 The Australian legislation includes a detailed definition of what is meant by “related payment”: • causing a payment(s) to be made to, or in accordance with the directions of, the other person(s); or • causing an amount(s) to be credited to, or applied for the benefit of, the other person(s); or • causing services to be provided to, or in accordance with the directions of, the other person(s); or • causing property to be transferred to, or in accordance with the directions of, the other person(s); or • allowing any property or money to be used by the other person(s) or by someone nominated by the other person(s); or • causing an amount(s) to be set off against, or to be otherwise applied in reduction of, a debt(s) owed by the person(s) to the taxpayer or associate; or • agreeing to treat an amount(s) owed to the other person(s) by the taxpayer or associate as having been increased. 136 TAX CREDITS Submission (40 – Securities Industry Association, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The following amendments should be made relating to tax credits attached to replacement payments: • Replacement payments should be treated as surrogates for dividends, with the resulting imputation and withholding tax implications. • The resident withholding tax (RWT) and imputation rules should not apply to replacement payments. • Participants should be able to use exemption certificates for RWT on replacement payments. • Share users should be able to pass RWT deductions on borrowed shares through to share suppliers. • The reference to RWT in the definition of a share-lending arrangement should be clarified. • The Australian certification approach should be adopted for dealing with tax credits on borrowed shares. Comment Resident withholding tax Under the proposed rules, transactions will be subject to RWT at a rate of 33% if the share user has not received a fully imputed dividend on the borrowed shares. The RWT will be converted into imputation credits which are attached to the replacement payment. The Securities Industry Association and New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants have submitted that replacement payments should be treated as surrogates for dividends, with the resulting imputation and withholding tax implications. They do not agree with the imposition of the RWT rules proposed in the bill. RWT on replacement payments is required to match the tax deduction available to the share user when they make a replacement payment. Officials agree with the general proposition that the share-lending rules should leave share suppliers in no worse position than if they had maintained their investment in the original shares. However, in applying this principle, it is important to ensure that the New Zealand tax base is protected. 137 For example, if replacement payments paid to non-residents were treated as non- resident withholding income they would be taxed at 30% (or 15% if covered by a double tax treaty). However, the share user would be entitled to a tax deduction for making the replacement payment at 33% (assuming they are a company). The differential in these two rates would be a cost to the New Zealand tax base. Therefore, officials do not support exempting replacement payments from RWT. Exemption certificates and passing on RWT credits The Securities Industry Association has submitted that the RWT rules as they apply to replacement payments should be amended to allow for RWT exemption certificates and the passing on of RWT credits. They are concerned that there will be a requirement for share users to fund the RWT on replacement payments until they can either use the RWT credits attached to dividends received or claim a refund of surplus RWT credits. As discussed above, the purpose of the share-lending RWT is to counter the tax deduction available to the share user in making the replacement payment. While there will be a timing difference between the payment of RWT under section NF 2(1)(g) and the ability to claim a tax deduction for the replacement payment, this can be reduced by factoring the tax deduction into provisional tax payments. Officials therefore decline the submissions that RWT exemption certificates should apply for share-lending RWT and that share users should be able to pass through RWT credits. RWT under section NF 2(1)(g) To qualify as a share-lending arrangement, it is necessary that “the amount of resident withholding tax given by section NF 2(1)(g)” is paid by the share user. The Securities Industry Association has submitted that the proposed rules should be amended to clarify that it is RWT payable under the wider regime that needs to be paid and not the amount specifically calculated under section NF 2(1)(g). RWT is only required to be paid under section NF 2(1)(g) if the share user has not received and passed on fully imputed dividends. RWT is required to be paid so that the share user does not benefit from obtaining a tax deduction for the replacement payment. The RWT payable is specific to share-lending transactions and is separate from any other RWT obligations in respect of the borrowed shares. Tax credit transfers The Securities Industry Association is concerned about the compliance costs and risks for share users related to receiving, tracking, and paying tax credits. They consider that replacement payments should be exempt from the imputation rules and that a certification approach should be adopted to transfer tax credits. 138 Officials disagree with exempting replacement payments from the imputation rules. Requiring a share user to attach imputation credits to a replacement payment is intended to put the share supplier in the same position as if they had retained the shares. A share supplier should not be able to exchange imputation credits for a cash replacement payment. Officials would, however, support the introduction of a voluntary tax credit transfer system as part of the proposed share-lending rules. This would be based on the Australian system whereby relevant tax credits would continue to be derived by the share supplier if the share user and share supplier notified Inland Revenue of the share-lending arrangement. The system would operate only between share users and suppliers and should not impose any obligations on share issuers since they are unlikely to have knowledge of the share-lending arrangement. This differs from the system described in the Securities Industry Association submission. Recommendations Officials recommend that: • The submissions on treating replacement payments as surrogates for dividends, with the resulting imputation and withholding tax implications, and removing the RWT rules proposed in the bill be declined. • The submissions on amending the proposed rules to allow for RWT exemption certificates and passing on RWT credits should be declined. • The submission that the proposed rules should be amended to clarify that it is RWT payable under the wider regime that needs to be paid be declined. • The submission on exempting replacement payments from the imputation rules be declined. • The submission on introducing a tax credit transfer system be accepted. The system should be voluntary and should not impose any obligations on share issuers. 139 TREATMENT OF NON-FULLY IMPUTED DIVIDENDS Submission (28W – New Zealand Exchange Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association) A share user should not have to withhold RWT of 33% from a replacement payment made to the share supplier for unimputed or partially imputed dividends paid on the borrowed securities. Comment If a distribution is paid on a borrowed share during the term of a share-lending arrangement, the share supplier must receive a “replacement payment” from the share user. This is a normal commercial requirement for these transactions. The purpose of the replacement payment is to place the share supplier in the same position (as far as possible) as if they had received the actual distribution. When an unimputed or partially imputed New Zealand dividend is paid to a non- resident investor, the dividend will have NRWT of 15% (or 30% if there is no applicable double tax agreement) withheld from the payment. For example, on a $100 unimputed dividend, the non-resident investor will receive $85 in the hand. Under the proposed rules, when the non-resident lends those shares to a New Zealand resident share user, the dividend will have RWT of 33% withheld from that payment. When the share user makes a replacement payment to the non-resident lender, they will be required to fully impute this payment and pay RWT of 33% to fund these credits. The New Zealand Exchange Limited, while noting that the majority of New Zealand dividends are fully imputed, is concerned that this could mean that a non-resident share supplier may not be in the same position as if they had held the original shares throughout the period of the share-lending arrangement. The share-lending rules have been designed to ensure that the benefit of a dividend is received by the economic owner of the borrowed shares. The rules therefore require a share user to pay RWT to counter the tax deduction available for making a replacement payment. However, the proposed rules do not specify the amount of the replacement payment to be made, only that it is “intended to be economically equivalent in value to rewards of ownership to which the holder of the original share would be entitled”. Therefore, a share user is able to adjust the cash amount of the replacement payment to ensure this is equivalent to what the share supplier would have received as the recipient of the actual dividend. While increasing the amount of the cash replacement payment means more RWT is paid, the tax deduction available also increases by an equal amount. 14 14 For example, for a $100 unimputed dividend, the share user could make a cash replacement payment of $85. Under the proposed share-lending rules, the share user will be required to attach imputation credits of $42, generated by paying RWT of $42. However, they can obtain a tax deduction on the entire value of the replacement payment of $127 (worth $42). 140 This means that the non-resident investor will be in the same tax position as if they had received the actual distribution, assuming that they are unable to use the imputation credits. The requirement to fully impute the dividend (and pay the associated RWT) will be offset by a tax deduction for an equivalent amount. While there will be a timing difference between the payment of RWT and the ability to claim a tax deduction for the replacement payment, this can be reduced by factoring the tax deduction into provisional tax payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 141 NON-RESIDENT SHARE USERS Submissions (28W – New Zealand Exchange Limited, 31W – Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Amendments should be made so that non-resident share users can participate under the proposed rules, including: • that the requirement for share users to operate an ICA be removed; and • that a mechanism is introduced to allow non-resident share users to maintain an ICA for the purposes of share-lending arrangements. Comment As currently drafted, the share-lending rules allow only New Zealand-resident share users or borrowers to undertake share-lending arrangements. This is because a share user must operate an ICA. Non-resident companies are specifically prohibited from establishing and maintaining an ICA. This effectively means that only New Zealand- resident companies can be share users for the share-lending rules. Officials consider that the requirement to maintain an ICA is an important part of the proposed rules. To place the share supplier in the same tax position (as far as possible) as if they had received the actual distribution, a share user must be able to pass on imputation credits when these have been attached to the underlying dividend. This is only possible if the share user can maintain an ICA. If there was no requirement to ensure that a replacement payment mirrored the form of the underlying dividend, shareholders (non-residents or tax exempts) who were unable to use imputation credits would enter into a share-lending arrangement in order to “sell” these imputation credits. This would be contrary to the policy intent of the imputation rules. One possibility would be to allow non-residents who wanted to borrow shares from a New Zealand share supplier to maintain an ICA on a limited basis. However, this raises concerns about the ability of Inland Revenue to monitor the use of this account. Officials have been careful in designing the share-lending rules to counter possible avoidance risks and have agreed to closely monitor the implementation of the amendments for any unintended outcomes. The need to monitor non-resident borrowers would make this difficult. A second solution proposed by the New Zealand Exchange Limited and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants is for a separate “securities lending account” to be created, either just for non-residents or for all share-lending arrangements. This account could operate identically to an ICA, but could be operated by a non-resident to allow them to attach credits to replacement payments. Officials did consider the use of a separate memorandum account. However, this had significant administrative and compliance costs. 142 As a compromise, officials recommend the requirement to maintain an ICA be limited to those transactions which cross a dividend distribution date. Participants will also be able to make use of the credit transfer mechanism discussed earlier in this report. Recommendation That the submissions on removing the requirement to operate an ICA or allowing non- resident share users to maintain an ICA be declined. Instead, officials recommend that the requirement to maintain an ICA be limited to those transactions which cross a dividend date. Future consideration could be given to further expanding the rules to non-resident companies if the implementation of the current proposals is successful and does not give rise to any unintended outcomes. 143 NON-RESIDENT SHARE SUPPLIERS Submission (31W – Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed rules should be amended to allow for the payment of a supplementary dividend (or equivalent) so that that non-resident share suppliers can participate. Comment A general aim of the proposed share-lending rules is to keep share lenders in the same tax position they would have been in if they had not disposed of the underlying shares. Normally a non-resident shareholder would be subject to NRWT on any New Zealand dividend but could receive a supplementary dividend of the same value. Under the proposed share-lending rules, a non-resident share supplier is instead not subject to NRWT. Submitters have requested that the proposed share-lending rules be amended to allow for the payment of a supplementary dividend. Officials agree that, prima facie, non-resident share suppliers should be entitled to receive the equivalent of a supplementary dividend if this would have been available on the borrowed securities. However, the availability of a supplementary dividend is tied to a liability for NRWT. New Zealand is currently reviewing its position on NRWT treaty rates. Given the complexity of building supplementary dividends into the proposed rules, and the possibility that New Zealand’s NRWT treaty rates could change, officials recommend that this submission be declined at this stage. Recommendation That the submission on allowing for the payment of supplementary dividends be declined. 144 FOREIGN DIVIDENDS Submission (40 – Securities Industry Association, 47 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed rules should be amended to eliminate double taxation as a result of the dividend withholding payment (DWP) rules also applying to a share-lending arrangement. Comment The Securities Industry Association and the New Zealand Law Society are concerned about the relationship between the DWP rules and the proposed share-lending rules. Under the proposed rules, if a share supplier lends foreign shares to a New Zealand resident, dividends received would be subject to DWP. The replacement payment made to the share supplier would also be subject to RWT. Officials have modelled a variety of scenarios under the proposed share-lending rules. In the majority of situations these put the lender in the same tax position as if they had continued to hold the shares as well as ensuring that the same amount of New Zealand tax is collected pre and post any share-lending arrangement. However, officials agree that this is not achieved for all scenarios. The specific issue could be reviewed if the industry and officials come up with a workable alternative in the future. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the legislation should provide for the transfer of DWP credits. 145 REPLACEMENT SHARES Submissions (31W – Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submitters have suggested changes to the definition of replacement shares, including that: • the requirement to return identical shares should be waived in certain limited circumstances; • the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be given the discretion to approve transactions as still qualifying under the share-lending rules; • there should be greater certainty to cover situations when a share-lending arrangement cannot be completed. Comment The definition of a “share-lending arrangement” requires identical shares to be returned to the share supplier upon termination of the transaction. In general, the industry agrees with this requirement. However, submitters have suggested that share-lending arrangements affected by certain events such as the receivership or insolvency of the share user, receivership of the share issuer, the share issuer being subject to corporate action or shares being no longer listed or traded, should continue to qualify under the proposed rules (and there should be no disposal for tax purposes). The intention of the proposed share-lending rules is to keep the share supplier in the same tax position as if they had retained the shares. For corporate events such as the amalgamation, liquidation or takeover of the issuer, which would have affected the share supplier if they had continued to hold the shares, the same tax treatment should apply. Therefore, a disposal should arise (at the time that the event occurs) where these shares are part of a share-lending arrangement. Recommendations That the submissions on the definition of a replacement share be declined. Officials consider that further consultation is required on the treatment of share-lending transactions where it is not possible, due to default of the share user or a corporate action, to return replacement shares. 146 12-MONTH RESTRICTION Submission (31W – Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association) The 12-month time limit for returning shares should be removed. Comment A share-lending arrangement is defined as a returning securities transfer that meets a number of further requirements, including that the term of the transfer is 12 calendar months or less. The Securities Industry Association and Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited have submitted that the 12-month restriction is arbitrary, will prevent participants from adopting longer term hedging or trading strategies, and could lead to reduced liquidity. They consider that the 12-month restriction should be removed. The 12-month restriction is consistent with the rules adopted in Australia. As the rule allows a special treatment outside the ordinary tax rules, it is important to clearly identify those transactions which qualify. The majority of share-lending transactions have terms of less than one year. Officials therefore consider that this is an identifying characteristic of these transactions and that the limitation should be retained. For those taxpayers wishing to adopt longer term strategies, the rules permit the roll-over of qualifying transactions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 147 COLLATERAL Submission (31W – Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited, 40 – Securities Industry Association) The tax treatment of collateral provided as part of a share-lending arrangement should be clarified. Comment It is normal commercial practice for share-lending arrangements to require the share user to post collateral with the share supplier. This collateral may take the form of cash or other securities. The Securities Industry Association and Goldman Sachs JBWere (NZ) Limited have submitted that the tax treatment of collateral provided as part of a share-lending arrangement should be clarified. In particular, the transfer of, or changes in, collateral provided by the share user to the share supplier should not be a taxable event. Officials agree that the provision (and returning) of collateral as part of a share- lending arrangement should not be a taxable event. Similarly, changes in the level or make-up of that collateral should not be subject to tax. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. 148 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES Submissions (47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submissions have been made about the proposed share-lending anti-avoidance rules, in particular that: • The securities lending and anti-avoidance parts of the proposals should be separately considered. • The anti-avoidance rules should be referred for wider consultation. • Only one anti-avoidance measure should apply to any returning securities transfer. Comment Introduction of the proposed share-lending rules The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants has submitted that the securities lending and anti-avoidance proposals should be separately considered and that the anti-avoidance rules should be referred for wider consultation. Officials disagree with this submission (subject to the subsequent comments on the NRWT anti-avoidance rule). Any change to the tax treatment of share-lending must simultaneously address the risk to the tax base of adopting an economic substance over legal form approach. The strengthening of associated anti-avoidance measures as part of introducing special tax rules for share-lending is consistent with the approach taken in other international jurisdictions, such as Australia and the United Kingdom. The anti-avoidance rules are also needed to counter existing transactions which are using the lack of rules to trade imputation credits and circumvent the NRWT rules. It is estimated that tax lost to date from such transactions is in excess of $100 million. The proposed anti-avoidance rules were included in the November 2003 government discussion document on securities lending and have been subject to the full generic tax policy process. Single anti-avoidance measure The New Zealand Law Society has submitted that only one anti-avoidance measure should apply to any returning securities transfer. The proposed anti-avoidance rules are primarily aimed at the trading of imputation credits. However, the draft legislation also contains measures to prevent taxpayers using share-lending to circumvent the NRWT rules. 149 Officials agree, that based on the draft legislation, it is possible that both the imputation and NRWT anti-avoidance rules could apply to a single transaction (cancelling the imputation credits and denying a deduction for the replacement payment). This would put the taxpayer in a negative rather than neutral position which was not the intention of the proposed rules. Given these technical difficulties, officials recommend the removal of the NRWT anti-avoidance rule until the government’s NRWT review has been completed. NRWT avoidance is not seen as a significant risk for share-lending transactions. The estimated $100 million of tax lost to date from these transactions relates solely to the trading of imputation credits. Recommendation Officials recommend that: • The submission on separately considering the securities lending and anti- avoidance proposals be declined. • The submission that only one anti-avoidance measure should apply to any returning securities transfer be accepted. The NRWT anti-avoidance rule should be removed at least until the government’s NRWT review has been completed. 150 DRAFTING Submission (40 – Securities Industry Association, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Several drafting references should be corrected or clarified, including: • That the reference to share user at the end of section CD 44(1)(b) be changed to share supplier. • That subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) be deleted from section DB 12B. Comment Section CD 44 Officials agree with the Securities Industry Association submission that the reference to “share user” at the end of section CD 44(1)(b) is incorrect. However, if officials’ recommendations with respect to the relationship between the proposed share-lending rules and revenue account property provisions are accepted, this section will be removed. DB 12B(1)(b)(ii) The Securities Industry Association has submitted that the reference to an original share or replacement share acquired “when the share-lending arrangement ends” should be deleted as it is inconsistent with the wording of other sections (sections CX 44B(1)(c) and DB 12C(1)(b)) and could cause confusion. Officials agree. However, if officials’ recommendations with respect to the relationship between the proposed share-lending rules and revenue account property provisions are accepted, this provision will be removed. Recommendation Officials agree with both submissions. However, if officials’ recommendations with respect to the relationship between the proposed share-lending rules and revenue account property provisions are accepted, these provisions will be removed. 151 OFFICIALS’ RECOMMENDATIONS Officials also recommend making the following amendments to clarify the proposed share-lending rules and ensure they operate as intended: • Amending the references to “a party” in the proposed share-lending rules to also cover associated persons of that party. Officials are concerned taxpayers may be able to structure their affairs around the proposed rules as currently drafted by using associated persons. • Amending the definition of a “returning securities transfer” to deal with arrangements utilising options. The current wording implies upfront agreement regarding the future transfer of the shares, which may not be satisfied when the shares are subject to an option. • Clarifying the definition of a “returning securities transfer” by referring to key terms directly rather than putting these in brackets. For example, share supplier, share user, original share, replacement share and replacement payment. • Deleting the reference to “substitute” in the definition of original share. The current wording could imply that a share in some other company could be returned as a substitute. • Removing the words “receives” and “acquires” at the beginning of paragraphs (a) and (b) (respectively) in the definition of replacement share as they are redundant. • Amending the definition of “replacement share” to make it clear that a share user can have a replacement share. • Including the requirement for the replacement share to confer the same rights and impose the same obligations on the holder in the definition of a replacement share (currently in the definition of a returning securities transfer). • Deleting clause 64 as section EW 32 is no longer relevant to the proposed share- lending rules. • Including a specific anti-avoidance provision in the share-lending rules to target arrangements structured to defeat the application of the rules. • Replacing the term “replacement share” with “identical share”. 152 153 Allocation of research and development tax deductions 154 155 OVERVIEW The amendments in the bill will allow taxpayers to allocate certain research and development (R&D) tax deductions to income years after the year in which the related expenditure (including a depreciation loss) is incurred. This new tax treatment will be optional. However, those who choose this approach must allocate R&D deductions against income resulting from R&D expenditure. The result is a better matching of income and expenditure for taxpayers who opt in. In particular, the tax benefit of a taxpayer company’s R&D expenditure will not be lost as a result of a significant change in their shareholding. Technology companies, in particular, often have a long lead-in period in which they incur major expenditure before realising income from it. Under current law they can lose R&D tax deductions if they bring in new investors after their initial development stage. The changes in the bill will better suit the growth cycle of these companies. Most of the pre-commercial production expenditure of start-up technology companies will qualify for the new treatment. The amendments will apply from the 2005–06 income year. Four submissions were received on these amendments. All the submissions supported the general principle of the amendments, which is to achieve a better matching of the timing of tax deductions for R&D expenditure with the timing of income resulting from that expenditure. The submissions also proposed a number of technical amendments. 156 DEDUCTIONS UNDER THE GENERAL PROVISIONS Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A person should be entitled to also allocate to a later income year research and development (R&D) expenditure that is deductible under the general deductibility provisions in subpart DA. In some circumstances, a person will be entitled to a deduction for R&D expenditure on the basis that R&D is an ordinary part of the person’s business and hence is not of a capital nature. In these circumstances, the taxpayer does not need to rely on section DB 26 to obtain a deduction for the R&D expenditure as the capital prohibition in section DA 2(1) does not apply. The new rules should apply to all deductible expenditure on R&D regardless of the provision under which the primary entitlement to the deduction arises. Comment Officials consider the proposed amendment to be unnecessary because all R&D expenditure on revenue account (and therefore not of a capital nature) would still come within the main R&D deduction provision in section DB 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Any deduction allowed under section DB 26 will qualify under the new rules and can be allocated to future income years. Section DB 26 allows taxpayers a deduction for R&D expenditure if the expenditure does not satisfy all the asset recognition criteria contained in Financial Reporting Standard 13 (FRS-13). The main group of persons that section DB 26 applies to are those who recognise R&D expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes under paragraph 5.1 or 5.2 of FRS-13. Entities which qualify for exemption in accordance with the framework for differential reporting are not required to comply with paragraph 5 of FRS-13 – for example, small companies. However, it is still possible for any entity which qualifies for differential reporting to have their R&D expenditure covered by section DB 26. All they need to do is to recognise the expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes under paragraphs 5.1 or 5.2 of FRS-13. In other words, although such entities are not required to apply FRS-13 they are not prevented from doing so and therefore coming within the ambit of section DB 26. Section DB 26 also automatically applies to persons who incur expenditure of $10,000 or less on R&D in a tax year. This is a minimum threshold provision for small taxpayers who would often qualify for differential reporting. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 157 DEPRECIATION ISSUES Issue: Depreciation of assets used for market development Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The allocation rules should apply to depreciation of assets used for market development as well as to assets used for R&D. It is likely that some assets used in the market development of a product will not be used in carrying out the R&D for the product. The policy intent is that depreciation deductions for assets used in all activities covered by the proposed allocation rules should be covered by the new rules. Comment Officials agree that depreciation deductions for assets used for R&D and for market development of products resulting from R&D should both be covered by the new allocation rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Loss on sale of an asset Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) It should be clarified that the deduction for any loss suffered on the sale or disposal of a depreciable asset should be able to be allocated to a later income year in the same way that the depreciation on that asset can be allocated to a later year. Comment Officials consider that the proposed amendment is unnecessary because it is already clear that a loss on disposal of a depreciable asset comes within the definition of “depreciation loss”. In particular, the legislation provides that: • A “depreciation loss” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 as a loss that a person has in the circumstances set out in section EE 1(2). • Section EE 1(2) provides, inter alia, that the amount of depreciation loss is calculated under sections EE 9 to EE 11. 158 • Section EE 11(4) provides that a person has an amount of depreciation loss calculated under section EE 41(2) for a disposal or event to which that provision applies. • Section EE 41(2) allows an amount of depreciation loss to the extent that the consideration received from the disposal is less than the item’s tax book value. Officials therefore consider that the legislation is sufficiently clear on this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 159 MARKET DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement in proposed section EJ 20 that market expenditure must be incurred before the person first derives assessable income from the use of the R&D product to qualify for the new treatment should be omitted. The reason for the inclusion of these criteria is to ensure that regular advertising expenditure cannot qualify for the new treatment. However, this requirement is not necessary to achieve this objective and will exclude some expenditure that should be covered by the rules. This is because some income may be earned during the development phase – for example, from the sale of prototypes. The best indication that market development is completed is the start of commercial production, which is another requirement in section EJ 20. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement in proposed section EJ 20 that the expenditure be incurred before commercial production of the R&D product starts should be omitted. A deduction should not depend on whether commercial production development has begun. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EJ 20 should be amended by deleting the reference to “market development”. It is possible that the words “market development” will create difficulties in interpretation. There appears to be a significant reason for the rule relating to the allocation of expenditure by a start-up entity to be restricted to market development expenditure. New section EJ 20 should apply to all expenditure incurred by a company in relation to a product that has resulted from R&D expenditure in the period until commercial production is commenced. The proposed section EJ 21(2) could also result in interpretation difficulties if proposed section EJ 20 applies only to market development expenditure. It will be difficult to prove that assessable income “would not have been derived but for” the market development expenditure. The linkage between market development expenditure and assessable income may not be a clear one. (New Zealand Law Society) Alternative submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The words “the use of” in proposed section EJ 20(1)(b) should be deleted since income may be derived from the sale of the product rather than its use. Comment Officials agree that proposed section EJ 20(1)(b), requiring market development expenditure to be incurred before the person first derives assessable income, may exclude some market development expenditure that should be covered by the new rules. This is because some income, such as from the sale of prototypes, may be earned during the development phase. However, the other requirement in proposed section EJ 20(1)(c) that the expenditure is incurred before the start of commercial 160 production of the R&D product would only cater for situations involving the sale of goods. It would not cater for the situation where the R&D product is a service. Officials therefore consider that while proposed section EJ 20(1)(b) should be omitted, proposed section EJ 20(1)(c) should be amended so it applies to both goods and services. This will ensure that general advertising expenditure does not qualify under the new rules. The proposed requirement that the market development expenditure must be incurred before the person begins commercial production of the R&D product is a timing provision only. The deductions for market development must already be allowed under the deduction enabling provisions in Part D of the Income Tax Act 2004. Proposed section EJ 20 is concerned only with whether certain deductions for market development of a product resulting from R&D expenditure should qualify for the new allocation treatment. The proposed requirement that the market development expenditure must be incurred before the person begins commercial production of the product to qualify for the new treatment is consistent with FRS-13, which the main R&D production provision in section DB 26 is based on. FRS-13 allows expenditure on market research activities undertaken prior to the beginning of commercial production to establish the usefulness of a product or the existence of a potential market, to be treated as development costs to which the standard applies. The fact that commercial production has started therefore operates as an objective indication that the market development stage of an R&D product is completed. Expenditure incurred on promoting a product after its commercial production has started should be treated as a regular advertising expense and subject to normal income tax timing rules (that is, it should be recognised in the year the expenditure is incurred). The reference to “market development” in proposed section EJ 20 has been developed in consultation with representatives from relevant technology sector groups. “Market development” has a generally accepted commercial meaning and should not create difficulties in interpretation. New section EJ 20 would be inappropriately wide if it applied to all expenditure (not just market development expenditure) incurred by a company in relation to a product resulting from R&D expenditure until commercial production has started. As noted above, the reference to “market development” is also consistent with FRS-13. Recommendation That the primary submissions be accepted to the extent of omitting proposed section EJ 20(1)(b) and amending section EJ 20(1)(c) to ensure it applies to both goods and services. 161 TIMING ISSUES Issue: Ordering of deductions Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The effect of the ordering rule in proposed section EJ 21(3) is that deferred expenditure must be deducted from gross income before any deduction is claimed for expenditure which has not been deferred. To achieve the full policy intent, the proposed ordering rule should be reversed so that deferred expenditure should be deducted only after all current year expenditure and depreciation has been deducted. After commercial production has begun, a company may still require additional equity injections which may result in shareholder continuity being breached during the commercial production phase. If it takes five years to deduct all the deferred R&D expenditure, for those five years, the current year expenditure will result in losses that must be carried forward. In the event that a breach in shareholder continuity occurs (for example, in year three of commercial production because further capital is required) those losses will be forfeited. This result is inappropriate because it does not match the current year expenditure to the income derived from that expenditure and may result in deductions for current year expenditure being forfeited even though income will continue to be derived from the product. The most appropriate way to resolve this is to allow current year expenditure to be deducted before deferred R&D expenditure. Comment Officials do not consider it would be consistent with the policy underlying the reform to require current year expenditure to be deducted before deferred R&D expenditure. The amendments are based on achieving a better matching of the timing of tax deductions for R&D expenditure with the timing of income resulting from that expenditure. This treatment recognises that taxpayers in the development period of an R&D project are developing assets for the purpose of earning income in future periods instead of incurring economic losses in the initial development stage. The current tax treatment results in R&D expenditure being recognised too early in relation to when the resulting income is recognised. The current mismatch in the early recognition of expenditure and the later recognition of income means that the deductions for R&D expenditure of a company may be inappropriately lost when there is a shareholding change in the company. This is particularly problematic for technology companies whose growth cycle typically has a long lead-in period and significant expenditure is incurred before any income is realised. It is part of the normal financing process for such companies to bring in additional equity investors after the initial development work has been successful, but before commercial production has started. 162 It is appropriate for deferred R&D expenditure from earlier years to be offset first against any current year income resulting from that expenditure based on the application of a first-in, first-out principle. Normal income tax rules should otherwise apply once commercial production has started. As described earlier, the primary objective of the reform is to achieve a better matching of R&D expenditure with resulting income and to ensure that shareholding changes occurring before commercial production starts, and income is earned, do not result in R&D deductions being forfeited. It is not a particular objective of the reform to mitigate the effect of shareholding changes on the carry-forward losses after a company has begun commercial production of an R&D product. Instead, normal income tax rules should apply, which is the case under the proposed amendments. The proposed amendment to require deferred expenditure to be deducted only after all current year expenditure and depreciation has been deducted would also significantly increase the complexity of the rules because the deferred deduction would be treated more like an available net loss than another current year deduction in the year of recognition. In particular, the amendment would require the calculation of an interim net income figure (gross income less all expenditure and depreciation incurred in the current year), something which the Act does not currently provide for. It is also noted that any current year R&D expenditure qualifies for the new treatment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Allocation against resulting R&D income Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be no requirement that the R&D expenditure can only be offset against income resulting from that expenditure. There are serious compliance costs in tracking the expenditure and trying to identify which income arises from the expenditure. There are also apportionment problems where the expenses of the business have to be apportioned between R&D producing income and non-R&D producing income. A single purpose R&D business is fine under these rules but a start-up business with a mix of projects is a problem. The submission expresses concern that taxpayers will not use the provisions as they are currently drafted. It requires differentiation between successful and non-successful R&D projects. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 163 Draft section EJ 21(2)(a) should be amended to refer to “assessable income derived from the use or disposal of the product that has resulted from the expenditure incurred by the person on research and development”. The proposed section currently uses a “but for” test. There may be considerable difficulties in establishing the link to this standard. An example is when expenditure is incurred in developing a market from which no revenue is ultimately generated. The wording in the bill will not allow this expenditure to be allocated to a year after that in which it is incurred. (New Zealand Law Society) Alternative submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An alternative approach that merits consideration is a rule where it is possible to have a special-purpose subsidiary that has full deductibility for R&D expenditure. Comment The proposed requirement that taxpayers must allocate their deferred tax deductions against income resulting from R&D expenditure is necessary as a tax base protection measure to ensure that taxpayers do not use their R&D tax deductions to shelter their non-R&D income. The requirement is also consistent with the policy underlying the new treatment of achieving a better matching of deductions for R&D expenditure with the income resulting from that expenditure. This requirement has been developed in consultation with representatives from relevant technology sector groups. Overall, the design of the new rules for allocating R&D tax deductions is simple, and officials consider that the proposed rules will be able to be applied in practice. The rules do not require differentiation between successful and non-successful projects. In particular, expenditure incurred on unsuccessful R&D projects can be matched against income resulting from successful R&D projects. Most R&D expenditure is already fully deductible so the alternative approach suggested is already possible. It would not be appropriate to fully exempt a special- purpose subsidiary engaged in R&D from the shareholder continuity rules because the policy reasons for these rules are of general application. The policy underlying the proposed reform, which is to achieve a better matching of deductions for R&D expenditure with income resulting from that expenditure, is not inconsistent with the policy underlying the shareholder continuity rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 164 Issue: Further options for the timing of the deferred deduction Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section EJ 21(2), which governs the timing of the deferred deduction, should be amended to include the following options: • allowing a continuity of business test as exists in a number of jurisdictions overseas, limited only to the R&D expenditure aspect; • allowing all R&D expenditure to be carried forward regardless of shareholding changes. Comment The government has previously considered and rejected a general business continuity test for the following reasons: • It is contrary to the main policy underlying the loss carry forward rules, which is to prevent the trading of losses between unrelated parties. • It is the experience of other countries that the test is difficult to apply in practice, creating both complexity and uncertainty. • A general business continuity test could potentially lock companies into businesses that are only marginally profitable and do not represent the best use of capital. • A general business continuity test could have significant revenue implications. Many of these reasons for not favouring a general business continuity test will also apply to a business continuity test limited to R&D expenditure. There are also no grounds for giving a separate exemption from the shareholding continuity rules to R&D expenditure. Such an exemption would not be based on the sound policy principles underlying the proposals in the bill which is to achieve a better match between the timing of tax deductions for R&D expenditure and the timing of income resulting from that expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 165 EXTENDING PROPOSALS Issue: Extending the rules to all start-up expenditure Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reform should be extended beyond R&D to all start-up expenditure. The rules are too subjective. Section DB 26 allows other expenditure types such as overheads to be allocated to R&D, which seems to support a broader approach. In particular, all small companies should be able to elect for all significant start-up expenditure to be allocated to a memorandum account. This could apply to, say, the first five years of business. They could then elect for this expenditure to be allowed as a deduction once taxable profits are made. This would then allow the start-up expenditure to be allocated to income irrespective of the continuity of a shareholding. Alternative submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Small businesses should be exempt from the shareholder continuity rules. The compliance costs for conforming to the shareholder continuity rules are onerous for small business. Comment It would not be consistent with the policy underlying this reform to extend it to all start-up expenditure. The amendments in the bill are based on achieving a better matching of the timing of tax deductions for R&D expenditure with the timing of income resulting from that expenditure. The current tax treatment results in R&D expenditure being recognised too early in relation to when the resulting income is recognised. This current mismatch in the early recognition of expenditure and the later recognition of income means that deductions for R&D expenditure of the company may be inappropriately lost when there is a shareholding change in the company. However, this mismatch rationale for the proposed amendments does not apply to all start-up expenditure. There is no mismatch under current timing rules in the recognition of some start-up expenditure and income resulting from that expenditure. For example, in the case of a rental property there is no mismatch in the timing of the relevant expenditure and rental income. Officials do not agree that the proposed rules are too subjective. For example, the main type of expenditure covered by the proposed rules comes within section DB 26, which is the main R&D deduction provision in the Income Tax Act 2004. This provision, in turn, is based on the application of the objective criteria in FRS-13. 166 R&D expenditure covered by section DB 26, and therefore by the proposed allocation treatment may include overhead costs (other than interest) such as rent and power. There is no policy justification for generally exempting small businesses from the shareholding continuity rules for carrying forward tax losses. Such an exemption would be contrary to the main policy underlying these rules, which is to prevent the trading of losses between unrelated parties. The proposal is also not appropriate because it would require a hard to define boundary between small businesses and other businesses. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Extension of proposals to petroleum mining Submission (2 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand, 47 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed new rules should be extended to petroleum prospecting and exploration expenditure. Like technology companies, petroleum exploration companies are faced with long lead-in times in which they incur significant prospecting and exploration expenditure before they realise income from that expenditure. The current tax treatment results in such expenditure being recognised considerably in advance of the resulting income being derived. For new companies in particular the prospecting and exploration expenditure is often funded by new equity investors. The introduction of these new investors may breach the shareholder continuity requirements for carrying forward tax losses. Comment The proposals in the bill are concerned only with achieving a better matching of the timing of tax deductions for R&D expenditure with the timing of income resulting from that expenditure. Although R&D expenditure may not be the only type of expenditure when these timing issues arise, extending the proposed treatment to other types of expenditure is outside the scope of this bill. Also, there may be other significant issues concerning these other types of expenditure which need to be properly considered. Proper consideration of all relevant issues is best achieved through the generic tax policy process. This process places a major emphasis on consultation at each of the main stages of the process with taxpayers, their advisors and professional and industry bodies. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 167 Issue: Recommendations for a Tax Information Bulletin article Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Tax Information Bulletin article on these amendments should make it clear that if a company incurs R&D expenditure on a number of projects, some of which are successful and some of which are not, all of the expenditure, including the expenditure that does not result directly in a product, can be allocated under proposed section EJ 21. Comment Officials agree it is the intention of the proposed amendments that R&D expenditure incurred on unsuccessful projects can be allocated against income from successful R&D projects. Officials will reiterate this aspect in the Tax Information Bulletin article on these amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Need to address “black hole” R&D expenditure Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is still a need to address the “black hole” issue for R&D expenditure. “Black hole” expenditure is simply any expenditure that is capital (other than land) that does not result in a depreciable asset. Such expenditure should be available as a deduction, one way or the other (depreciable or expensed). Comment The issue of black hole R&D expenditure is on the tax policy work programme for consideration. Since the enactment of the new R&D expenditure tax rules in 2001 (now contained in sections DB 26 and DB 27 of the Income Tax Act 2004) there would be less R&D black hole expenditure for which no deduction is available. This is because under the current tax rules R&D costs that do not satisfy all the asset recognition criteria in FRS-13 can be deducted immediately. Theoretically, some R&D expenditure may result in an asset (and therefore cannot be deducted under section DB 26) but the asset is not a depreciable asset for income tax purposes. After the 2001 rules were enacted, officials consulted with the private sector to identify any specific remaining examples of black hole expenditure. As a result, legislation was enacted in the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 to ensure that expenditure on failed patent and failed Resource Management Act consent applications could be 168 immediately deducted as an expense. Officials do not believe that a “catch-all” R&D black hole expenditure provision is needed and are not aware of further examples of R&D black hole expenditure. However, taxpayers and their advisers are welcome to bring further examples to officials’ attention, and the issue does merit further consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 169 Corporate migration 170 171 OVERVIEW The bill introduces amendments to ensure that migrating companies pay tax on their worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand, and that the rules are consistent with the tax rules that apply on liquidation. The changes are intended to remove incentives for companies to migrate for tax reasons. A company resident in New Zealand is liable for New Zealand tax on its worldwide income. However, a company is currently able to migrate without having necessarily paid tax on income that was earned while it was resident. Under the changes in the bill, a migrating company will be treated as if it had realised all assets, liquidated, and fully distributed its proceeds to shareholders prior to migration. The changes will apply to companies migrating on or after 21 March 2005, the date these changes were announced by the government. Six submissions were received on the corporate migration amendments. The main issues concerned the application date of the amendments and the treatment of capital gains. Officials are recommending a limited grandparenting provision for companies that had done everything within their control to migrate by 21 March 2005, but had not yet become non-resident. While realised capital gains will generally be excluded from the distribution that is taxed, a consequence of alignment with the liquidation rules is that they will be included for non-resident related corporate shareholders. Officials do not support changing this aspect of the reform. However, it is proposed that this issue be separately reviewed. 172 WITHDRAW PROPOSED LEGISLATION Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed changes for the taxation of migrating companies are incorrect from a policy perspective and should not be enacted. The government should consider withdrawing the proposed legislation. Comment New Zealand wishes to tax its residents on their worldwide income. However, companies are currently able to migrate without having paid tax on some of their worldwide income that was earned while they were resident in New Zealand. For example, any increase in the value of offshore revenue account property, 15 such as a forest, that accrued during their New Zealand residence is not taxed in New Zealand if the company migrates and the property is then sold. Similarly, reserves generated during residency may not be entirely captured in New Zealand’s tax base. Distributions to resident shareholders would still be subject to tax, although offset to some extent by credits for tax paid on the distribution in the company’s new country of residence. However, distributions made to non-resident shareholders would not be taxed in New Zealand at all as the company is no longer a New Zealand-resident company. On the liquidation of a New Zealand company, distributions of retained earnings to shareholders are treated as a dividend subject to income tax. Distributions of capital profits as well as retained earnings to non-resident related companies are treated as a dividend subject to NRWT. Therefore a higher portion of economic income is captured in the New Zealand tax base when a New Zealand company liquidates compared with when it migrates. This creates an avenue for obtaining a tax advantage as companies may choose the option with the lighter tax. For example, a company wishing to liquidate may first migrate before doing so. While migration and liquidation are not exact substitutes, they are close equivalents for tax purposes; both involve the taxpayer leaving the New Zealand tax base so neutrality between them is desirable. Almost all OECD countries have some form of exit tax on migration so New Zealand is simply moving closer to the treatment in comparable jurisdictions. The proposed changes can therefore be seen as filling an anomalous gap in New Zealand’s tax laws. The changes will remove incentives for companies to migrate for tax reasons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Other than financial arrangements that are generally taxed on an accrual basis. 173 APPLICATION DATE Issue: Application date: grandparenting provision Submissions (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 – Pacific Hydro, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date of the proposed rules should be amended to exclude companies that were committed to migrating before 21 March 2005. (Pacific Hydro, PricewaterhouseCoopers) A company could have committed itself to the migration process as early as approval has been given by the board of directors, and should not be caught with the new rules. It should not be necessary for the company to have progressed the migration to the stage that an application has been made to a foreign registrar for registration. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Alternative submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The application date of the proposed rules should be amended so that the rules do not apply to companies that became non-resident on or before 21 March 2005. Alternative submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Any company that had an application for approval for a corporate migration with Inland Revenue on 21 March 2005 should be excluded from the new rules. Comment Officials agree that a grandparenting provision should apply to companies that, before 21 March 2005, completed the statutory requirements for migrating companies relating to public notification, shareholder approval, Inland Revenue clearance and solvency, and that have applied to a foreign registrar for registration. These objective criteria are based on a company having completed all steps within its control before 21 March 2005 to migrate a company out of New Zealand. A company committed to migrating before 21 March 2005 that satisfies these criteria would be excluded from the new corporate migration rules. Officials do not agree that a company has committed itself to migrating merely by its board of directors passing a resolution to that effect. This is only an initial step and there are many others that are within its control, such as public notification and obtaining shareholder approval. 174 Recommendation That the submissions seeking a grandparenting provision along the lines described in the comment above be accepted. Issue: Prospective application date Submission (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Any new legislation affecting migrating companies should only have a prospective application date so that non-resident investors can plan future investment into New Zealand. Comment The proposals should apply on or after 21 March 2005 (the date of their announcement) to minimise the risk of companies migrating before the legislation is enacted to obtain the tax advantages under the current law. The application date of 21 March 2005 means there is no window of opportunity to exploit the weaknesses in the current law before amendments are enacted. If the proposals applied only to future investment, a number of concerns would arise: • Investment patterns would be distorted through the use of existing companies as opposed to new companies as a vehicle for new investment. • There would be significant loss of tax revenue should existing companies choose to migrate. • Distinguishing existing and new companies would lead to comparable investments facing different tax consequences, undermining the neutrality benefits of the proposal. Alternative submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The amendments should only have effect from the date on which the bill was introduced. Comment The concerns discussed under the previous submission also apply if the amendments applied from the date of the bill’s introduction. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 175 Issue: Unapproved applications Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Companies that have applied for, but have not yet received, Inland Revenue approval to migrate should be entitled to have their application put “on hold” pending finalisation of the legislation. This will provide companies with the opportunity to fully consider the tax implications of migrating from New Zealand before deciding whether to proceed with their proposed migration. There should be transitional rules to allow companies in the middle of a migration to be reinstated to their pre-migration status. Comment There is nothing to preclude companies seeking to put their application to migrate on hold or to withdraw their application from making a request to the Inland Revenue staff member considering the application. Recommendation Note that companies are currently entitled to put their application for Inland Revenue clearance to migrate on hold. 176 TAXATION OF CAPITAL GAINS TO NON-RESIDENTS Submissions (29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 42W – Ernst & Young, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submissions seek removal of what they regard as a current anomaly whereby capital gains can be distributed tax-free to New Zealand shareholders but are subject to non- resident withholding tax when paid to non-resident corporate shareholders that are related. Alternatively, as submitted by Ernst & Young, the capital dividend exclusion should be extended to those foreign corporate investors which can demonstrate that any tax paid in New Zealand on capital dividends would not be creditable against any tax payable in their home country. Ernst & Young also submit that if the current proposal proceeds then taxing capital gains to non-residents should be subject to consultation as a separate matter. Submissions suggest that the different tax treatment between distributions paid to New Zealand-resident shareholders and non-resident shareholders is contrary to the non-discrimination articles in many of New Zealand’s double tax agreements. These broadly require that residents of the relevant country are not subject to tax in New Zealand, which is more burdensome than taxes imposed on a New Zealand resident in the same circumstances. The proposals are likely to entrench further a preference towards other investment vehicles into New Zealand such as trusts and branches. The existing rules are clearly inequitable for those foreign investors that cannot, in terms of their own corporate or home tax rules, invest abroad other than through a subsidiary of their foreign parent company. Comment The existing liquidation rules generally exempt from tax the capital gains component of dividend distributions received by all shareholders – with the exception of related non-resident corporate shareholders. The proposed new corporate migration rules follow this approach. Under the current dividend rules, all distributions of capital gains outside liquidation are taxable as dividends. Most companies potentially affected by the corporate migration proposal face a choice between liquidation and migration. By matching the approach taken on liquidation, the corporate migration proposal goes some way towards ensuring that similar investments face similar tax consequences. Officials have previously reported on these issues and will raise them again with the government as part of the new tax policy work programme. 177 Officials do not agree that these rules are contrary to non-discrimination articles. The submission refers to Article 24 of the New Zealand/Indian DTA. However, paragraph 4 of the article expressly allows both countries to have different rules for residents and non-residents. It is an acknowledged feature of our tax system that different tax rules can apply to different investment vehicles. For example, because a branch of a foreign company is not a separate legal entity, its tax treatment does differ significantly from that of a New Zealand-resident company. In particular, NRWT cannot apply on distributions of profit from a branch to its overseas head office as any payment is within the same company. The different treatments are not significantly worsened by the proposal. Ernst & Young submitted that the capital dividend exclusion be extended to those foreign corporate investors which can demonstrate that any tax paid in New Zealand on capital dividends would not be creditable against any tax payable in their home country. Officials consider that New Zealand’s tax treatment should not be governed by the particular tax laws in the non-resident shareholder’s home country. Also, some countries deny foreign tax credits in cases where the tax laws of foreign countries impose tax on non-resident investors only if a credit for the tax is available in their home country. Officials estimate that the amount of tax foregone if capital gains were excluded from the dividend that is taxed for non-resident related corporate shareholders would be, on average, about $20 – $30 million per annum. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but note that officials will report to the government on the distinction in the liquidation and migration rules between non-resident related corporate shareholders and other shareholders. 178 TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND VALUATION OF ASSETS Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The progress of the proposals should be deferred until further work is undertaken, in consultation with industry bodies and other interested parties, to determine the possible implications of the proposed rules for high technology industries in New Zealand. Comment There is no ground for exempting a particular industry sector from the corporate migration rules. The reasons for the corporate migration rules have general application and should apply to any New Zealand-resident company that migrates regardless of the type of activity it is involved in. New Zealand has recently introduced or announced a number of tax measures to reduce barriers to technology investment in New Zealand. For example: • Since late last year, gains from the sale of shares in unlisted companies held on revenue account have been exempt from tax for certain non-resident investors. • Proposed legislation in this bill will exempt non-resident investors from tax on the sale of shares in companies that they have invested into alongside the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Limited. • Proposed legislation in this bill improves access to tax deductions for research and development expenditure for companies that bring in new equity investors after their initial development stage. • A limited partnership regime is also to be introduced into New Zealand. It will have separate legal personality and a flow-through (partnership) tax treatment. • Investment tax changes are to be introduced that will remove the current disincentive for New Zealanders to save via investment funds. This should increase the level of domestic private equity available from funds for use in New Zealand. This will send an important profitability signal to potential non- resident investors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 179 EXTENT OF APPLICATION OF RULES Issue: Breadth of proposed rules Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed rules are significantly broader than required to achieve the stated policy objective of removing the incentives for companies to migrate rather than liquidate for tax reasons. Instead of the proposed rules, a targeted anti-avoidance provision should be introduced that applies in circumstances when the primary purpose of a company ceasing to be New Zealand tax resident is tax avoidance. Comment The proposed changes will fill an anomalous gap in New Zealand’s tax laws by ensuring that migrating companies pay tax on their worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand. Therefore, they should have general application to any New Zealand-resident company that migrates rather than be limited to avoidance cases only. Any limitation to avoidance cases would also create uncertainty as it would be difficult to define when a migration had occurred for tax avoidance reasons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Limiting amendments to change of place of incorporation Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules should apply only to corporate migrations occurring by a change in the place of incorporation, and not to companies that change their residence. Comment New Zealand loses the right to tax a company’s worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand whenever the company becomes non-resident, and not just when its place of incorporation is shifted from New Zealand to another country. For example, any increase in the value of a forest situated outside New Zealand that accrued when a company was resident in New Zealand is not currently subject to New Zealand income tax if the company ceases to be a New Zealand resident and the forest is then sold. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 180 Issue: Tax credits for non-resident shareholders Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 42W – Ernst & Young) Further work should be undertaken by officials on the potential impact that the proposed corporate migration rules will have on non-resident investors, in particular on tax credits for non-resident shareholders. Imposing a more onerous tax burden on non-residents is generally a disincentive to encourage foreign investment. Comment The ability for non-residents to claim tax credits in a foreign jurisdiction for New Zealand tax paid is determined by the foreign jurisdiction. New Zealand’s tax treatment should not be governed by the particular tax laws in the non-resident shareholder’s home country. Officials consider that a corporate migration exit tax that would apply at a modest rate only on previously untaxed income is not likely to be a big factor in a company’s decision to make a long-term permanent investment in New Zealand. Also, such an exit tax is a common feature of tax systems in comparable jurisdictions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 181 TIMING OF DISTRIBUTION Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Any distribution treated as being paid by a migrating company pursuant to proposed subpart FCB should be deemed to be paid six months after the date the company becomes non-resident. Comment Officials do not agree with shifting the time of the deemed distribution as it could affect the effectiveness of the rule changes. A company needs to be a New Zealand resident, and therefore fully within our taxing jurisdiction at the time of the deemed distribution. This is currently achieved under proposed section FCB 2, which treats the distribution as occurring immediately before the company becomes a non-resident. Officials acknowledge the amount of work involved in calculating the amount of tax payable under the corporate migration rules and consider the submitter’s concerns can be resolved by allowing a three-month extension of time for the payment of NRWT and RWT (and associated filing) relating to the corporate migration. This would not affect the timing of the distribution under proposed section FCB 2. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent of allowing a three-month extension of time for the payment of NRWT and RWT (and associated filing) relating to the corporate migration. 182 PROPOSED EXEMPTIONS Issue: Exemption for non-New Zealand sourced income derived before migration Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The retained earnings that arose prior to migration from non-New Zealand sourced income should be exempt from these rules. Comment The retained earnings of a company relating to its worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand are part of the New Zealand tax base and should therefore be subject to the corporate migration rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for retained earnings with no imputation credits Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Retained earnings with no attached imputation credit arising through a group loss claim should be exempt from the corporate migration rules. Comment If no tax is paid, and therefore no imputation credits are generated because of the use of losses, then subsequent dividends will be unimputed. This is a general feature of our tax system and is not special to the corporate migration rules. The submission is therefore inconsistent with the structure of New Zealand’s corporate tax system. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 183 Issue: Exemption for assets remaining in New Zealand Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Assets which are owned by a company that ceases to be New Zealand-resident, and which remain in New Zealand following the migration and continue to be subject to tax in New Zealand, should be excluded from the proposed rules. Comment An exclusion for assets that remain in New Zealand is unnecessary as the corporate migration rules provide that the assets are deemed to be re-acquired in New Zealand at the current market value. This will establish a new cost base to apply in the event of a subsequent disposal and remove any double taxation. In addition, it would be very complex to separately identify assets that remain in the New Zealand tax base and exclude them from the corporate migration rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption where parent company remains a New Zealand resident Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be an exemption from these rules when the ultimate parent company is still a New Zealand resident. Comment Even when the ultimate parent company remains a New Zealand resident, New Zealand still potentially loses some taxing rights – for example, if a company migrates to a grey list country. Therefore, it is still necessary to apply the corporate migration rules in this case to ensure that the company pays New Zealand tax on its worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand, which is the primary objective of the new corporate migration rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 184 Issue: Inward migration exemption Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The retained earnings of a company that migrates into New Zealand should be deemed to be an amount paid in consideration for the subscription of shares and should therefore form part of a company’s “available subscribed capital”. Comment New Zealand obtains full taxing rights over dividends paid out of retained earnings of a New Zealand-resident company whether or not the retained earnings accrued while the company was a New Zealand resident. New Zealand does not have comprehensive cost basis rules which apply when a non-resident becomes a New Zealand resident. For example, if a person holding shares in a company with retained earnings migrates to New Zealand, New Zealand has full taxing rights to any dividends subsequently received. The submission is therefore inconsistent with other features of New Zealand’s tax system. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 185 INTERACTION WITH DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society) Retained earnings of a migrating company that have not been taxable in New Zealand under a double tax agreement (DTA) should be deemed to be an amount paid in consideration for the subscription of shares, and should therefore form part of a company’s “available subscribed capital”. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Enactment should be accompanied by a Public Ruling, Interpretation Statement or other public comment (such as commentary in the Tax Information Bulletin) confirming that the proposals to treat corporate migrations as liquidations under New Zealand domestic law are not seeking to override the effect of the DTAs that New Zealand has concluded, nor deprive migrating companies (or shareholders of migrating companies) of the ability to claim relief from the impost of NRWT that may be available under a DTA. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The corporate migration rules apply only to companies that cease to be resident under domestic rules. The migration rules do not apply to dual-resident companies because the application of the rules would be too uncertain because it is difficult to ascertain the effect of other countries’ residence rules. Therefore there should be no increase to available subscribed capital to take account of the effect of a DTA. A dual-resident company is still resident in New Zealand and is treated as non-resident only for the purposes of the DTA. A DTA may limit certain taxing rights, but New Zealand still retains full taxing rights otherwise. There will be some discussion of the interaction between DTAs and the corporate migration rules in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the new law. Officials consider that the corporate migration rules are not inconsistent with DTAs. Recommendation That the submission to amend the rules be declined, and note there will be some discussion of the interaction between DTAs and the corporate migration rules in a Tax Information Bulletin item on the new law. 186 TECHNICAL ISSUES Issues: Retrospective attachment of imputation credits to deemed dividends Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposals should be amended to clarify that a company is not required to be an imputation credit account company after the date of migration. Comment A company cannot be an imputation credit account company once it has migrated. However, a company must be an imputation credit account company to apply proposed section ME 6(2) and retrospectively attach imputation credits to dividends arising under the corporate migration rules. Section ME 6(2) should be amended so that it applies to migrating companies that were imputation credit account companies immediately before becoming non- resident. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Conduit tax relief account debits Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The liability arising under section MI 5(1)(f), (g) or (h) (debits arising to conduit tax relief account) should arise (or be calculated) after the deemed distribution arising under subpart FCB. There is a risk that the debit will be overstated if the migrating company is required to have regard to the balance in the conduit tax relief account prior to the time the deemed dividend arises and prior to the attachment of relevant credits to the deemed distribution. 187 Comment Officials consider that the suggested amendment is unnecessary because conduit tax relief account credits cannot be used to impute the deemed distribution arising under subpart FCB. Imputation credits, including those generated from tax paid on the deemed disposition under section FCB 3, may be retrospectively attached to dividends arising under the corporate migration rules. Companies have the ability to clear out credits from their conduit tax relief accounts at any time before migration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing of imputation credit account credits Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed rules should be amended to clarify that all income tax paid on income derived before migration, including tax that is attributable to income derived under subpart FCB, be treated as being paid immediately before the migrating company becomes a non-resident. Comment Proposed new section ME 6(2) will allow a company to retrospectively attach imputation credits to a dividend arising from the migration. Tax paid that is attributable to the migration will be treated for imputation purposes as being paid immediately before the company ceases to be a New Zealand resident. Officials consider it is appropriate, for imputation credit timing purposes, to treat tax paid on income derived to the date of migration the same as tax paid that is directly attributable to the migration. In both cases the tax should be treated as being paid immediately before the migrating company becomes a non-resident (and therefore ceases to be entitled to maintain an imputation credit account). A migrating company will be able to attach imputation credits available immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident to the deemed dividend resulting from the migration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 188 Issue: Reference to dividends Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The phrases “as a dividend” and “as dividends” should be removed from proposed subpart FCB. The phrases could be interpreted as deeming a distribution under proposed section FCB 2 to be a taxable dividend, notwithstanding that it may be paid out of available subscribed capital or capital gains. This interpretation is unintended and could lead to unplanned results. Comment Officials consider it is already clear under proposed section CD 18 that available subscribed capital or capital gains are not taxed as a dividend. Referring to the term “dividend” ensures the corporate migration rules link directly to the dividend rules which makes the law clear and accessible to users. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Calculation of distribution Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section FCB 2 should be amended to clarify that the amount of the distribution deemed to be paid is the market value of the property owned by the company, less all known and contingent liabilities. Comment The legislation refers to “the amount that would be available for distribution”. Therefore, liabilities are already taken into account and the suggested amendment is unnecessary. The liquidation rules refer only to “an amount paid to a shareholder in relation to a share”. Specifying the various types of liabilities to be excluded from the taxable amount of the distribution on migration would therefore also be inconsistent with the liquidation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 189 Issue: 20% loading on assets remaining in New Zealand Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Assets treated under proposed section FCB 3 as being disposed of and reacquired by a migrating company should continue to be eligible for the 20% loading available on New Zealand-new assets under section EE 26 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment Officials agree that because actual ownership of the property does not change, the disposition and re-acquisition deemed to occur under the corporate migration rules should be disregarded for depreciation loading purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Mitigation of double taxation on dividends paid subsequent to migration Primary submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) All dividends paid by a non-resident company that was previously New Zealand- resident should be exempt from tax in New Zealand to the extent that dividends arose to shareholders when the company migrated. Alternative submission The definition of “available subscribed capital” should be amended to clarify that available subscribed capital is increased by the amount of the deemed dividend. Comment The primary submission would require shareholders to record the amount of the distribution made under the corporate migration rules and match it to a subsequent dividend. Such tracking rules are complex and increase compliance costs. Under the proposed approach, the amount of the distribution is added to a company’s available subscribed capital which can be measured and monitored by the company and distributed tax-free to shareholders in certain circumstances. This removes the need for each shareholder to record and track the amount of the distribution and is the better approach because it reduces complexity and compliance costs. 190 The draft legislation in the bill amends the definition of available subscribed capital to include the amount of the deemed distribution under section FCB 2 “that is assessable income of the shareholders”. The alternative submission considers that these words should be changed to “that is a dividend”. It is possible that some “dividends” may be exempt income but should also be added to available subscribed capital. Secondly, some distributions which are excluded from dividends may be assessable income (for example, a capital return to a revenue account shareholder) and should not be added to available subscribed capital. Officials agree with the alternative submission. Recommendation That the primary submission be declined. That the alternative submission be accepted. Issue: Meaning of migration time Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is not clear what the relationship is between “emigration time” and the point in time at which a company ceases being resident in New Zealand. This should be clarified. Comment Draft legislation in the bill amends section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 to define “emigration time” as “the time at which the emigrating company becomes a non-resident”. Officials therefore consider that the legislation is already clear on this point, and does not need to be amended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 191 Temporary exemption from tax on foreign income for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders 192 193 OVERVIEW The bill introduces a number of amendments to remove the tax barriers inhibiting international recruitment to New Zealand. A two-tiered exemption will be introduced. The first tier proposes a five-year exemption for employees and the second tier a three-year exemption for all new migrants. In both cases the exemption would be from all foreign income except dividends, interest, employment income and business income relating to the supply of services. To qualify, the individual must not have been tax resident in New Zealand for at least ten years. Six submissions were received on these changes. While all submissions welcomed the overall proposal, they considered that some proposals did not go far enough or were compliance intensive. In particular, it was argued that the scope and length of the exemption should be extended. As a result, officials recommend that the scope of the exemption be extended to cover dividends, interest and amounts connected to employment exercised outside New Zealand while non-resident. However, no change should be made to the length of the exemption. In addition, it was argued that the certification regime is overly complex and compliance intensive. After further consideration, officials recommend the removal of the certification process. An individual would then be required to “self-assess” their eligibility. 194 RESIDENCE DEFINITION Clause 22 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The exemption period for a new recruit should begin on the first day of arrival for work in New Zealand. Comment The definition of “residence” under New Zealand law is based on a physical presence in New Zealand test. If a person is present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period, they are deemed to be resident from the first date they were present in New Zealand. This may mean that, as a technical matter, for some new migrants or returning New Zealanders, their first date of residence may be backdated to a previous visit prior to 1 April 2006. Therefore, they will be ineligible for the exemption. Or, the period of exemption will begin before the new migrant or returning New Zealander actually moves permanently to New Zealand. Officials acknowledge that this result would be counter to the policy objectives of the exemption and have therefore recommended an amendment to ensure that the exemption period begins on the first day of arrival for work in New Zealand. This will be achieved by disabling the 183-day test and relying on the permanent place of abode test in section OE 1. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Changes will be made to the application of the residence rules for the purposes of the exemption. The effect of this change will be to “turn off” the 183-day test. Therefore, residence will be based on the permanent place of abode test. 195 LENGTH OF THE EXEMPTION Issue: Extending the length of the exemption Clause 170 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 11W – Business New Zealand, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The length of the exemption should be extended from the proposed 5-year exemption to a seven-year exemption. If this is not accepted, then an extension of an additional four years should be available on request by the employer. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The scope of the proposed exemption of five years represents a compromise between having an exemption that is lengthier but narrower in application versus an exemption that is shorter and wider in application. These were the two potential options advanced in the government discussion document, Reducing tax barriers to international recruitment to New Zealand, released in November 2003. Officials have a general concern that any exemption on foreign-sourced income would encourage taxpayers to disguise onshore income as offshore income. We are therefore concerned to keep the period of exemption as short as practicable, to minimise this risk. Further to this, the five-year time limit strikes a balance between achieving the desired policy objectives while not unnecessarily conceding revenue. Officials consider that the proposed five-year exemption period is the appropriate policy response. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Commissioner discretion to extend the exemption Clause 22 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be granted a discretion to extend the exemption for a limited period of time in certain circumstances. 196 Comment The submitter argued that in some circumstances, there would be an unreasonable compliance burden on an individual who is required to comply with domestic legislation for a short period of time. For example, a person due to repatriate within six months of the exemption ending will have to account for an interest in a foreign investment fund for that six-month period before he or she leaves New Zealand. Officials believe that the five-year time limit provides the best balance between the policy objectives of the amendment and revenue conceded. Providing such discretion to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would in effect be creating a further exemption with associated boundary issues. This would result in uncertainty and further compliance costs in trying to determine eligibility to the extension. Officials consider that it would be inappropriate to provide the Commissioner with discretion to allow for an extension of the exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax years Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 91K (1)(c)(ii) should state “one of the next three tax years”. Section 91K (2)(d)(ii) should state “in the next five years”. Comment The submitter argues that the period of time permitted for the exemption could potentially be restricted to two years. This is because the exemption is tied to tax years. A situation could arise where a person becomes New Zealand resident on 29 March 2006 with the exemption expiring on 31 March 2008. Therefore, the submitter advocates an exemption for a minimum of three years and up to four years. The current wording in the bill is consistent with the intentions of the proposed legislation. Changing it in the way this submission suggests could give rise to adverse tax planning opportunities that would have the effect of lengthening the exemption. This would give rise to equity issues. To avoid any confusion, officials intend to explain the effect of the exemption being tied to tax years, and not a 12-month period in an article in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 197 NON-RESIDENCE PERIOD Clause 170 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement that new and returning residents must not have been tax-resident for at least ten years is too long, and should be reduced to five years. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed ten-year qualification should be reduced to seven. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The ten-year non-residence rule targets New Zealanders who have emigrated from New Zealand on a permanent basis and have, therefore, the same status as a new migrant relating to New Zealand tax on foreign-sourced income. It is accepted that reducing the ten-year exemption may have advantages in attracting mobile New Zealanders because of their familiarity with New Zealand culture and business practices. However, officials do not agree that the period of non-residence should be reduced. It is critical to have robust rules restricting the extent to which former New Zealand residents can access the relief provided by the exemption. Such rules also reduce the risk that New Zealanders will be incentivised to emigrate to access the exemption in future. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 198 SCOPE OF THE EXEMPTION Issue: Extending the exemption to all foreign-sourced income Submission (11W – Business New Zealand, 29W – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The exemption should be extended to other types of foreign-sourced income. Comment It was submitted that further sources of income should be considered for the exemption. The Corporate Taxpayers Group submitted that the exemption should be extended to all foreign-sourced income. Officials have reconsidered whether dividends and interest should remain taxable. It has always been an “on balance” call whether to include dividends and interest in the exemption. In essence, it is necessary to trade off the benefits of continuing to tax income that is generally taxable in all countries (and so should not be a deterrent to migrants) against the beneficial effects of signalling an across-the-board exemption. Australia recently announced details of a similar proposal. Under the Australian proposals, dividends and interest would be exempt. It has been argued that this would encourage people to repatriate their income, allowing individuals to rearrange their affairs in light of international tax rules, without being penalised by tax. There is some advantage in harmonising our proposed exemption with Australia’s. Excluding interest and dividends from the exemption could pose a risk to the tax base – particularly in relation to wholly owned companies. Individuals would be eligible for deductions for the interest on their borrowing to fund investments in overseas companies. The deferral of repatriation of dividends/interest could result in a timing advantage. Indeed, the income may never be repatriated during the period of the exemption – or prior to the departure of the migrant. These issues do not arise if dividends and interest are exempt. Recommendation That the exemption be extended to cover dividends and interest. 199 Issue: Bonus payments Submission (25W – Deloitte, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The exemption should cover bonus payments from employment performed overseas before coming to New Zealand. Comment It is not uncommon for individuals who arrive in New Zealand to receive bonus payments from overseas employment. Officials accept that it would be inappropriate to tax bonus payments simply because they are often not determined until after the individual has arrived in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. However, as the Income Tax Act 2004 does not define a bonus payment, all amounts derived in connection with employment exercised outside New Zealand before an individual’s arrival will be exempt. Issue: Death and asset transfer rules Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The new rules should exclude temporary residents from the death and asset transfer rules for interests in property outside the tax base. Comment The death and asset transfer rules do not by themselves bring any income into the tax base. What they do is deem assets to be sold upon death or an in specie or “in kind” distribution, and any tax consequences follow. If the assets are not in the tax base, then there can be no adverse tax consequences. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 200 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Issue: Available more than once in a lifetime Clause 170 Submission (25W – Deloitte, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The eligibility to receive the exemption should be extended to twice in an individual’s lifetime. (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The exemption should be made available more than once, but restricted to four years. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment It was submitted that allowing individuals to receive the benefit of the exemption more than once better recognises the work patterns of people who are truly mobile and continuously shift their residence for employment. Many international entities place people in New Zealand in management positions who often return later in a more senior role because of their association with, and knowledge of, New Zealand. However, a multiple exemption rule may adversely affect public perceptions of equity. It also gives rise to the concern that skilled individuals would have an incentive to leave New Zealand to keep refreshing their exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: One class of exemption Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, Issue raised by the Specialist Tax Advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee) There should be only one class of new-resident certificate, which should apply to all migrants and returning New Zealanders. (New Zealand Law Society) The two-tiered proposal is unnecessarily compliance cost intensive and a more simplistic and workable approach could be adopted. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 201 The different treatment could send an adverse signal that New Zealand is more interested in attracting employees than the self-employed. (Specialist Tax Advisor to the Finance and Expenditure Committee) Comment Submitters argue that there should be no distinction between individuals who come to New Zealand for employment and those who come to New Zealand as contractors, investors, or business owners in their own right. This will encourage people to come to New Zealand to undertake employment, engage in entrepreneurial activities, or work as independent contractors. The original proposal was to exempt employees only. However, during consultation it became evident that it would be desirable to cover independent contractors as well, to achieve the aims of the proposal. The problem is that it is difficult to develop laws to target only independent contractors. Legislative boundaries can be structured around (even by persons who are essentially retirees) and are difficult to enforce. Moreover, they can produce arbitrary results for taxpayers. In order to include independent contractors, it was necessary to extend the proposal to all new migrants. Our preference is to provide a shorter exemption period of three years for all new migrants who have not been resident in New Zealand for at least ten years. A shorter exemption will accommodate independent contractors – who are generally in New Zealand for a shorter period of time than migrant employees – while mitigating any concern with retirees receiving a tax exemption. Therefore, if we were to align the exemption periods, this would mean that individuals outside the target group of skilled workers will receive a longer period of exemption. Officials acknowledge the concerns expressed by submitters and by the Specialist Tax Advisor to the Committee. However, aligning the periods would increase the fiscal cost of this proposal. We do not consider the benefits of alignment would outweigh these costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 202 Issue: Eligibility criteria – full time work test Clause 170 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 25W – Deloitte, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 47 – New Zealand Law Society (alternative submission if submission above is not accepted), 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An individual can receive an employed resident certificate if the individual is engaged in full-time employment 94 percent of the time. This allows three weeks to find employment. This is insufficient and the threshold should be lowered. The manner in which the test is to operate should also be clarified. Comment Some submitters viewed the 94 percent threshold as being too high because it creates a bias in favour of those with prearranged employment. Officials acknowledge that a 94 percent test may be overly strict. On the other hand, it is still important to keep the threshold reasonably high to ensure the exemption applies to genuine employment cases. The concern is that if the threshold were lowered, the employee exemption would be much more widely available than intended. Ensuring this boundary is robust is important to maintain the integrity of the new rules. Also, it recognises the wider availability of the three-year general exemption. In line with submissions, officials now recommend that the 94% threshold be reduced to 85%. This will give new migrants up to 54 days to find employment on arrival in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the threshold be reduced to 85%. Issue: Eligibility criteria – part-time work test Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society; alternative submission if main submission is not accepted) A person can receive an employed resident certificate if they are working part-time only if they earn $70,000 per annum, pro rata. This threshold is too high and should be reduced to $40,000. 203 Comment The submission states that the threshold is such that persons who come to New Zealand seeking only part-time work in areas where there are skill shortages, such as nursing, would be ineligible for the five-year exemption. Officials believe it is important to keep the threshold reasonably high to ensure the exemption is appropriately targeted. If the threshold were dropped, the employee exemption would be much more widely available than intended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Associated persons Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The employment exemption should be available to individuals who are associated with the employer. Comment The condition that the migrant employee cannot be associated with their employer is an anti-avoidance measure. It ensures that an individual cannot establish a fictional employment situation in order to receive the benefit of the longer exemption. It is difficult to draw legislative and administrative lines between legitimate and fictional employment situations where the employee is associated with their employer. Legitimate business people will still be eligible for the general exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 204 Issue: Exemption for dependent spouses Clause 170 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 25W – Deloitte, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Dependent spouses should be eligible for the exemption if the working spouse can obtain the exemption. Comment Not allowing an exemption for a dependent spouse could result in inequitable and complex treatment where assets may be jointly held. Therefore, officials agree that the exemption should be extended to dependant spouses. This is also consistent with the treatment of dependent children under the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Existing New Zealand residents and application date Clause 22 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 25W – Deloitte, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The exemption should apply to individuals who are already in New Zealand, who would otherwise be eligible for the exemption. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte) The exemption should apply from 1 April 2006 to all individuals who arrive in New Zealand after the date the bill was introduced (19 May 2005). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The submitters argue that the amendments provide no incentive for current migrants to stay. Therefore, consideration should be given to extending the amendments to migrants already in the country if they would otherwise have been eligible. The employee would be entitled to the exemption for the balance of the five years from 1 April 2006. 205 Officials do not consider that retrospective application of the exemption can be justified. It is not desirable to signal that the exemption will apply prior to the legislation being enacted, because of potential changes to the design of the exemption that may occur during the legislative process. It is our understanding that new and returning New Zealanders would prefer a set application date and a set date of arrival for certainty of treatment. Furthermore, those who arrive in New Zealand before 1 April 2006 will not be sensitive to New Zealand tax, as they had already chosen to come to New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Changing exemptions Submissions (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 25W – Deloitte, 29 – Corporate Taxpayers Group ) Individuals should be able to qualify for the employed temporary resident exemption after they have qualified for the general resident exemption, providing they meet the criteria. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New migrants who are eligible only for the general three-year certificate should be able to apply for an extension of two years if they meet the employment test. (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment The submissions are inconsistent with the policy objective of maintaining the distinction between the two exemptions. The employee five-year exemption accommodates individuals with long employment contracts. The general three-year exemption is designed for individuals who are in New Zealand on short-term contracts, as independent contractors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 206 CERTIFICATION PROCESS Clause 170 Submissions (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 11W – Business New Zealand, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 47 – New Zealand Law Society) It should be possible for the application for a certificate to be made up to one month before the due date for the tax return to be filed. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The level of complexity that is involved in applying for the exemption is of concern. Inland Revenue should take steps to ensure that the changes are clearly advertised and explained to all prospective applicants. (Business New Zealand) The new resident certification process should be done away with entirely. Individuals should be able to “self-assess” their eligibility on their tax return. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Sections 91L to 91O inclusive should be omitted entirely. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The words “for a time” and “at a time” in new section 91L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are not necessary. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment There is some concern around the certification process and its complexity. Officials have reviewed the need for a certification process. Individuals who rely on the exemption should comply with New Zealand’s tax laws once the period of exemption expires. To this end, a certification requirement was included in the proposed legislation. An individual would apply for a certificate of exemption, and Inland Revenue would issue a certificate confirming that the individual met the residence criteria for the exemption. However, this process requires unnecessary contact by taxpayers with Inland Revenue. After further consideration, officials believe Inland Revenue’s current risk management approach in identifying and profiling those eligible for the exemption will be adequate. Recommendation That the submissions are noted and the certification process is removed from the bill. 207 SHARE OPTIONS Clause 14 Submissions (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should be clarified to state whether it is the date the option is granted or the vesting period that is relevant for the exemption. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A rule will be required to apportion gain attributable to periods when the person is a non-resident if the gain is derived over both periods. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Submitters are uncertain about the effect of this clause. Clause 14 refers to “the period of employment that gives rise to the benefit or part of the benefit” when non- resident. This means that when a share option is granted in relation to employment while the individual is non-resident, and the individual chooses to exercise the option while claiming the exemption, there will be no New Zealand tax impost. However, when the employment services to which a share option relates have been provided both overseas and in New Zealand, an allocation rule is required. The allocation method would simply be a straight-line day counting test. Recommendation That the submission be noted and the drafting clarified. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section CE 2 should be amended to include all tax residents who derive an employee share option benefit, not just those categories of temporary residents that are eligible for the exemption. Comment Individuals coming to New Zealand will be eligible for the general exemption provided they have not been tax-resident in New Zealand for at least ten years. The submission says that the issue of share option schemes held offshore and exercised when the individual is resident in New Zealand for tax purposes should be addressed. 208 The submission is outside the scope of this policy initiative of relieving tax on foreign sourced income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 209 TRUSTS Clause 86 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The wording of clause 86 does not make it clear to whom the concession applies and the position of returning New Zealanders with foreign trusts should be clarified. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section HH 2 should be amended to better deal with returning residents. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Currently, new migrants who have settled a trust offshore have 12 months to elect to make the trust a qualifying trust for New Zealand tax purposes. Clause 86 defers the election until 12 months following the end of the exemption. It has been submitted that a New Zealander who settles a foreign trust while tax non- resident cannot elect into the qualifying trust regime upon their return to New Zealand. Officials disagree with these submissions. The changes in clause 86 extend the election period to returning New Zealanders. Under the proposed rules, when a New Zealander who is eligible for the exemption settles a trust prior to their return, that trust will be deemed to be a foreign trust up until the date that they elect into the qualifying trust regime. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, officials will clarify the application of this section in the Tax Information Bulletin. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The 12-month election rule in section HH 2 should be changed to 24 months. Comment This submission is outside the scope of this policy initiative of relieving tax on foreign-sourced income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 210 ACCRUAL RULES Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, matter raised by officials) Section EW 5(15B) should apply to a financial arrangement with a non-resident that was entered into after the person became a resident. Comment It was submitted that if individuals vary their financial arrangements after becoming resident, the exclusion should cover these arrangements also. Officials believe that this is a consequential change that needs to happen if the scope of the exemption is extended to cover interest. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 211 NON-RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Removing the requirement to withhold non-resident withholding tax on foreign mortgages should be extended to the removal from the agency rules as well. Comment An amendment to section NG 2(1)(b) removes the requirement for non-residents to be liable for non-resident withholding tax on foreign mortgages – provided that the interest payment is paid by a certified resident. The submitter asks whether we need to turn off the agency rules in sections HK 16–26 for individuals who are eligible for the exemption. Even though the individual will technically remain an agent of the mortgagee, the liability to pay non-resident withholding tax will be removed by the amendment to section NG 2(1)(b). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 212 FAMILY ASSISTANCE IMPLICATIONS Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rebate apportionment rules should also apply in addition to the definition of “qualifying person” in section KD 3 and in section OB 1. Comment After clarification with the submitter, it is submitted that individuals eligible for the exemption should not be eligible to receive the low income rebate in section KC 1. Although this will be desirable, systematically it would be difficult to achieve. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill amends the definition of “qualifying person” for the purpose of section KD 3. The effect of these amendments is intended to be that an individual who has a new- resident certificate will be ineligible to receive family assistance payments. The bill should also amend the definition of “principle caregiver”. However, it appears that after the current amendment has been enacted, an individual who is eligible for the exemption may still be eligible to receive an in-work payment. To be eligible to receive an in-work payment, a person must be a “principal caregiver” and not necessarily a “qualifying person”, as required for the other forms of family assistance. Currently the bill does not amend the definition of “principal caregiver” and it is arguable that a new resident can be a “principal caregiver” and meet other requirements for obtaining an in-work payment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 213 IMMIGRANTS’ FOUR-YEAR EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN FIF INTERESTS Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The new provisions outlined in clause 72 should be added to, rather than replace, section EX 35. Comment Currently section EX 35 provides relief from the foreign investment fund rules for individuals resident in New Zealand who will not be eligible for the exemption. Under clause 72 this will no longer apply and individuals with a foreign superannuation fund or foreign life insurance policy will no longer be able to rely on the four-year exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. However, the current section EX 35 will expire on 1 April 2010, and clause 72 will apply. 214 DISCLOSURE Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There do not need to be specific exclusions, apart from the specific exclusion from disclosure. Comment The submitter argues that as the changes to section EX 16 and section EX 35 effectively mean that an individual eligible for the exemption will not have an interest in a CFC or a FIF, they will have no disclosure requirement under section 61 of the Tax Administration Act. Consequently no changes are required to section 61. Officials agree with this submission and recommend that the changes to section 61 in the bill be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 215 OTHER Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Tax Information Bulletin should highlight that rental losses on property owned offshore and rented will not be deductible in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A “living away from home” allowance should be introduced so that New Zealand is more competitive internationally. Comment The proposals do not address other costs incurred by New Zealand businesses to attract international recruits such as “tax-free” packages. These packages often include housing allowances, reimbursement or contributions to utility expenses, return airfares home and continued contributions to home-country superannuation/pension plans. New Zealand businesses usually incur the tax costs of such benefits. The submission requested that the government should introduce a “living away from home” allowance to become more competitive with Australia. The Australian concession allows for tax-free accommodation, together with assisted tax-free food costs and provides concessions for those who are truly working away from home on a temporary basis. The proposal is outside the scope of this policy initiative of relieving tax on foreign- sourced income. However, the broad direction of tax reform in recent times has been to remove exemptions of this sort. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 216 DRAFTING ISSUES Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The concept of a “period of time” has the potential to create unnecessary confusion. Comment The proposed removal of the certification process removes the need for this phrase. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The concept of “last becoming a New Zealand resident” causes confusion. Comment The phrase “last becoming a New Zealand resident” arises because the legislation needs to deal with a person who becomes a New Zealand resident after having previously become a New Zealand resident and then being a non-resident. Officials recommend that the drafter be asked to consider whether the use of “last”, or an equivalent, is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be noted and the drafter asked to consider whether the use of “last”, or an equivalent, is necessary. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The words “maintained as a member of the family” are confusing. Comment The phrase “maintained as a member of the ... family” is used in the current definition of “dependent child” in the Income Tax Act 2004. It is also used in the definition of “dependent child” in s30(5) of the Child Support Act 1991. We are unaware of any significant confusion the phrase has caused in the history of its use. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 217 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “certified resident” should be replaced by “temporary resident”. Comment The term “certified resident” has been superseded, due to the removal of the certification process. However, the residency of the affected individuals is not “temporary”. It is their proposed status that is temporary. Therefore, officials recommend that the term “certified resident” be replaced by a phrase that indicates the transitional nature of the exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. The term “certified resident” will be replaced by a phrase that indicates the transitional nature of the exemption. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 91K should be split into three sections that respectively deal with general, employee and dependent temporary residents. Comment Section 91K, as it is, will no longer be needed if the certification process is removed. However, a new eligibility section, very similar to this, would be needed. However, officials feel that there is merit in asking the drafter to consider whether the replacement for section 91K should have a different structure. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 91K (6)(b) should state “has not been tax resident for at least ten years”. Comment Officials consider that both formulations can be interpreted as a requirement that the person had been resident in New Zealand for less than ten years. The current formulation is not unambiguous. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 218 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 91K (2)(e) is cumbersome and needs rewriting. Comment The detail in this section arises from the width of the definition of “source deduction payment” and the policy requirements to limit the types of remuneration that qualify a person to have the proposed exemption. There is no suitable alternative to “source deduction payment” that has a narrower meaning. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment to Part CW should include a general amendment that would cover all income types that these rules seek to exclude from the income of the temporary resident for the relevant period. Comment The approach of the Income Tax Act 2004 is to notify users of the relationship between related provisions, if possible. If a general exclusion was used, amendments to affected provisions would still be required. Officials therefore do not think that the result would be any simpler. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section CW 22B doubles up by potentially exempting income arising under the FIF and CFC rules in addition to the amendment that treats these people as not holding FIF or CFC interests, and in addition to the amendments that exclude CFC and FIF income and losses arising. Comment Section CW 22B is required as the section exempts foreign-sourced amounts that are not CFC or FIF income. Recommendation That the submission be declined 219 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendments to sections EX 16 and EX 35 mean that the person is not regarded as holding an interest in a CFC or a FIF if they are a qualifying person under these rules. There is no need to further amend the CFC or FIF rules. Comment This submission suggests that the amendments to sections such as CQ 2 and CQ 5 and the loss rules are unnecessary. These amendments are necessary as they are consistent with the current drafting approach of the Income Tax Act 2004. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An exemption method should be considered for the accrual rules. Comment The amendments to the financial arrangement rules extend the approach that the rules currently adopt towards non-residents who are parties to financial arrangements. It is logical to adopt the same approach towards residents who qualify for the exemption. In addition, it would be unnecessary for the financial arrangements rules to require a resident to calculate a figure that would be treated as exempt income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 220 221 Information-reporting and record-keeping requirements for foreign trusts 222 223 OVERVIEW Clauses 87, 155(2), (12) and (14), 156, 162 and 182 The bill introduces new information-reporting and record-keeping requirements for foreign trusts that will enable New Zealand to meet its exchange of information obligations with its double tax agreement (DTA) partners, especially Australia. These requirements will also ensure that New Zealand is better placed to meet its international obligations as a member of the international community and organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A foreign trust is a trust that has had no New Zealand-resident settlor from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date that the first settlement was made to the trust. Under current tax law, a New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust that receives foreign-sourced income (a “targeted” trust) is not required to provide information to Inland Revenue or keep records for New Zealand tax purposes about that foreign income. Information relating to foreign income of foreign trusts may be requested by foreign tax authorities under the exchange of information provisions in New Zealand’s DTAs. As targeted foreign trusts are not required to provide that information to Inland Revenue, there is a risk that New Zealand may be unable to provide foreign tax authorities with the information requested. While the size of the problem is not readily definable, failure to provide information will impact negatively on New Zealand’s relationship with its DTA partners. Australian authorities, in particular, are concerned that foreign trusts are being established in New Zealand that have the effect of causing Australian tax to be avoided. The OECD has recently developed minimum standards to improve greater transparency and exchange of information between foreign tax authorities and to encourage international co-operation on tax matters. Unless New Zealand is in a position to exchange information on the foreign income of foreign trusts that are administered by New Zealand-resident trustees, New Zealand will not be compliant with these standards. The requirements introduced in the bill impose obligations on New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts to disclose limited information to Inland Revenue and to keep financial and other records relating to each foreign trust for New Zealand tax purposes. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a New Zealand- resident trustee being subject to sanctions, such as prosecution for failure to keep or provide information. In limited circumstances, the foreign trust may be treated as being taxable in New Zealand on its worldwide income. 224 Eight submissions were made relating to the new requirements for foreign trusts. Most submissions were critical of the new requirements, in particular, submitters complained that the requirement for each foreign trust to have at least one qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee was too onerous and that the sanctions for non- compliance were illogical, misdirected and unfair. The majority of officials’ recommendations are aimed at dealing with these concerns by improving the overall fairness and balance of the foreign trust requirements. The requirements as amended by the recommendations in this report are briefly explained below. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has heard two submissions that questioned the legality of automatically providing foreign trust information to Australia and whether New Zealand has a current legal obligation to provide foreign trust information in response to an exchange of information request under its DTAs. These submissions were of particular concern to the Committee. It is the view of officials that the new foreign trust requirements are consistent with current tax law, the exchange of information provisions in New Zealand’s DTAs, and international standards of transparency and effective exchange of information between foreign tax authorities. Officials’ analysis and views on these submissions are set out in the chapter, “Validity of the new requirements” on page 227. New requirements as amended The new requirements for foreign trusts, as amended by the recommendations of this report, take into account the need to create the right incentives for New Zealand- resident trustees to comply with the requirements, while protecting those trustees who genuinely do not have knowledge of these requirements from potentially onerous tax and compliance costs. Under the requirements originally proposed in the bill, a New Zealand-resident trustee would have been required to disclose limited information and keep certain financial and other records and provide these records to Inland Revenue, if requested. The foreign trust was also required to have at least one qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee. If the trustee did not comply with the requirements, sanctions would have applied and, in some instances, the foreign trust would have been subject to tax on its worldwide income. These requirements would have been particularly harsh for non-professional trustees of family trusts or private estates or for trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services. For example, a person who migrated to New Zealand from the United Kingdom before 1 April 2006 (the proposed date the new requirements come into effect), and who is also a trustee of his or her parents’ estate would have been caught by the new requirements. Most people in this situation would not have been aware that the new requirements applied to them. Under the new requirements as amended by the recommendations in this report, there will be no requirement for a trustee to become a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee and a New Zealand-resident trustee will be subject to sanctions only if he or she “knowingly” fails to disclose information or keep or provide records to Inland Revenue, as required under the law. Whether the trustee is aware of his or her tax responsibilities is a question of fact to be determined on a case-by-case basis, although it will be assumed that “professional” trustees or those trustees who are in the business of providing trustee services will be aware of the new requirements. 225 If a New Zealand-resident trustee knowingly does not comply with the new requirements, Inland Revenue can prosecute the trustee under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act and, if convicted, the trustee will be subject to a monetary fine and/or a term of imprisonment. Additionally, the world-wide income of the foreign trust will be subject to tax in New Zealand. The penalty for non-compliance and the taxing penalty are considered necessary to deal with serious recalcitrant trustees. If the New Zealand-resident trustee is a “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee”, or a co-trustee that meets the qualifying status has been appointed to the trust, the trust will never be subject to tax on its worldwide income. These trusts will effectively enjoy a safe-harbour treatment from the taxing penalty. New Zealand-resident trustees can become a “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee”, or appoint a co- trustee who meets the qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee criteria, at any time to qualify for the safe-harbour treatment. The possibility of conviction under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act should provide sufficient incentive for qualifying New Zealand-resident trustees to comply with the new requirements. If a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee is convicted of the above offence, it will become a matter of public record and Inland Revenue will bring the matter to the attention of the trustee’s professional body. It will be left to the professional body to determine what action should be taken against its members. The new requirements as amended by the recommendations in this report were developed in response to the submissions and in consultation with the Committee’s specialist tax advisor, Ms Therese Turner. 226 APPLICATION DATE FOR NEW REQUIREMENTS Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date for the new requirements should be 1 October 2006, rather than 1 April 2006. This change would allow more time for the new requirements to be implemented. Comment The current application date of 1 April 2006 does not give sufficient time for Inland Revenue to publicise the new requirements, implement internal procedures to support the requirements or publish guidelines for organisations seeking “approved organisation” status. In addition, existing trustees of foreign trusts will need to develop an appreciation of the new obligations, decide whether the trust should continue to be administered in New Zealand and, if so, make the required disclosure to Inland Revenue within 60 days of the date of the commencement of the new requirements. For trustees appointed on or after 1 April 2006, they will have 30 days to make the required disclosure. Officials recommend, therefore, that the new requirements apply from 1 October 2006. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 227 VALIDITY OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS Issue: No current obligation to collect foreign trust information Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The new requirements should not be imposed, as they are predicated on the misconception that New Zealand requires information about certain foreign trusts to be in a position to meet its international commitments and obligations under its double tax agreements. Comment The submission provides technical arguments that there is no current obligation under New Zealand’s double tax agreements to obtain foreign trust information. As such, the submission contends that the entire predication on which the amendments are based is invalid. The rationale for the amendments was the need “to ensure that New Zealand can meet its international obligations, such as satisfying requests for information from countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement”. The emphasis on “international obligations” refers primarily to new minimum standards of transparency and effective exchange of information adopted by both the European Union and the OECD. Such standards of transparency and effective exchange of information are reflected in the 2002 OECD Model agreement on exchange of information in tax matters and the revised “Exchange of Information” Article inserted in the 2005 update of the OECD Model tax convention on income and on capital. In addition, in 2003 the New Zealand Minister of Finance, Hon Dr Michael Cullen, and the Australian Treasurer, Hon Peter Costello, agreed to New Zealand and Australia entering into a partnering arrangement for jointly negotiating Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) with jurisdictions identified by the OECD as meeting the criteria of a “tax haven”. New Zealand has commitments both as an OECD member and because of its political relationship with Australia to support the new standards of transparency and effective exchange of information and to encourage the adoption of those standards by other countries. New Zealand should also take seriously Australia’s concerns that New Zealand-based foreign trusts with Australian settlors have the effect of avoiding Australian tax. The technical argument that New Zealand’s current double tax agreements do not require the collection of information on foreign trusts does not take these factors into account. The NZLS’s argument is based on the current wording of the Exchange of Information Article in the DTA between New Zealand and Australia. 228 The current wording of Article 26 of the New Zealand/Australia DTA provides that: (1) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or of the domestic law of the Contracting States concerning the taxes to which this Agreement applies insofar as the taxation under that law is not contrary to this Agreement... (2) In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 1 be construed so as to impose on the competent authority of a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the law or administrative practice of that or the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the law or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; or (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or to supply information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.” \[Emphasis added\] An amendment to the wording of Article 26 of the New Zealand/Australia DTA has been negotiated, formally signed by the two respective governments, and is due to come into force early this year. The new wording follows that made by the OECD to the “Exchange of Information” Article in the OECD Model tax convention on income and on capital. It therefore adopts the new OECD standards. The NZLS also argues that at present New Zealand does not have any obligation to provide information concerning New Zealand-based foreign trusts to any of its treaty partners. This is because providing such information would be “at variance with the law or administrative practice” of New Zealand and would not be able to be obtained “under the law or in the normal course of the administration” of New Zealand. In other words, New Zealand has no interest in obtaining information concerning New Zealand-based foreign trusts unless those foreign trusts derive New Zealand-sourced income. Officials do not agree with the NZLS view. Officials note that the commentary on the OECD Model tax convention on income and on capital (at paragraph 16) states that information is deemed to be obtainable in the normal course of administration if it is in the possession of the tax authorities or can be obtained by them in the normal procedure of tax determination. The new Article 26 of the New Zealand/Australia DTA provides that: (1) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is forseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic law concerning taxes referred to in Article 2, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Article 1. 229 (2) Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contacting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic law of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. (3) In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the law and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable by the competent authority under the law or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). (4) If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. (5) In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. The main rule concerning the exchange of information is contained in the first sentence of paragraph 1. It provides that information may be exchanged not only for the purposes of the provisions of the DTA but for the “administration or enforcement of the domestic law”. On this basis, officials consider that New Zealand will be obliged to provide information to Australia for the purposes of administering or enforcing their tax laws, which would extend to information concerning Australian residents who use trusts with New Zealand-resident trustees to undertake their income earning activities. The information would be used to determine whether these people are being correctly taxed in Australia. Paragraph 4 of the new Article provides that the reasons contemplated in paragraph 3 for denying a request cannot “be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information”. This directly answers the NZLS’ concern that New Zealand has no domestic tax interest in the information concerning New Zealand-based foreign trusts and that paragraph 3 can therefore be relied upon to deny any request from Australia to provide that information. The fact that New Zealand does not tax certain foreign trusts is of no relevance and cannot be used to decline a request. 230 Furthermore, paragraph 3 states that the Article should not be construed as imposing an obligation “to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State”. On the enactment of the proposed requirements, obtaining information on New Zealand foreign trusts is not at variance with domestic law. The new exchange of information Article is now the model that New Zealand will use in all current and future DTA negotiations with other countries. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Automatic provision of information to Australia – “unlawful” Clause 162 Submission (4 – NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners) The automatic exchange of information with Australia in connection with all New Zealand foreign trusts which have an Australian settlor would appear to be a blatant breach of international tax law principles and the provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the provisions of the current Australian/New Zealand DTA. Comment As proposed, if information provided by a trustee indicates that a settlor of a trust is an Australian resident, Inland Revenue would request further information from the trustee on an annual basis (such as financial records, details relating to distributions to beneficiaries and the identity of the settlor). This information would be provided automatically to the Australian Tax Office (ATO) on an annual basis. The ATO has indicated that the provision of this information by Inland Revenue would satisfy its requirements. Officials do not agree that the automatic exchange of information with Australia is unlawful. The recently updated commentary on the OECD Model tax convention on income and on capital explains that paragraph 1 of the exchange of information Article allows information to be exchanged in three different ways: • upon request, with a special case in mind; • spontaneously, when a Contracting State has acquired information which it supposes to be of interest to another Contracting State; 231 • automatically, when information received by a Contracting State meets certain criteria agreed with another Contracting State and is provided to that State on a systematic basis. The new requirements would merely put New Zealand in a position to exchange certain information automatically with Australia. The OECD commentary also states that the Article does not restrict the possibilities of exchanging information to these three methods and that Contracting States may use other techniques to obtain information, such as simultaneous examinations, tax examinations and industry-wide exchanges of information. Any information provided by a trustee would be subject to the existing tax confidentiality provisions. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act prevents Inland Revenue from providing information to a foreign jurisdiction except as permitted by section 88 of that Act – under a DTA. Therefore, the automatic provision of information concerning New Zealand-based foreign trusts with Australian settlors to Australia would not contravene the provisions of the Tax Administration Act. Recommendation That the submission and officials’ views be noted. Issue: Valid information requests under a TIEA or DTA Submission (4 – NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners) The bill should specifically provide that information requests made by Inland Revenue in relation to New Zealand foreign trusts should be made only in response to valid information requests made under a DTA or Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA). This would prevent Inland Revenue from going on “fishing expeditions” at the behest of foreign tax authorities by making blanket requests for information that are not related to specific taxpayers. Comment Officials do not consider that such a provision is necessary. As noted in the commentary to the bill, information will be provided to New Zealand’s DTA partners on a case-by-case request basis except for Australia, when Inland Revenue considers there are valid grounds for requesting the information. The 2002 OECD Model agreement on exchange of information in tax matters (for TIEAs) is explicitly limited to information on request and prohibits fishing expeditions. 232 The revised “Exchange of Information” Article in the 2005 update of the OECD Model tax convention on income and on capital is not limited to information on request as noted in the previous comment. The OECD commentary explains that the revised Article is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that Contracting States are not at liberty to engage in fishing expeditions or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 233 SANCTIONS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE Issue: Proposed sanctions are “illogical”, “misdirected” and “unfair” Submissions (4 – NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, 47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section HH 4(3BB) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which imposes tax on the worldwide income of a foreign trust, is not supported. Imposing New Zealand tax on the worldwide income of a foreign trust is illogical, inconsistent with the scheme and purpose of New Zealand’s tax legislation, discriminatory and unconstitutional. (NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Non-compliance with the new requirements should be dealt with by the application of penalties to the New Zealand-resident trustee, as presently provided for in new section 143(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, as well as the existing provisions of that Act. (NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Penalties or tax should arise when a trustee fails to provide information, as this is when the mischief arises, not merely because a New Zealand-resident trustee does not qualify, or because the foreign trust has no qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee. There is no automatic connection between a trust that has no qualifying New Zealand- resident trustee and that trust failing to provide information. Therefore, the sanctions should apply to the failure to provide information only. The requirement to have a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee is discriminatory as it presumes that people who do not belong to certain professions can be less trusted to meet their tax obligations (as a trustee) than non-professionals. If new section HH 4(3BB) is enacted, the new requirements should be redrafted to impose a tax liability or penalty only if a New Zealand-resident trustee does not comply with the record-keeping requirements in section 22 of the Tax Administration Act or the disclosure requirements in new section 59B(1) of the Tax Administration Act. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment As proposed in the bill, the sanctions for failing to comply with the new information- reporting and record-keeping requirements are: • If a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee does not disclose information or keep or provide records as required by law, the trustee will commit an offence under section 143 or 143A of the Tax Administration Act and, if convicted, will be subject to a monetary fine. 234 • If a New Zealand-resident trustee is not a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee, the trustee will commit an offence under new section 143(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act and, if convicted, will be subject to a monetary fine. If the trustee does not become a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee (or have a co-trustee appointed who satisfies this requirement) within 30 days of receiving notice from Inland Revenue of its intention to prosecute (for failure to be a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee), the worldwide income of the foreign trust will be subject to tax. • If the New Zealand-resident trustee is not a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee and the records requested by Inland Revenue are not produced, the worldwide income of the foreign trust will be subject to tax for the income years for which the records cannot be produced. The trustee may also be prosecuted for failure to keep or provide records or for failure to be a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee. The qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee requirement is intended to ensure that there is local accountability and that there is a person located in New Zealand who has the necessary expertise and incentive to maintain records of the required standard and who will comply with the law. Officials believe the current proposed sanctions can be amended to address the concerns raised in submissions without compromising the stated policy objectives of the new requirements. This result can be achieved by: • removing the criminal penalty that applies to New Zealand-resident trustees for failure to be a “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee”; • restricting the sanctions for non-compliance to the knowledge offence in section 143A of the Tax Administration Act, which would apply if a New Zealand- resident trustee “knowingly” fails to disclose information or keep or provide records, as required by law; and • limiting the taxing penalty in new section HH 4(3BB) to serious recalcitrant trustees who are not qualifying New Zealand-resident trustees and who do not provide the information requested. The effects of these changes on the new requirements are outlined below. The requirement that at least one New Zealand-resident trustee must be a qualifying- resident trustee will no longer apply. Therefore, non-professional trustees may act as a trustee for a foreign trust and, as long as they comply with the new requirements, sanctions will not apply to them. Sanctions will only begin if a New Zealand-resident trustee “knowingly” fails to comply with the new requirements. The criminal penalty for failure to disclose information or maintain records as required by law in section 143 of the Tax Administration Act will not apply to New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts. It is now recognised that had this penalty applied it would have created unfair results, especially for non-professional trustees of family trusts or estates and those trustees who are not in the business of providing trustee services. 235 If a New Zealand-resident trustee has failed to comply with the new requirements but was not aware of these requirements, sanctions will not apply. As a matter of practice, Inland Revenue will notify the trustee of his or her tax responsibilities as a trustee of a foreign trust, seek the required limited information disclosure and outline the record-keeping requirements. Whether the trustee is aware of his or her tax responsibilities will be a question of fact to be determined on a case-by-case basis, although it can be reasonably assumed that “professional” trustees and those trustees in the business of providing trustee services will be aware of the new requirements. If a New Zealand-resident trustee has failed to comply with the new requirements and the trustee ought to have known about his or her tax responsibilities as a trustee of a foreign trust, the trustee will be in breach of section 143A of the Tax Administration Act and, if convicted, will be subject to a monetary fine and/or imprisonment. When the non-compliance is first detected, Inland Revenue will notify the trustee of its intention to prosecute for the breach if the requirements are not met. If the trustee fails to comply with the terms of the notification, Inland Revenue will commence prosecution proceedings. If a non-compliant New Zealand-resident trustee is not a qualifying New Zealand- resident trustee and the trustee has been convicted of an offence under section 143A of the Tax Administration Act and has not provided the requested information, the world-wide income of the foreign trust will be subject to tax in New Zealand. This tax liability ceases when the New Zealand-resident trustee has provided the required information. If a non-compliant New Zealand-resident trustee is a “qualifying New Zealand- resident trustee”, the sanctions for non-compliance will be limited to the penalty in section 143A of the Tax Administration Act. Therefore, foreign trusts that have at least one qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee will never be subject to tax on their worldwide income – they will effectively enjoy a safe-harbour treatment. Because qualifying New Zealand-resident trustees may be subject to disciplinary action by their professional bodies, officials consider that this will create sufficient incentive to comply. Officials consider that the proposed changes will improve the overall fairness and balance of the sanctions for non-compliance by targeting the actual mischief when it arises. The retention of the tax penalty, however, is considered necessary to deal with serious recalcitrant trustees. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. Officials recommend that: • the taxing penalty in new section HH 4(3BB) of the Income Tax Act 2004 apply to New Zealand-resident trustees but not qualifying New Zealand-resident trustees. The taxing penalty ceases to apply when the New Zealand-resident trustee provides the required information; 236 • the criminal penalty in section 143 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 not apply to New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts; • the criminal penalty in section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to New Zealand-resident trustees who knowingly fail to disclose information or maintain financial records as required by law; • the criminal penalty in new section 143(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act be removed. Issue: Penalties should not apply if a foreign trust has a qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee Submission (48 – New Zealand Law Society) New section HH 4(3BB) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and new section 143(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to ensure that they will not impose tax or penalties as long as the foreign trust has at least one qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee. Comment If the recommendations on pages 235–236 are accepted, a qualifying New Zealand- resident trustee who complies with the new requirements will not be subject to the proposed penalties, nor will the foreign trust be subject to tax on its worldwide income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Penalties should apply to the corporate trustee – not their employees Submission (30 – NZ Trustee Association) Penalties for non-compliance should apply to corporate trustees and not their employees. The bill should provide that corporate trustees, and not their employees, should be penalised for non-compliance with the new requirements. The Association is concerned that corporate trustees could nominate their in-house accountants or lawyers for the purposes of meeting the criteria of a “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee” even though they might not be subject to the full jurisdiction of their respective professional bodies. 237 Comment The policy intention is to impose sanctions for non-compliance on the New Zealand- resident trustee. If the trustee is a corporate trustee, it is intended that sanctions also apply to the New Zealand-resident directors or managers of the corporate trustee. If a corporate trustee has committed an offence against section 143A of the Tax Administration Act, an employee, officer or agent of the corporate trustee would be liable to sanctions under section 147 of the Tax Administration Act. This would occur if the section 143A offence was caused by an act done, or carried out by, or by an omission of, or through knowledge attributable to the employee, officer or agent. Although the sanctions in section 147 are not intended to apply to non-managerial employees such as clerical staff, this is not clear. Officials recommend that if the New Zealand-resident trustee is a corporate trustee, penalties for non-compliance should apply to the corporate trustee, and the New Zealand-resident directors and managers of the corporate trustee, but not to non- managerial employees. Furthermore, the proposed amendment to remove the penalty for failure to be a “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee” should address the concern relating to in- house accountants and lawyers being nominated as the “qualifying New Zealand- resident trustee”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. The bill should clarify that New Zealand- resident directors and managers of a corporate trustee, and not non-managerial employees, should be subject to the existing sanction in section 147 of the Tax Administration Act. 238 SCOPE OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS Clauses 155(2) and (12) Issue: Exclusion of certain trustees from the new requirements Submission (9W – Inter Church Working Party on Taxation, 12W – the Salvation Army of New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga Territory, 25W – Deloitte, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed definition of “New Zealand-resident trustee” should be amended to exclude New Zealand-resident trustees of charitable foreign trusts. The new requirements will impose additional compliance costs on charitable foreign trusts since many of their trustees are not likely to be members of an “approved organisation”. The compliance costs relate to amendments to the constitutions and trust deeds to include an additional acceptable trustee, recruitment and paying ongoing fees to these trustees, and the actual information disclosures and record- keeping. (The Inter Church Working Party on Taxation and the Salvation Army of New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga Territory) The proposed definition of “approved organisation” should be amended to include executors of private estates. The compliance costs would be too onerous for these trustees. (Deloitte) Foreign trusts with non-professional trustees should not be subject to the new requirements as these trusts are typically created for asset protection or asset management and inheritance purposes rather than for tax avoidance or evasion. It would be unfair and unreasonable to subject these types of trusts to the new requirements and related penalties. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The effect of these submissions would be to exclude certain trustees from the ambit of the new requirements. Comment If officials’ recommended changes to the current proposed sanctions for non- compliance are accepted (see pages 235–236), the requirement that all foreign trusts must have at least one qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee will be removed. This change should reduce compliance costs for charitable foreign trusts and foreign trusts with non-professional trustees. Officials consider it may be appropriate to exclude certain foreign trusts from the new requirements if Inland Revenue is able to obtain information about those trusts from another government authority or other body that requires similar information- disclosure and record-keeping. On this basis, officials consider there is a case for excluding charitable foreign trusts from the new requirements. 239 New Zealand has recently introduced a charities registration system. Organisations seeking charitable recognition may apply to the Charities Commission. Upon application, certain information is required to be lodged with the Commission, including a copy of the constitution or trust deed of the organisation and a set of annual accounts. If Inland Revenue were permitted to obtain this information for the purposes of satisfying a valid request for information from a foreign tax jurisdiction, this would meet New Zealand’s exchange of information obligations. There is currently provision for Inland Revenue to obtain information from the Charities Commission. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. Charitable foreign trusts should be excluded from the new requirements if they are registered with the Charities Commission. 240 APPROVED ORGANISATION Clause 155(2) Issue: Eligibility criteria Submission (30 – NZ Trustees Association) The NZ Trustee Association (NZTA) should be an “approved organisation”. Unless the Association is an approved organisation its members who are in the business of providing trustee services would not be eligible for “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee” status. This is likely to disadvantage NZTA members in the provision of trustee services in New Zealand. Comment If the recommendation to remove the requirement that a foreign trust must have at least one qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee is accepted, the perceived disadvantage between NZTA members and non-members in the provision of trustee services for the administration of foreign trusts in New Zealand should be minimised. Whether the NZTA is an “approved organisation” depends on whether it meets the eligibility criteria. An “approved organisation” is an organisation that is acceptable to Inland Revenue, whose members include individuals who are subject to a code of conduct and disciplinary procedures intended to enforce compliance with this code, and who typically provide trustee services in the course of their business activities. The code of conduct and the disciplinary processes are considered important factors in providing appropriate incentives for such trustees to comply with the new requirements. If the submission on page 241 is agreed, organisations will also be required to comply with other criteria set by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Once the legislation is enacted, organisations including the NZTA would be invited to apply to Inland Revenue for consideration as an “approved organisation”. Inland Revenue also proposes to issue administrative guidelines regarding the type of bodies that are likely to be found acceptable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The NZTA will be invited to apply to Inland Revenue for consideration as an “approved organisation”. 241 Issue: Commissioner to set further eligibility criteria Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have the discretion to consider other suitable criteria in determining an “approved organisation”. Comment It is the view of officials that providing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the discretion to consider other suitable criteria in determining an “approved organisation” should provide greater certainty and a more streamlined approval process. It will also avoid the difficulties that arose with the recently enacted “approved advisor group” approval process in relation to the non-disclosure rights rules. Examples of other criteria that the Commissioner may consider include: • whether the organisation’s activities require its members to have certain qualifications; • whether the organisation has a minimum number of members. The Commissioner will have the discretion to allow bodies to be approved as an “approved organisation”. District Law Societies and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants are expected to apply. Other organisations may also apply, and approval will depend upon those organisations fulfilling the eligibility criteria of the definition of “approved organisation”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Professional code of conduct Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to a “code of conduct” in the proposed definition of “approved organisation” should be replaced with a reference to a “professional code of conduct”. Comment This amendment would be consistent with similar criteria in the current definition of “approved advisor group”, which relates to non-disclosure rights for tax advisors. It also sets a higher threshold for organisations seeking “approved organisation” status. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 242 Issue: Publishing the names of “approved organisations” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to allow Inland Revenue to publish names of organisations that have “approved organisation” status. Comment To ensure that New Zealand-resident trustees know which organisations have been approved by Inland Revenue, the names of these organisations should be published by Inland Revenue on its website and/or in an appropriate publication. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 243 QUALIFYING NEW ZEALAND-RESIDENT TRUSTEE Clause 155(14) Issue: Exclusion of “manager” Submission (4 – NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners) The proposed definition of “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee” should be amended to exclude the reference to a “manager”. The term “manager” has no specific definition in any of the Revenue Acts or any precise meaning from a commercial or legal perspective and could be open to abuse. The “manager”, despite being properly qualified, may have little role or obligation in the management or administration of the corporate trustee. The requirement for a New Zealand-resident individual to be a director of a corporate trustee would ensure a much greater level of accountability given the onerous obligations imposed upon directors under the Companies Act 1993. Comment The policy intention of including a “manager” in the definition of “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee” is to ensure that there is someone in a position of responsibility who can be held accountable under the new requirements, if there are no New Zealand-resident directors of the corporate trustee. The term “manager” is intended to cover administrators or officers of the company who are responsible for the day-to-day management of the company or who carry out the duties and responsibilities of the non-resident director. Officials accept, however, that the term “manager” should be defined for the purposes of the definition of “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee” to avoid doubt. Furthermore, officials will monitor corporate trustees that use New Zealand-resident managers to satisfy the qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee status for any abuse. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Officials recommend that the term “manager” be defined for the purposes of the definition of “qualifying New Zealand-resident trustee”. 244 INFORMATION-DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS Clause 162 Issue: Timing of disclosure Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) New section 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to ensure that disclosure is not required until after the trustees have arrived in New Zealand and their residency status has been determined. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Foreign trusts with more than one New Zealand-resident trustee Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section 59B should be amended to provide that if a foreign trust has more than one New Zealand-resident trustee, only one trustee should be required to make the required disclosure. Comment It is accepted that if a foreign trust has more than one New Zealand-resident trustee that only one trustee should be required to make the required disclosure to Inland Revenue under new section 59B. To clarify this matter, officials recommend the bill provides that the requirements in new section 59B will be met if one of the New Zealand-resident trustees of a foreign trust makes the required disclosure. The bill should also provide that if a foreign trust has more than one New Zealand-resident trustee, the trustees must decide who is to make the required disclosure. 245 To ensure that the initial disclosure is made and that the trustees have nominated a “responsible” trustee to make the initial disclosure, each of the New Zealand-resident trustees will be subject to the penalties for any breach of the disclosure requirement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. In addition, officials recommend that each New Zealand-resident trustee should be subject to the penalty for any breach of the disclosure requirement. Issue: Overlap with existing disclosure requirements Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) New section 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which contains information disclosure requirements for foreign trusts, should be redrafted having regard to the existing disclosure requirements of section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment A review of the information disclosures required under new section 59B and section 61 indicates some overlap. However, the common information collected would be insufficient for New Zealand to meet its exchange of information obligations relating to foreign trusts. Officials consider that if a New Zealand-resident trustee complies with the new information-reporting requirements in new section 59B, the trustee should be exempt from the existing disclosure requirements in section 61. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. The bill should provide for an exemption from the disclosure requirements in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts who have complied with the disclosure requirements in new section 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 246 Issue: Limit disclosure requirements to foreign trusts whose settlors reside in a DTA country Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If the above submission is not accepted, the additional information-reporting and record-keeping requirements should apply only to New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts where the settlor is resident in a country with which New Zealand has a DTA. This limitation would alleviate the burden and costs of the new requirements on foreign trusts from non-DTA countries and would also be consistent with the stated purpose of the new requirements and current tax law. Comment Officials consider that limited information should be collected from all foreign trusts with a New Zealand-resident trustee, irrespective of the country of residence of the settlor. As a New Zealand-resident trustee might not know the country of residence of a settlor or a settlor might move between jurisdictions, it might be unclear, without analysis, where a settlor resides. Also, a beneficiary of a trust, rather than a settlor, could be of interest to a foreign tax authority. As New Zealand is currently working in partnership with Australia to negotiate Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEA) with non-DTA countries, it is also possible that valid requests for information on foreign trusts could in future be received from countries with which New Zealand has no full DTA, but a TIEA. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 247 RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENTS Clause 156 Issue: Foreign trusts with more than one New Zealand-resident trustee Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section 22 should clarify that if a foreign trust has more than one New Zealand- resident trustee, only one trustee should be required to maintain the records and provide these to Inland Revenue, if requested. Comment It is accepted that the new record-keeping requirements will be met if at least one New Zealand-resident trustee maintains the required records in accordance with new section 22. Officials consider that this requirement should be clarified in the bill. The bill should also provide that if a foreign trust has more than one New Zealand-resident trustee, the trustees must decide who is to keep the required records. This will avoid any arguments that the other trustee was meant to comply with the record-keeping requirement. To ensure compliance with the new record-keeping requirements, each New Zealand- resident trustee should be subject to the penalty for any breach of the record-keeping requirement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. In addition, officials recommend that each New Zealand-resident trustee should be subject to the penalty for any breach of the record- keeping requirement. Issue: Responsibility for maintaining the required records when no New Zealand-resident trustees remain in New Zealand Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The amendments to section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should clarify who bears responsibility for maintaining the records relating to the foreign trust when the New Zealand-resident trustee leaves New Zealand and no New Zealand-resident trustees remain. 248 Comment As proposed, if a New Zealand-resident trustee of a foreign trust leaves New Zealand and no New Zealand-resident trustees remain, the departing trustee can either seek Inland Revenue’s approval to keep and retain the records of the foreign trust outside New Zealand, or maintain the records of the foreign trust in New Zealand. It is the responsibility of the departing trustee to ensure that the records are readily available and can be provided at minimal cost to Inland Revenue. This matter will be clarified in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin that is issued when the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin. Issue: Record-keeping requirement too stringent Submission (4 – NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed record-keeping requirements for foreign trusts should not be enacted as they are unnecessary and inappropriate. (NZ Trustee Companies Association Ltd and the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners) New sections 22(7)(d)(iii)(B) and (C) should be deleted, and new section 22(7)(d)(iii) should be reworded as “a record of the assets and liabilities of the foreign trust”. These proposed record-keeping requirements are too wide and will impose unnecessary obligations on the trustees of foreign trusts – especially family trusts or non-trading trusts with simple and infrequent transactions that are adequately administered on a manual basis. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The policy intention of the record-keeping requirements is to ensure that appropriate records are being kept to enable the financial position of the trust to be determined. The proposed record-keeping requirements reflect the current general record-keeping requirements that apply to businesses. Officials now recognise that the requirements may not be suitable for non-trading trusts such as family trusts or private estates. We therefore consider that the proposed record-keeping requirement should apply only to New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts that are in business. 249 For non-trading foreign trusts, limited record-keeping should be required. The trustees of such trusts should not be required to maintain records relating to the charts and codes of accounts, the accounting manuals and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used in the administration of the trust. However, the other records such as a record of the assets and liabilities of the foreign trust and the details of all sums of money received and expended by the trustee in relation to the trust should still be required to be kept. Such records are necessary to enable the financial position of the trust to be determined with reasonable accuracy at any time and financial statements to be prepared. This limited record- keeping should reduce the compliance costs for trustees of non-trading foreign trusts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. The proposed record-keeping requirements should apply to foreign trusts that are in business only and lesser record-keeping requirements should apply to non-trading foreign trusts. 250 DRAFTING Submission (46 –PricewaterhouseCoopers) In section 59B(3)(c) the term “resident” should be included after the words “that ends immediately before the trustee becomes a New Zealand”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matters raised by officials) New section 59B(4)(b) should be amended to replace the word “of” (where it first appears) with the word “after”. The suggested amendment clarifies that the date on which the relevant disclosure is required to be made is 60 days after new section 59B(4)(b) becomes effective. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 251 Trans-Tasman imputation credit streaming 252 253 OVERVIEW The changes deal with the inappropriate use of the trans-Tasman imputation rules to stream imputation credits. The intention of the trans-Tasman imputation rules is that Australian and New Zealand shareholders of trans-Tasman companies can be allocated imputation credits representing New Zealand tax paid and franking credits paid, in proportion to their ownership of the company. However, each country’s credits can be utilised only by its residents. A problem has emerged in the form of imputation credit “streaming”. Imputation credits are directed to the New Zealand owners of Australian-issued redeemable preference shares (RPS), where the proceeds of the share issue do not directly cause further New Zealand tax to be paid by the Australasian group. A particular feature of these arrangements is that under Australian tax law the RPS coupons are deductible as interest. This streaming problem is being dealt with by not allowing the Australian issuer of shares to attach imputation credits to dividends if the payment of the dividends gives rise to an Australian tax-deductible amount. This automatically includes RPSs of the type discussed above. This solution is not a “first principles” solution, but is based on the Australian characteristics of the mechanism being used. 254 JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANGES Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The perceived need for this change indicates that either the law as it currently stands, or the current policy settings are defective. If the law is defective, a planned and full change is the proper response. If policy settings are not correct, the proposed changes may not be required. This indicates that a proper review is required. Comment Officials acknowledge that the legislative amendments do not comprise a first principles solution that deals with the deficiency in the law. Different solutions are available (such as aligning the tax treatment of debt and equity between New Zealand and Australia) but would have wider implications, would take longer to consider, and may prove inappropriate or impractical. However, given the market activity and in particular that the relevant transactions are being directed at the retail investment market, a timely response is required. Officials therefore considered that the legislation should be amended as soon as possible to deal with current transactions, rather than waiting for a full review to be carried out. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 255 TRANS-TASMAN IMPUTATION CREDITS Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submissions (34W – Russell McVeagh, 39 – Commonwealth Bank of Australia) Section ME 6(1B) should apply only to Australian imputation credit account companies. Comment The policy intention is that the new rule should apply if a company claims an Australian deduction for dividends paid on redeemable preference shares. Officials believe that nothing further is added by this submission, but will further clarify this in our response to the next submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 256 COMPANIES RESIDENT IN NEW ZEALAND Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The amendment should apply only to dividends which are paid by a company which is not New Zealand resident. New Zealand-resident companies which pay tax on their worldwide income should not need to consider whether proposed section ME 6(1B) applies to them or not. Comment The submission asks for more certainty. Officials have reservations about whether a further amendment is necessary. However, we accept that further certainty can be provided at no cost to the effectiveness of the rule. This can be achieved by including the requirement that the payment by the imputation credit account company be dealt with in an Australian tax return of the company. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 257 DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST Submissions (34W – Russell McVeagh, 39 – Commonwealth Bank of Australia, 47 – New Zealand Law Society) The new rule should apply only when the company can claim an interest deduction in Australia. Comment As currently drafted, the new rule may prohibit the attachment of imputation credits to dividends paid by one company in a “consolidated group” to another company within the same “consolidated group”, although under Australian tax rules no deduction is allowed for those dividends. The intention is that the attachment of imputation credits should be prohibited if the dividends are paid to non-Australian residents. Therefore, officials consider that the provision should be amended by excluding from its application dividends paid between members of the same wholly owned group if the companies involved are not New Zealand resident. Recommendation That the tenor of the submission be accepted to the extent described above. 258 PROCEEDS USED TO GENERATE INCOME WHICH IS SUBJECT TO NEW ZEALAND TAX Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submission (34W – Russell McVeagh) The new rule should not apply when the proceeds of issuing shares are applied to generate income which is subject to New Zealand tax. Comment Conceptually, if the proceeds of the issue of the redeemable preference shares were directed back into the New Zealand activities of the Australasian group, and this caused additional New Zealand-sourced income and increased New Zealand tax payments, there would not be a streaming problem from a New Zealand perspective. However it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace the proceeds of an issue of redeemable preference shares through a group of companies to its end use. This is because money is fungible. In particular, the interest deductions for companies rules are based on this fungibility concept. If Australasian groups have concerns about being denied imputation credits for dividends relating to redeemable preference shares where the proceeds of the shares were directed at New Zealand operations, they have the option of issuing the redeemable preference shares directly from their New Zealand subsidiaries. Imputation credits could then be allocated to the dividends in the normal way. Alternatively, the New Zealand operation could simply issue debt. This should yield an economically equivalent result to both parties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 259 STREAMING CONCERNS Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submission (34W – Russell McVeagh) Streaming concerns should not be addressed by amending the imputation rules. Comment The arrangements targeted by the proposed new rule could cause significant loss to the tax base. The proposed amendment deals with the problem in a timely manner, rather than a more generic approach, which would have taken considerably longer to develop. However, officials acknowledge that the proposed solution is not a “first principles” solution, and is based on the Australian characteristics of the mechanism being used. A more fundamental analysis of the use of imputation credits by shareholders, which could include an examination of the wider policy settings, is a matter for consideration in the context of the government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 260 FURTHER “GRANDFATHERING” PROVISIONS Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submission (39 – Commonwealth Bank of Australia) Section ME 6(1C) should be extended to “grandfather” certain shareholdings by companies that are in the same imputation group of companies as the imputation credit account company. Comment Irrespective of when the share issue was made, the new rule will apply to dividends paid after 1 April 2006, if the imputation credit account company and the redeemable preference shareholders are part of the same group of companies (related party issues). This is less concessionary that the treatment of non-related issues. Non- related issues made before 21 July 2005 are not caught by the new rule. The submission argues that further relief should be provided for related party issues, for shares that are held for business reasons, when: • a share-broking company within a group acquires such shares as part of its share-broking business; • security may be taken over such shares by a group company and that security may be enforced, resulting in the group company holding shares; • an insurance company within the group may hold such shares as part of its investment portfolio; and • a company within a group may hold such shares as trustee for non-related persons. Officials agree that further relief is warranted if the shares were issued before 21 July 2005 and the decision that led to the acquisition of the shares was independent of the ownership of the subsidiary companies. Recommendation That the submission be mainly accepted, and the rule be amended so that it does not apply for shares issued before 21 July 2005, if the shares were acquired in the circumstances listed above in the ordinary course of business and the decision to acquire the shares was independent of the ownership of the subsidiary companies. 261 BINDING RULING APPLICATIONS Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submission (15W – AXA) Section ME 6(5B) should be extended to exclude from the rules the proposed issue of redeemable preference shares by AXA Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd, which is the subject of a binding ruling application. The application was made before 21 July 2005, the date of the announcement of the proposed changes. Comment Technically, the legislation that underpins binding rulings provides that any amendment to the tax law upon which a ruling is based effectively negates that part of the ruling, whether the ruling has been issued or merely applied for. Section ME 6(5B) provides that the new rule applies to dividends paid on shares issued after 21 July 2005 (the date of the announcement) and subject to grandparenting, shares issued before this date. In deciding to grandparent existing public issues, officials’ main concern was the effect on public subscribers – hence the decision to restrict full grandparenting to instances where a public issue has already been made. The current grandparenting provision is relatively generous. It would not be sustainable to extend this to those considering, or in the process of, making a public issue. A rulings application falls into this category. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 262 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submission (6W – Westpac) The tax law should be changed so that Westpac Banking Corporation, an Australian company, is not required to deduct and account for resident withholding tax deductions from the dividends it pays to its New Zealand shareholders. Comment The rationale for the requirement for a non-resident company with a fixed establishment in New Zealand to deduct and account for resident withholding deductions was to address tax avoidance concerns that can arise where the non- resident company has no business operations in its home country, but has a branch operation in New Zealand. Officials now consider that it should be unnecessary for non-resident companies which have significant business interests in their home country as well as in New Zealand, such as Westpac, to deduct and account for resident withholding tax. In economic terms it is difficult to separate the New Zealand activities of Westpac (which is required to deduct RWT) and the other Australian banks that are not required to deduct. The problem is the confirmation of significant home-country business interests. There are several ways this can be done. The present legislation allows an exemption when dividends are not paid in New Zealand dollars. Unfortunately, this provision no longer correctly targets such entities because Australian companies now frequently pay dividends to their New Zealand shareholders in $NZ. It is considered that if the companies’ financial statements are not required by generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) to be presented in $NZ, that is sufficient evidence that avoidance of resident withholding tax should not be a concern. If the company’s activities are substantially or all denominated in $NZ, then GAAP will require that company to report in $NZ, which would correctly result in RWT being deducted from dividends. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by applying the anti-avoidance rule where the non- resident company has a fixed establishment in New Zealand and if the company’s financial statements are required by GAAP to be presented in $NZ. This amendment should apply to dividends paid after 1 April 2007. This will allow sufficient time for Westpac’s New Zealand shareholders (and any others who may be affected) to be informed about the change. 263 IMPUTATION CREDITS AND RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTIONS Clauses 106, 107B and 143 Submission (6W – Westpac) The tax law concerning resident withholding tax deductions should be amended to allow for a reduction in resident withholding tax deducted, to the extent that a dividend paid by a non-resident is imputed under the trans-Tasman rules. Comment The policy intention is that resident withholding tax should complement the imputation system, so that withholding tax is deducted from dividends at source only if there are insufficient imputation credits allocated to the dividend to cover its full tax liability. When the trans-Tasman imputation rules were introduced a consequential amendment to the resident withholding tax rules, to allow for trans-Tasman imputation credits to be taken into account, seems to have been overlooked. This anomaly should be corrected retrospectively to the introduction of the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, to the extent the present law has not been complied with. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the amendment made retrospectively to the introduction of the trans-Tasman imputation rules (1 April 2003) to the extent the present law has not been complied with by the dividend-paying company. 264 265 Foreign hybrids and foreign tax credits 266 267 OVERVIEW A foreign hybrid is an entity that has the characteristics of both a company and a partnership. It is treated like a partnership (with a “flow-through” tax treatment) under another country’s tax system. The bill clarifies that foreign hybrids will be treated as a company for tax purposes. People who invest in “foreign hybrids” will then receive the benefits of grey list treatment or foreign tax credits for the foreign tax paid by them on income earned by a foreign hybrid. The changes will apply to foreign hybrids that are either a controlled foreign company or a branch-equivalent foreign investment fund. Three submissions were received on the proposed amendments. Submissions were generally supportive of the proposed amendments. However, they stated that further technical changes are needed to achieve the purpose of the amendments. In particular, in relation to the amendment that reduces the amount of the dividend paid, submissions commented that it should apply to all other fiscally transparent entities and not just partnerships. Submissions also suggested that the application date be made retrospective or a savings provision adopted. 268 DIVIDEND REDUCTION Issue: Allowing a credit for foreign taxes paid by a New Zealand shareholder in a foreign hybrid Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A credit should be available against a dividend withholding payment (DWP) liability. Comment The legislation does provide a credit for foreign tax against DWP liabilities – when one would be available if the tax had actually been imposed on the foreign hybrid. New section CD 10B applies only to determine the amount of the dividend on which a New Zealand shareholder in a foreign hybrid is taxable. It excludes from that amount the amount of any foreign income tax paid by the New Zealand shareholder on the company’s income. This ensures that the overall tax result is the same as if the foreign hybrid had actually paid the tax instead of the shareholder. Furthermore, subpart LF is being amended in the bill, which changes the underlying foreign tax credit that is deductible against the dividend withholding payment liability. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extending the reduction for foreign income tax paid by a New Zealand shareholder in a foreign hybrid Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section CD 10B(1)(a)(ii) is too restrictive. It should be extended to apply to a dividend from any fiscally transparent entity when the New Zealand taxpayer is liable for tax on the income of the entity – regardless of whether that entity is technically taxed as a partnership. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The approach taken in related provisions (clauses 70 and 71 of the bill) would be more suitable. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 269 Comment In some situations, an entity which has a flow-through tax treatment in its country of organisation, is not treated as a partnership for tax law purposes in that country. For example, a limited liability company (or LLC) formed in the United States with only one member is technically taxed as a “branch” of the member rather than as a “partnership”. We agree that such entities should be treated in the same fashion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section CD 10B(1)(a)(ii) should be extended to apply to a dividend from a foreign company that is treated as a fiscally transparent entity by the laws relating to income tax of the country or territory in which the company would otherwise be liable to pay tax. Comment Under the proposed rules, the amount of the dividend received from a foreign hybrid is reduced by the foreign income tax imposed on the New Zealand shareholder only if the hybrid is resident in the country or territory imposing the tax. This may be too restrictive. For instance, when a foreign hybrid is organised in one jurisdiction – say the United Kingdom but is doing business in another jurisdiction – say the United States, the United States may treat the hybrid as a flow-through entity for tax purposes. Therefore, the New Zealand members of the hybrid will be liable to pay tax in the United States. But in this case the liability arises not because the foreign hybrid is resident in the United States but because the income is derived from sources in the United States. It would be consistent with the underlying policy of the reform to reduce the amount of the dividend for foreign tax imposed on the foreign hybrid on the basis of the source of the income. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 270 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section CD 10B should be extended to cover situations when there are two (or more) layers of hybrid entities and the foreign tax is imposed on the New Zealand shareholder of the lower-tier entity. Comment The proposed rules apply to foreign tax imposed on the New Zealand shareholder for the income of the hybrid entity. The income of the lower-tier entity will flow through to the upper-tier entity and therefore the tax will be imposed in respect of the income of the upper-tier entity rather than the lower-tier entity. Accordingly, no specific mention needs to be made to lower-tier entities. However, the legislation should be clarified to ensure that it refers to the tax liability arising under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the legislation will be clarified. 271 GREY LIST EXEMPTION FOR FOREIGN HYBRIDS Clauses 70 and 71 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The current proposal allows a New Zealand member of a foreign hybrid to treat its interest as a share in a grey list resident company (and therefore as exempt from attribution under the CFC or FIF rules) only if the foreign hybrid derives 80 percent or more of its income from the country under whose law it is organised. This is inconsistent with the application of the grey list exemption for non-hybrid investments. Also, other provisions in the proposed sections achieve the objective of ensuring the grey list country taxes the hybrid’s income (albeit in the hands of the members). Comment The grey list exemption is given on the basis that the relevant entity is subject to tax in the grey list country on its worldwide income. A hybrid entity organised in grey list country X which derives income sourced from country Y often will not be subject to tax in country X on income derived from country Y that is attributable to members resident outside country X. That is because the income is treated by grey list country X as earned by a non-resident from sources outside country X. The 80 percent rule is therefore necessary to ensure that grey list treatment is given to a hybrid entity only if the grey list country taxes most of the income earned by (or through) the hybrid entity. The threshold of 80%, as opposed to 100%, is intended to provide some flexibility where an insignificant amount of income is earned outside the jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 272 GREY LIST COMPANY UNDERLYING FOREIGN TAX CREDITS Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement that the foreign hybrid derives 80 percent of its income from the jurisdiction in which it is organised is inconsistent with the application of the underlying foreign tax credit to existing grey list companies. Comment The proposal is designed to extend the deemed underlying foreign tax credit. The credit would be extended to dividends paid by a foreign hybrid which is organised in a grey list jurisdiction and derives 80 percent of its income from that jurisdiction. There is a sound reason for the 80 percent requirement being imposed in relation to hybrid entities. The grey list country would generally not impose tax on income sourced from another country which is attributable to an investor resident in another country. So, without this restriction, a deemed underlying foreign tax credit could be granted for income on which no grey list country taxation is payable by either the foreign hybrid or its investors. However, as the submission states, the restriction should require that 80 percent or more of the income of the foreign hybrid is from sources in the grey list jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, proposed section LF 5(1)(b) should be amended by inserting the words “or more” after the figure “80%”. Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 47 – New Zealand Law Society) The legislation requires further amendment to ensure a foreign hybrid will be a “grey list company” for the purpose of claiming deemed underlying foreign tax credits in subpart LF. Comment A deemed underlying foreign tax credit can be claimed only in respect of a dividend paid by a “grey list company” as defined in section OB 1. That definition, in turn, refers to the section OE 2 definition of a grey list company. As drafted, this definition may not apply to a foreign hybrid because it requires that the foreign hybrid is liable for tax in the grey list jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 273 DEFINITION OF “COSTS” Clauses 74 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendments to section EX 44(6) should also include foreign tax on the income of the foreign investment fund (FIF) for which the person is liable. Comment One of the options for calculating income from a FIF is the comparative value (CV) method. Under the CV method a person is allowed a deduction each year for the opening value of their FIF interest, plus any costs incurred during the year. The proposed amendments in clause 74 include in those costs any foreign tax paid by the shareholder in a foreign hybrid on the income of the company, but only if the tax is imposed by the jurisdiction in which the FIF is resident. The submission states that the costs should also extend to foreign tax paid by the shareholder because the income earned by the foreign hybrid is imposed on a source basis. (This is similar to the submission made in relation to section CD 10B.) The submission also refers to clause 75 of the bill, where the amendment would be the same but the effect is different. In this case the effect of treating the amount of the foreign tax payment by the shareholder as a cost is to increase the amount of the dividend calculated under the deemed rate of return method (since that method determines income as a percentage of cost). A similar amendment should be made to this clause. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 274 DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS AND OTHER SUBMISSIONS Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Subsection NH 2(2) should be amended to make it clear that the dividend amount (item “a”) should be reduced by the amount of tax calculated under section CD 10B. Comment The proposed section CD 10B would reduce the amount of a taxable dividend subject to tax for a New Zealand resident who is not a company by the amount of foreign income tax on the income of that entity which is imposed on and paid by the New Zealand resident. The reduction in the amount of a dividend subject to tax should also apply to sections NH 1 and NH 2. Proposed section CD 10B does not explicitly link to those sections, nor does it explicitly deny that it applies to them. However, consistent with the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, there is no general cross-reference to subpart CD. A specific cross-reference would be inconsistent with this approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) When a New Zealand shareholder calculates income from a foreign hybrid that is a FIF using the accounting profits method and pays foreign tax on the income of the FIF, that foreign tax should reduce the amount of FIF income. Comment Investors in FIFs that are widely held can use the accounting profits method of calculating income from the FIF. However, in most cases, a hybrid entity would not meet the requirements for applying the accounting profits method. In particular, it is unlikely that it would be quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange or offered widely to the public in more than one country. However, it is theoretically possible that it might occur. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 275 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Further consideration should be given to whether New Zealand income tax paid on the New Zealand income of a CFC hybrid should be claimable as a tax credit. Comment New Zealand will seek to tax the New Zealand sourced income of a CFC hybrid directly, as we do not “look-through” the CFC hybrid. Therefore, officials believe that this situation is covered by the existing credit provisions in LC 4. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 276 APPLICATION DATES AND SAVINGS PROVISION Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The amendments to sections EX 24, EX 33 and LC 4 should be made retrospective. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the submission to apply the amendments retrospectively is rejected then a “savings” provision should be included confirming returns already filed when the person has relied on hybrids being grey list residents, or on the ability to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax paid by New Zealand shareholders on a hybrid’s income. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A savings provision is appropriate in relation to the amendments to section LC 4 and subpart LF, and the starting date for some of the other provisions should be more clearly specified. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Taxpayers have interpreted and applied the law in a variety of ways. This would make retrospective legislation or a savings provision difficult to implement and apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A different application date is appropriate for the amendments to the FIF and CFC rules (including the foreign tax credit against CFC income in section LC 4). Comment In relation to clause 8, there does not seem a need for a different implementation date. New section CD 10B will apply to dividends derived from 1 April 2006 onwards and will allow reduction for tax payments made by the shareholder at any time before receipt of the dividend (whether before or after 1 April 2006). In relation to the proposed changes to the FIF and CFC rules, including section LC 4, officials agree that in line with the submission it would make sense for these changes to apply on an income year basis. Otherwise taxpayers with non-standard years would need to make an apportionment, treating the CFC/FIF as subject to the relevant rules for the period up to 31 March 2006, but not thereafter. 277 In relation to underlying foreign tax credits, there does not seem a need for a different implementation date. The amendments to subpart LF will apply to dividends received from 1 April 2006 onwards, and will allow a credit for tax payments by the shareholder made at any time before receipt of the dividend. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that the amendments to the CFC and FIF rules apply for the 2006–07 income year. 278 279 Other changes to the Income Tax Act 280 281 DEDUCTIBLE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM CO-OPERATIVES Clauses 7, 10, 47 and 220 Submissions were generally supportive of the proposal to exclude certain types of payouts from co-operatives to their members from being a dividend and to allow a deduction to the co-operative. There were, however, several technical submissions relating to the drafting of the new provisions, as well as submissions that the dividend exclusion apply to all distributions from co-operatives. Issue: Support for amendments Submission (24 – Federated Farmers, 32W – Fonterra) Federated Farmers and Fonterra note that they were consulted on the proposal and that their members support it. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Election to treat a distribution as a dividend Submissions (8W – Foodstuffs (South Island Ltd), 44 – Foodstuffs (Auckland Ltd), 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Co-operatives should be allowed to elect whether a distribution to members is treated as a dividend, with an attached imputation credit, or as a deductible expense. Comment Currently, payouts from co-operatives to members may be treated either as a dividend under the general dividend provisions in subpart CD and the specific co-operative distribution provisions in ME 35, or as a deductible expense to the co-operative under the mutual association provisions in section HF 1. The proposed dividend exclusion in section CD 24B is designed to clarify the conditions under which a co-operative can deduct payouts as an expense in relation to transactions with a member. This new provision should not preclude a co-operative from distributing under any of the other existing provisions. Rather, section CD 24B should complement the other provisions by allowing the co-operative the choice of excluding the payout as a dividend and obtaining a deduction. 282 Officials agree that allowing co-operatives to elect to apply section CD 24B would provide clarity and certainty on the treatment of payouts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of co-operative company Submissions (44 – Foodstuffs (Auckland Ltd), 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) To provide certainty for taxpayers, the term “co-operative company” in section CD 24B should be defined by reference to the definition contained in the Co-operative Companies Act 1996. Comment The Income Tax Act 2004 defines a co-operative company as not including statutory producer boards (OB 1). Therefore, with the exclusion of statutory producer boards, a co-operative company would be defined according to its ordinary meaning. Although defining the term “co-operative company” according to the Co-operative Companies Act would provide some certainty, officials understand this could also exclude certain co-operatives that are not co-operative companies under the Co- operative Companies Act but would be co-operative companies under the Income Tax Act. Furthermore, amending the definition of co-operative company would also have wider implications because references to co-operatives are included elsewhere in the Income Tax Act. A wider review would need to be undertaken to ensure that these are consistent throughout the Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 283 Issue: Drafting clarification Submissions (32W – Fonterra, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section CD 24B(3) should be re-drafted to make it clear the amount that is to be excluded as a dividend. Comment Fonterra has some concerns about the current drafting of section CD 24B(3), which relates to the amount of the distribution that is to be excluded as a dividend. It accepts that the wording attempts to preserve the dividend treatment for transactions between the co-operative and member shareholders whose equity interest bears no relation to the level of transacting between the two parties. Nevertheless, Fonterra is of the opinion that this section could be drafted more clearly to avoid uncertainty and confusion. The purpose of section CD 24B is to specify the amount of the distribution by the co- operative to the member shareholder that can be excluded as a dividend under the section. It is intentionally drafted so that it does not apply to distributions that relate to shares held in the co-operative that have no relation to the amount of trading stock supplied to, or by, the co-operative to the member. If a member holds shares in the co-operative and those shares are not required in order to trade with the co-operative, any distribution relating to those shares will be treated as a dividend. Officials agree that the section should be redrafted to make clear the policy intent that distributions may be excluded from the definition of “dividend” if they are in relation to shares that members are required to hold in order to trade. Distributions will not be excluded from the definition of “dividend” if they are in relation to shares that members are not required to hold in order to trade with the co-operative. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 284 Issue: Extension of dividend exclusion Submissions (36 – Deloitte) The ability of co-operatives to deduct as an expense and exclude from being a dividend certain payouts to members should apply to all types of transactions, including the provision of services that include financial services. (41W – Deloitte) Co-operatives should be able to deduct all rebates paid to members subject only to the restriction that the rebates must constitute taxable income in New Zealand. (35W – Deloitte on behalf of Market Gardeners Ltd) The proposed amendment should also apply to consignment stock transactions where the co-operative sells on behalf of members. Comment Co-operatives may currently deduct any payout to members, as long as the payment relates to the profits from transactions between the co-operative and member shareholders. The intention of this amendment is to clarify the treatment of profits from non- member transactions, where the payments relate to trading stock transactions, rather than introducing a dividend deduction scheme for co-operatives. Extending this treatment to all rebates paid to members is beyond the scope of the current bill. The main reason for limiting the application to trading stock is to minimise the risk that businesses that would not normally set up as a co-operative would use the provision to achieve inappropriate results. This is done by linking any payout from the co-operative to the member to the sale or receipt of trading stock and to the level of shareholding held for that member to trade. When a co-operative is buying or selling trading stock it can be reasonably certain that the shareholder vendor or purchaser (as the case may be) is undertaking the activity on revenue account and is inside the New Zealand tax base. From an integrity perspective this is important. This level of confidence would fall away if the scope of the amendment were extended, even by the limited suggestion of the provision of services relating to consignment stock transactions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 285 Issue: Extension of trading stock definition Submissions (47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “trading stock” should be widened. Comment The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants submitted that the definition of “trading stock” should be widened because parts of the payouts may not qualify as relating to trading stock, such as royalty or commission payments. The New Zealand Law Society submitted that the dividend exemption should apply to intangibles in some circumstances. The deductibility of parts of payouts not relating to trading stock, such as royalty or commission payments, is covered in other parts of the Income Tax Act. Officials therefore believe that it is unnecessary to widen the definition of trading stock to include these payments. As noted earlier, the main purpose of limiting payouts to those relating to trading stock is to connect the payout to the trading relationship between the co-operative and the member. Therefore deductions are limited to shares required for the purpose of trade in a product with the co-operative, and do not include payments for shares held for the purpose of investing in the co-operative. Under the proposed amendment, payments relating to the sale of intangibles will not be allowed to be deducted as trading stock by a co-operative. This is to avoid the risk that co-operatives would be set up to take advantage of the deductibility of payouts, and to ensure that the intended scope of the amendment as described is maintained. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 286 Issue: Consistency of application dates Submissions (47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application dates should be consistent and should reflect the fact that the changes are intended to clarify the law only. The New Zealand Law Society submitted that the application date should therefore be from the date of Royal assent. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants submitted that the provisions should be backdated, or alternatively they should be consistent. Comment Currently, section DV 10B allows a deduction for those distributions that meet the requirements of section CD 24B. The deduction applies to the tax year in which the payments are made. The application date of the section is currently the 2006–07 and subsequent tax years. However, the application date for the dividend exclusion in section CD 24B is the date of Royal assent. Co-operatives with late balance dates may be allowed an exclusion as a dividend for a payment that is made after Royal assent (for example, 1 April 2006) but because of their late balance date (for example, 30 September 2006) they cannot receive a deduction for the payment. The application date of section DV 10B should be amended to apply from the 2005–06 and subsequent tax years. This means that a co-operative would be permitted a deduction for payments made under section DV 10B that also met the requirements of section CD 24B on any date after Royal assent. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, and that the application date of sections DV 10B and CD 1B be amended to apply from the 2005–06 and subsequent tax years. Issue: Drafting Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendments should clarify that amounts paid by a co-operative company to members, which are deductible to the co-operative, are taxable to the members. Comment Under proposed section CD 1B, a distribution made by a co-operative to a member is income to the member. Officials consider that this provision is sufficiently clear and do not recommend that further clarification is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 287 Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) New section DV 10B is unnecessary. Comment The purpose of section DV 10B is to ensure that a payout will be deductible expenditure to the co-operative if the payout meets the criteria outlined in section CD 24B. Officials do not believe that widening section HF 1, as suggested, is preferable to the current drafting, and it would create complexity and uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) Given that the re-write exposure draft proposes to move deductions from section HF 1 to a new section DV 14, proposed DV 10B should be moved to the end of subpart DV. Comment This issue will be resolved when the bill is included in the rewrite of Part H. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (Matters raised by officials) Section CD 24B should require that any company making a distribution under the proposed rules should be resident in New Zealand. A further requirement, that the co-operative has no reasonable grounds to believe that the member receiving the distribution is not resident in New Zealand (except if they are trading with the co-operative company through a fixed establishment in New Zealand), should be added. Comment The bill requires that a co-operative be resident in New Zealand in order for a distribution to be deductible to the co-operative. However, the legislation as currently drafted does not specifically require that a subsidiary making a payment to a member must be a resident. Officials recommend that the legislation should clarify that any company making a distribution under the proposed rules should be resident in New Zealand. 288 The proposed changes are intended to restrict the treatment to New Zealand-sourced income, ensuring that the payment to the member is taxed in New Zealand. To reflect this intention, officials also recommend that the co-operative must have no reasonable grounds to believe that the member receiving the distribution is not resident in New Zealand (except if the member is trading with the co-operative company through a fixed establishment in New Zealand), in order for the distribution to be deductible to the co-operative. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 289 TAX CONSEQUENCES OF NATURAL DISASTERS Clauses 34, 42, 49, 60, 61, 82, 98, 143(43) and (59), 186, 187 and 192 Submissions were generally supportive of the proposed solutions to technical problems arising from the floods in the lower North Island and the Bay of Plenty in 2004. One submission recommended extending the solutions. Another recommended that deductions should be allowed for losses on farm improvements when the improvement is destroyed by natural causes. Issue: Support for amendments Submission (24 – Federated Farmers) Federated Farmers note that they were consulted on the proposals and they support them. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application dates Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date for the proposed amendments should be from the 2003–2004 year because in a number of cases the donation of livestock or the restorative grant has already been made. Comment The proposed application date for restorative grants is from the 2003–2004 income year. This is necessary to deal with the problems arising from the major floods of 2004. The application date for transfer of livestock is from the 2005–2006 year. The 2004 events were explicitly dealt with at the time, and this bill introduces the generic legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 290 Issue: Exclusion of associated persons from trading stock donations Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exclusion for trading stock donations by an associated person should be removed. Comment Typically, trading stock (which includes livestock) is deemed to be disposed of and acquired at market value. Officials would have concerns about reversing this paradigm, and believe that the proposal is already generous because farmers can self- assess the qualifying event. Therefore, at this stage, we do not recommend the exclusion be extended to cover associated persons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of self-assessed adverse event Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “self-assessed adverse event” should be amended to include any other event outside the control of the person. Comment The proposed definition has been copied (with no substantive changes) from the long- standing definitions in section EH 36 and EH 63, which deal with income equalisations schemes. This definition has operated as intended for over ten years. Officials do not believe any further extension to cover off-farm events is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 291 Issue: Farming, horticultural, aquacultural and forestry improvements destroyed by natural causes Submission (50W – McCullochs, 46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Deductions for losses on capitalised and amortisable farm development expenditure (improvements such as farm tracks and culverts) should be allowed when the improvement is destroyed by natural causes. (McCullochs) Deductions for losses on farm development expenditure should be allowed where the improvement is destroyed by the taxpayer or another party, or alternatively, when the improvement is destroyed by events beyond the taxpayer’s control. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 allowed a deduction for losses on buildings when a building is irreparably damaged and rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income, when the damage is caused by events beyond the taxpayer’s control. Officials agree that it would be appropriate to similarly allow deductions for losses on capitalised and amortisable farm and horticultural development expenditure when the improvement is irreparably damaged and rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income, and when the damage is not caused by the owner or a related party, or their failure to act. Officials recommend that it would also be appropriate to allow deductions for losses on forestry and aquacultural improvements in the same circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Late estimates of provisional tax for those affected by a self- assessed adverse event Submission (Matter raised by officials) Taxpayers should be able to request that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue accepts late estimates of provisional tax if they are significantly affected by either a self- assessed adverse event or a qualifying event. 292 Comment Under current law, Inland Revenue can accept late estimates of provisional tax from a taxpayer if that taxpayer is significantly affected by a qualifying event. The definition of “qualifying event”, which requires the declaration of a state of emergency and the passage of an Order in Council, is overly restrictive. There are other situations which do not meet the criteria of “qualifying event” but where it is appropriate for taxpayers to be able to provide late estimates of provisional tax. An amendment in the present bill therefore aims to make those measures apply more generally. Under the proposed changes, “qualifying event” has been replaced by “self-assessed adverse event”. This will allow taxpayers to provide late estimates of provisional tax when some natural event has materially affected their farming, agricultural or fishing business. However, under this proposed amendment, taxpayers who do not have farming, agricultural or fishing businesses will not be able to provide late estimates. Although the criteria for a qualifying event is set at a much higher threshold, it is not restricted to taxpayers with a farming, agricultural or fishing business. Officials believe that it would be appropriate to continue to allow taxpayers significantly affected by a qualifying event to provide late estimates of provisional tax. Comment That the recommendation be accepted. Issue: Remission of penalties on written application Submissions (Matter raised by officials) The application date for the amendment to 183H of the Tax Administration Act should be changed from the 2005–2006 income year to the date of Royal assent. The legislation should clarify that the amendment applies to requests for remissions of penalties from the date of assent. Comment The proposed amendment will remove the requirement that requests for remissions of certain penalties be in writing. Currently this amendment will apply from the 2005– 2006 income year. This means that some taxpayers, depending on the balance date of their income year, will be able to use the new law earlier than others, which does not seem justified. It seems appropriate to allow all taxpayers to apply for remissions from the date of Royal assent. The amendment should also clarify that the application date relates to the request and not to the time that the penalty arises. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 293 Issue: Miscellaneous – clarification of EB 23 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EB 23 should be clarified to apply to those in the primary sector. Comment Under section EB 23, taxpayers with turnover of less than $1.3 million do not have to value their trading stock at year-end if their trading stock can reasonably be estimated at less than $5,000. Amendments to this section were not included in the present bill. However, identification of whether further clarification of section EB 23 is necessary could be considered for inclusion in the government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 294 ACC ATTENDANT CARE Issue: Application date Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date of the ACC attendant care proposal should be deferred. Comment Officials have reported to the government on the application date of the ACC attendant care proposal. The ACC attendant care provisions will require regulations to give full effect to the policy intent of the proposals, and enactment of the legislation in March 2006 will not allow sufficient time for the necessary regulations to be prepared and promulgated 28 days before the intended commencement date of both proposals on 1 April 2006. There are also indications that a 1 April 2006 commencement date will not provide sufficient time for all the system changes that ACC and Inland Revenue need to make. The government has therefore agreed that the commencement date be deferred. The new commencement date is 1 April 2007 for the ACC attendant care proposal. It is recommended that the application date of the ACC attendant care proposal be amended to reflect the government’s decision to defer the application date and to clarify the wording of the application provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Gross income of an attendant caregiver being paid by an ACC claimant Submission (Matter raised by officials) In accordance with the overall policy of this proposal, two further substantive amendments should be made. 295 Comment The change will ensure the gross income of an attendant care provider being paid by an ACC claimant includes the amount of tax originally withheld by ACC (15 cents in the dollar) when it made ACC attendant care payments to the claimant. The second amendment will allow the caregiver a tax credit equivalent to the amount withheld. It will ensure that caregivers who earn more than $9,500 annually will be taxed at the correct marginal rate. This will also mean that Family Assistance and child support obligations will be calculated accurately. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting amendments Submission (Matter raised by officials) Minor technical revisions should be made to clauses 17, 144, 158, and 159 to clarify the intent of the provisions. Comment Minor technical amendments should be made to clauses 17, 144, 158, and 159. Clause 17 – section CF 1(2) This provision should be redrafted to better express the policy intent by making it clearer that the payment addressed in this section goes first to a claimant, and then may be made by the claimant to a caregiver. Only the amount not used to obtain attendant care services should be included as income of the claimant. If the claimant uses all their attendant care payments to pay caregivers, then those payments are exempt income. Clauses 34B, 41B and 42B have been added to ensure this legislation reflects the policy intent. A typographical error should also be corrected. The reference to the “Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 1991” should be changed to the “Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001”. Clause 144 – section OB 2(1) Two typographical errors relating to references to the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 and the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 should be corrected. 296 Clause 158 – section 33A(1)(a)(iiic) The redrafted version of this clause makes it clearer that this provision caters for claimants. It also removes an unnecessary reference to the tax code used by the caregiver. Subparagraph (iv) is also amended to include a cross-reference to subparagraph (iiic). Clause 159 – section 33C The redrafted provision clarifies that returns are personal to the taxpayer, and do not relate to a particular type of income only. The filing threshold in an income year for attendant caregivers is set at more than $9,500 of total income in the income year. A typographical error in the reference to the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 is also corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 297 VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT ALONGSIDE THE VENTURE INVESTMENT FUND Clause 21 Submission (17, 17A and 17B – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Limited) The current drafting of the legislation does not exempt non-resident investors who, as a result of the complexities of the legal structure of the relevant fund, co-invest alongside the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Limited (VIF) pursuant to separate agreements with the venture capital manager. The bill should include investments made with these types of agreements. Comment The VIF enters into two main types of investment agreement. Under the first type, the VIF, its co-investors and a venture capital manager (who makes investments on behalf of the VIF and its co-investors), are party to the same agreement. The current drafting of the bill exempts non-resident co-investors who are party to this type of agreement from tax on realised gains. Under the second type of agreement, the VIF is party to an agreement with a venture capital manager and its co-investors are party to a separate agreement with the same venture capital manager. Officials agree that the current drafting does not exempt non-resident co-investors who are party to the second type of agreement from tax on realised gains. This is despite the second type of agreement having the same investment conditions and restrictions as the first type. The proposal is intended to cover all investments made alongside the VIF. Given that there is no reason to distinguish between the types of legal structure of the investment agreements, officials agree that the drafting should be altered to capture all investments made alongside the VIF. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 298 Submission (17, 17A and 17B – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Limited) That the exemption contemplated in the bill be extended to 31 March 2010 to allow a sufficient period for the VIF to enter into venture investment agreements. Comment The proposal is intended to have a temporary effect because the VIF has a limited number of funds to invest. When the funds have been committed, new investors will not be able to access the tax exemption. To ensure that the exemption can apply to all investments made under the current VIF programme, officials agree that the date to which the exemption applies should be extended. If the VIF is still in operation when this amendment ceases to have effect, the issue of whether the exemption should be extended further will be reviewed at that time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (17, 17A and 17B – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Limited) Remove the requirement that, for a co-investor to be eligible for the exemption, the VIF be reasonably satisfied that no co-investor (and its associated persons) who is resident in New Zealand has a direct or indirect interest of more than ten percent in the company being invested in. Comment In effect, this requirement means the VIF has to investigate the tax residency of the ultimate owners of a VIF co-investor. Officials agree this is not practical. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 299 EXEMPTION FOR INTERESTS IN EMPLOYMENT-RELATED FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES Clause 73 Issue: Qualifying private foreign annuity – time period Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The four-year timeframe in section EX 37, which contains the qualifying foreign private annuity exemption, should be aligned with the new five-year timeframe in section EX 36(2)(b)(ii). Comment The policy intention of the proposed amendments to section EX 36 is to streamline the various FIF exemptions that apply to foreign superannuation scheme interests thereby ensuring both consistency and equity in the FIF rules. Officials consider that aligning the timeframes, which relate to the period of New Zealand residence covered by the exemptions, will be consistent with the stated policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Part entitlements to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section EX 36 should be amended to clarify that these rules can apply to part of an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme. Comment It is the view of officials that the issue raised in this submission should be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin dealing with the new legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 300 Issue: Australian superannuation funds Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Foreign investment fund interests in Australian superannuation funds should be subject to the grey-list exclusion when they are acquired through employment in Australia. Comment Officials are currently working on the proposal to amend the FIF rules to exempt interests in specified Australian superannuation schemes. The change was signalled in the speech by the then Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue at the International Fiscal Association on 29 April 2005. The change would apply to first- time and returning residents to New Zealand who hold interests in an employment- related superannuation scheme in which the entitlements under the scheme are generally locked in until retirement. Further work is being undertaken on the proposal to determine the scope of the exemption – whether it should be extended to all Australian superannuation scheme interests and, if so, whether this extension will resolve the longstanding compliance issues or reduce the disincentive for people to take up long-term or permanent employment in New Zealand. The submission will be considered in the context of ongoing work. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reinstating the exemption relief for current taxpayers Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The amendments to section EX 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should not remove the exemption for people who currently rely on it. The amendments were supposed to extend rather than remove the current exemption. Comment Officials agree that the proposed amendments to section EX 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be clarified to make it clear that they extend rather than remove the current exemption for interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 301 Issue: Amendments to section EX 36 should be retrospective Submission (Matter raised by officials) The amendments to section EX 36 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should apply from the commencement of the foreign investment fund rules. Comment A number of private sector individuals have commented that the relief provided by the proposed exemption should also apply to returning residents who have arrived in New Zealand before 1 April 2006. They consider that the vast majority of people who are aware of their FIF obligations have interpreted the current exemption as applying to returning residents anyway. The effect of the suggested change is that the proposed exemption would apply retrospectively. Officials are aware that people may not be complying correctly with their tax obligations under the current FIF rules and, indeed, may not even be aware that they have to account for tax. It is recognised that this non-compliance is largely due to the complexity of the FIF rules (and, in particular, the application of the current exemptions) and the differing treatment of first-time residents and returning residents. It is the view of officials that the suggested change should be accepted as it will simplify the application of the new exemption and improve the equity of the FIF rules as they apply to first-time and returning residents. Although the suggested change is likely to give rise to a fiscal cost this is expected to be small because some existing FIF exemptions relating to superannuation scheme interests have been interpreted by taxpayers as applying to them. A precise measure of the fiscal cost can not be quantified because there is no information readily available on the number of taxpayers who currently hold such interests or who are currently exempt from the FIF rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 302 Issue: Technical deficiencies in new section EX 36 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section EX 36 should be clarified to ensure it applies to both first-time residents and returning residents to New Zealand. As currently drafted, this provision assumes that the person is a first-time resident. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section EX 36(2)(b)(ii) should refer to the sixth income year after the year of becoming a New Zealand resident. Comment New section EX 36(2)(ii) refers to “the fifth income year following the year in which the person becomes a New Zealand resident”. This provision ensures that employment-related superannuation scheme interests acquired by new migrants or returning residents in the first five years of New Zealand residence will be covered by the new exemption. Officials consider that the draft legislation accurately reflects the relevant period of New Zealand residence to which the new exemption should apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 303 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The period that is referred to in new section EX 36(2) should be properly reflected in new section EX 36(3). Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 304 INCREASE IN CHILD TAX REBATE Clause 89 Submission (24 – Federated Farmers of NZ, 26W – National Council of Women of New Zealand) Federated Farmers supports the proposed change. (Federated Farmers of NZ) While this clause offers greater fairness to young workers, the submitter would be concerned if such a measure was seen as an incentive by children and their parents to allow them to work longer hours. The Committee should consult with the Commissioner for Children to ensure that regulations governing the paid employment of children are strictly enforced. (National Council of Women of New Zealand) Comment The child rebate is being increased so children who earn income below a certain level do not have to complete tax returns. The measure is aimed at reducing compliance and administrative costs. Recommendation Note that such consultation is outside the scope of the bill. 305 REVERSE TAKEOVERS AND CONTINUITY RULES Issue: Support for amendment Clauses 2, 146 and 147 Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Society and the Institute support the amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Application date Submission (23 – Citibank, N.A. (New Zealand Branch), 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The “clarification” to the concessionary continuity rules should have retrospective effect from 1 April 1992 (the date on which they first came into force). Comment The proposals “extend” existing law, but the change applies prospectively. The present law requires a company to maintain a continuity of shareholding of 49 percent in order to carry forward tax losses, and a continuity of 66 percent for imputation credits to be allocated to dividends. These continuity rules are premised on tracing shareholdings through groups of companies back to non-corporate shareholders. The concessionary continuity rules acknowledge that this is not practicable in some circumstances. These concessionary rules are not comprehensive in their coverage. This is the second extension to them. The first was in 2002 and allowed for “spinouts” (where a subsidiary of the top-tier company was “spun out” to the top-tier company’s shareholders, with no real change in shareholding). In contrast, the underlying tracing rules, while sometimes not practical to apply, are comprehensive. The concessionary continuity rules do not currently provide continuity when a smaller widely held company takes over or merges with a larger one (for example, a reverse takeover). 306 From a policy perspective such a takeover or merger should not result in losing tax losses or imputation credits when there is clearly a continuity of shareholding through the process of at least 49 percent or 66 percent respectively. This proposal incorporates changes to reflect this in the concessionary continuity rules. Citibank argues that the proposal should be made effective retrospectively. Any decision on the application date of the changes is essentially a matter of judgement. Precedent also needs to be considered. Further, there is a general presumption against making legislation retrospective. Grounds that may justify a retrospective amendment include: • the law as written is manifestly unjust under the circumstances; or • the law as written gave rise to rational and legitimate expectations (“rational expectations”) as to how it would apply, and the law did not apply in that way (perhaps due to an unexpected interpretation of the law). The present concessionary continuity rules are having the effect intended and were generally understood when they were enacted, although some of the outcomes are not appropriate from a policy perspective because the reverse takeover scenario was not specifically considered when the rules were designed. Therefore, it cannot be argued that they are manifestly unjust, or that Citibank should have a reasonable expectation that they should have applied to a merger. Citibank New Zealand and its tax advisors argue otherwise quoting, in particular, a letter from Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue dated October 2000. Officials agree that the letter confirms that the merger transaction itself should not, from a policy perspective, cause losses to be lost. In fact, under the underlying tracing rules continuity would not be lost because of the merger transaction. However, this letter should not have caused a rational expectation of what the law is because it makes clear that the opinion is from a policy perspective and does not purport to be an analysis of law. Citibank also argue that the proposal clarifies existing law and is not a change to it. Officials agree that if the proposal was merely a clarification, retrospectivity could be justified. However, officials believe these proposals change the concessional continuity rules by extending them. The main argument for retrospective legislation is that Citibank New Zealand has 49.8 percent continuity through its merger process and thus it should be able to carry its losses through the merger in accordance with the underlying policy intent as generally reflected in the continuity legislation. The submission is that the concessionary rules should be retrospectively extended to reflect the policy intention. If its submission is successful, Citibank would still have to establish that they otherwise complied with the concessionary continuity rules throughout the period they had losses. 307 Notwithstanding this, the government has a general policy of not enacting retrospective tax legislation, and the criteria discussed above for doing so are not satisfied. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) Section OD 5AA(2) should be amended to begin with the words “Subsections (3) and (4) apply if”. Comment The intention is that subsections (3) and (4) should apply only if subsection (2) is satisfied. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in principle Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The words “by reason of having been holders of ownership interests in the initial parent” should be added at the end of section OD 5AA(2)(f)(ii). Comment The submitter is making the point that a shareholder may hold other shares in a “new parent” and that these should not upset the continuity measurement. This point is valid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in principle. 308 Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) It should be made clear that in applying subsection (2)(e), ownership of the initial and new parents is determined without applying section OD 5(5), or else the relationship between the provisions should be clarified. Comment Determining ownership interests in subsection (2)(e) under section OD 5(6)(b) would be consistent with subsection (2)(d). Officials consider that the subsection should be clarified in this way. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) It is not clear what the purpose of subsection (5) is and this should be spelt out explicitly in any Inland Revenue explanatory material on the provision. Comment After further consideration of this complex area of the legislation officials agree that proposed section OD 5AA(5) should not be proceeded with. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that proposed section OD 5AA(5) should be omitted. Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) Subsection (6) does not seem to make sense, and should be amended to do so. Comment Officials have discussed this submission with the author, and agreement has been reached that no change is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 309 Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) Subsection (7) marks a change in policy relating to the market interest test. Comment Officials agree that subsection (7) needs revisiting. Its intention, to state which core tests apply, is clear but repeated references to section OD 5AA(5) are redundant because of the recommendation to repeal that subsection. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Section OD 5AA(7) is to be redrafted for greater clarity and to remove references to section OD 5AA(5). 310 INCOME TAX RATES Clause 3 Issue: Confirmation of annual income tax rates for 2005–06 tax year Submission (Matter raised by officials) As the legislation to confirm the annual income tax rates for the 2005–06 tax year was recently enacted via the Taxation (Annual Rates of Income Tax 2005–06) Act 2005, clause 3 of the bill is now redundant and should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Adjustment for inflation Submission (24 – Federated Farmers) The personal income tax thresholds should be adjusted to take into account inflation from 1 April 1998 and thereafter be adjusted regularly for inflation. Comment As recommended above, clause 3 of the bill should be removed as it has been already enacted. Given this, officials consider that the submission is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 311 Issue: Tax rates Submission (24 – Federated Farmers, 11W – Business NZ) Income tax rates should be reduced. Comment As recommended above, clause 3 of the bill should be removed as it has been already enacted. Given this, officials consider that the submission is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 312 FARM CONVERSIONS Clauses 45, 46, 143(12), 143(47), 150, 193, 200(4), 200(5) and 201 Issue: Support for amendments Submissions (24 – Federated Farmers, 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Both Federated Farmers and New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) support the proposed changes. Federated Farmers supports the proposed changes, notes the consultation with officials in developing the changes and acknowledges that the proposal takes account of modern farming practices by enabling regrassing and fertilising expenditure to be amortised for tax purposes at 45% each year when it is incurred in connection with a significant capital activity such as a farm conversion. Federated Farmers’ comment is that although the proposal is not as favourable as would be the case if all such expenditure could be deducted in the year it was spent, it provides a substantially better result than under current law, which would require amortisation of the capital expenditure at 6% a year. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants also endorses the proposed changes and discusses several minor technical points. Issue: Application from the 2005–06 tax year Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Instead of the proposed changes applying to expenditure incurred on, and after 1 April 2005, they should apply to the 2005–06 tax year because many farmers have non- standard balance dates. Comment As noted in the commentary on the bill, the proposed changes will apply to expenditure incurred on, or after 1 July 2004, and not 1 April 2005, as preferred in the submission. July 2004 is the month when Inland Revenue issued its Operational Statement (OS 007) on the treatment of farm conversion expenditure. 1 July was set as the application date because the Operational Statement changed the commonly held view of the law by providing a statement for the first time. 313 A clear, simple switch in treatment under the amortisation rules is provided by having the amendments apply to expenditure incurred after a date, rather than on an income- year basis. This avoids the possibility of having different treatments result for farmers because they have different income years with different balance dates. The amendments will override the Operational Statement in relation to the treatment of regrassing and fertilising expenditure associated with farm conversions and should thereby avoid any further confusion for taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Procedure for claiming deductions for the 2005–06 tax year Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rules should allow taxpayers to “catch up” any deduction that cannot be made in tax returns for the 2005–06 tax year either by reassessment or adjustment in the next tax return period. Comment In practice the problem is unlikely to arise as the bill is likely to be enacted in March, which is the same month as Inland Revenue sends out tax returns for the 2005–06 tax year. If there are farmers who have already filed returns that are affected retrospectively by the amendments, Inland Revenue advises that adjustments will be made, on application, by agreement with farmers to reflect the retrospective application of the new law after it comes into force. This is most likely to be the case for expenditure incurred in, and returned for, the 2004–05 tax year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 314 Issue: Subsection numbering Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section 46 should state: Order in Council to amend Schedule 7 (8) (1) The Governor-... Comment The submission refers to clause 46 of the bill, which currently reads: 46 Improvements to farm land (1) After section DO 4(7) (Link with subpart DA), the following is inserted: ‘‘Order in Council to amend Schedule 7 ‘‘(8) The Governor-General may from time to time by Order in Council, make regulations to amend Schedule 7 so as to vary the categories of improvements and percentages of diminished value of those improvements allowed as a deduction.’’ (2) Subsection (1) applies for income years corresponding to the 2005–06 and subsequent tax years. The current drafting follows the conventional way of adding a new subsection – in this case, adding a subsection (8), after the current subsection (7) of section DO 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004. Officials have discussed this submission with the drafter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Straight line versus diminishing value amortisation rates Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amortisation rate should be straight line rather than diminishing value. Pasture only has an effective life of three years but expenditure on pasture is never completely written off under the amortisation rules, which only operate on a diminishing value basis. 315 Comment The amendments reflect a three-year life for pasture, according to modern farming practices. The specific proposal for grassing and fertilising expenditure proposes a diminishing value rate of 45%. Under Schedule 10 to the Income Tax Act 2004, 45% is the closest equivalent diminishing value rate to the equivalent straight line depreciation rate for an asset with a three-year life, which is 33.33%, rounded to 33.5%. The changes proposed in the bill make minor amendments to the existing amortisation rules to update and clarify the treatment of grassing and fertilising expenditure. The amortisation rules relate to a significant number of other activities and categories of expenditure affecting not just farming but aquaculture and forestry. Changing the methods used under the amortisation rules would require a broad review of the way farming and other primary sector expenditure is treated, which is beyond the scope of the current minor amendments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of significant capital activity Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The meaning of a change in the nature or character of a farming activity is too open to interpretation. The definition should be more positive and should exclude conversions that change less than 75 percent of a farming activity. Comment A key objective of the amendments is to ensure that some regrassing and fertilising expenditure is recognised as capital account expenditure when it is incurred as part of a larger, significant capital account project. Accepting the submission would mean in all likelihood that no such expenditure would ever be recognised on capital account. A likely consequence of imposing a fixed limit is that conversions would be timed to straddle two tax years so that the limit is not breached in any one tax year, with the effect that all such expenditure would be treated on revenue account. Moreover, imposing any set boundary would be arbitrary and inappropriate in relation to assessments which must be made in the circumstances of each case, as each will raise different questions of fact and degree. For example, a significant capital activity for a very large farming business conducted over many farms might never affect anywhere near 75 percent of the business. This means that the capital costs of 316 grassing and fertilising expenditure associated with farm conversion would only be recognised when incurred by smaller, typically single farm, businesses. Further defining the terms used would risk reducing the flexibility necessary to deal with a wide range of circumstances. The amendments are constructed on the general principles developed by the courts that are used to distinguish activities conducted on capital account from those conducted on revenue account. These principles are discussed in Inland Revenue’s Operational Statement (OS 007), issued in July 2004, and help define the meaning of the words in the proposed amendments. The proposed amendments define a significant capital activity, “in relation to a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand”, as “an activity that enables a change in the nature or character of a farming activity from that undertaken on the land immediately before the change.” In addition, the definition excludes changes in the intensity of farming activities from being treated on capital account, despite that, under general principles, such changes could, in some circumstances, be regarded as being on capital account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Guidelines Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Guidelines should be provided on what is meant by a change in the nature or character of a farming activity and a change in intensity of a farming practice. Comment Inland Revenue’s July 2004 Operational Statement (OS 007) refers to a widely understood example of a farm conversion: that of converting a sheep to a dairy farm. The commentary on the bill includes an example of a change in the intensity of a farming activity: moving from eight (low intensity) to 12 (high intensity) sheep or other stock units per hectare. Inland Revenue will consider providing further guidance through its operational statements if there are specific situations of concern. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 317 ROLLOVER OF EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN LISTED CFCS Issue: Consequential amendments Clause 77 Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill proposes to replace section EZ 29 with a new section EZ 29. The purpose of the amendment is to extend the exemption for interests in certain listed controlled foreign companies (CFCs) until the 2010–2011 tax year. The current sections EX 19(5), EX 21(35) and EX 46(7) refer to section EZ 29 using the words, “Disclosure restrictions on grey list CFCs before 2006–07”. Given that the CFC exemption is being extended, these sections should be amended so that they refer to section EZ 29 using the words, “Disclosure restrictions on grey list CFCs before 2011–12”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 318 319 Other changes to the GST Act 320 321 GST ON GOODS AND SERVICES SUPPLIED TO SECURITY HOLDERS Issue: Purpose of the amendments and consultation Clauses 203(2) and (6), 20, 205(2) and (4), 206, 207(2) and (5), and 209 Submissions (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendments do more than clarify the application of GST to suppliers of financial services and, in fact, overturn the Court of Appeal decision Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Limited. 16 As such, it is a base-maintenance measure, not a clarification. Consultation on the proposal was not on the basis envisaged by the generic tax policy process. The GST Act should follow the legal form of transactions. The amendments are inconsistent with this principle. The amendments will create uncertainty, create areas of dispute and cause difficulties with determining the value of supplies that are caught by the changes. Comment Officials agree that the amendments are of a base-maintenance nature, but consider that they also clarify application of GST to supplies of financial services. Specifically, the amendments clarify the scope of the GST exemption that applies to financial services with a view to stopping arrangements that substitute the supply of otherwise taxable goods and services with GST-exempt financial services. The general concern regarding the scope of the financial services exemption in connection with substituting otherwise taxable goods and services with financial services was raised in the discussion document, GST and financial services, which was released in October 2002 with the usual opportunity to make submissions. 17 The proposal outlined in the discussion document for dealing with substitution problems was not considered to be effective following the later High Court decision Gulf Harbour Development Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 18 and further work was carried out which has resulted in the amendments in this bill. Officials agree that, for the most part, determining the GST treatment of a transaction according to its legal form produces the most efficient tax outcome. This outcome, however, needs to be balanced against the effect that substitution can have on consumer behaviour because of its potential tax advantages. If, in the absence of suitable anti-avoidance measures, a product can be offered without GST, consumers 16 (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915. 17 See paragraphs 6.21 to 6.24, page 40, GST and financial services. 18 (2003) 21 NZTC 18,192. 322 will have an obvious preference for this product over an identical product that is subject to GST, resulting in inappropriate policy outcomes. Since its enactment, the GST Act has contained a number of measures that deal with the substitution of otherwise taxable goods and services with GST-exempt financial services. The amendments in this bill are consistent with these earlier anti-avoidance measures. The boundary between taxable goods and services and GST-exempt financial services, as with any tax boundary, creates uncertainty and areas of dispute. The court decision involving Gulf Harbour Development Limited is an illustration of this. The amendments seek to reduce the extent to which disputes occur and uncertainty arises by refining the boundary between taxable and exempt supplies, and setting out the consequences if otherwise taxable goods and services, such as club memberships, are supplied to security holders as a result of a right arising from the security. Uncertainties regarding the application of the amendments to debt securities are considered in relation to the next submission, “Proposed scope and application of the amendment”. Officials consider the recommendation to remove “debt securities” from the scope of the amendments provides a solution that should, to some extent, deal with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ concerns. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Proposed scope and application of the amendment Clause 203(2) Submissions (14W – The Retirement Villages Association of New Zealand Inc, 43AW – Deloitte) Commentators on the bill have noted that the amendment could require GST to be paid on refundable deposits paid to secure licences-to-occupy at a retirement complex. Although the intent of the amendment is not to impose GST on such supplies, the matter needs to be put beyond doubt. (The Retirement Villages Association of New Zealand Inc) The amendment should not apply to debt securities and the words “debt security” should be removed from the definition of “associated supply”. (Deloitte) Comment Clause 203(2) defines the type of transaction that is to be treated as an “associated supply”. The amendments respond to the Court of Appeal case Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Limited and are directed at arrangements that seek to substitute the supply of otherwise taxable goods and services for the supply of GST-exempt financial services (such as shares). The effect of these arrangements is to remove the GST that a consumer would otherwise pay for 323 the supply of goods and services by instead having the consumer acquire shares in a company or other securities that give rights to receive the goods and services. The amendments attempt to remove any GST advantages associated with these arrangements. The GST advantages are removed as the supplier of the GST-exempt financial services will be required to attribute the consideration received for the financial services to the supply of the otherwise taxable goods and services at the open market value of those goods and services. The submitters are concerned that the amendment will affect the supply of debt securities (GST-exempt) that give the holder a licence to occupy a dwelling in a retirement complex (a taxable supply). Submitters argue that the effect of the amendments potentially results in GST being payable on the full value of the debt security as this represents the value of the licence-to-occupy. Typically, an individual will secure a licence to occupy from a retirement village complex by advancing a sum of money to the managers of the complex (in the form of a refundable deposit). The refundable deposit is treated as a loan (debt security) from the individual to the retirement village and interest may or may not accrue on the principal. When the individual dies or moves, the deposit is returned (with interest, if any) less any costs that the retirement village managers consider should be deducted under the terms of the arrangement. GST is usually returned on any amounts deducted. One interpretation of the amendments, particularly clause 203(2), is that GST could apply to the refundable deposit for a licence to occupy at the time the deposit is paid. The amendments are not, however, intended to apply to arrangements where the debt is repaid because there is no discernable substitution between the supply of the refundable deposit (GST-exempt) and the licence-to-occupy (taxable). Further, the GST Act seems to correctly tax these arrangements without the additional assistance of the amendments in this bill. The inclusion of debt securities in the proposed definition of “associated supply” was in response to concerns regarding the general substitutability between equity and debt investment. 19 Officials consider that the problem the amendments seek to address is less likely to arise under debt securities. Although debt and equity are substitutable economically, investing using equity gives rise to different legal relationships in connection with ownership and participation in assets from those arising from the use of debt. Officials note from the submission from Deloitte that the definition of “debt security” in the GST Act is limited to interests that provide a right to receive money, unlike the definitions of “equity security” and “participatory security” which include the assets and liabilities of an entity. The narrower focus of the definition of “debt security” and the Privy Council case Culverden Retirement Village v Registrar of Companies 20 19 Also see Riverside Country Club v The Queen 2001 CanLII 778 TCC. This case concerned whether the supply of club membership was substituted for the supply of debt. The Canadian Tax Court considered that the debt did not give membership rights. 20 (1997) 8 NZCLC 261,301. The case concerned the meaning of the term “debt security” used in the Securities Act 1978. The GST Act uses a similar definition to the one used in that Act. 324 suggest that it is harder to substitute otherwise taxable supplies for GST-exempt financial services using debt securities. Officials agree that debt securities should be removed from the proposed definition of “associated supply” in clause 203(2) and the valuation rule in clause 205(2). This change should also address the concerns raised by the Retirement Villages Association of New Zealand in its submission. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Clause 203(2) and 205(2) should be amended to remove the words “debt security”. 325 GST AND INTERNATIONAL POSTAGE STAMPS Issue: Support proposed amendment Clauses 205(1) and (3) Submission (22W – Ernst & Young) Ernst & Young on behalf of DX Mail, agrees with the proposal to ensure a level playing field for all entities operating in the postal services market. This will be achieved by clarifying that all postage stamps supplied in New Zealand are subject to GST irrespective of whether the stamps are used to send mail overseas and irrespective of whether the seller is registered under the Postal Services Act 1998. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Oppose proposed amendment Clauses 205(1) and (3) Submissions (19 – Universal Mail Limited, 19A – Universal Mail 48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment will: • create more anomalies within the GST Act rather than remove them; • is not consistent with the policy of GST; and • will substantially reduce the profitability of Universal Mail. (Universal Mail) The cost of sending an item (letter, parcel or other article) from New Zealand should be zero-rated. GST policy needs to be consistently applied to all items that are delivered overseas. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Alternatively, Universal Mail suggests that the provision that ensures couriers are excluded from the proposal should be removed, or that all international mail be zero- rated. 326 Comment Officials agree that the arguments for and against imposing GST on postage stamps used to send mail overseas are finely balanced. However, when considered in the context of the market in which postage stamps are used, compared with the transportation of goods or the communications market, officials consider that, on balance, the better argument is that GST should apply. Officials also note that the policy advanced in this bill is consistent with international agreements on the treatment of charges relating to the delivery of mail and policies being developed in the European Union. The problem that the amendment seeks to resolve is the result of deregulating the postal services market and the different purposes of the Postal Services Act 1998 and the GST Act. Legislation governing the supply of postal services is concerned with domestic postal services. Postal services involved in overseas mail only are not covered by the Postal Services Act, whereas operators involved in both domestic and international mail delivery are. Persons that are not regulated by the Postal Services Act may use stamps, but these are not “postage stamps” as defined in the Postal Services Act. The reference to the GST Act to “postage stamp” was intended to cover all instances when postage stamps were supplied, not just to those governed by the provisions of the Postal Services Act. The objective of the amendment in this bill is to ensure that: • supplies of postage stamps are treated the same regardless of whether the person selling the stamps in New Zealand is registered under the Postal Services Act; and • the consumption of postal services remains in the GST base. Officials note that while Universal Mail and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants oppose the proposed amendment, it is supported by DX Mail, which is also involved in the postal services market. New Zealand Post was consulted during the development of the policy. Why are stamps taxed when courier services are zero-rated? GST is a tax on consumption that occurs in New Zealand. For practical purposes this means that sales of goods and services in New Zealand to New Zealanders and tourists alike are subject to GST. This policy is integral to the objectives of maintaining a broad-base, low-rate GST system. In principle this policy suggests that the supply of transportation services involving the movement of goods from New Zealand should also be taxed. 21 The costs associated with moving goods to and from international borders are considered to be embodied in the value of the goods when they reach their ultimate destination. Transportation costs, including insurance and the declared value of the goods, will often form the dutiable value for excises, duties and indirect taxes (such as VAT or GST) imposed at the border of destination. Transportation costs from the country of origin are therefore zero-rated to reduce the potential for double taxation to 21 A deduction for any GST paid would be allowed to the NZ exporter if the transportation was incurred for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 327 arise as goods move from one country to another. Postage stamps are rarely, if ever, included in this calculation. In the case of stamps that are purchased in New Zealand, the supply occurs in the country of origin. The New Zealander or tourist directly receives the stamp and has the discretion to hold on to the stamp as a collectors’ item (souvenir) or use it to post a mail article. If any other product was supplied to a tourist or New Zealander in New Zealand, GST would apply (duty-free shopping would be an exception to this). Under the principles set out in the Court of Appeal decision Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 22 the purchaser in New Zealand is considered to receive the benefit of having the mail sent to another person. While officials note the inconsistency with international travel and international courier services, officials consider that this does not necessarily lead to a presumption that outbound postal services should have the same treatment as these other services. Officials therefore view outbound mail delivery services purchased in New Zealand to be services consumed in New Zealand. Importantly, this policy is consistent with the Universal Postal Union (UPU) agreement where consumption is considered to occur in the country of residence of the initiator or sender of the mail. Therefore, GST should be charged by the country in which the initiator of the mail resides. Officials also note that courier services operate in a different market and provide a product that is distinguishable from standard postal services in terms of price, speed of delivery, security and certainty of delivery. Officials are of the view that the services couriers offer are therefore not directly substitutable for the postal market. Supply of postal services like other communication services Officials consider that other equally valid comparisons to postal services can be made, for example, telecommunication services and sending electronic mail from New Zealand. These communications services are all subject to GST if initiated in New Zealand because consumption is considered to occur in New Zealand. This policy is consistent with the international treatment of telecommunication services used in Australia, Canada and the European Union. The supply of all forms of communication by fax, e-mail, telecommunication or letter should be treated similarly. Regardless of which analogies are drawn, an economic distortion may be perceived in these situations depending on an individual’s perspective of which “market” they view their products to be competing in. 22 (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. 328 Whether the amendment will create further anomalies The purpose of the amendment is to remove GST pricing advantages for postal operators who are not required to register under the Postal Services Act, and who argue that they are not required to charge GST on international outbound mail delivery. The amendment ensures that all suppliers of postage stamps are treated equally for GST purposes and that consumption in New Zealand is appropriately taxed. Officials therefore note that the amendment removes an anomaly rather than creates one. Other matters Apportionment: Universal Mail notes that most of its services are carried out overseas, leading to an apportionment of the sale price attributable to the domestic and international component of the transaction. Officials note that apportioning the price of a postage stamp in this way is inconsistent with the way the Courts analyse the application of GST. 23 It is more appropriate to consider the application of GST on a supply of goods and services in terms of the product received by the consumer, not according to the means or components that made up the supply. This analysis creates an all or nothing approach in determining the application of the zero-rating rules unless the contract under which the goods and services are supplied makes it clear that there is an intention to make two separate supplies (domestic postage and international postage) rather than one. Cost to Universal Mail: Universal Mail is concerned that the amendment will reduce its profitability. However, officials are of the view that the amendment reflects the policy intent that goods and services supplied in New Zealand be subject to GST at the standard rate. Further, it is arguable whether an unregistered postal operator can in fact properly apply the criteria governing the supply of vouchers as set out in the GST Act and on which Universal Mail has based its business. The key criterion is whether it can be argued that it is not practical (because the issuer and supplier are different persons) to treat the issue or sale (as opposed to the redemption) of a voucher as a supply of goods and services. Officials acknowledge that the change will have an impact on Universal Mail’s profitability. Alternative proposals Submitters have recommended two alternative proposals to the change contained in this bill. Zero-rate international postage stamps: The argument for zero-rating international mail is on the basis that it involves the movement of goods from New Zealand to another country. In support, submitters note that couriers, prepaid delivery vouchers (PAT labels) and similar services involving the movement of mail from New Zealand are similarly zero-rated. Officials estimate that the revenue cost associated with zero- rating international mail would be the region of $1.5 to $2 million a year. However, in addition to the earlier arguments regarding the appropriate place of consumption and the differences between mail and courier services we have wider concerns that zero-rating international mail could create a precedent for zero-rating communications 23 See Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 and Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 12 NZTC 18,915. 329 services to overseas, such as international telephone calls or internet services. Officials consider that international post is in competition with these communication services. The effect of zero-rating these services would give rise to much larger revenue cost and would be inconsistent with international practice. Do nothing: Universal Mail suggests that as a further alternative, the change in this bill does not proceed. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the supply of postage stamps in New Zealand is subject to GST regardless of whether the person providing the mail delivery services in return for the stamp is a registered postal operator under the Postal Services Act. If the amendment does not proceed the current distortion in the GST treatment of postage stamps will remain. Officials note that the submission from DX Mail supports the amendment. Treatment of postage stamps in other countries To give an indication of how finely balanced the arguments regarding the treatment of postage stamps are, officials have set out the treatment of postage stamps in other countries: Australia: Australia zero-rates the supply of postage stamps used for international mail. Officials, for the reasons outlined under this submission, do not consider that this treatment is appropriate. Canada: Canada taxes the supply of stamps used for international mail up to the value of $CAN5 (as calculated by the face value of the stamp). Stamps that exceed this dollar value are generally considered to involve the movement of goods from Canada and are zero-rated. Officials consider that the treatment of stamps in New Zealand should not be determined on the basis of the value of the stamps used but on the basis of where consumption occurs. The European Union: The Commission of the European Communities has recognised that the exemption of postal services in the European Union from Value Added Tax (VAT) is creating distortions in the postal sector. Therefore, the Commission has proposed that all postal services, regardless of the destination, will be taxable at the relevant standard-rate of VAT. The place of supply will be in the country of departure. This approach is consistent with the proposed approach contained in the bill. Conclusion Officials note that the arguments for and against imposing GST on postage stamps are finely balanced. The comparisons drawn between postal services and couriers handling letters are not necessarily invalid. Officials consider there are some important differences and that other comparisons are also valid. If other policy considerations are taken into account, such as the appropriate place of consumption, the balance of arguments suggests that postal services that are paid for using a postage stamp in New Zealand should be subject to GST at the standard rate of 12.5%. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 330 Issue: Residual uncertainty Clauses 205(1) and (3) Submission (22W – Ernst & Young on behalf of DX Mail) There could still be some uncertainty surrounding the nature of the supply for GST purposes. The amendment explicitly states that the supply of a stamp will occur on sale. However the amendment is not explicit about whether the supply is subject to GST at 12.5% or zero-rated. Comment The amendment clarifies that the supply of a stamp for GST purposes occurs on issue or sale and not when the stamp is redeemed. The place of supply is in New Zealand as the stamp is issued to a person in New Zealand. Therefore, GST must be charged at 12.5%. In order to zero-rate the supply, the supply would need to satisfy the zero- rating provisions contained in the GST Act and this is fact-specific. Officials are of the view that any further legislative clarification is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 331 GST AND DISTRIBUTIONS FOR NO CONSIDERATION Issue: Application date Clauses 207(1), (2) and (3) Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should be retrospective except for the situation when a GST return has already been filed on a different basis and the taxpayer is not disputing the application of the current law with Inland Revenue. Comment The application date for the proposed amendment is when the bill is enacted. The amendment clarifies that supplies between registered, associated people for no consideration are revenue neutral. As the amendment confirms the policy intent, the amendment should apply from the date GST commenced, 1 October 1986. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clauses 207(1) and (3) should apply from 1 October 1986. Issue: The scope of the amendment should be extended Clause 207(3) Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment should also apply to relationship property splits. Comment The amendment is designed to deal with concerns specific to the distribution of property to a GST-registered beneficiary for no consideration or as a gift. These events are treated as supplies for GST purposes. Officials acknowledge that relationship property splits under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 may also be treated as supplies for GST purposes. 24 24 See Ti Toki Cabarets (1989) Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2000) 19 NZTC 15,576. 332 However, officials consider the circumstances under which relationship property splits arise under the Property (Relationships) Act are different from those the amendment seeks to address. The circumstances envisaged by the Property (Relationships) Act are considerably wider than those referred to in the submission as occurring under a matrimonial agreement. Officials therefore consider that extending the application of the amendment to relationship property splits may not be an appropriate policy response for all circumstances where property is divided following a relationship, and that the submitter’s concern should be dealt with as far as possible using the existing provisions of the GST Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 333 Other changes to the Tax Administration Act 334 335 COMMISSIONER MAY ISSUE AN ASSESSMENT WITHOUT FIRST ISSUING A NOPA Clause 164 Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The technical amendment to replace the words “income year” with the word “period” in section 89C(db) of the Tax Administration Act is supported, but the circumstances in which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can issue an assessment without first issuing a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) should be limited. Comment The amendment is a technical correction that allows section 89C(db) to apply to GST returns as well as to income tax returns. Section 89C lists the circumstances when the Commissioner may make an assessment without issuing a NOPA. They include when the assessment reflects an agreement between the Commissioner and the taxpayer or when the Commissioner believes a notice may cause the taxpayer to leave New Zealand. Section 89C(db) enables the Commissioner to issue an assessment in relation to a matter that is identical to an assessment of the taxpayer for another income year that is at the time subject to court proceedings. In this situation the disputes process would have been completed in relation to the earlier assessment, and the purpose of the amendment is to reduce the compliance and administrative costs of going through the process again. Officials note that the circumstances in which the Commissioner may issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA are already reasonably limited and the amendment seeks to clarify rather than extend these circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 336 RESPONSE PERIOD TO START A DISPUTE FOR DISPUTABLE DECISIONS Clause 155(17) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill contains a provision to ensure that the four-month response period for the taxpayer to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) applies to a “disputable decision” issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under Part IVA. However, because the term “disputable decision” is also used to establish the response period to start the challenge procedure under Part VIIIA, the proposed amendment is wider than intended. Comment Officials recommend that the amendment be restricted to situations where a NOPA is issued in response to a disputable decision under Part IVA – the disputes resolution process. This will ensure that the status quo remains for the two-month period to initiate challenge proceedings. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 337 DEEMED ACCEPTANCE OF A VALID NOPA IF COMMISSIONER DOES NOT RESPOND WITHIN THE SPECIFIED PERIOD Submission (48A – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The dispute resolution rules should be clarified to confirm that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is deemed to accept a valid taxpayer Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) if the Commissioner does not respond to that NOPA within the specified response period. Comment A key feature of the disputes rules is the timeframe allocated to parties to a tax dispute to lodge notices and respond to notices received from the other party. The purpose of the notices is to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach to tax disputes so that that all relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed. Responding to notices within a specified period of time ensures that tax disputes are dealt with efficiently and promptly. Under the dispute resolution rules taxpayers have four months from the receipt of an assessment if they want to dispute the assessment. The Commissioner then has two months within which to respond to the taxpayer. Alternatively, if the Commissioner issues a NOPA, the taxpayer has two months to respond. The submitter notes that underpinning the response time limits is a rule that if there is a failure to respond within the specified period the Commissioner or taxpayer are deemed to have accepted the other party’s NOPA. The Commissioner accepts this and is bound by the relevant law. A dispute will end on deemed acceptance (subject to the discretion of the Court in certain limited and prescribed circumstances). The specific question to be considered is whether, despite having been deemed to have accepted a taxpayer NOPA through not responding in time, the Commissioner is prevented from starting a new dispute, subject to the four-year time bar, when the Commissioner considers that a return is in error. This matter is currently being discussed between representatives of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that it also be noted that Inland Revenue officials and representatives of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants are continuing to discuss the matter. 338 SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR TAKING AN UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION Submission (48 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in section 141B of the Tax Administration Act should be amended to return to the narrower “unacceptable interpretation penalty”, with an increase to the level of temporary shortfall and voluntary disclosure reductions. Comment An unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty of 20% is imposed on a taxpayer if, viewed objectively, their tax position fails to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The penalty is only imposed when the tax shortfall is significant – that is, a shortfall over $20,000 and the lesser of either 1% of the total tax figure or $250,000. The penalty does not apply to tax shortfalls that arise from mistakes in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return. In 2003 the penalties legislation was amended. The “unacceptable tax position” penalty was previously the “unacceptable interpretation” penalty. Before the amendment a taxpayer could argue that they had not made an interpretation and therefore the unacceptable interpretation penalty could not be imposed. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants considers that the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty could penalise most, if not all, errors in excess of the minimum thresholds. If a taxpayer has made and acknowledges an error, by definition, it cannot be “about as likely as not to be correct”. The effect is that errors that should be considered under the reasonable care rules are being penalised under the unacceptable tax position rules. This is adversely influencing taxpayer behaviour, with taxpayers less inclined to disclose errors for correction by Inland Revenue. Mr Jeff Owens has also written to the Committee seeking an amendment to the legislation that would remove the application of the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty in situations that involve a significant tax shortfall but a minimal risk to the revenue. He is particularly concerned about the imposition of the penalty where a taxpayer lodges a return, discovers an error in the return, corrects the error, and pays the correct amount of tax by the due date. This submission involves significant policy issues which are not addressed in the bill. Officials are reporting to ministers setting out options to resolve this issue which, if agreed to, could be included in a supplementary order paper introduced at the Committee of the Whole House stage. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 339 Rewrite of the Income Tax Act 340 341 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL – RECOMMENDED CHANGES Issue: Unintended changes Submission (Matters raised by officials on the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel) Corrections of unintended changes in legislative outcomes in the Income Tax Act 2004 should be included in the bill. The provisions affected are: section CB 9(1)(b) and Schedule 22A (sales of land by builders and associated persons of builders), section CD 32(15) (exclusions from dividends for available subscribed capital), section CD 33(2) (exclusions from dividends for capital gains), section CD 33(7)(b) (exclusion from dividends for capital gains), section EC 48 (replacement of bloodstock), section EI 6 (allocation across income years of income derived in anticipation), section EZ 35(3) (base price adjustment result under old financial arrangement rules), section 394L(4A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (export market development credits and the imputation credit account). In addition, there are a small number of minor drafting amendments that have been brought to the attention of the Rewrite Advisory Panel. These amendments correct punctuation, spelling, grammar and cross-referencing in the 2004 Act and are listed on the Panel’s website on the “Maintenance Items Log”. Comment At the time of enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004, the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) noted a concern that the new legislation could contain adverse unintended policy changes. In response, the FEC recommended that a panel of tax specialists be appointed to review submissions which stated that a provision of the 2004 Act contained an unintended policy change. In this context, an unintended policy change is one that gives rise to a different outcome from the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 1994. The Rewrite Advisory Panel accepted this review role. The government also announced that it would consider promoting retrospective legislation to correct unintended changes in the legislative outcome of a provision in the 2004 Act. These retrospective changes, that merely restore the 1994 Tax Act’s status quo, have been recommended by the Panel to officials. Officials agree with them. Recommendation That the proposed amendments to restore the 1994 Tax Act status quo be included in the bill and that they apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year, being the application date of the 2004 Act for all taxpayers. 342 Issue: Section OB 1 – definition of “shares of the same class” Submission (Matters raised by officials on the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel) In section OB 1 of the 2004 Act, the drafting of the definition of “shares of the same class” provides for the three paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) to be alternative conditions to satisfy in order for shares to fall within this definition. Under the Income Tax Act 1994 definition of “shares of the same class”, paragraphs (a) and (b) had to be satisfied cumulatively, and paragraph (c) was an alternative condition. The Rewrite Advisory Panel recommends the definition of “shares of the same class” be amended to restore the position under the 1994 Act. Comment Officials note that the 1994 Act definition of “shares of the same class” contained a drafting error arising from an amendment in the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 (applying from 1 July 1994). Before this amendment, the three paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) in the definition were required to be applied cumulatively. The 1994 amendment repealed and replaced paragraph (b) and, in doing so, inadvertently omitted the conjunction “and” between paragraphs (b) and (c). This left some uncertainty about how the provision applied, and the 2004 Act was drafted as if each of the paragraphs was an alternative test. The rule’s intent is that all three paragraphs are to be applied cumulatively. As paragraph (c) does not apply to all situations, the rule is that where paragraph (c) applies, then it is intended to be applied cumulatively with paragraphs (a) and (b) and not as an alternative condition to those two earlier paragraphs. Officials agree with the Panel that the definition in the 2004 Act contains an unintended change in law when compared with the 1994 Act. However, officials believe it is better to have the definition reflect the correct policy intention rather than being amended to give rise to an incorrect policy outcome. The correct policy outcome is that the three paragraphs (a), (b), (c) should be applied cumulatively. Officials consider this outcome should apply from 1 July 1994, which would require both the 1994 and the 2004 Acts to be amended. However, because a retrospective amendment of this nature has potential to adversely affect filed tax positions, officials consider that a savings provision would be required overcome this possibility. 343 Recommendation That the 1994 Act be amended to correct the drafting of the provision to ensure the conditions in all three paragraphs are to be applied cumulatively, and that this amendment apply retrospectively to 1 July 1994. That the 2004 Act be correspondingly amended, and that this amendment apply from the beginning of the 2005–06 income year. That a transitional provision ensures that these amendments do not apply to a person who has a filed tax position before the commencement of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill for any relevant tax year to which the recommended amendment would otherwise apply. 344 CHANGES RECOMMENDED BY OTHERS Issue: Remedial amendments required Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submitter recommends five remedial amendments to correct cross-referencing and wording errors arising from the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Comment Officials note that of the five recommended changes, no change is required to the cross-references in the OB 1 definition of “finance lease” as these are correct. Of the four remaining recommendations: • The suggested correction to the terminology used in section CS 1(2) will be considered for possible inclusion in the next tax bill. • The suggested correction to the cross-referencing error in section FB 2(2) is included in the bill (see clause 77B). • The cross-referencing error in section EX 22(2) will be considered for possible inclusion in the next tax bill. • The cross-referencing error identified in section OB 3(1)(b)(i) is corrected by an amendment recommended by officials on page 354 of this report. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Ordering rule and slice rule Submission (46 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submitter recommends a change to the definition of “shares being cancelled of class” as used in a formula to calculate a taxpayer’s “available subscribed capital”. Comment The change suggested by the submitter potentially results in a change in policy. Officials will consider whether the matter should be included on the tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 345 Other changes recommended by officials 346 347 APPLICATION OF SECTION EE 41 TO BUILDINGS Submission (Matter raised by officials) A drafting error in section EE 41(3), which excludes buildings from the depreciation claw-back provisions in section EE 41(1), should be corrected. Comment Section EE 41(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004 allows a loss when an item of depreciable property is disposed of for an amount less than its adjusted tax value. The exception is where the item is a building. The Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 allowed, via the insertion of a new subsection (3), a loss on disposal to be claimed for a building in limited cases – that is, if a building has been irreparably damaged and rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and the damage is outside the control of a taxpayer (for example, as the result of a natural disaster). However, owing to a drafting error in new subsection (3), section EE 41(1), which claws back depreciation when an item of depreciable property is disposed of for consideration in excess of its adjusted tax value, no longer applies to buildings. A remedial amendment is therefore needed to clarify that section EE 41(1) continues to apply to buildings. The correction should be retrospective to the application date of the changes in the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 348 PAYE DEDUCTIONS Issue: PAYE tax deductions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Three problems have been identified in section LD 1 of the Income Tax Act which deals with the way PAYE tax deductions are credited towards the tax liability of taxpayers, namely: • When an employer fails to account for PAYE actually deducted, employees should be given credit for the amount of PAYE deducted by their employer. However, the legislation incorrectly refers to the employee receiving credit for the amount of PAYE received by Inland Revenue. • When a shareholder-employee receives a greater refund of PAYE than entitled to, the shareholder-employee and the employer are jointly liable for the difference between the amount refunded and the amount paid to Inland Revenue by the employer. However, the legislation incorrectly refers to the shareholder- employee and the employer being liable for the difference between the amount refunded and the amount shown on the employer monthly schedule, which could inappropriately benefit both parties. • An amount of PAYE credited to an employee of a close company must not exceed the amount of tax received by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. However, the legislation incorrectly refers to the refund including any family assistance credits paid to the employee. The employer no longer pays family assistance to employees, and the reference should be removed to avoid confusion with family assistance credits paid by Inland Revenue. Comment These problems should be corrected to preserve the integrity of the PAYE tax deduction system and to ensure that the rules operate as intended. This will require a new clause to be inserted into the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 349 PROHIBITIONS ON HAVING IMPUTATION CREDIT ACCOUNTS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section ME 1(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2004, which prohibits a company resident in a country other than New Zealand from having an imputation credit account, should be repealed with application from the 2005–06 income year. Comment A New Zealand-resident company must establish and maintain an imputation credit account (ICA) under section ME 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 unless it is prohibited from doing so under any of the circumstances listed in section ME 1(2). Before an amendment made by the Taxation (Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, section ME 1(2)(a) prohibited a company from having an ICA if it was “not resident in New Zealand”. This provision was redundant and should have been repealed because only a New Zealand-resident company can have an ICA. However, the 2004 amendment replaced section ME 1(2)(a) with a provision that prohibits a company from having an ICA if it is “resident in a country other than New Zealand”. As a result, the current section ME 1(2)(a) has the unintended effect of prohibiting all dual resident companies from having an ICA. This should not be the case. Only a dual resident company of the type listed in section ME 1(2)(b) – that is, a company treated as not being a New Zealand resident for the purposes of a double tax agreement – should be prohibited. Current section ME 1(2)(a) should therefore be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 350 DEFINITION OF “BENEFICIARY INCOME” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “beneficiary income” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be amended so that the reference to “income year” includes a non-standard accounting year. Comment The definition of “beneficiary income” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 uses the term “income year”. The term “income year” is defined as the tax year (ending 31 March) or the non-standard accounting year approved by Inland Revenue. The definition of “beneficiary income” provides for distributions to be made to beneficiaries during the income year or within six months after the end of the income year. The effect of the reference to “income year” is that the six-month period expires on a date that is six months after the (approved) balance date of the trust. This is different from the Income Tax Act 1994 where the period ended six months after 31 March (30 September). The Rewrite Advisory Panel considered a submission that the 2004 Act contains an unintended change from the 1994 Act. The Panel agreed that such a change had occurred, but decided that the 2004 Act should remain unchanged and that a retrospective change to the 1994 Act should be made to bring it into line with the 2004 Act. This involves amending the definition of “beneficiary income” in the 1994 Act so that the reference to “income year” includes a non-standard accounting year. The amendment to the 1994 Act will protect the position of all options used by taxpayers by giving them the later of six months post-balance date (for those who followed the 2004 Act position) or 30 September (for those early balance date taxpayers who followed the 1994 Act). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 351 CROSS-REFERENCES BETWEEN THE GST ACT AND NEW CREDIT CONTRACTS LEGISLATION Clauses 204(1B) and 207(3B) Issue: Amendments required to smooth transition Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials have received submissions from the Financial Services Federation and PricewaterhouseCoopers to consider amending the GST Act to provide transitional relief following changes to legislation governing the treatment of credit contracts. The GST Act makes two cross-references to the credit contracts legislation: • in connection with the definition of “financial services” under which services are exempt from GST; and • a special valuation rule that separates the interest component under a credit contract from the principal value of the goods and services supplied under the contract. Under special valuation rules GST applies to the principal value but not the interest. A problem has arisen because the GST Act was consequentially amended to reflect the new definition of “credit contract” in the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA). Some lease arrangements, which were previously treated as “credit contracts” under the Credit Contracts Act 1981, no longer qualify as “credit contracts” under the CCCFA. The term “credit” now applies to a narrower set of contracts under the CCCFA. For a contract to be considered a “credit contract” it must meet one of three limbs of the definition of “credit”. 25 The most significant of these is that the contract must defer a payment of a debt. There are two elements to this requirement: • there must be a debt; and • the payment of that debt must be deferred. Many finance leases do not defer the payment of debt. Each payment is due and payable as and when required under the lease. The total amount of the lease payments are not due on day one of the lease with the payments deferred over the term of that lease. Because of this, there is no deferral of a debt. 25 See section 6 of the CCCFA. 352 By contrast, before the CCCFA came into effect on 1 April 2005, leases were treated as “credit contracts” under the Credit Contracts Act 1981 if a contract, under which a person provides or agrees to provide money or money’s worth in consideration of a promise by another person to pay a sum or sums of money, exceeded in aggregate the amount of first mentioned money or money’s worth. 26 The result of the change in the meaning of “credit” is that lessors, who entered into certain lease arrangements before 1 April 2005 on the expectation that GST would not apply to the interest component, must now return GST. This effect was unintended. Comment The changes brought about by the CCCFA, including the change to the definition of “credit contract”, are intended to provide better protection for consumers by: • simplifying the law in relation to credit products; and • regulating the supply of consumer credit such as home loans, personal loans, credit sales (including hire purchases) and credit cards. The policy intent of the reference to credit contract is to exclude the interest component of a contract from GST if the interest component has been clearly identified in the contract. Officials have consulted with representatives of the finance lease market (the Financial Services Federation) on the effect the change in reference to the new credit contract legislation has had on the application of the GST Act. To date, members of the Financial Services Federation (FSF) have not been able to reach consensus on whether the GST Act should continue to use the old definition of “credit contract” in the Credit Contacts Act 1981 or use the new definition used in the CCCFA. However, agreement has been reached between officials and the FSF that transitional relief is required to assist taxpayers until the problem of definitions is resolved. The transitional relief would seek to carry forward the old 1981 definition of “credit contract” for leases: • entered into before 1 April 2005, and • entered into after 1 April 2005. Some members of the FSF have, however, expressed a preference for the new definition of “credit contract”. These members wish to continue to use the new definition for contracts entered into after 1 April 2005. Officials have been advised that there are substantial costs associated with system changes to accommodate the CCCFA. Taxpayers that are complying with the new credit contracts legislation do not want to incur costs in moving back to the old definition. 26 See section 3(1) of the Credit Contracts Act 1981. 353 Officials consider that for the purposes of the GST Act, both definitions should be available to taxpayers until the definition problem is resolved. Officials will recommend to the Minister of Revenue that the issue be included on the tax policy work programme and be advanced for a later taxation bill. The choice that taxpayers will have under the recommended change, in terms of what contracts are treated as “credit contracts”, is intended to apply for a limited time until officials, in consultation with the FSF, have developed an agreed solution that applies to all GST- registered persons who offer credit contracts. Officials consider that both the substantive problem of definition and the recommended transitional relief do not have substantive revenue implications but will have a material impact on compliance costs. Officials therefore recommend that the GST Act recognises contracts that comply with the Credit Contracts Act 1981 or Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 as meeting the definition “credit contract” where it appears in the GST Act. The amendment should apply from 1 April 2005, the date the CCCFA came into effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 354 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Rebate for gifts of money – Habitat for Humanity New Zealand Limited Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 67 of the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 purported to amend section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004 to add Habitat for Humanity New Zealand Limited to the list of entities donations to which are eligible for tax rebates from the 2005–06 tax year. Because of an error in the amending words, the amendment is inoperative. Comment Re-enactment of the amendment for the 2005–06 and later tax years is necessary to achieve the intended policy outcome. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Meaning of “qualifying company” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section OB 3(1)(b)(i) of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to refer to “subsection (3)” rather than “subsection (2)”. Comment Section OB 3(1)(b)(i) (Meaning of qualifying company) contains a cross-reference to subsection (2) of that section. Subsection (2) was omitted when section OB 3 was re- enacted as part of the Income Tax Act 2004. The cross-reference should refer to subsection (3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 355 Issue: Correction to Schedule 18 of Income Tax Act 2004 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 169 of the Crown Entities Act 2004 relates to the tax treatment of statutory entities, including the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Limited. At the time of enacting the Crown Entities Act 2004, the name of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Limited should have been omitted from Schedule 18 (which lists State Enterprises) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment The failure to omit the name of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Limited from Schedule 18 does not affect the tax status of the company but should, for reasons of consistency, be done as soon as possible. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disclosure of information to prevent cessation of benefit payments Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 82A(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to refer to section 81(4)(o) rather than section 81(4)(n). Comment Section 82A(5) contains a reference to section 81(4)(n) of that Act. The reference is incorrect because section 81(4)(n) was repealed in 2003 and re-enacted as section 81(4)(o). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 356 357 Other changes pertaining to the bill 358 359 WINE EQUALISATION TAX REBATE SOP 380 Submission (47 – New Zealand Law Society) The society queries why the proposed power to make regulation concerning double tax agreements is not general, rather than relating solely to wine and Australia added as a simple addition to section 225(1) of the Tax Administration Act. Comment This item has been removed from the bill and enacted as part of the Taxation (Urgent Measures) Act 2005. The amendments referred to by the New Zealand Law Society were redrafted before inclusion in the Taxation (Urgent Measures) Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 360 GENERAL MATTERS Business New Zealand made two general submissions relating to the bill. Issue: Consultation Submission (11W – Business New Zealand) The submitter notes that they were omitted from the list of parties with whom officials consulted over proposals in the bill. Comment The omission of Business New Zealand from the list of professional groups and industry representatives included in the explanatory note to the bill (page 43) was an oversight. Business New Zealand was consulted on a number of the proposals contained in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inland Revenue resources Submission (11W – Business New Zealand) The submitter recommends that Inland Revenue is provided with sufficient resources to administer the policy and legislative initiatives recently outlined by the government, so that resources are not diverted away from further tax simplification initiatives. Comment Officials note that Inland Revenue has been allocated additional financial resources to implement the recent changes announced by the government. Recommendation That the submission be noted.
Determination G22A: Optional Convertible Notes Denominated in New Zealand Dollars This determination may be cited as “Determination G22A: Optional convertible notes denominated in New Zealand dollars”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This determination gives the methods under the financial arrangements rules for calculating income, expenditure and the base price adjustment in relation to optional convertible notes that are denominated in New Zealand dollars. An optional convertible note is a type of convertible note. A convertible note is a financial arrangement in the form of an instrument issued by a company (the issuer) to a person (the subscriber or a holder) who provides money to the company. A third party (a holder) may acquire a previous holder’s interest in the optional convertible note. Under a convertible note, the company is required to repay in cash or new shares in the issuer at a future date. A convertible note usually, although not necessarily, requires the company to pay interest during the period of the loan. Optional convertible notes may grant either the company or the holder the right to elect to have the underlying debt settled for either cash or shares. This determination applies only to optional convertible notes under which the holder has a right to choose whether the repayment is to be in cash or new issuer shares. This determination applies to an optional convertible note which contains either an option that can be exercised only at maturity (a European-style warrant) or allows the holder to exercise the warrant component during the optional convertible note’s term (an American-style warrant). This determination applies to persons who become a party to the relevant optional convertible note on or after the date of this determination. It also applies to relevant optional convertible notes entered into before the date of this determination if the four-year “grandparenting” period provided for in sections 90 (6B) and 90 AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has expired. Those applying this determination must also have the following information by their first balance date following the date on which they become a party to the convertible note: (a) The value of the consideration that the person holding the note may choose to accept (the cash redemption amount) in repayment instead of shares; (b) the maturity date; (c) the amounts and dates of payments to be made under the note by the holder; (d) the dates of payments to be made under the note by the company; and (e) the amounts of the payments, other than in repayment, to be made under the note by the company or the fixed relationship between the amount of each such payment and a market or indicator interest rate. As this information is necessary to calculate the net present value of the debt component of the optional convertible note, this determination does not apply if the preceding information is not available by the appropriate time. This determination recognises that an optional convertible note has both a debt component and an equity component; the equity component is the option (or warrant) to receive repayment of the debt in the form of new shares. This determination prescribes methods of separating the consideration under the convertible note into debt and equity components. The value of the debt component is used to calculate, for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules, financial arrangement income or expenditure during the term of the optional convertible note and the base price adjustment at the end of the term. Generally, if the issuer and the subscriber are members of the same wholly owned group of companies or if the exercise of the option would result in there being no change in the ownership of the company, no value will be attributed to the optional convertible note’s equity component. Accordingly, all consideration paid by or to or on behalf of any person under the optional convertible note is attributed to the debt component. However, this rule does not apply in circumstances where the subscriber subsequently sells the notes to third parties within 93 days of acquisition. If the value of the optional convertible note’s equity component is not zero, the equity component’s value (for both company and holder) is the amount by which the consideration paid by the holder exceeds the debt component’s present value. The present value is calculated as required by another determination by reference to the debt component’s cashflows. Cashflows consist of the following payments payable over the term of the optional convertible notes: (a) The cash redemption amount; (b) the coupon interest payments, if any; and (c) any contingent fees. The income or expenditure for each of the years before the final year of the term must be calculated by reference to the debt component’s value. The calculation must be made using the yield to maturity method or using an alternative method producing results that are not materially different from those that would be produced by the yield to maturity method. The appropriate methods, and their application, are prescribed under the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the Act”). This determination provides for the following consideration flows for calculating the base price adjustment under the financial arrangements rules: (a) where the optional convertible note contains a European-style warrant, this determination assumes that the debt component of the consideration paid or received by the issuer or holder on maturity is the face value of the optional convertible note. If the holder elects to be repaid with new shares, any difference between the value of the shares and the optional convertible note’s face value is treated as being attributable to the equity component; and (b) where the optional convertible note contains an American-style warrant that allows the holder to exercise the warrant component during the optional convertible note’s term, this determination assumes that the debt component of the consideration paid or received by the issuer or holder on the exercise date is the present value of the optional convertible note debt component. The overall effect of this determination is that the financial arrangements rules treat an optional convertible note as if it were a bond that: (a) is issued at a price that excludes any amount paid or received for the optional convertible note’s equity component (if any); and (b) is settled for its face value (or its present value if converted before the end of its term). This determination replaces Determination G22\*. It applies: (a) from the date of this determination to financial arrangements that a person becomes party to on or after the date of this determination; and (b) four years after the date of this determination for financial arrangements that were entered into before the date of this determination, and that currently apply Determination G22, satisfy the criteria of this determination and have not matured within that four-year period. 2. Reference This determination is made under sections 90 (1) (c) and (g), and 90 AC (1) (d) and (h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope 1. This determination replaces Determination G22. It applies in relation to a financial arrangement that is a convertible note which contains either a share warrant that the holder can exercise only on the maturity date or a share warrant that allows the holder to exercise the warrant component during the convertible note’s term: (a) that a person becomes party to on or after the date of this determination; and (b) four years after the date of this determination for financial arrangements that were entered into before the date of this determination, and that currently apply Determination G22, satisfy the criteria of this determination and have not matured within that four-year period. 2. This determination applies in relation to a financial arrangement that is a convertible note for which: (a) all amounts payable under the convertible note are denominated in New Zealand dollars; and (b) the person has the following information by the person’s first balance date that follows the day on which the person issues or acquires the convertible note: (i) The cash redemption amount; and (ii) the maturity date; and (iii) the amounts and dates of payments to be made under the convertible note by the holder; and (iv) the dates of payments, other than in repayment, to be made under the convertible note by the issuer; and (v) the amounts of the payments, other than in repayment, to be made under the convertible note by the company that issues the convertible note or the fixed relationship between the amount of each such payment and a market or indicator interest rate; and (c) the person holding the convertible note may choose whether consideration in the form of shares or other consideration is to be provided by the company issuing the convertible note in discharge of the liability to make repayment; and (d) the company that issues the convertible note cannot require the person holding the convertible note to accept consideration in a particular form in discharge of the liability to make repayment; and (e) the option to accept shares in repayment cannot be separated from the convertible note. 4. Principle 1. An optional convertible note is a financial arrangement with a debt component and an equity component. The equity component, being the share warrant, is an excepted financial arrangement. 2. To apply the financial arrangements rules to a person and an optional convertible note, it is necessary to identify the part of the consideration provided and received by the person under the optional convertible note that is solely attributable to the optional convertible note’s equity component. That part is not included in the calculation under the financial arrangements rules of the income or expenditure arising under the optional convertible note. 3. None of the consideration provided or received by a party under the optional convertible note is attributed to the optional convertible note’s equity component and all consideration paid or received under the optional convertible note is attributed to the debt component if: (a) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or (b) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are beneficially owned or ultimately controlled by the same person; or (c) under the arrangement, however structured at the date of issue, there would be no change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests in the issuer if the share warrant were exercised at that time. 4. Subclause (3) does not apply if the subscriber intends to sell the optional convertible notes to an independent third party within 93 days of acquiring the notes and does so sell them. 5. If subclause (3) does not apply, the effect of this determination is that a party to an optional convertible note is taxed as if the optional convertible note were a bond that: (a) is issued at a price excluding an amount paid or received for the share warrant; and (b) is redeemable for the cash redemption amount or its present value if converted early; and (c) otherwise has the same terms as the optional convertible note. 6. If subclause (3) does not apply, this determination attributes to the value of the share warrant any difference between the consideration actually provided under the optional convertible note and the consideration that is deemed to be provided for the bond described in subclause (5). 5. Interpretation 1. In this determination, a reference to the Act is a reference to the Income Tax Act 2004. 2. In this determination: cash redemption amount, for an optional convertible note, means the amount that the holder receives in repayment under the optional convertible note if the person elects not to exercise the share warrant which is part of the optional convertible note, being its agreed future value or face value contingent fees is the amount of the fees payable by the person that are contingent on the optional convertible note being issued convertible note— (a) means an instrument issued by a company that: (i) is evidence of, acknowledges, creates, or relates to, a loan or other advance to the company, or any other secured or unsecured liability of the company; and (ii) provides that there is an option to require all or part of the liability referred to in subparagraph (i) to be redeemed or paid by the issue or delivery of new shares in the company: (b) includes any subsidiary or collateral agreement that fixes the amount of a coupon interest payment to be made under the instrument described in paragraph (a) coupon interest, for an optional convertible note, means an amount that: (a) is payable or receivable under the optional convertible note by the company; and (b) is not a contingent fee or part of the cash redemption amount for the optional convertible note debt component, for an optional convertible note, means that portion of the optional convertible note that is subject to the financial arrangements rules and treated under this determination as if it were a bond but does not include the equity component Determination G22 means Determination G22: Optional Conversion Convertible Notes Denominated in New Zealand Dollars Convertible at the Option of the Holder issued by the Commissioner on 24 October 1990 equity component, for an optional convertible note, means the share warrant holder, for an optional convertible note, means the subscriber or a person other than the subscriber that has acquired the optional convertible note issuer, for an optional convertible note, means the company issuing the optional convertible note and, in respect of any obligation to issue new shares on redemption, includes any company that is required to issue those shares market value interests means market value interests as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition in section OB 1 of the Act maturity date, for an optional convertible note, means the last date on which the company is required to settle the optional convertible note (whether for the cash redemption amount or for new shares in the company) optional convertible note means a convertible note that satisfies the following requirements: (a) all amounts payable under the convertible note are denominated in New Zealand dollars; and (b) the person either issues, subscribes for or acquires the convertible note on or after the date of this determination or the person issued, subscribed for or acquired the convertible note before the date of this determination, has applied Determination G22 to the convertible note and the convertible note has not matured within four years of the date of this determination; and (c) the person has the following information by the person’s first balance date that follows the day on which the person issues or acquires the convertible note: (i) the cash redemption amount; and (ii) the maturity date; and (iii) the amounts and dates of payments to be made under the note by the holder; and (iv) the amounts, or the fixed relationship between the amount of each such payment and a market or indicator interest rate, and dates of payments (other than in repayment) to be made under the note by the issuer; and (d) the holder can elect to settle the convertible note’s face value for new shares in the issuer, rather than the cash redemption amount; and (e) the issuer cannot elect whether the convertible note can be cash settled or redeemed for shares; and (f) the share warrant cannot be separated from the convertible note. specified rate, for an optional convertible note and a date, means the specified rate given for the optional convertible note and the date by Determination G23: Specified Rate share warrant, for an optional convertible note, means the right of the subscriber or holder to elect to settle the optional convertible note by receiving new shares in the issuer subscriber, for an optional convertible note, means the person that subscribes for the optional convertible note issued by the issuer term, for an optional convertible note and a person, means the period between the date on which the optional convertible note is issued and the maturity date voting interests means voting interests as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition in section OB 1 of the Act 3. In this determination, a term not referred to in subclauses (1) and (2) has the meaning given to the term for the purpose of— (a) the financial arrangements rules, if the term is defined in the Act for that purpose; (b) the Act, if paragraph (a) does not apply. 4. In this determination, a reference to another determination made by the Commissioner includes a reference to a determination that, with or without modification, replaces or corresponds to that determination. 6. Method 1. This determination treats an optional convertible note as having both a debt component and an equity component. The equity component, being the share warrant, is an excepted financial arrangement. 2. This determination gives the method for determining the amount of consideration paid or received under the optional convertible note that is solely attributable to the equity component for the purposes of determining: (a) the income or expenditure for an income year that is attributable to the debt component; (b) the base price adjustment for the debt component. Consideration provided by person that is attributable to equity component 3. The amount of the consideration provided by a subscriber or received by an issuer that is solely attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible note is nil if: (a) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or (b) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are beneficially owned or ultimately controlled by the same person; or (c) under the arrangement, however structured at the date of issue, there would be no change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests in the issuer if the share warrant were exercised at that time. 4. Subclause (3) does not apply if the subscriber: (a) acquired the optional convertible note with the intention of selling it within 93 days to any person whose exercise of the share warrant would result in a change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests of the issuer; and (b) does so sell the optional convertible note. 5. If subclause (3) does not apply, the amount of the consideration provided or received by a person that is attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible note is the greater of— (a) nil; or (b) the amount given by the following formula: y – s 6. In subclause (5) (b), y, being the consideration for the optional convertible note, is: (a) for the issuer, the amount of consideration that has been paid, and consideration that is or will be payable, to the issuer for or under the optional convertible note, ignoring non-contingent fees; (b) for the subscriber, the amount of consideration that has been paid, and consideration that is or will be payable, by the subscriber for or under the optional convertible note, ignoring non-contingent fees. 7. In subclause (5) (b), s, being the present value of cashflows, is the present value of the amount given by the following formula: total coupon interest + contingent fees + cash redemption amount 8. In subclause (7), total coupon interest is the total amount of all coupon interest payable or receivable during the term of the optional convertible note. 9. In subclause (7), contingent fees and cash redemption amount are as defined in subclause 5 (2) of the interpretation section of this determination. 10. In subclause (7), the present value of an amount is determined by applying: (a) Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods; or (b) an alternative method that produces a result that is not materially different from the method referred to in paragraph (a). 11. If the amount of a coupon interest payment under an optional convertible note has a fixed relationship to a market or indicator interest rate, a person who is required by this determination to estimate the amounts of future coupon interest payments under the optional convertible note may assume that the coupon interest rate applicable to the first coupon interest payment in the term applies to the remaining coupon interest payments in the term. Spreading the debt component 12. For the purposes of the financial arrangements rules, the amount of income or expenditure under an optional convertible note that a person must attribute to an income year in the term of the optional convertible note is found by using a spreading method prescribed under sub-part EW of the Act to spread the consideration referable to the debt component of the optional convertible note. In this context, the consideration referable to the debt component is the amount given by the following formula: For the issuer: (consideration received – value of warrant) – consideration paid with a negative amount being a deduction under the financial arrangements rules. For the holder: consideration received – (consideration paid – value of warrant) with a positive amount being income under the financial arrangements rules. 13. In subclause (12): (a) consideration received is the amount of consideration that is or will be received, and the amount of consideration that has been received, by the person for and under the optional convertible note, including coupon interest receipts and contingent fees, but ignoring non-contingent fees and treating any consideration received in repayment of the optional convertible note as being equal to the cash redemption amount. (b) consideration paid is the amount of consideration that is or will be payable, and the amount of consideration that has been paid, by the person for and under the optional convertible note, including coupon interest payments and contingent fees, but ignoring non-contingent fees and treating any consideration paid in repayment of the optional convertible note as being equal to the cash redemption amount. (c) value of warrant is the amount of consideration referable to the equity component as determined under subclause (3) or (5) above Secondary market 14. Where a holder sells or transfers an optional convertible note to another holder, the amount of the consideration provided or received that is solely attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible note is nil if: (a) at the time of the sale or transfer the parties are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or (b) at the time of the sale or transfer the parties are beneficially owned or ultimately controlled by the same person; or (c) under the arrangement, however structured, there would be no change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests in the issuer if the share warrant were exercised both prior to and after the sale or transfer. 15. If subclause (14) does not apply, subclauses (5) to (12) will apply to determine the amount of consideration received by a holder and paid by the new holder that is referable to the debt component of the optional convertible note when the optional convertible note is sold or transferred. Base price adjustment on maturity or exercise 16. For the purposes of the base price adjustment formula specified in section EW 31 of the Act, in determining the consideration that is paid by the issuer or paid to the holder: (a) where the holder can exercise the share warrant only on the maturity date, any consideration paid in repayment of the optional convertible note is treated as being equal to the cash redemption amount; or (b) where the holder can exercise the share warrant at any time or at agreed times prior to the maturity date, and the share warrant is exercised prior to the maturity date, any consideration paid in repayment of the optional convertible note is treated as being equal to the present value of the optional convertible note’s debt component on the date the share warrant is exercised. 17. In subclause (16) (b), the present value of the optional convertible note’s debt component is determined by applying the formula specified in subclause (7). 7. Examples Example A: From the perspective of the issuer On 1 April 2007, a publicly listed New Zealand company, ABC Ltd, raised $120 million from the market through the issue of 100 million $1 optional convertible notes with a five-year term. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value (FV) of $100 million and paid a coupon rate of 5% per annum semi-annual. At the time the optional convertible notes were issued, ABC Ltd had one billion shares on issue, which were trading at $1.00 each. The terms of the optional convertible notes provided that the holders could at any time over the term of the optional convertible notes elect to redeem each optional convertible note for cash or for one share per note held. The exercise price on the American-style warrant component of each optional convertible note was $1.00 per share. The total consideration paid by the holders of the optional convertible notes was $120 million. ABC Ltd paid $1 million to a broker for the successful issue of the optional convertible notes. The five-year New Zealand government bond rate at the time of issue was 5.81%. ABC Ltd has a 31 March balance date. This determination requires that a bifurcation process be applied in order to calculate an amount that is solely attributable to the warrant component of the optional convertible notes. The warrant is an excepted financial arrangement and is excluded from calculation of financial arrangement income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. To calculate the total amount of consideration attributed to the equity component of the optional convertible notes, subclause 6 (5) of this determination must be applied. The consideration paid for the optional convertible notes is $120 million. Therefore y = $120 million. The present value (PV) of the bond component applying subclause 6 (7) is $96,528,457.95. This amount may be calculated in accordance with Determination G10B or through the use of the standard market bond pricing formula. The discount rate applicable to this calculation is the specified rate in accordance with Determination G23. Therefore s = $96,528,457.95. The aggregate amount attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible notes is therefore: $120,000,000.00 – $96,528,457.95 = $23,471,542.05. This amount may be ignored for the purposes of calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. In order to calculate financial arrangement income or expenditure, the yield to maturity (YTM) method has been applied. This may be done in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method or any other determination that may apply, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. The yield to maturity for the financial arrangement is 6.04973318% or 3.024867% per semi-annual period. Notwithstanding the methods available which have been described above, the YTM rate is most easily calculated by calculating the net present value (NPV) of the cash flows arising under the bond component of the optional convertible notes by iterating the discount rate used until a result of zero is achieved. Using Determination G3, the following table can be constructed (taking into account the deduction of $1 million of fees paid by ABC Ltd): Critical dates Amount of principal outstanding at start of period YTM calc F.A. expenditure at end of period Actual coupon interest at end of period Amount of principal outstanding at end of period 1 Apr 07 95,528,457.95 2,889,608.41 2,500,000.00 95,918,066.36 1 Oct 07 95,918,066.36 2,901,393.54 2,500,000.00 96,319,459.90 1 Apr 08 96,319,459.90 2,913,535.16 2,500.000.00 96,732,995.06 1 Oct 08 96,732,995.08 2,926,044.05 2,500,000.00 97,159,039.11 1 Apr 09 97,159,039.11 2,938,931.31 2,500,000.00 97,597,970.42 1 Oct 09 97,597,970.42 2,952,208.40 2,500,000.00 98,050,178.82 1Apr 10 98,050,178.82 2,965,887.10 2,500,000.00 98,516,065.92 1 Oct 10 98,516,065.92 2,979,979.56 2,500,000.00 98,996,045.48 1 Apr 11 98,996,045.48 2,994,498.30 2,500,000.00 99,490,543.78 1 Oct 11 99,490,543.78 3,009,456.22 2,500,000.00 100,000,000.00 1 Apr 12 0 Totals 29,471,542.05 25,000,000.00 The difference between financial arrangement expenditure and coupon interest paid by ABC Ltd is $4,471,542.05 and is equal to the difference between the FV of the bond component and its price calculated using the specified rate of 5.81% per annum semi-annual plus the $1 million in fees paid by ABC Ltd. Financial arrangement expenditure is spread between income years, in accordance with Determination G1A, on a daily basis. So, for example, in the 2008 income year, ABC Ltd would return financial arrangement expenditure of $5,791,001.95 in relation to this financial arrangement. The sum of $5,839,579.21 would be returned in the 2009 income year. A base price adjustment (BPA) is required in the final year of the optional convertible notes’ term. The formula for a BPA is: Consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted. Consideration in relation to the financial arrangement is: 96,528,457.95 + (25,000,000) + (1,000,000) + (100,000,000) = (29,471,542.05) Income is zero. Expenditure is $23,467,587.53 and is the amount of financial arrangement expenditure calculated and deducted up to and including 31 March 2011. There is no remission. The BPA amount is therefore: (29,471,542.05) – 0.00 + 23,467,587.53 + 0.00 = (6,003,954.52). As this is a negative amount, it is financial arrangement expenditure for ABC Ltd. As no amount is remitted, the amount of the BPA is exactly equal to the amount of financial arrangement expenditure calculated in the final year of the financial arrangement under the YTM method. A similar calculation must be undertaken to calculate the holder’s position if the holder is subject to the financial arrangements rules. Example B: From the perspective of the issuer On 1 April 2007, XYZ Ltd, a non-listed company and a wholly owned subsidiary of another company (“Parent”) raised $100 million through the issue of 100 million $1 optional convertible notes with a five-year term to Parent. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value (FV) of $100 million and paid no coupons. At the time of the optional convertible notes issue, XYZ Ltd had 100 shares which were issued for $1.00 each. The terms of the optional convertible notes provided that the holder could at any time over the term of the optional convertible notes elect to redeem the optional convertible notes for cash or for one share per note held. The exercise price on the American-style warrant component of the optional convertible notes is $1.00 per share. The total consideration paid by Parent for the optional convertible notes was $100 million. XYZ Ltd paid no fees to issue of the optional convertible notes. The five-year New Zealand government bond rate at the time of issue was 5.81%. XYZ Ltd has a 31 March balance date. This determination requires that a bifurcation process be applied in order to calculate an amount that is solely attributable to the warrant component of the optional convertible notes. The warrant is an excepted financial arrangement and is excluded from calculation of financial arrangement income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. To calculate the amount of consideration attributed to the equity component of the optional convertible notes, subclause 6 (5) of this determination must be applied, unless subclause 6 (3) applies. As the companies are members of the same wholly owned group of companies, the amount of consideration attributable to the warrant component of the optional convertible notes is nil. Accordingly, all of the consideration received from the issuance by XYZ Ltd of the optional convertible notes must be attributed to the bond component. Therefore, no financial arrangement income or expenditure arises in relation to this financial arrangement. A similar calculation must be undertaken to calculate the holder’s position if the holder is subject to the financial arrangements rules. Example C On 1 April 2007, a publicly listed New Zealand company, XYZ Ltd, raised $100 million through the issue of 100 million $1.00 optional convertible notes with a five-year term. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value of $100 million, paid a coupon of 3% per annum, semi-annual, and were issued at par to the optional convertible notes’ face value. For commercial reasons, the subscriber for the optional convertible notes was a member of the same wholly owned group of companies that acquired the notes with the intention of selling the optional convertible notes to institutional third party investors for $100 million. Settlement with the institutional third party investors was to occur on 1 July 2007. At the time the optional convertible notes were issued, XYZ Ltd had one billion shares on issue, which were trading at $1.00 each. The terms of the optional convertible notes provided that the holders could at any time over the term of the optional convertible notes elect to redeem the optional convertible notes for cash or for one share per note held. The exercise price on the American-style warrant component of the optional convertible notes is $1.00 per share. The total consideration paid by the subscriber (a member of the same wholly owned group of companies as XYZ Ltd) of the optional convertible notes was $100 million. No fees were payable by XYZ Ltd in relation to issue of the optional convertible notes. The five-year New Zealand government bond rate at the time of issue (1 April 2007), and when the optional convertible notes were on-sold (1 July 2007), was 5.81%. XYZ Ltd has a 31 March balance date. Given the subscriber’s intention to sell the optional convertible notes within 93 days of their issuance date, the provisions contained in subclause 6 (3) of this determination do not apply if the notes are sold to relevant third parties within the requisite period. In such circumstances, the bifurcation process described in subclause 6 (5) of this determination must be applied by XYZ Ltd when the optional convertible notes are initially issued to the member of the same wholly owned group of companies on 1 April 2007. The bifurcation process must also be applied by the relevant parties (to the extent that the financial arrangements rules apply) on 1 July 2007 when the subscriber sells the optional convertible notes to the third party investors. XYZ Ltd’s financial arrangements rules treatment of the optional convertible notes is the same as if it had issued the notes directly to third party investors. However, should the subscriber fail to sell the notes to those investors within the requisite time frame, subclause 6 (3) will apply to XYZ Ltd. In regard to the first part of this arrangement, the aggregate consideration for the optional convertible notes when they were initially issued was $100 million. Therefore y = $100 million. The PV of the bond component on the original date of issue applying subclause 6 (7) is $87,956,749.20. Therefore s = $87,956,749.20. The aggregate amount attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible notes is therefore: $100,000,000.00 – $87,956,749.20 = $12,043,250.80. This amount may be ignored for the purposes of calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. The YTM method or alternative method, as prescribed under the Act, must be applied in order to calculate financial arrangement income or expenditure on the bond component of the optional convertible notes by XYZ Ltd. For the tax period ending 31 March 2008, XYZ Ltd’s calculation of financial arrangement expenditure will be $5,140,939.04. If the optional convertible notes are not exercised and run for their full maturity under the contracted terms of the arrangement, XYZ Ltd will be entitled to claim total financial arrangement expenditure of $27,043,250.81, apportioned each year under the YTM method and BPA requirements. If the financial arrangements rules apply to the subscriber, that person will derive income from the bond component of the optional convertible notes calculated in accordance with subclause 6 (5) of this determination and the requirement to perform a BPA. Assuming the subscriber is subject to the financial arrangements rules, it paid $100 million to XYZ Ltd on 1 April 2007 and received $100 million from third party investors when the optional convertible notes were sold on 1 July 2007. The PV of the bond on 1 July 2007 was $89,218,194.23, applying the bifurcation process, a difference of $1,261,445.03 from the PV of $87,956,749.20 calculated applying the bifurcation process on 1 April 2007. The subscriber is required to perform a BPA and account for this amount of financial arrangement income. The formula for a BPA is: Consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted. Consideration in relation to the financial arrangement is: (87,956,749.20) + 89,218,194.23 = 1,261,445.03 Income is zero as the BPA occurs in the first year of the financial arrangement and, consequently, no other income has been recognised for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules. Expenditure is zero. There is no remission. The BPA amount, is therefore: 1,261,445.03 – 0.00 + 0.00 +0.00 = 1,261,445.03. As this is a positive amount, it is financial arrangement income for the subscriber. For the avoidance of doubt, if the subscriber does not sell the optional convertible notes to the institutional investors (or any other relevant third party) within 93 days from the date of issue, subclause 6 (3) will apply. Example D: From the perspective of the issuer In Example A of this determination, on 1 April 2007 ABC Ltd raised $120 million from the market through the issue of 100 million $1 optional convertible notes with a term of five years. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value (FV) of $100 million and paid a coupon rate of 5% per annum semi-annual and could be exercised for 100 million shares at any time on or before 1 April 2012. For the purposes of this example, the optional convertible notes described in Example A were widely held. On 1 April 2009, for commercial reasons, all of the investors holding the optional convertible notes elected to exercise the warrant component of the optional convertible notes and redeem the optional convertible notes for 100 million shares priced at $1.00 each. It should be noted that the investors made their election to convert immediately following receipt of the coupon payment (totalling $2.5 million) from ABC Ltd on 1 April 2009. In accordance with section EW 29 of the Act, ABC Ltd is required to perform a base price adjustment. The specified rate on 1 April 2009 for the three-year government bond was 5.81% per annum semi-annual (there had been no change to the specified rate which applied when the optional convertible notes were originally issued on 1 April 2007.) The PV of the aggregate bond component of the optional convertible notes on 1 April 2009 calculated in accordance with Determination G10B or through the use of the standard market bond pricing formula is $97,799,112.60 and would be the amount that ABC Ltd would be required to repay all of the holders of the optional convertible notes if the debt were extinguished at that point. The formula for a BPA is: Consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted In accordance with subclause 6 (16), the amount of consideration referable to the financial arrangement (debt component of the optional convertible notes) is: (120,000,000 – 23,471,542.05) – (10,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 97,799,112.60) = (12,270,654.65) Income is zero. Expenditure is $11,630,581.16 and is the amount of financial arrangement expenditure calculated and deducted up to and including 31 March 2009. An extract from the table constructed in Example A has been replicated below to assist with the explanation of how the financial arrangements expenditure amount has been calculated for the purpose of this BPA example.

Determination G30 Debt Securities, Finance Leases and Hire Purchase Agreements Denominated in New Zealand Dollars This determination may be cited as “Determination G30: Debt Securities, Finance Leases and Hire Purchase Agreements Denominated in New Zealand Dollars”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This determination may be applied to all debt securities held or issued by a person who is in the business of lending money where the person has adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for financial reporting purposes. The determination also applies to financial arrangements that are finance leases or hire purchase agreements in respect of the person that receives the rental or hire payments under the lease or agreement where that person has adopted IFRS for financial reporting purposes. However, the determination does not apply to debt securities that are held or issued for dealing or liquidity purposes. Where a financial arrangement comes within the scope of this determination, the determination is an alternative to Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method and Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method or an alternative to Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements. Before the adoption of IFRS, a person in the business of lending money generally applied the following tax treatment in relation to debt securities. Gross income included interest income (being interest actually received and accrued for the reporting period) on the principal amount of the loan plus relevant fee income, adjusted for doubtful debt provisions. Fee income was brought to account over a period not exceeding the period of the loan. The recognition of interest and relevant fee expenditure by the person used the same method. That method was acceptable for reporting income and expenditure for tax purposes under the financial arrangements rules. Specifically it was an alternative method to the yield to maturity method that satisfied the requirements of section EW 16(2) of the Income Act 2004 (“the Act”). The method was acceptable for the same reasons under the old financial arrangements rules. Following the adoption of IFRS, the method no longer complies with the requirements of section EW 16(2) of the Act because the tax method would not be used by the taxpayer for financial reporting purposes. It also does not comply with section EW 20(2) of the Act, in relation to debt securities where yield to maturity cannot apply, for the same reason. This determination will allow persons in the business of lending money to continue to apply the same tax treatment as above for interest income and expenditure following their adoption of IFRS. This determination also sets a method in respect of contingent fees and, in the case of the old financial arrangements rules, certain non-contingent fees. The recognition of all (contingent and non-contingent) fee income and expenditure by persons in the business of lending money under IFRS for financial reporting will result in compliance with the requirements of this determination. The application of this determination results in any impaired asset adjustments and adjustments to reflect fair value movement or changes in interest rates, made under IFRS, being disregarded for tax purposes. Bad debt deductions may continue to be made in accordance with section DB 23 of the Act. Where a taxpayer changes its spreading method, it is required to make a spreading method adjustment which may give rise to income or expenditure in the year of adjustment. Where a person that has previously applied the method described above and then applies this determination, the net effect of the spreading method adjustment should be a one-off recognition, in the year of adjustment, of any difference in treatment of fees between the previous method and this determination method. This determination may also be applied to all existing and new finance leases and hire purchase agreements by a person that receives the rent or hire payments under the lease or hire purchase agreement and where the person has adopted IFRS for financial reporting purposes. 2. Reference This determination is made: (a) For the purposes of the financial arrangements rules, pursuant to section 90 AC (1) (e), section 90AC (1)(f) and section 90AC (1) (g) of the Tax Administration Act 1994; and (b) for the purposes of the old financial arrangements rules, pursuant to section 90 (1)(d) and section 90 (1)(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope (1) This determination applies to: (a) A person’s interest income, interest expenditure, fee income and fee expenditure for debt securities held or issued by the person where the person is in the business of lending money and has adopted IFRS for financial reporting purposes; and (b) a person’s income or expenditure from financial arrangements that are finance leases or hire purchase agreements where: (i) the lease or agreement is for a fixed term with fixed rent or hire payments made on a regular basis at least annually; (ii) the lease or agreement is denominated in New Zealand dollars; and (iii) the person is the party that receives the rent or hire payments made under those financial arrangements and the person has adopted IFRS for financial reporting purposes. (2) This determination does not apply to: (a) debt securities which have been identified at the time the financial arrangements were acquired and allocated to a specific portfolio for the purpose of liquidity management, including real time gross settlement; or (b) debt securities held for the purpose of dealing. (3) A person may use this determination for all debt securities that satisfy sub-clause (1) (a) (and do not fall within sub-clause (2)) above irrespective of when the person in the business of lending money became a party to that debt security. A person may also use this determination for all financial arrangements that satisfy sub-clause (1) (b) irrespective of when that person became a party to that financial arrangement. 4. Principle (1) The income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred from a debt security to which this determination applies: (a) interest income or interest expenditure will be equal to the interest amount calculated on the principal amount outstanding on the debt security during the income year; and (b) fee income and fee expenditure will be recognised for tax purposes in the same manner as they are recognised under IFRS. (2) The income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in respect of a finance lease or hire purchase agreement to which this determination applies will be calculated in the same way as for a debt security, under sub-clause 4 (1), using the interest rate that is inherent in the terms of the finance lease or hire purchase agreement. (3) For the avoidance of doubt, no impaired asset, fair value movement or interest rate adjustment that may be required by IFRS is permitted under this determination. 5. Interpretation (1) A reference to “the Act” is a reference to the Income Tax Act 2004. (2) “debt securities” means a class of financial arrangements involving an instrument creating or acknowledging a debt that: (a) is issued or acquired for its face value (or an amount not materially different from its face value); (b) incorporates interest rest periods of no less than one period per income year; (c) has an appropriate market rate of interest that is either fixed or floating and applies to the principal outstanding at each rest; (d) in respect of which fees may be imposed when the instrument is issued, whether those fees are required to be spread across the instrument’s term or not; and (e) has all amounts payable under the instrument denominated in New Zealand dollars. “core acquisition price” means the core acquisition price as defined in section EZ 45 of the Act. “fee expenditure” means: (a) in relation to a financial arrangement subject to the financial arrangements rules any contingent fee charged to a party to the financial arrangement that relates to the financial arrangement; or (b) in relation to a financial arrangement subject to the old financial arrangements rules any contingent fee charged to a party to the financial arrangement that relates to the financial arrangement plus the smaller of – (i) the amount of consideration provided in relation to the financial arrangement by the party to the financial arrangement that is not contingent on the implementation of the financial arrangement; or (ii) 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement. “fee income” means: (a) in relation to a financial arrangement subject to the financial arrangements rules any contingent fee charged by a party to a financial arrangement that relates to the financial arrangement; or (b) in relation to a financial arrangement subject to the old financial arrangements rules any contingent fee charged by a party to the financial arrangement that relates to the financial arrangement plus the smaller of – (i) the amount of consideration provided in relation to the financial arrangement to the party to the financial arrangement that is not contingent on the implementation of the financial arrangement; or (ii) 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement. “financial arrangements rules” means the financial arrangements rules as defined in section EW 1(2) of the Act. “IFRS” means the New Zealand equivalent of the International Financial Reporting Standards, operating within the framework of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. “interest”, for the purposes of this determination, means any periodic payment or periodic receipt, accrual or capitalisation in relation to a debt security to the extent that it is intended to provide a return to the lender on the sums provided to the borrower, not including fees or payments effecting a reduction in principal. “interest expenditure” means any amount of interest that is incurred by a borrower under a debt security. “interest income” means any amount of interest that is derived by a lender under a debt security. “old financial arrangements rules” means the old financial arrangements rules as defined in section OB 1 of the Act. (3) All other terms used have the same meaning given to them in the Act for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules or the old financial arrangements rules, as appropriate. 6. Method (1) Interest income or interest expenditure for a debt security will be equal to the interest amount calculated under the terms of the debt security on the principal amount outstanding on the debt security during the income year. Non-fee income or non-fee expenditure for a financial arrangement that is a finance lease or a hire purchase agreement will be calculated in the same way as interest income or expenditure for a debt security by using the interest rate that is inherent in the terms of finance lease or hire purchase agreement. (2) Fee income and fee expenditure for a debt security or a financial arrangement that is a finance lease or hire purchase agreement is to be determined in the same manner as recognised for the purposes of IFRS. 7. Transitional adjustment (1) Where a taxpayer changes its spreading method, section EW 26 of the Act requires a spreading method adjustment to be calculated under section EW 27 of the Act. This may give rise to an amount of income or expenditure in the year of adjustment. (2) Where a debt security gives rise to interest income or expenditure only, the results obtained under the previous method generally adopted by persons in the business of lending money would be expected to be the same as the result under this determination. As a result, the spreading method adjustment should give rise to an amount of income or expenditure (where the previous method had been applied) only where, and to the extent, the treatment of fees under the previous method was different to the treatment under IFRS. 8. Example (1) A bank with a 30 June balance date has made a loan to a customer in accordance with standard banking practice. The loan was for $100,000.00 and was issued on 1 July 2005 for a term of 15 years and is secured by way of a mortgage over a residential property. (2) The interest rate applicable to the loan is based on a floating rate of interest which was initially set at 9.25%. Principal and interest repayments by the customer have been calculated in accordance with the pricing formula of a table mortgage type of financial arrangement with monthly rests. Equal payments of $1,029.19 per month over 180 (15 years x 12 months) months are required in order to fully repay this loan. The monthly instalments are paid on the last day of each month. (3) An establishment fee of $500.00, amounting to 0.5% of the amount lent, has been charged to the customer. The fee has been netted off against the amount of principal lent to the customer, resulting in a net amount of $99,500.00 paid by the bank to the customer on 1 July 2005. (4) No fee was paid by the bank to a mortgage broker in order to originate the loan. (5) The calculation method required under this determination must be made in accordance with clause 6. A separate calculation is required for interest and for fees. Interest income or expenditure must be calculated in accordance with sub-clause 6 (1). (6) Interest income for the income year is the aggregate of the monthly interest component of the total monthly repayment of $1,029.19. All fees are excluded from this part of the accrual calculation. Interest calculated under the table mortgage calculation formula and the YTM method are therefore identical. In accordance with the standard table mortgage formula, the interest income component for the first month is $770.83. In the second month it would be $768.84. In the third month it would be $766.83 and so on and so forth aggregating to $9,115.12 for the 2006 income year. (7) Fee income or expenditure must be calculated in accordance with sub-clause 6 (2) and allocated to income years in accordance with its treatment under IFRS. (8) The bank’s accrual income for the 2006 income year is therefore: $9,115.12 + fee income as per IFRS. (9) On the basis that the loan is not written off as bad, the bank’s accrual income for the 2007 income year is: $8,802.85 + fee income as per IFRS. (10) Similarly, the bank’s accrual income for the 2008 income year is: $8,460.44 + fee income as per IFRS. (11) If the loan were to run for the full 15-year term of the financial arrangement and the interest rate is not changed, total accrual income of $85,755.09 would be returned under the calculation methodology of this determination. Further examples are provided in the Schedule. Signed on the 28th day of March 2006. JIM GORDON Policy Manager Inland Revenue Department SCHEDULE: Further examples Example A: This example has an identical fact pattern to the example given in clause 8, except that the loan was made on 15 July 2005 and the repayments are made on the 15th of each month. In calculating the interest income for the year ending 30 June 2006, the interest component of the payment due on 15 July 2006 must be apportioned, on a daily basis, between the year ending 30 June 2006 and the subsequent year. This same apportionment must be carried out at the end each year during the term of the loan, with adjustment for last year’s apportionment. Example B: This example has an identical fact pattern to the example given in clause 8, except that the bank paid a mortgage broker a fee of $1,000.00 to originate the loan. This determination requires accrual income and expenditure to be calculated in accordance with clause 6. The amount of gross income in relation to interest income is $9,115.12 (the same amount as the example given in clause 8) for the 2006 income year. In relation to making the loan, the bank charged the customer $500.00 in fees and incurred a fee of $1,000.00 from the mortgage broker. The income and expenditure from these fees is to be allocated to income years in accordance with the treatment of the fees under IFRS. Accrual income for the 2006 income year is therefore $9,115.12 less net fee expenditure as per IFRS. Example C: This example concerns a cash basis person, on 1 July 2005, placing $500,000.00 on deposit with a bank at a fixed interest rate of 7.25% p.a. paid quarterly, for a term of three years. There were no fees in relation to this transaction. The deposit is repaid in one bullet payment of $500,000.00 on 1 July 2008, together with the final quarterly interest amount of $9,062.50. As there are no fees in relation to the deposit, the fixed interest rate of 7.25% p.a. paid quarterly (1.8125% per calendar quarter) by the bank is the same as the YTM rate of 7.25%. Interest paid by the bank to the customer for the 2006 income year is $38,250.00 ($9,062.50 x 4 quarters) and is gross expenditure. Accrual expenditure for the 2006 income year is therefore $38,250.00.

Media Statement

### Costello bilateral to progress single economic market

Progress towards streamlining the trans-Tasman business environment will be top of the agenda when Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Australian Treasurer Peter Costello hold annual talks in Wellington on Monday 29 January.

"I look forward to these meetings as they are a valuable opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest and importantly to accelerate progress on the Single Economic Market agenda," Dr Cullen said today.

"Australia remains our largest trading partner, a valuable market of well over 20 million people right on our doorstep and the first offshore market for many Kiwi companies.

"Therefore, it is vital we continue the momentum in recent years towards a single economic market. Our aim is to make it as easy for a company to expand its business in Sydney as it is in Auckland.

"At last year's meeting in Melbourne we agreed to legislative changes so our respective banking supervisors could better support each other to improve financial system stability, allowed for the mutual recognition of securities offerings and improved information sharing between competition authorities.

"At Monday's meeting Peter and I will discuss:

*   Trans-Tasman tax issues, including implications of the International Tax Review;
*   Business law coordination;
*   Banking supervision;
*   Climate change;
*   Trade and other regional economic issues, including Australia's hosting of APEC later this year.

Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne will attend some of the discussions.

Dr Cullen and Mr Costello will hold a media conference at the conclusion of the talks at 3.30pm in the Beehive Theatrette and will later attend a Trans-Tasman Business Circle function.

### Background

**What is the Single Economic Market?**

At their January 2004 meeting Dr Cullen and Mr Costello expressed a goal of achieving a single economic market based on common regulatory frameworks. This aimed to ensure the ongoing development of the trans-Tasman economic relationship beyond the CER agreement.

**Why does the Single Economic Market matter?**

*   It provides both countries with a combined market of 25 million people.
*   New Zealand provides Australian companies with another domestic market the size of Queensland.
*   For New Zealand business, CER increases the domestic market six fold.
*   New Zealand exported over $7 billion of goods to Australia in the year to November 2006, up 6% on the previous year.
*   Australia exported over $8 billion of goods to New Zealand in the year to November 2006, up 6% on the previous year.
*   Australia is New Zealand's number one export market and number one source of imports.
*   New Zealand is Australia's fifth largest export market and eighth largest source of imports and the largest market for elaborately transformed manufactures.
*   AusTrade recently reported that 17,343 exporters sent products to New Zealand in 2005-06, more than double any other destination.
*   Australia is the largest foreign investor in New Zealand, supplying around 50% of our foreign investment.
*   New Zealand is Australia's sixth largest source of foreign investment, and in 2006 became the largest destination for New Zealand foreign investment.
*   There is freedom of movement of people across the Tasman.
*   New Zealand is Australia's number one source of short-term visitors with over one million visiting every year, mostly tourists.
*   Australians are the most frequent visitors here with 900,000 visiting in the year to November 2006. They spend around $1.4 billion a year here.

Media Statement

### Bilateral progresses Single Economic Market agenda

Efforts to further the development of an Australia–New Zealand Single Economic Market have been underscored by the annual bilateral between New Zealand Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen and Australian Treasurer Peter Costello in Wellington today.

"We are determined to maintain the momentum towards streamlining the trans-Tasman business environment. It is vital we do so as the combined Australasian market of 25 million people provides valuable opportunities for all businesses, consumers and investors," said the Ministers.

"Today we are building on our progress by agreeing to:

*   start the process for negotiating a revised double tax treaty between the two countries;
*   investigate the feasibility of trans-Tasman private retirement savings portability;
*   continue work towards a CER Investment Protocol;
*   continue to facilitate the coordination of business laws."

The bilateral also included discussions on regional economic developments. Ministers discussed their shared interests in a range of important international meetings, particularly APEC, which Australia is hosting in 2007, and the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting.

### Progress so far

At their January 2004 meeting, Finance Minister Cullen and Treasurer Costello established their goal of achieving a single economic market based on common regulatory frameworks. This reflects the ongoing development of the trans Tasman economic relationship beyond the CER Agreement.

The focus of work of the Single Economic Market programme has been across a range of areas including banking regulation, business law co-ordination, competition and consumer policy and taxation. The aim has been to reduce barriers to provide a seamless regulatory environment for business, consumers and investors across the Tasman.

Ministers also reflected on progress that is being made on areas outside their specific portfolios on reducing the impact of borders between the two countries, and streamlining regulation on both sides of the Tasman.

Ministers agreed that measures implemented as a result of discussions so far have amounted to a substantial lowering of regulatory barriers to doing business on a trans-Tasman basis. However, Ministers reiterated that it is important to maintain this momentum.

### Banking supervision

Ministers noted that legislation is now operating in both countries that increases coordination between both countries' banking supervisors, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand Amendment Act and Australia's Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Trans-Tasman Banking Supervision) Act both came into force in December 2006.

This legislation further aligns the two financial systems.

"This shows the world the way ahead in the regulation of business with cross-border operations," the Ministers said.

"The two Acts require APRA and RBNZ to support each other and consider the impact of their actions on financial system stability in the other country when performing their regulatory responsibilities. APRA and the RBNZ will also be required to consult each other on these matters."

The new legislation reflects the high degree of commercial interdependence of the Australian and New Zealand banking markets. It enables the regulators to afford the banks more flexibility in how they structure their businesses within the trans-Tasman market, which is expected to bring compliance cost reductions and efficiency benefits.

Ministers are pleased with the progress being made on banking issues by the Trans-Tasman Council on Banking Supervision and announced that further work is continuing on integrating crisis management arrangements for financial institutions operating in either country. As well, Ministers endorsed the work of the council on further investigation of barriers to the seamless provision of banking services.

"These actions further reinforce the stability of our countries financial systems."

### Streamlining taxation

Mr Costello, Dr Cullen and New Zealand Revenue Minister Peter Dunne today discussed updating the 1995 double tax agreement between the two countries. The Ministers noted the importance of facilitating cross-Tasman investment, which substantially benefits the economies of both nations.

"We expect to be in a position to commence negotiations for a new tax treaty shortly."

The decision follows the release late last year of New Zealand's "International Tax Review: a direction for change".

The document indicated that, while a measured approach to change would be important for New Zealand, lower withholding rates could both increase New Zealand's attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment and reduce tax barriers to offshore investment from New Zealand. Treasurer Costello today welcomed the direction for change signalled in the document.

Consultation with business and other interested parties on the possible changes outlined in the discussion document, which also include wider reforms to New Zealand's international tax rules, is currently taking place in New Zealand.

### Retirement savings portability

As part of the bilateral, Dr Cullen provided an update on the introduction of the KiwiSaver work place saving scheme. Ministers discussed the feasibility of allowing people to take private retirement funds with them when they cross the Tasman to work.

Ministers have agreed to set up a trans-Tasman working group to examine issues around portability.

"The officials working party will look at the portability of retirement funds during a person's working life. This would benefit a wide range of people who find themselves working on either side of the Tasman during their working life.

"Benefits could include the ability to transfer savings across the Tasman, thereby supporting trans-Tasman labour mobility as well as providing the ability to streamline small and administratively expensive accounts in both countries," Ministers commented.

### CER Investment Protocol

Australia and New Zealand are negotiating a CER Investment Protocol.

The two Ministers discussed progress to date and agreed that work towards concluding an agreement should continue.

"Australia has tabled an ambitious market access offer and New Zealand will respond in due course."

### Business law coordination

Following signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding on Business Law Coordination at their 2006 meeting, the Ministers noted progress has been made across a range of issues. New Zealand Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel joined them in the discussions.

Progress has included cross-border company recognition, cross-border insolvency provisions, mutual bans on disqualified company directors and information sharing between trans-Tasman competition and consumer regulators.

"We are making things easier for trans-Tasman businesses and the significant gains that can be made through process and system changes. This includes such changes as removing duplication for companies around the registration process through information sharing between the New Zealand Companies Office and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission."

Alongside this change, Australian and New Zealand financial reporting standards setters have agreed an integrated approach in relation to strategic planning, participating in international standards-setting processes and standards preparation and approval.

Ministers have also agreed to examine ways of bringing together the patent application processes of both countries. They also discussed the importance of mutual recognition of court proceedings and enforcement of judgments on both sides of the Tasman.

The Ministers also discussed the importance of the mutual recognition of occupations with increasingly mobile workforces globally. Particular occupations Ministers identified as important to the trans-Tasman business world were financial advisers, auditors and insolvency practitioners, particularly with work on the regulation of these professions in New Zealand currently underway.

"Both countries will undertake further work this year on mutual recognition in these areas.

"We want to achieve a situation where businesses face a single set of regulatory procedures whether they operate in Auckland or Sydney.

"We are confident the measures we are taking will make it much easier for businesses to seize opportunities in the trans-Tasman market and so bring wider benefits to investors and consumers," concluded the Ministers.

### Speech notes  
Hon Peter Dunne  
Minister of Revenue  
2007 Conference of the International Fiscal Association  
Crowne Plaza, Christchurch

I'm very pleased to have been invited once again to open your annual conference.

A lot has happened since I addressed your conference last year.

Since then we have made major progress on the Business Tax Review, the review of our international tax rules and other major reforms on our tax policy work programme.

In what risks becoming a tradition, I'll quote Jo Doolan again this year, though we are not in continuous agreement, despite possible appearances. In a recent column she wrote:

"Overall, 2006 saw us starting a journey that is shaking up our stagnant tax system and waking up to the reality of the need for a competitive tax system if we want to play in global markets. A government working with business toward a platform on which economic transformation can become a reality."

And, yes, from my perspective, it is a journey of fundamental tax reform, one that is driven by the actual needs and experiences of the business sector, not just theory.

But while they are fundamental, they are also pragmatic and moderate reforms.

A good example of that pragmatism can be found in the recent passage of the offshore tax reforms.

Possible options ranged from full accrual taxation on unrealised capital gains, through to exempting offshore shares from any taxation other than on dividends.

What was introduced in the May 2006 bill was an attempted compromise between those two extremes, but it was widely held to be too complex.

Following extensive consultation with the private sector, a more pragmatic way of taxing offshore investment emerged in the form of the fair dividend rate method, a reasonable compromise which is now in legislation.

The government's tax reform programme is based on the confidence and supply agreement that was signed between Labour and United Future.

A key plank in that agreement was a major review of our business tax rules, with a view to ensuring that the system works to give better incentives for productivity gains and improved competitiveness with Australia.

Note that the focus is on being competitive with Australia.

Why Australia and why not China?

We would naturally like to have China's nearly 10 percent annual growth rate but we start from much higher income levels.

What we want is a high-wage economy, with a high-growth rate.

You can see an Australian focus in a number of our reforms that are under way, such as the international tax review, which takes as its starting point the Australian rules on taxing offshore income.

The same goes for our officials' review of the taxation of life insurance, which is looking at developing rules that have certain conceptual similarities to Australia's rules.

So why not just do as Australia does?

I agree that we can improve our way of doing things by doing some of what Australia does, but not everything.

Take Australia's capital gains tax, for example, a measure that I would not like to see introduced here.

So we are talking with New Zealand business to develop rules that are not only appropriate in the New Zealand context, but also meet our goal of being competitive with Australia.

The driving force behind the ideas set out in the Business Tax Review discussion document, released in July last year, is the strong desire to strengthen the ability of New Zealand businesses to grow and compete in an increasingly borderless international economy.

It represents the most comprehensive review of business tax arrangements since 1988, and arises as a direct consequence of the confidence and supply agreement between United Future and Labour, and when you consider the vast changes in the international environment and the advance of technology in that time, it was long overdue.

Our initial proposals were released for public consultation in July last year.

They included a reduction in the company tax rate to 30 cents; and improved assistance for research and development, as per United Future's policy.

And they also included proposals for new tax incentives to boost export market and skills development, matters of particular interest to the Labour Party, and a series of more technical changes to depreciation and asset write-offs, building on the substantial changes introduced in the 2005 Budget.

Altogether, they amounted to a programme which, if implemented in full, would cost just under $2 billion a year.

A corporate tax rate of 30 cents, without the accompanying capital gains tax, stamp duties, or compulsory superannuation levies, would certainly achieve the goal of retaining competitiveness with our major trading partner, Australia, in the first instance.

But that is not the only step we believe we should consider, which is where the targeted incentives for research and development, export markets and skills development come in.

The excesses of the 1970s and early 1980s have understandably given tax incentive schemes of this type a bad name, and one of the real challenges we confront is batting off the cynicism that we are about to repeat that awful nightmare all over again.

But equally one of the lessons of the later 1980s and the 1990s is that the preoccupation with things working in theory ahead of practice has been just as detrimental, so what has characterised our discussions on these issues has been the pragmatism I spoke of earlier.

We are looking for solutions that work, not fit a pre-determined ideological grid.

I expect detailed announcements to be made in the Budget, with legislation to follow shortly thereafter.

Complementary changes are being considered as part of our review of New Zealand's international tax rules.

I will be devoting much of my speech today to the international tax review since it occupies a large part of your conference programme.

The discussion document released late last year examines the principles underlying the current tax rules for offshore income and concludes that there is a good case for revising the current paradigm, which seeks to tax all offshore income as it is earned.

New Zealand is the only country that follows this approach to taxation, with the result that our rules are out of line with those of our major trading partners, in particular Australia.

And the costs of being different have grown.

The discussion document also looks at the case for reducing rates of withholding tax in New Zealand's double tax agreements.

Lower rates would encourage inward investment and benefit New Zealand firms investing offshore.

The discussion document examines a comprehensive reform of the current system - since simply tinkering would obviously not be enough.

The cornerstone of the new paradigm is an exemption from taxation for offshore active income, regardless of where it is earned.

Providing such an exemption would represent a fundamental departure from the principles underlying New Zealand's current tax system and therefore requires a rethinking of all of the provisions related to the taxation of income from foreign direct investments.

While the discussion document establishes a new approach to taxation, it deliberately does not put forward concrete proposals on how to implement it.

Rather, it canvasses the many provisions other countries have employed in implementing an active-passive distinction.

Taken as a whole, these provisions form a daunting list, one that has raised some concerns among commentators about the "worst case" scenario that would arise if all of them were to be implemented at once.

Let me assure you that that is not our intention.

Rather, as Dr Cullen and I said in the discussion document, we hope to draw on international experience in conjunction with our consultation process, to develop a set of proposals that are appropriate in the New Zealand context.

The development of the new rules depends crucially on input that we receive from New Zealand businesses.

Four principles will guide the development of the new system. They are as follows:

*   First, the tax system should not discourage firms from undertaking expansion of business operations offshore to take advantage of market opportunities or gain production efficiencies.
*   Second, the new rules should take into account the legitimate business arrangements and methods of operation that New Zealand businesses use in their offshore operations.
*   Furthermore, the rules should maintain a level of protection for the domestic tax base.
*   And finally, the rules should, as much as possible, reduce compliance burdens.

Obviously, it will be necessary to make trade-offs among these objectives.

The government is prepared to make them, to achieve a balance among the objectives, and we hope that business too will recognise the need for a reasonable balance to help us determine the appropriate mix of policies.

One obvious trade-off is between enabling businesses to expand offshore and protecting the source taxation of New Zealand domestic income.

We recognise the benefits of such expansion, although there obviously has to be a limit to the extent to which we can expose the domestic tax base to erosion.

Many provisions are used internationally in determining this limit.

*   Some measures concentrate on the determination of the income to benefit from the exemption. These are the rules that define active and passive income and other rules such as base company rules.
*   Many countries tax the dividends remitted by offshore subsidiaries, a backstop to the system which turns the active income exemption into a deferral.
*   Finally, costs applied against the New Zealand tax base can be limited - for example, by extending the interest allocation rules.
*   Overlying all of these provisions are the rules for transfer pricing.

And in New Zealand we have the further protection of the imputation system: in many cases there is an advantage to paying tax here rather than overseas.

To a certain extent, these approaches are alternatives; a tighter approach on one can allow a looser approach on others.

We are seeking businesses' views on which approaches are least disruptive to their operations.

The final trade-off is between the precision of the rules and the compliance burden they impose.

This is very important and will play a crucial role in determining which provisions should be implemented.

To develop rules that are consistent with how New Zealand firms operate their businesses, we asked our officials to conduct an extensive program of consultations directly with interested companies.

This program has been invaluable in providing detailed information with which to evaluate potential changes.

I would like to thank those company officers and members of the tax community who have given their time to this process on such short notice, many of whom are probably here today.

I assure you that we are listening and that your input will be influential in determining the rules which will be adopted.

I would like to share with you some of the lessons that have emerged in discussions with businesses, and reflect on some of the implications for the reform that have arisen from the discussions.

First and foremost, we have been impressed by the diversity and dynamism of New Zealand businesses operations overseas.

Businesses often use foreign operations to lever up domestic operations, allowing them to expand markets for domestically produced goods and increase production and organisational efficiency.

The discussions have confirmed the positive role that can be played by the internationalisation of New Zealand business.

The consultations have also confirmed the benefits both of moving to an active-passive distinction and of seeking to reduce our treaty withholding rates, particularly for non-portfolio dividends.

But there are challenges in finding a combination of provisions that fulfil the objectives discussed earlier, to the greatest extent possible.

Let me be clear that we do not believe that an active income exemption can be simply tacked onto the current system with no other changes to target the exemption to its intended policy.

Even so, discussions with companies also indicate that many of the provisions used internationally to target the exemptions are complex, may interfere with legitimate business arrangements and, in some cases, are ineffective in any event.

Let me give you some examples of the insights that have emerged from these discussions.

A number of countries, such as the United States and Australia, have introduced a broad concept of base company income, which is subject to accrual taxation, to protect against shifting domestic income offshore to obtain the exemption.

Consultation has demonstrated that these rules could potentially apply in situations that are part of the normal offshore business operations of New Zealand companies.

We will continue to work with companies to ensure that any base company rules are appropriately targeted and do not interfere with standard business practices.

Ideally, base company rules would not affect the vast majority of business arrangements and would apply as rarely as possible.

Again, this is dependent on reaching a reasonable balance in the overall package.

Many countries, such as the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom, tax repatriated dividends.

Such systems are complex and frequently ineffective.

Discussions with businesses revealed their preference for not taxing dividends.

As indicated in the discussion document, we are also attracted to exempting the dividend if rules to target the exemption in others areas are sufficiently robust.

An issue that has engendered considerable discussion has been the possible abolition of the so-called "grey list" of countries that have tax systems similar to ours.

Australia has retained a grey list in its application of the active-passive boundary.

There is no reason, in principle, to have a grey list once an active income exemption has been provided.

The issue is not gaining revenues from taxing the current level of passive income - most New Zealand companies have limited amounts of passive income, if any - rather, our concern is ensuring that the grey list cannot be used to reduce tax on what is, in substance, domestic income.

Businesses, on the other hand, have raised the legitimate concern that abolition of the grey list could entail an increased compliance burden.

For this reason, we are examining ways of providing a simplified threshold test, based on company books, which would exclude incidental amounts of passive income while offering adequate protection to the domestic income base.

Finally, the discussion document noted the conceptual case for extending interest allocation rules to companies making offshore investments. Australia has done that, but other countries with active income exemptions have not.

We will be considering very carefully the views of business in determining what changes should be made in this area.

Companies have also raised a number of technical issues addressed in the recent banking minimum capital rules.

Discussions have underlined that the issues for the general business environment are different from those for the banks and that a simple transfer of provisions from the bank rules to the general rules would not make sense.

I would like to reiterate my gratitude for the many useful comments received so far.

My officials will continue to work with business to develop a suitable framework for the new system.

In the meantime, the closing date for submissions on the ideas set out in the discussion document is 9 March, next week, a deadline that we extended in response to a number of requests for more time to prepare submissions.

I want to stress that this review is a matter of high priority for the government.

The first evidence of our strengthened international focus appeared in January, when it was announced that Australia and New Zealand have agreed to start the process for negotiating a revised tax treaty between the two countries.

That process includes consideration of withholding taxes.

Dr. Cullen and I intend to make announcements on the main framework of the new system by the middle of the year, and a further round of consultation on the technical implementation issues will follow.

If all goes well, they will be included in a tax bill expected to be introduced early next year.

As Minister of Revenue, one of my major interests lies in ensuring that our tax and tax-related social policy laws work well, so it is easy for people and firms to comply with the law and to meet their responsibilities.

For example, in October last year I released a discussion document proposing liberalisation of a range of tax penalties and associated legislation, to encourage voluntary compliance with the law.

The idea was to have tax penalties that reflect the seriousness of the offence, since people comply with the law more willingly when they see it as reasonable.

We have considered a wide range of submissions on that and other proposals, and if all goes well, they will all be included in the taxation bill planned for introduction in May.

The matter is awaiting Cabinet approval at present.

Most proposals will be unchanged from how they appeared in the discussion document.

One major change, however, concerns the proposal to refrain from imposing penalties when a taxpayer voluntarily discloses a shortfall.

There will be two changes to that proposal: we will remove the requirement that the disclosure be made within two years of someone taking a tax position, and the application date will be earlier, on the date of introduction of the bill.

Submissions were very supportive of the original proposal but recommended these two changes, which I agree will help to encourage voluntary compliance.

On a similar theme, legislation before Parliament makes improvements to the administration of the student loan scheme, particularly in relation to borrowers who are overseas.

Compliance is low amongst those borrowers, and the legislation may be creating disincentives for them to return.

Changes to simplify the administration of the loan scheme include allowing data matching between Inland Revenue and Customs, to ensure borrowers not based in New Zealand do not have access to interest-free loans.

At the same time, however, the bill introduces new, more realistic rules for borrowers going overseas that will make it easier for them to repay their loans, and offering them the chance of a "fresh start" to those who have fallen into arrears.

Further data matching between Inland Revenue and Customs will be a feature of child support legislation to be introduced in May.

The proposed changes will allow Inland Revenue to use cross-border departure and arrival information to help in the recovery of outstanding child support payments.

Child support is an area where it is especially challenging to reach a reasonable balance between the interests of those liable for support and those caring for children.

As Minister responsible for this area, I am committed to ensuring that liable parents meet their obligations but in a reasonable way.

There will be several other major policy events this year.

As you may know, the government is in the process of codifying the tax rules on general partnerships and introducing new rules on limited partnerships.

This is part of the wider aim to introduce modern limited partnership rules that seek to remove regulatory barriers to the flow of venture capital investment into New Zealand. A bill effecting these changes is expected to be introduced by the middle of this year.

The Income Tax Bill, which is currently before Parliament, is expected to pass in August, all going well.

The bill represents the final stage of the 15-year rewrite of the Income Tax Act, and its completion is an impressive achievement.

The purpose of rewriting the Act, as you may know, is to reduce compliance costs by producing tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent.

I must pay a special tribute here to the contribution of Sir Ivor Richardson to this mammoth task, because without his dedication, and commitment, I doubt the process could have been completed.

Also this year, there will be major announcements relating to charities and charitable giving, the result of another key feature of the Labour-United Future confidence and supply agreement.

The government last year released a discussion document canvassing views on possible tax incentives to encourage charitable giving of money, skills and time.

We have analysed the many submissions received on the ideas put forward in the discussion document, and I expect that we will soon be able to announce changes that recognise the invaluable contribution to New Zealand society made by the charitable, community and voluntary sectors.

This year also sees the start-up, in July, of KiwiSaver, which is a key part of the government's strategy to increase personal savings, and therefore the country's economic performance.

KiwiSaver was an important influence on the recently enacted investment tax reforms, which were necessary to remove the significant tax disadvantages for individuals saving through managed funds.

Before I close I would like to pay tribute to David Butler, Commissioner of Inland Revenue, who leaves this month for a position in the OECD.

I was chairman of the Finance and Expenditure Committee in the late 1990s during its inquiry into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue.

The inquiry was conducted in an atmosphere of growing concern about the way the department operated, and that it was sometimes too heavy-handed and inflexible in its dealings with taxpayers.

Since David Butler's appointment in 2001, I have noticed many positive changes in the public's perception of Inland Revenue, which is a major achievement for him as Commissioner.

I'll conclude by saying that last year was an extremely demanding year in tax policy.

It was demanding of government and the private sector alike, and meant a lot of work for you all in participating in tax policy development.

This year is expected to be at least as heavy as a result of tax initiatives resulting from the Business Tax Review and the international tax review, as well as all the other reforms that are under way.

Thank you and best wishes for your conference.

Media Statement

### Dunne: Tax reforms pragmatic and fundamental

Pragmatism and a genuine desire to listen are at the heart of the government's current tax reform programme, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne told the International Fiscal Association conference in Christchurch today.

He told the conference the tax reforms were fundamental and intended to assist the long-term goal of economic transformation.

Mr Dunne announced a bill planned for introduction in May will reduce the number of penalties faced by people who have a tax shortfall if they tell Inland Revenue about it before they learn they are to be audited.

He said the change, once enacted, would apply from the date of introduction of the bill.

The bill was expected to include a number of changes relating to tax penalties and associated legislation, designed to encourage voluntary compliance with the law.

"The idea was to have tax penalties that reflect the seriousness of the offence, since people comply with the law more willingly when they see it as reasonable," Mr Dunne said.

The proposed changes were outlined in a discussion document released last year for public consultation, he said, and most proposals would remain unchanged from how they were set out there.

"One major change, however, concerns the proposal to refrain from imposing penalties when a taxpayer voluntarily discloses a shortfall," he said.

"There will be two changes to that proposal: we will remove the requirement that the disclosure be made within two years of someone taking a tax position, and the application date will be earlier, on the date of introduction of the bill," Mr Dunne said.

Mr Dunne said, "We are talking with New Zealand business to develop rules that are not only appropriate in the New Zealand context, but also meet our goal of being competitive with Australia.

"The driving force behind the ideas set out in the Business Tax Review discussion document, released in July last year, is the strong desire to strengthen the ability of New Zealand businesses to grow and compete in an increasingly borderless international economy.

"It represents the most comprehensive review of business tax arrangements since 1988, and arises as a direct consequence of the confidence and supply agreement between United Future and Labour, and when you consider the vast changes in the international environment and the advance of technology in that time, it was long overdue.

Technical annex Summary of forthcoming legislation on the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for taxation purposes New Zealand businesses are following the worldwide move to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for financial reporting purposes. The adoption of IFRS for financial reporting purposes has been allowed since 1 January 2005 and is mandatory from periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 for entities that have to comply with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP). As tax law relies on accounting practice in a number of areas, the adoption of IFRS for financial reporting purposes will have flow-on consequences for taxation purposes. In 2006, tax policy officials released an issues paper outlining the tax consequences of IFRS and seeking feedback on suggested changes to the relevant tax rules. As the government has announced, a tax bill containing the technical changes to deal with these flow-on consequences will be introduced in May 2007, with enactment expected in late 2007. Once enacted, the tax changes will generally apply from the date a taxpayer adopted IFRS. In the meantime, this technical annex outlines how the forthcoming legislation is expected to work, to provide certainty for early adopters of IFRS, who may be in the process of preparing tax returns for the relevant periods. General principle Current taxation rules are linked to accounting practice in areas such as the treatment of trading stock, research and development expenditure and in areas where the Courts and tax legislation have relied on generally accepted accounting practice. Tax rules’ reliance on accounting practice in these areas is “ambulatory” in principle, meaning that changes in accounting practice arising from the adoption of IFRS are brought into tax automatically. Although some changes in accounting practice will be automatically reflected in tax law, others will require legislative change. The major IFRS-related amendment in the forthcoming tax bill will be to set out the circumstances where the IFRS timing of income from financial arrangements can be adopted for tax purposes. A number of other, more technical changes are also proposed. Timing of IFRS adoption for taxation purposes The legislative changes that will be included in the May 2007 tax bill will clarify that taxpayers who adopt IFRS for financial reporting purposes must also adopt IFRS for tax purposes. Any transitional adjustment arising from the adoption of IFRS for taxation purposes will be recognised contemporaneously. Some taxpayers that adopted IFRS early have indicated that they would like to adopt IFRS for taxation purposes at the same time. The tax bill will generally require early adopters of IFRS for financial reporting purposes to adopt IFRS for taxation purposes contemporaneously. However, because of the potentially significant uncertainty created by legislation not being in place, the bill will allow early adopters of IFRS to use the existing financial arrangement rules (and pre-IFRS accounting practice), with mandatory IFRS adoption being required from the 2007-08 income year. This will be done by way of retrospective legislation. Details of the proposed legislative changes Changes to the financial arrangement spreading rules Income and expenditure of financial arrangements are brought to tax under specific tax timing rules. The current rules require the income and expenditure of financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the financial arrangements based on several spreading methods, including the yield-to-maturity method and a method based on financial reporting practices. With the adoption of IFRS, the accounting methods for financial arrangements have been formalised considerably. Income and expenditure of financial arrangements are calculated before their maturity using either the “fair value method” or the “effective interest method” under IFRS. Although the IFRS methods could, arguably, be applied for taxation purposes under the existing financial arrangement rules as the “financial reporting” methods, there are considerable uncertainties on the acceptability of these methods under the existing legislative provisions. The tax bill will set out the circumstances where IFRS methods will be required for taxation purposes. Taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts will be required to follow the IFRS timing rules for taxation purposes, instead of applying the specific tax timing rules to spread the income and expenditure of financial arrangements. Taxpayers who do not prepare IFRS accounts will continue to apply the current tax timing rules for financial arrangements, except that they will not have the option of using the financial reporting method that is currently available. A summary of the spreading methods available to taxpayers under the proposed legislative changes is presented in Figure 1. For IFRS methods to be acceptable for taxation purposes, taxpayers are expected to satisfy additional conditions. First, income and expenditure reported under IFRS in both the income statement and the statement of changes in equity should be included for taxation purposes, unless an alternative spreading method provided in one of the determinations described below is adopted. Second, credit impairment adjustments made under IFRS will have to be reversed out for taxation purposes. Credit impairments of financial arrangements will continue to be tax deductible only when the debt is actually written off as being bad. In addition to the IFRS methods, the proposed legislation will provide other spreading methods based on the existing determinations. Taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts will have the option of using the determination methods or an alternative that is not materially different from these methods. The existing determinations that will be available are: • Determination G9C – Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • Determination G14B – Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; and • Determination G27 – Swaps (Method C as outlined in sub-clause 6(3)). F IGURE 1 Proposed financial arrangement spreading rules No No No Use cash basis Yes Use straight line Yes No No Use YTM or equivalent Yes No Qualify & want to use MV? Use MV Yes Qualify for & want to use SL? No Use determinations Yes No Qualify & want to use determinations? Use default method IFRS financial statements Qualify for & want to use alternatives Yes Yes Use alternatives in Determinations G9C, G14B or G27 Use IFRS Qualify for & want to use cash basis? No Can use YTM or equivalent? Scope of the changes to the financial arrangement rules The proposed alignment between tax and accounting practice under IFRS applies only to the spreading rules (sections EW 12 to EW 22) and not to the definition of a “financial arrangement”. The financial arrangement rules will continue to apply only to a “financial arrangement” as defined in the tax legislation. As such, the existing determinations that deal with the boundary between a “financial arrangement” and an “excepted financial arrangement” (Determination G5C and Determination G22A) will continue to be applicable to taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts. Furthermore, other aspects of the financial arrangement rules, such as the requirement to perform a base price adjustment calculation at maturity, will continue to apply to taxpayers who prepare IFRS accounts. These taxpayers will still be required to perform a base price adjustment, for example, at the maturity of their financial arrangements. Transitional rules The proposed legislative changes will also “grandparent” the existing financial arrangement spreading rules until the 2007-08 income year. Taxpayers will be allowed to apply these existing rules (and the pre-IFRS accounting treatment of financial arrangements) in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 income years even if they have adopted IFRS for financial reporting purposes for those years. Trading stock and R&D expenditure rules The current tax treatment of trading stock and research and development expenditure is explicitly linked to accounting practice. These tax rules will be updated to reflect changes brought about by IFRS. Specifically, the trading stock tax rules will be amended to ensure that primary sector taxpayers are able to continue using the existing cost and market value methods to value their trading stock for taxation purposes, even though they are required to “fair value” the trading stock under IFRS. Minor legislative amendments to the research and development rules are also required because some standards under the old accounting rules are no longer applicable under IFRS. Compliance guidelines for early adopters Early adopters of IFRS may be intending to apply IFRS for taxation purposes from the 2005-06 income year and will be filing their tax returns while the tax legislation is not yet in place.

1 27 March 2007 Proposed technical amendments to portfolio investment entity rules Use of formation losses A portfolio investment entity’s (PIE’s) formation losses should be spread over three years. A PIE will have available to use on each day of the first three years total formation loss X 1/1095. To the extent that there is insufficient net income on a day to offset the amount of available formation loss for the day, the difference is added to the amount of formation loss for the next day – and so on. Once the 1095 day period has ended there is no daily restriction on the amount of formation losses that can be used each day. Formation losses cannot be rebated or flowed through under any circumstances. A PIE’s formation losses that represent 5% or less of the PIE’s net asset value (on entry into the PIE rules) are not subject to this restriction. There should be no restriction on flowing through or rebating current period losses. PIEs should have the choice to apply formation losses at the entity level or at the investor class level. Formation losses – effect on credits Formation losses should not be used to offset net income to the extent that the PIE has income covered by New Zealand tax credits. This restriction would continue to apply after the 1095 day period referred to above has ended. The relevant credits are imputation, DWP and RWT. To calculate how much income is covered by New Zealand tax credits – and therefore cannot be offset by formation losses – the credits are grossed up to an income amount by dividing the credits by 0.33. Foreign tax credits Foreign tax credits (FTCs) are attributed daily to the investors in each portfolio investor class as they arise. Each investor’s FTC share is equal to their share of the class’s foreign income (i.e. equal to their portfolio investor interest in the class). For non-zero rated investors in the PIE, the PIE offsets the investor’s separate entitlement of accumulated FTCs against the investor’s tax liability at the end of the year (or when the investor exits). An investor’s entitlement to the FTCs that are not used at the end of the year are forfeited. 2 FTCs received by non-PIE zero rated investors are accumulated in the same way as above and allocated at the end of the year or when the investor exits. The investor will take the credits into account in their own tax return. The FTCs can only be used to offset tax payable on portfolio investor allocated income from that PIE. Where a retail PIE invests into a wholesale PIE, any FTCs received by the wholesale PIE are allocated by the wholesale PIE (without reference to that PIE’s income) to the retail PIE each day - and so on down any further tiers of PIEs until allocated to non-PIE investors where the treatments described above apply. Quarterly PIEs should be allowed to carry forward excess FTCs across subsequent quarters in the same income year. Treatment of investor expenses The portfolio entity tax liability and rebate mechanism should be adapted to enable fees charged direct to investor accounts or cash accounts (that sit outside the PIE) to be deducted at the PIE level to reflect the individual investor position. Investor return adjustments Amendments are required to ensure that the adjustment made to an investor's interest to accurately reflect their share of the tax on PIE income or loss also reflects the commercial operations of PIEs. These amendments would ensure that the adjustments can be done on an investment class basis, may be carried out on the same day as tax calculations are made, do not unnecessarily give rise to further taxation as a result of unit cancellations, and should be made within 2 months of the end of the tax year for PIEs who calculate tax daily. Distributions from PIEs An amendment is required to clarify that only portfolio listed companies must attach full imputation credits (where available) to distributions. The current drafting could be interpreted to include other portfolio investment entities which were not intended to be caught by the provision. A clarifying amendment is needed to ensure that distributions from portfolio listed companies to natural person investors are excluded income. An amendment is required to ensure that distributions from portfolio tax rate entities to non-residents are not subject to further tax through deduction of non-resident withholding tax as non-resident investors are already subject to tax at 33% at the PIE level. 3 An amendment is required to ensure that non-resident investors in portfolio listed companies are still subject to non-resident withholding tax on dividends which carry full dividend withholding payment credits. This income should therefore not be treated as excluded income. Eligibility criteria An amendment is required to ensure that entities that derive (as opposed to allocate) certain types of income will be eligible to be PIEs. The types of income should be expanded to include income from other PIEs and distributions from superannuation funds. This would ensure that PIEs investing into other PIEs and superannuation funds will satisfy the income type eligibility requirement. Unlisted companies should be allowed to be treated temporarily as portfolio listed companies if they meet certain criteria. The main criteria are that they are widely held and that they have commenced the process of listing on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and that listing is completed within two years of this treatment commencing. A clarifying amendment is required to ensure that all failures to meet eligibility requirements are considered for an entity to become a PIE. An amendment to the shareholding investment eligibility criteria is needed so they are based on a market value measurement instead of voting interests. This change is intended, in particular, to prevent unit trusts being used to circumvent the percentage threshold and achieve effective control of underlying investments. An amendment is needed to require a portfolio investor proxy to provide information to a PIE each quarter if the portfolio investor proxy considers that the investors in the portfolio investor proxy would cause the PIE to breach the PIE eligibility criteria. PIE and investor tax calculations A monthly allocation period should be allowed for quarterly PIEs. The tax calculation options should be expanded to accommodate investors with multiple portfolios within PIEs to allow tax to be effectively calculated at a portfolio or PIE level when they leave a fund. A PIE calculating tax daily should have the option to deduct and pay tax for part years when an investor only partially leaves the fund. PIEs should have the option of treating investor switches (across portfolios within a PIE or across PIEs) as a taxable event with the result that a PIE would calculate and pay tax for the investor at the time of the switch (if this option were taken). 4 An amendment is required to ensure that double taxation does not occur when a corporate investor inadvertently omits to elect a 0% rate. Also, in this situation, a credit should be provided for tax paid at the PIE level. An amendment is required to provide investors with a refund of excess credits where the credits represent residual investor interest amounts paid to Inland Revenue from a PIE. An amendment is needed to ensure that the rate for certain individuals leaving a PIE must be their most recently provided “prescribed investor rate”. Superannuation funds Under current legislation, income relating to unvested contributions to superannuation funds electing to be PIEs will generally be taxed at investor tax rates where the vesting period for the contributions is three years or less. An amendment is required to lengthen the vesting period to five years to align with certain vesting requirements for KiwiSaver funds. New Zealand Superannuation Fund An amendment is required to allow the New Zealand Superannuation Fund to be treated as a PIE to ensure that the benefit of the Australasian share exemption is available to the fund. Companies Act 1993 An amendment is required to correct a cross-referencing error in the Companies Act 1993 which should refer to the investor return adjustment provision in the PIE rules. A minor clarification is required to remove the reference to payment of differential dividends being “required”. Definitions The definition of a "portfolio tax rate entity" should be amended to exclude "portfolio defined benefit fund", not "defined benefit fund" as currently drafted. To accommodate temporary breaches of the threshold test for a portfolio land company an amendment is required to provide that the threshold must only be met for 300 days in the year. To deal with a situation where a quarterly PIE deducts tax when an investor leaves the fund, the definition of "portfolio investor exit period" should be amended to include a period where the PIE has not withheld the tax from the investor for the period. 5 An amendment to the definition of "prescribed investor rate" is required to resolve a conflict within the definition. This will clarify the different rates which are available to trustees. In addition, this definition should include portfolio investor allocated loss in determining which tax rate an individual investor should use. Investor certificates An amendment is required to ensure certificates for investors leaving quarterly PIEs are issued at the end of the month following the month they leave the fund. Under current legislation, certificates are only required annually in June. Tax returns for portfolio investment entities Annual income tax returns are not required for PIEs that are portfolio tax rate entities under the new rules. However an amendment is required to limit non-filing to portfolio tax rate entities that do not pay provisional tax. PIEs that pay provisional tax will continue to file tax returns. Minimising investor tax returns An amendment is required to ensure that investors receiving small amounts of income (which is not excluded income) from quarterly PIEs will not fall back into the tax return filing net where these amounts, combined with other sources of income which have not been correctly taxed at source, is $200 or less. Other clarifying amendments Some sections, or part thereof, need to be repealed as they are redundant or need to be deleted or replaced to give effect to policy intent. These sections relate to some information requirements, broadening access to the PIE rules for foreign investment vehicles, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue making determinations, investments held by entities acting on behalf of PIEs, exclusion of life insurers from certain PIE eligibility requirements, and the exclusion from non-resident withholding income of dividends from portfolio listed companies. Other cross-referencing An amendment is required to correct the cross referencing error in the provisions relating to credits received by a portfolio tax rate entity or portfolio investor proxy.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Technical tax changes for savings reforms

The government will introduce a number of technical tax changes to ensure the smooth introduction this year of KiwiSaver and associated reforms of the tax rules on investment income, Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne announced today.

"Last year's flagship reforms were aimed at promoting greater fairness in the taxation of income from share investments here and overseas, a fundamental step in developing a savings culture in New Zealand," the Ministers said.

"A key aspect of the reforms was to prevent the over-taxation of lower income people who invest through managed funds, which are the first investment choice for many thousands of ordinary New Zealanders.

"In the lead-up to the introduction of KiwiSaver in July and the application of the associated portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules in October, funds have now identified a number of technical concerns that may affect their ability to convert their systems on schedule.

"Therefore, to aid the changeover, the government will ensure that the necessary technical changes to the law are enacted at the earliest opportunity.

"The proposed technical changes will focus on problems relating to the PIE tax calculation – including the use of formation losses, how to deal with partial exits by investors, how to deal with switches between investment portfolios within a PIE and the treatment of investor expenses.

"These amendments will ensure that KiwiSaver funds that are PIEs can operate with certainty from the start of the new rules.

"The government also plans to introduce legislation to allow investors in unit-linked life insurance products to have access to some of the benefits of the new PIE rules.

"The proposed changes will allow policyholders in unit-linked life products to be excluded from tax on realised New Zealand and Australian listed equity gains, in the same way that investors in PIEs are excluded.

"Life insurers will be able to choose whether or not to elect into these new rules, which, once enacted, are also expected to take effect from 1 October.

"The changes to the tax treatment of unit-linked life products have emerged from the first stage of the government's review of the taxation of life insurers and were originally considered at the request of the industry.

"Further changes to achieve greater alignment between the taxation of life insurance products and similar financial products are being considered as part of stage 2 of the review of life insurance tax rules," they said.

Finance Minister on Budget tax package
======================================

In a pre-Budget speech today to the Canterbury Manufacturers Association, Finance Minister Michael Cullen outlined the aims and structure of the Budget's business tax package. The government will not be proceeding with tax credits for export market development and investment in skills, he said, although those areas would be "strongly targeted" in the Budget. Other issues covered in the speech include supplementary stabilisation instruments and the tax treatment of employee relocation expenses.

SPEECH

### Budget 2007: towards a stronger and fairer economy

_Speech notes for address to Canterbury Manufacturers Association luncheon, Latimer Lodge, Latimer Square, Christchurch_

Ladies and Gentlemen

On 17 May I will present my eighth Budget. We face very significant challenges, only some of which can be dealt with directly in the context of the Budget.

To begin with I think it is helpful to pause and reflect on the progress we have made. I want to observe that in recent years we have considerably strengthened the base of our economy:

*   Average growth rates since the Labour-led government took office in December 1999 have been over three per cent - faster than the average of developed countries, faster than Europe, Japan, the US and the UK and as fast as Australia.
*   Company tax returns show profits grew at an average of twenty per cent a year between 2003 and 2005 - up from growth of around five per cent a year in the nineties.
*   More Kiwis than ever - 2.1 million of us - are in jobs. The last time there were as few on the dole, Hamish Hay was the mayor here in Christchurch, Gliding On was winning the Feltex television award for best entertainment …and many of the current All Black team hadn’t been born.
*   Job growth and rising incomes have clearly boosted household wealth. Families, young and old are healthier, wealthier and more secure than they have been in a generation. Working for Families is making a real difference to the lives of 360,000 households every day, helping to lift 70,000 children out of poverty.
*   New Zealand has better public finances than nearly all other OECD countries – a particularly pleasing achievement considering where we stood in the early 1980s. Gross debt is approaching twenty per cent of GDP and we no longer carry any net debt at all, if you include the assets of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.

Indeed, the OECD in its annual review of the New Zealand economy released last week described our economy as one of the most resilient and flexible in the club of developed nations, praising our policies as consistent with international best practice.

The international recognition is gratifying. We have put in a place a responsible, forward looking strategy to transform this economy – one that seeks to place the economy on a sustainable footing so we can be even more resilient and flexible to meet the challenges to come.

The pleasing measures of progress are accompanied by signs that last year’s slow-down has bottomed out and growth is picking up again.

But too much of that growth is demand-led. And that demand is borrowing-led. This is leading to an unvirtuous cycle in which inflationary pressures are met by tightening monetary policy, higher interest rates, and, therefore, upwards pressure on the Kiwi dollar.

As I have been saying for quite some time now, the exporting sector has been called on to take too much of the strain of macroeconomic management by way of monetary policy.

The simultaneous announcements last week of a further increase in the O.C.R. by the Reserve Bank and the outsourcing of manufacturing by Fisher and Paykel has led to much more public discussion about this point.

I welcome that discussion. It is a pity it did not occur on a more rational basis at the time it was revealed that I, Trevor Mallard and the National Party leadership had been in discussions on how to make monetary policy work better.

That led to both a media frenzy and a sabotaging of those discussions by Bill English against the clear wishes of his leader. Again, last week, Mr English said he saw nothing wrong with the current framework and all that was needed was more tightening and a slashing of government spending.

In both cases I believe he is wrong. Government spending at the moment is below forecast. The Government is in fact still running a large cash surplus so that it is taking more demand out of the economy than it is putting in. I cannot sustain such surpluses indefinitely. They have been the subject of intense criticism, most notably from the National Party.

In fact, given the latest Budget forecasts, I expect National to revert on Budget night to criticising me for running excessive surpluses – that is, too tight a fiscal policy.

But nor can we be satisfied with a monetary policy framework and operation which so heavily penalises the export sector. Mr English needs to wake up and smell the grass; especially in his home electorate.

That is why the Treasury and the Reserve Bank have been working on supplementary instruments for some time. We need to look for means of translating monetary policy more quickly and effectively than happens at present.

We also need to look at other factors, which have contributed over three successive cycles in the last twenty years to the kind of outcome, you and I both find unacceptable.

But the answers are not easy ones. There is no pain free way of reducing demand when the economy is overheating and so causing inflationary pressures.

The kind of remedies proposed by the OECD a couple of weeks ago are so laughably undeliverable politically, and wrong socially, they need not detain us.

Any changes will require a broad consensus in Parliament. We need to examine the objectives of monetary policy, the mechanisms to achieve them, and the obstacles to effective monetary policy. The aim should be to do the minimum collateral damage to the exporting sector and to confidence in investing in the future – for in doing that monetary policy does affect long term growth despite the endless repetition to the contrary.

Now we can expect much guidance or help from many in the financial sector who have large vested interests in the current methods of operation. And, sadly, I have to report; too many Kiwis now no longer understand the importance of exporting.

When the stuff hit the fan over the mortgage interest levy proposal one senior press gallery journalist said to my press secretary effectively “who cares about exporters – they get millions already.”

I believe the most effective way to try to explore and create a consensus for change is not by trying to rescue confidential talks, but through an open process in the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. I have written to Shane Jones, suggesting that such an inquiry would be very helpful. The terms of reference, of course, are a matter for the Committee.

What is important, I believe, is for people not to get trapped into ruling out discussions in advance.

We are bad at explaining ideas in New Zealand and very good at killing them before they even occur. If there is to be a select committee enquiry it must be allowed to look at ideas without an immediate frenzy that something is about to be introduced. The stakes are too high.

In a way I am pleased that last week’s announcements have brought matters to a head for I have been dissatisfied for some considerable time about the impact of monetary policy on the export sector.

Nevertheless, we need not go into some kind of blue funk. Over the past six years employment in the manufacturing sector has grown 14 per cent. Since 2006 the number of New Zealand manufacturers has increased seven per cent.

The challenge for us is to ensure that people, and our productive capacity, move into higher value areas given the inevitability of increased labour cost competition from Asia and other emerging economies which are no longer miles behind in terms of labour productivity.

The answer is not to try to preserve the past but to create the future. While in the short term we all want a lower exchange rate to be more competitive, over the longer term we should want to see a slow appreciation of the equilibrium rate as we move up the value chain.

Budget 2007 seeks to address some of the underlying issues by the emphasis on business tax reform, investment, and skills.

The business tax package is very much focused on strengthening the drivers of growth.

The package aims to improve competitiveness, encourage investment and raise productivity. Very simply we want to lift the speed limit of the economy. Raising productivity reduces inflationary stresses, reduces pressure on interest rates and makes our currency less attractive to foreigners.

Ultimately we want to improve the resilience of business to prosper at times when the dollar is stronger.

I have been listening very carefully to briefings from the business sector about the package. I felt some very valid points were made about the structure of the business tax package. Many in the business community have emphasised that a system of tax credits to facilitate investment in skills and export market development was not the preferred mechanism.

As a result we won't be proceeding with those tax credits - however, we will strongly target skills and exporting in the budget.

These advances will come on top of considerable effort that's already been put into simplification and areas designed to lift investment over the long term, such as depreciation.

I have also been listening to the concerns some of you have regarding the tax treatment of employee relocation costs. This may particularly be so in relation to attracting skilled workers from areas such as Auckland or overseas. Officials from Treasury and Inland Revenue are currently working through the relevant issues, and will be happy to discuss any concerns that you may wish to raise with them. They will report back to my colleague Revenue Minister Peter Dunne before the end of the year.

The other crucial component of an economic strategy that looks towards the long-term is lifting the level of our household savings.

The government has significantly increased the level of public sector savings in recent years through our fiscal surpluses and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. As I mentioned, including the Fund’s assets, the government has no net debt.

But our household savings record remains very poor by international comparison.

The OECD acknowledged this last week, saying household debt has climbed sharply to around 160 per cent of disposable income, higher than most other OECD countries.

Statistics New Zealand figures show that last year the average New Zealand household spent $1.15 for every dollar earned. Alternative measures of household savings are less negative, but still show a disturbing downward trend over a long period.

We have an appetite for debt when we should be hungry for savings.

Increasing our national savings is good for families, good for businesses, good for the economy. It helps secure our retirement dreams and our future prosperity.

Savings build the wealth of New Zealanders and help build the pool of assets needed for business investment.

If we want to make sure we own more of our own businesses, we need to save more. If we want to have a better standard of living in retirement than New Zealand Superannuation alone, we need to save more.

If we want to have deeper capital markets that provide the oil for a well-functioning business sector, we need to save more.

Our large current account deficit underlines our excessive reliance on foreign savings to finance consumption and investment in New Zealand.

If we save more domestically, we are less reliant on foreigners to finance consumption and business expansion here. Foreigners end up owning fewer of our assets and we become less vulnerable to rising interest rates if international sentiment towards New Zealand changes.

Help is coming on 1 July with KiwiSaver. It's a simple, voluntary workplace-based savings scheme. KiwiSaver aims to make it easy for people to start taking care of tomorrow, today. It makes it especially easy for young people starting out in the workforce.

I am confident KiwiSaver will make a real difference to the ability of many to look forward to a retirement that meets their dreams.

And KiwiSaver will be very positive for businesses. A deeper stock market and corporate debt market lifts business growth and productivity. It takes the pressure off our balance of payments, interest rates and the dollar.

We are reminded of this every time an Australian private equity firm crosses the Tasman to invest in our companies. They have the cash because of active policies in Australia encouraging saving for some decades.

Consider this: the Australian economy is five times the size of ours, yet some trillion dollars are now under management there, compared with just $64 billion dollars in New Zealand.

But we have to keep looking forward; KiwiSaver is the best tool our economy has to ensure we invest more rather than simply spending more.

I was not surprised last year when the economy slowed - we had experienced five consecutive years of growth and no one has yet worked out how to abolish the economic cycle.

But I was also not surprised the slow-down was mild. Commentators who warned of a recession were wrong.

The unexpected strength of the recovery has produced higher tax revenues than we predicted in December.

It has also coincided with higher levels of investment in infrastructure - more roads, rail, schools, hospitals, prisons and so on.

To put in perspective the scale of investment, this year just over $2.1 billion worth of large state highway projects are either under construction or being completed across New Zealand.

At the end of the nineties just $323m worth of large state highway projects were under construction or completed. Investment has increased nearly seven-fold.

We have begun to address the infrastructure deficit that built up through the nineties. Choices have consequences and by the end of the nineties infrastructure was badly run down. As a result, we have had to catch up.

We will continue the catch-up in the budget because this government is committed to building the world-class infrastructure that is needed to drive economic transformation.

And can I briefly don my other hat as Minister for Tertiary Education? You may have read about my announcement on Monday concerning the new funding framework for institutes of technology, polytechnics, wananga and industry training organisations. I plan a similar one next week for the university sector and further announcements on the tertiary education over the next few months.

The new tertiary education system being put in place allows a far more strategic view to be taken. We want to fund tertiary education organisations in a way that ensures the education and training needs of a wider range of stakeholders, including business and the government are being met.

This shift in focus is important if our tertiary education system is going to offer taxpayers greater value for money while at the same time ensuring the system produces the right mix of skilled graduates you need to help build a more dynamic economy.

So, in summary, my eighth budget will continue the strategy that has strengthened the foundation of our economy in recent years without unduly adding to domestic pressures.

Again it is all about raising the speed limit of the economy. What the Government can do to help is:

*   Running prudent fiscal policy
*   Building world class infrastructure
*   Encouraging investment
*   Promoting savings
*   Developing a highly skilled workforce

The budget continues our progress in building a solid basis for the future by providing solutions for the challenges of today and tomorrow.

We have a smart and active economic strategy and I am confident the choices the government is making will help all of this generation and the next, to share in a stronger and fairer economy.

Thank you.
Budget Saving and Investing Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue $3.4 billion for investment and innovation Budget 2007 delivers the most substantial changes to the business environment in twenty years, which will help develop a more innovative and dynamic economy, better able to compete in the global marketplace. "The Labour-led government is investing $3.4 billion dollars over the next four years in order to accelerate the transformation of New Zealand into a more resilient and flexible economy able to withstand the challenges we face today," said Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne. "If we are to lift the sustainable rate of growth of the economy businesses must do better at producing the kinds of products that can command a premium in overseas markets. "That's why we are determined to give businesses the tools they need to compete effectively and ensure New Zealand becomes a much more attractive place to invest and do business. "The Business Tax Reform package in Budget 2007 contains the first cut to the company tax rate since 1988 and builds on the $1.4 billion package of depreciation and other business tax measures announced in Budget 2005. Budget 2007 provides: (over four years) A cut in the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 30 per cent. The direct cost is $2.1 billion, effective 2008/09. In addition, the cost of transitional company tax changes will be $130 million over four years. A 15 per cent tax credit for research and development ($630 million) Changes to tax treatment of savings vehicles ($180 million) Greater export market development assistance ($87.8 million) Expansion of industry training ($53 million). 1 Included in the total Business Tax Reform package is the cost of extending the Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax exemption for employer contributions to complying superannuation funds at a cost of $74 million over four years. "In addition, the suggested changes to New Zealand's international tax rules are estimated to have a four-year cost of $112.5 million. "We are confident the changes unveiled today will help businesses expand here and overseas, improve their ability to research and develop new products and processes and invest in skilled staff in order to lift productivity. "The Labour-led government is committed to raising the low level of private funding of R&D. The tax credit substantially lowers the cost of R&D, and therefore gives smaller companies the incentive to start investing in R&D and larger companies to expand their research. "The changes will also drive higher productivity, which is essential to improve competitiveness and lift wages and so living standards across the economy," said the Ministers." The Business Tax Reform package advances the objectives of the confidence and supply agreements with United Future and New Zealand First. "These are substantial changes which I am confident will make a real difference to our economic performance and so our ability to raise living standards," said Mr Dunne. "The measures announced today build on the Labour-led government's integrated strategy designed to lift the speed limit of the economy," said Dr Cullen. "The Business Tax Reform package, in particular complement our efforts to encourage saving. Greater saving will help deepen capital markets, which should make it easier for businesses to access the capital they need to grow and prosper. "The investments in business tax changes, world class infrastructure and a revitalised tertiary sector capable of producing more highly skilled graduates, coupled with greater savings will all help reduce the stresses we see today in inflation, high interest rates and an over-valued exchange rate. "The reforms build on progress we have already made in fostering a supportive business environment. We are recognised internationally by the World Bank for the ease of doing business. "We are determined to go further. Therefore, the government will further investigate reducing business tax compliance costs, which are a particular concern for small and medium-sized businesses. A discussion document exploring options for doing this will be issued later this year." Business tax reform snapshot Company tax cut to 30 per cent "This brings the company rate in line with Australia so improving our competitiveness with our biggest export market as well as making New Zealand a more attractive location internationally from which to generate profits. This also helps companies to reinvest profits to drive greater productivity. Research and development tax credit "This mirrors similar concessions in Australia and elsewhere - three-quarters of the OECD club of developed economies offer R&D tax incentives. There is international evidence that non-discretionary assistance such as tax credits may be more cost-effective than discretionary assistance such as grants at boosting business R&D. The tax credit is expected to have wider benefits for the New Zealand economy. The aim is to help raise the rate of private sector R&D investment in New Zealand, currently only a third of the OECD average. International Tax Review "The government is introducing a tax exemption for active income (such as income from manufacturing and distribution) of New Zealand controlled companies based in overseas markets. This will enable New Zealand-based firms to expand overseas at a lower tax and compliance cost. This will bring New Zealand in line with the world's best practice in this area and so should help to reduce the incentive for our companies to migrate overseas. Further information on the continuing review is set out in 'New Zealand's International Tax Review: an update', available at http://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz./ Expanded market development assistance "The additional funding of $87.8 million for the Market Development Assistance Scheme reflects the decision not to proceed with a tax credit. After consultation with business this was a considered a more effective approach to boost productivity and competitiveness. Expanded skills training "The extra funding of $53 million to boost participation in industry training reflects the decision not to proceed with a tax credit. After consultation with business this was a considered a more effective approach to address skills shortages. The extra funding will provide further assistance towards the government's goal of 220,000 in training annually by 2011. Tax treatment of savings vehicles Consistent with the aim to encourage savings, certain vehicles such as unit trusts and widely held superannuation schemes will also be taxed at the new 30 per cent rate. The top tax rate for portfolio investment entities will also be capped at 30 per cent.
Budget 2007 Company tax rate change: questions and answers 1 Why is the company tax rate being reduced from 33 per cent to 30 per cent? Business tax reforms are a substantial and important part of the government's economic transformation agenda. Our aim is to have a sustainable economy built on innovation and quality, producing the kinds of products for which other countries will pay a premium. The business tax reforms are intended to help foster an environment that enables New Zealand businesses to grow and compete in a global economy. The Business Tax Review was a key feature in the government's Confidence and Supply Agreements with United Future and with New Zealand First. Reducing the company tax rate will allow successful businesses to keep a greater share of their profits. This is expected to increase investment in New Zealand which in turn will boost productivity. It is also expected to increase profits recognised in New Zealand which in turn will lift our international competitiveness, especially with Australia. 2 Who will get the company tax rate reduction? The tax rate reduction applies to New Zealand companies, including unit trusts. 3 Why is the rate reduction restricted to companies? The Business Tax Review discussion document, released in July last year, consulted on the possibility of a company tax rate reduction. The Review noted that most business activity in New Zealand is undertaken by companies and acknowledged that a company rate reduction would not benefit unincorporated businesses. Submissions on the Review strongly supported a company tax rate reduction, though some also supported reducing personal tax rates at the same time. A company tax rate reduction increases incentives to invest and improve productivity for New Zealand companies. It also improves the attractiveness of New Zealand as a location for companies, especially in relation to Australia. Therefore a reduction in the company tax rate directly addresses the two main objectives of the Business Tax Review. Personal tax reductions are a less direct way of reducing taxes on businesses (and addressing these objectives) as business income is a relatively small share of total personal income. 1 4 When does the tax rate reduction come into effect? Most of the amendments apply from the beginning of taxpayers' 2008/09 income years. The exceptions are: • the amendments that relate to Qualifying Company Election Tax, which will apply from 17 May 2007; and • the amendments that relate to benchmark dividends, which will apply from 1 October 2007. 5 How do companies take advantage of the tax rate reduction? Companies calculating their tax liability should use the reduced rate from the start of their 2008/09 income year. There will be special rules for provisional taxpayers who use the uplift method to allow for the tax rate reduction. 6 Won't the tax rate reduction be clawed back when profits are paid to shareholders? The imputation system allows credits for tax paid at the company level to be passed through to shareholders, offsetting their tax liability on dividends received. Following the company tax cut, to the extent that profits are distributed to New Zealand taxpaying shareholders, less tax will have been paid at the company level, requiring additional tax to be paid at the shareholder level. However, companies will benefit from the lower rate so long as profits are retained and reinvested in the company. 7 What associated changes are being made as part of the company tax rate reduction? Reducing the company tax rate will require a number of associated changes. These include amendments to the imputation rules, altering the tax credit ratios for shareholders, amending the foreign investment tax credit and available subscribed capital formulas, changes to the qualifying company rules and adjusting the Branch Equivalent Tax and Conduit Relief Accounts. 8 Why are there transitional imputation rules? The maximum imputation credit ratio is set equal to the company tax rate. Allowing the imputation ratio to change at the same date as the company tax rate is simple but would adversely affect many shareholders since dividends are usually paid out in arrears. Profits taxed in the company's hands at 33 per cent would be imputed only to 30 per cent, leading to an additional top-up tax being paid by shareholders. The transitional period therefore allows for profits that have been taxed at 33 per cent to be passed through to shareholders with credit for this higher rate of tax. The transitional period will run from the beginning of the 2008-09 income year to the end of the 2009/10 imputation year (being 31 March 2010). At the end of this period, companies will be able to distribute any 33 per cent tax credits at the new imputation ratio of 30/70. 2 9 Why do shareholders who are companies or widely held savings vehicles not fully benefit from the transitional imputation provisions? That is to prevent those shareholders with a 30 per cent tax rate from being able to use the additional 3 per cent credit to shelter other income from taxation. 10 How do companies take advantage of the transitional imputation period? Companies will need to calculate the level of their 33 per cent tax credits. To the extent that they have a balance of these credits during the transitional period they will be able to allocate them at a maximum tax credit ratio of 33/67. 11 Why is no associated change being made to the resident withholding tax (RWT) rate? No change is currently proposed in relation to the rates of RWT on interest and dividends, as 33 per cent is a final tax for a number of shareholders, including a number of individuals who do not have to file tax returns because their income is presently fully taxed. In addition, Inland Revenue is considering carrying out an operational review of RWT. 3
Budget 2007 R&D tax credit: questions and answers 1 Why is the R&D tax credit being introduced? The credit is intended to encourage New Zealand businesses to invest more in R&D, to innovate and develop improved products and processes. This is expected to have wider benefits for the New Zealand economy and boost productivity and international competitiveness. The credit is one of the business tax reforms that are a substantial and important part of the government's Economic Transformation agenda. The aim is to have a sustainable economy built on innovation and quality, producing the kinds of products for which other countries will pay a premium. The business tax reforms are intended to help foster an environment that enables New Zealand businesses to grow and compete in a global economy. The Business Tax Review is a key feature in the government's Confidence and Supply Agreements with United Future and with New Zealand First. 2 Who will get the credit? New Zealand businesses undertaking R&D on their own account or outsourcing it will be eligible. They will have to incur at least $20,000 of eligible expenditure in the year a claim is made unless the R&D is outsourced to a listed research provider. Businesses will be eligible, regardless of their legal structure, if the R&D is carried out predominantly in New Zealand. It is expected that up to 2,500 businesses could start claiming the credit. 3 How much is the credit? The credit will be 15 per cent of the claimant's total eligible expenditure for the year. Income tax deductions for the expenditure will not be reduced by the amount of the claim received in relation to the expenditure. 4 What is R&D? For the purposes of the tax credit, R&D is activity that is systematic, investigative and experimental which seeks to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty or that involves an appreciable element of novelty and that is carried on for the purposes of acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services. This activity is referred to as "core" R&D. Support activities can also be eligible if those activities are commensurate with, required for, and integral to the carrying on of the activity described above. 1 What activities are not eligible as R&D activities? Activities that are ineligible as a core activity include: • research in social sciences, arts or humanities; • making stylistic or cosmetic changes; and • market research. These activities are not eligible as core R&D because the credit is intended to incentivise scientific and technological advancement. They may be eligible as a supporting R&D activity. Why restrict the credit to businesses in New Zealand? Increased investment in R&D by New Zealand businesses has wider benefits for the New Zealand economy. Extending the R&D tax credit to cases where R&D is carried out by a party who is not in business in New Zealand may have some benefits to the New Zealand economy, but would enable the wider benefits associated with firms developing and marketing new products and processes to be captured overseas rather than in New Zealand. Extending the R&D tax credit to cases where R&D is performed as a service for an offshore commissioner would increase the fiscal cost of the R&D incentive, potentially unsustainably, as New Zealand accounts for a small share of global R&D. This extension is also likely to crowd out investment in R&D by New Zealand businesses as, at the margin, the capacity and capability to perform R&D are relatively scarce. Why must the R&D be carried out predominantly in New Zealand? Many of the wider benefits from doing the R&D are likely largely to arise in the location in which the R&D is carried out. The requirement is intended to ensure that New Zealand can capture those benefits. However, the credit will apply to R&D carried out overseas as part of a project based in New Zealand, for up to 10 per cent of the eligible expenditure incurred in New Zealand. Why is there a minimum threshold of $20,000 of eligible expenditure? The threshold exists to minimise compliance and administrative costs associated with the reclassification of small amounts of expenditure as R&D. However, there will be an exception to the threshold if the R&D is carried out by a listed research provider. The exception is designed to allow small businesses to access the credit at a low compliance cost. 2 9 Why are there requirements that the claimant must control the R&D, bear the technical and financial risk, and own the results of the R&D? When R&D is subcontracted out, the incentive will go to the party commissioning the R&D, instead of the party carrying it out. These requirements are designed to prevent multiple claims for the same expenditure. Also, the requirements are intended to ensure that the incentive goes to the party making the R&D investment - which will be the party taking the risks, deciding how much R&D will be undertaken, and benefiting from the results. 10 Who is ineligible and why? Crown Research Institutes, tertiary institutions and District Health Boards, their associates and entities controlled by them will be ineligible for the credit. However, if a New Zealand business commissions R&D from these institutions, the business may be eligible for the credit. These entities are excluded because the credits are intended to encourage private sector investment in R&D, and there are more effective mechanisms for increasing the amount of R&D carried out by these institutions. 11 Why is the credit based on volume of R&D, rather than incremental R&D? The credit is based on the volume of R&D done (that is, the total amount of R&D) rather than R&D done above a base-year level (an incremental system). The volume method is simpler to understand and apply. It will also give firms more certainty about the benefit of the R&D credit when planning their R&D investment over the longer term. International experience suggests that this certainty is important. In addition, as the amount of R&D carried out grows over time, a fixed-base incremental credit will increasingly have the same effect as a volume credit. 12 What expenditure is eligible? Eligible expenditure includes employee salaries and training, depreciation of tangible assets used primarily in conducting R&D, overhead costs, consumables, and payments to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the claimant. 13 What expenditure is not eligible? Ineligible expenditure includes interest, the loss on sale or write-off of depreciable property, the cost of acquiring core technology (technology used as a basis for further R&D), expenditure funded from a government grant or the required co-funding, expenditure on intangible assets and professional fees in determining eligibility. 3 14 When does the credit come into effect? The credit will apply from the 2008/09 income year. 15 How do claimants get the credit? The credit will be claimed as part of the annual income tax return process. A supporting statement will also need to be filed. Businesses with only exempt income will need to file an income tax return to access the credit. 16 How will businesses without a tax liability get the credit? The R&D credit will reduce tax payments, but if there is no tax to pay the credits will be paid out in cash. Therefore loss-making businesses, such as start-ups, or businesses, which only have exempt income will receive their credit in cash. 17 Won't the credit be clawed back when profits are paid to shareholders? The credit has been designed to minimise claw-back. Imputation credits will arise for a tax liability satisfied by the R&D credit. Those imputation credits will therefore be available to be attached to dividends as though the tax was actually paid. 18 Why is there a $2 million cap on software developed for internal use? Overseas experience highlights a risk that routine in-house software development may be reclassified as R&D expenditure. Expenditure on in-house software development as core R&D is therefore eligible only up to $2 million a year. However, the cap does not apply to software development that supports core R&D. Australia does not allow software developed solely for in-house use to qualify as core R&D. The Minister of Finance may increase the eligible amount for internal software development if the Minister is satisfied that the R&D activity is in the national interest - that is, it will be exploited mainly for the benefit of New Zealand, New Zealand will receive a substantial net benefit from the activities, and the claimant is committed to keep the value of their business in New Zealand. 19 What about co-operatives that do R&D? There are special provisions for industry research co-operatives, which are sector- based groups that undertake or commission R&D mainly on behalf of New Zealand businesses. If contributions or levies received by a co-operative from those businesses are applied to R&D that relates to the businesses, the co-operative may be eligible for the credit. The co-operative does not need to meet the requirement to be in business in New Zealand. 4
Budge International tax review: questions and answers 1 What are the major features of the international tax reform package? The central feature of the reform is the introduction of a tax exemption for active income (such as manufacturing) of a controlled foreign company (CFC). This constitutes a major policy change, and means that the offshore active income of New Zealand business will no longer be taxed as it is earned, but will instead be exempt from New Zealand tax. As part of a package of proposals for the implementation of an active income exemption, the following additional in-principle policy decisions have been made: • Ordinary dividends from CFCs to the New Zealand parent will be exempt from domestic tax. • A simple "active business" test will be developed to exempt all CFCs with less than five percent passive income, no matter where they do business. The test will be designed to replace the current eight-country "grey list" exemption. • Even if a CFC does not meet the active business test, only its passive income will be taxed back in New Zealand. • A relatively limited definition of passive income, that would include dividends, interest, royalties and certain rents, will be developed. • A limited set of "base company" rules for services will be adopted. • Once the exemption is in place, interest allocation rules will limit the extent to which New Zealand businesses can deduct interest costs relating to offshore investments that are outside the New Zealand tax base. • The conduit rules will be repealed. 2 What are these changes intended to achieve? The international tax reform package is aimed at improving New Zealand's international competitiveness through promoting an environment for globally connected firms to locate in and expand from a New Zealand base. The reform fits within the government's Economic Transformation agenda, recognising that tax is one of a number of factors that influence firms' location decisions. With an increasingly borderless global economy, New Zealand must be able to attract and retain capital and our businesses must be able to compete effectively in foreign markets. New Zealand's current CFC rules tax offshore income more comprehensively than other countries, which generally exempt active income earned offshore or defer tax until that income is returned in the form of dividends. Australia, in particular, has an extensive active income exemption in its CFC rules. 1 An exemption of offshore active income will bring New Zealand into line with international norms. This will put New Zealand companies on a more equal footing internationally by removing an additional tax cost not faced by firms based in comparable jurisdictions, enabling them to expand into new markets from a New Zealand base. Who will benefit from the active income exemption? New Zealand businesses will not have to pay New Zealand tax on the active income earned by their CFCs. Firms with active CFCs in non-grey list countries will be relieved of both tax and compliance burdens. As a result, New Zealand firms will be better able to expand their business overseas and compete more effectively in foreign markets. How do these changes compare with the Australian system? New Zealand has had the opportunity to learn from the Australian system in developing our rules. Australia uses a comparable framework for its taxation of CFCs, although some key features differ. For example, Australia has retained a "listed country" exemption. On the other hand, we propose a narrower definition of passive income, to minimise compliance costs and avoid getting in the way of the legitimate business arrangements of New Zealand firms operating offshore. Why replace the grey list? The new system needs to be looked at as a whole. The proposed rules exempt dividends from CFCs and allow considerable margin in the application of the interest allocation rules. In that context, taxation of passive income, no matter where it occurs, forms a cornerstone in protecting the domestic tax base from tax- eroding strategies. The grey list exemption is based on the assumption that eight listed countries have tax systems that are comparable to New Zealand. In reality, however, there can be no guarantee that passive income will be comparably taxed in those countries. Non-taxation of passive income may occur from the architecture of the other country's tax system, or as a result of tax arbitrage, exploiting technical differences between tax systems. What are the implications for firms' compliance costs? Compliance costs will be minimised through the adoption of a simple "active business" test, which will exempt all CFCs with less than five percent passive income, no matter where they do business. Combined with a narrow definition of passive income, and narrow base company rules, it is anticipated that most substantially active CFCs will not need to attribute any income at all. Other aspects of the system will also help to minimise compliance costs by comparison with other countries' regimes. For example, New Zealand will have no base company rules for goods and will exempt dividends from CFCs. 2 7 Why repeal conduit relief? Conduit tax relief is currently available for the CFCs to the extent that the parent company is owned by non-residents. Conduit relief will become redundant for active income once the proposed reforms are in place. The case for continuing to provide conduit relief for passive income is weak and would involve on-going risk to the tax base. In particular, it can encourage non-residents to re-characterise New Zealand source income as foreign income. 8 Why extend our interest allocation rules to New Zealand firms with CFCs? The introduction of an active income exemption will create an incentive for New Zealand companies with outbound investment to over-allocate their global interest costs against their New Zealand income. As such, there is a strong case in principle for extending our existing interest allocation rules on inbound investment to New Zealand firms with CFCs with the introduction of an exemption for active income earned by CFCs. To ensure that the rules do not unduly affect most New Zealand business, the government proposes to maintain the current thresholds, including a 75 per cent safe harbour. This will result in New Zealand having rules which are similar to Australia's. 9 What about Non-Resident Withholding Tax? The Budget announcement focuses on the design of an active income exemption. Changes to NRWT will be taken forward through bilateral treaty negotiation. Associated changes to the Foreign Investor Tax Credit and the Approved Issuer Levy are also best considered as part of that process. 10 What are the next steps? An update on the international tax review has been released with Budget materials. It provides a stock-take of the package of proposals discussed here and sets out the areas of which further detailed consultation, analysis and decisions are still required. Over the next few months, officials will release a series of technical papers covering in greater depth the topics requiring further consultation and analysis. Officials will then consult on the topics covered in the papers, and written submissions will be invited. 3 Following this second round of consultation, the government expects to consider the detailed proposals and finalise the reform package later this year, with a view to introducing legislation in early 2008 (for application beginning the 2009/10 tax year). In order to develop a workable and robust reform package, it is critical that supporting and consequential details are carefully considered. For this reason, the determination of a finalised policy package is conditional on the outcomes of a secondary round of detailed work and consultations. 4

INTRODUCTION Process to date 1.1 The discussion document New Zealand’s International Tax Review: a direction for change was released on 13 December 2006. It outlined the government’s intention to introduce an exemption for offshore active income. Rather than make concrete proposals for the implementation of the exemption, it canvassed the various approaches taken in other countries and indicated the broad direction and approach of the proposed reform. 1.2 Officials then engaged in an extensive consultation process with businesses. Forty-eight written submissions on the ideas set out in the discussion document were also received. This consultation and feedback has been invaluable in enabling the government to assemble a balanced package of reforms that is appropriate for the New Zealand context. Purpose of this document 1.3 This document aims to: • provide an update of the government’s in-principle policy decisions to date, setting out how the various components fit together as a balanced package; • set out the areas on which further, detailed consultation, analysis and decisions are still required; • indicate the potential reform proposals which the government has decided not to pursue; and • explain the process and timelines for the second round of consultations. 1.4 It does not cover the possible changes to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). As was noted in the discussion document, any changes to rates of NRWT are best done through bilateral treaty negotiation. Any proposals to change the foreign investor tax credit or the approved issuer levy rules will be considered in connection with this process. Next steps 1.5 A series of technical papers will be released over the next few months. They will draw extensively on the submissions received in response to the discussion document and are likely to cover a range of topics, including: • the active/passive boundary; • the active business test; 2 • interest allocation rules for New Zealand companies investing offshore; and • the possible extension of the active income exemption to branches and non-portfolio foreign investment funds. 1.6 Officials will begin consulting on the release of these papers, and written submissions will be invited on the technical issues raised in these documents. We are not expecting written submissions on this update. 1.7 Following the second round of consultation, the government expects to consider the detailed proposals and finalise the reform package later this year, with a view to introducing legislation early in 2008 (for application beginning from the 2009–10 income year). 3 2. BACKGROUND AND POLICY DECISIONS Background and policy context 2.1 The review of New Zealand’s international tax rules aims to improve our international competitiveness through promoting an enabling environment for globally connected firms to locate in New Zealand and expand into other countries from a New Zealand base. It fits within the government’s Economic Transformation agenda, recognising that tax is one of a number of factors, including infrastructure, education and skills, and research and development, that influence firms’ location decisions. 2.2 The central feature of this reform is the introduction of a tax exemption for active income. Examples of active businesses that will benefit from the exemption include: • businesses that take advantage of multi-national manufacturing networks; and • exporters that expand sales through international distribution networks. 2.3 An exemption for the offshore active income of New Zealand businesses constitutes a major policy change, and means that this income will no longer be taxed as it is earned. This will bring New Zealand into line with international norms and remove a current tax disincentive for globally connected firms to locate in New Zealand. 2.4 The following guiding principles have informed the design of the proposed package: • First, the new rules should, as much as possible, allow firms to get on with legitimate business activity. This means the new rules: – should not discourage firms from undertaking expansion of business operations offshore to take advantage of market opportunities or gain production efficiencies; and – should take into account the legitimate business arrangements and methods of operation that New Zealand businesses use in their offshore operations. • Second, the rules should, as much as possible, minimise compliance burdens. • Third, the rules should maintain a level of protection for the domestic tax base. A balanced package 2.5 Bearing these principles in mind, the government has taken the following in- principle policy decisions: 4 • A tax exemption for the active income of a controlled foreign company (CFC) will be introduced. • Ordinary dividends from CFCs to the New Zealand parent will be exempt from domestic tax. • A simple “active business” test will be developed to exempt all CFCs with less than five percent passive income, no matter where they do business. The test will be designed to replace the current eight-country “grey-list” exemption. 1 • Even if a CFC does not meet the active business test, only its passive income will be taxed in New Zealand. • A relatively limited definition of passive income that would include dividends, interest, royalties and certain rents will be developed. • A limited set of “base company” rules for services will be developed. • Once the exemption is in place, interest allocation rules will limit the extent to which New Zealand businesses can deduct interest costs relating to offshore investments. • The conduit rules will be repealed. 2.6 The changes are summarised in figure 1. Together, they represent a balanced package: F IGURE 1: Summary of the package 1 The income from CFCs resident in eight “grey list” countries is exempt from New Zealand tax. The grey list countries are considered to have tax systems similar to New Zealand’s. The eight grey list countries are Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. Getting on with business Minimise compliance costs Base protection Active business test Limited base company rules Limited definition of passive income No grey list Interest allocation No conduit rules Overall package Dividend exemption Active income exemption 5 2.7 The proposals allow companies room to go about their ordinary business, while constraining the risk of significant base erosion from tax planning strategies. 2.8 The active income exemption will remove the current barrier to investments outside the grey list countries and greatly reduce the compliance burden imposed on such investments. Exempting dividends received from offshore CFCs will enhance these benefits. The absence of base company rules on goods will be of particular benefit to New Zealand firms that export through international distribution networks. 2.9 Compliance costs are minimised by the introduction of the active business test and use of safe harbours, a relatively limited definition of what is passive income and the avoidance of many of the technically complicated base protection rules used in other countries. 2.10 Protection of the domestic tax base is achieved through accrual taxation of passive income above the threshold (including in grey list countries) and the extension of interest allocation rules to firms making offshore investments. Taxing passive income prevents the avoidance of domestic tax merely by shifting the location of the investment and inhibits tax minimising strategies. The interest allocation rules protect the domestic tax base from erosion by preventing an over-allocation of global interest costs against New Zealand operations. 2.11 In order to develop a workable and robust reform package, it is critical that supporting and consequential details are carefully considered. The final policy package depends on a satisfactory outcome from a second round of detailed work and consultations. The design of the active business test will be particularly important in minimising compliance costs faced by firms under the proposed package. The government plans to develop a simple test that exempts all CFCs with less than five percent passive income, no matter where they do business. The test will be designed to replace the current eight-country grey list exemption. The key design features 2.12 Table 1 outlines the key features of the proposals for the technical implementation of the policy and signals those areas where further policy development is required. 6 TABLE 1: KEY FEATURES OF THE PROPOSAL The main features of the package include: Exemption for active income An exemption for active income will consist of: • the introduction of an active income exemption under New Zealand’s CFC rules; • the exemption of all dividends received by the New Zealand parent company from ordinary shares in CFCs. Further work will explore extending the active income exemption to offshore branches and non-portfolio foreign investment funds (FIFs). Limited definition of passive income A relatively limited definition of passive income will include dividends, interest, royalties and certain rental income and be restricted to exclude: • income earned by a holding company or a financing subsidiary from related active CFCs in the same jurisdiction; and • rental income from real property in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. Further work will explore: • whether further narrowing of the definition of passive income with respect to royalty income and foreign exchange gains to the extent that they relate to an active business is appropriate and practicable; and • the scope of base company rules for certain services. Active business test The active income exemption will be implemented through the adoption of an active business test for CFCs – based on the CFC earning less than five percent passive income. Characteristics of the active business test will include: • No income will be attributed for a CFC that passed the test. • Only passive income will be attributed for those CFCs that failed the test. • It is intended that the test will be based on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) compatible accounts of the CFC, with adjustments as appropriate. • The test will apply for all jurisdictions, replacing the current grey list of eight countries. Further work will explore whether it is possible to use the consolidated accounts of a group of CFCs in a jurisdiction in applying the active business test. 7 Associated key base maintenance measures The grey list of eight countries will be replaced with a simple active business test that applies for all CFCs in all countries. The interest allocation rules will be extended to New Zealand firms with outbound investment in CFCs. Further work will explore: • whether certain preference shares should be treated as liabilities; • whether alignment of the definition of liabilities for the worldwide test and the definition of New Zealand liabilities can be achieved; and • the treatment of financial institutions under the interest allocation rules. The conduit rules will be repealed. Further work will explore the development of a targeted anti-avoidance provision relating to the foreign tax credit rules. 2.13 Some of the base maintenance measures suggested in the discussion document will not be taken up as part of the package. In particular: • The burden of proof on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on transfer pricing reassessments will remain with the Commissioner and not be shifted to the taxpayer. • Base company rules will not apply to the sale of goods by a CFC and associated services performed by that CFC. • Many of the possible changes to the general interest allocation rules (and therefore those applying to outbound investments) that were raised in the discussion document will not proceed. There will be no changes to: – the safe harbour of 75 percent; – the 110 percent uplift for the worldwide test; – the on-lending rules; – the treatment of goodwill and foreign tax credits (meaning that the banking provisions will not be extended to the general interest allocation rules). 8 3. GETTING ON WITH BUSINESS Exempting active income 3.1 The cornerstone of the new system is an exemption for active income earned through a CFC. This represents a radical shift from the current paradigm of accrual taxation of offshore income. Consultations have shown strong support for this change, which would bring New Zealand into line with the international tax rules of most other developed countries. This section considers the scope of the exemption – which businesses and what sort of income will be covered. 3.2 Active businesses can also be carried on through branches or non-portfolio FIFs. The discussion document supported the principle that an active income exemption should be extended to such vehicles as well as CFCs. There was considerable support for such an extension in the consultations. Australia currently has an active income exemption for branches and FIFs. 2 The development of detailed rules will form part of the post-Budget technical consultations. Exempting dividends from CFCs 3.3 As a complement to the active income exemption, dividends repatriated to a New Zealand parent company from CFCs will be exempted. For reasons of simplicity and to minimise compliance costs, this exemption will apply to dividends from CFCs regardless of whether the CFC passes the active business test or whether the dividends are paid out of active or passive income. This simplification is possible on the assumption that any passive income has already been taxed on accrual. Again, there is widespread support for this change. 3.4 The discussion document indicated that exemption was the preferred course of action, provided that other rules were sufficiently robust to ensure the integrity of the system – in particular, that passive income would in fact be taxed on accrual. The government considers that the proposals in the package, particularly the removal of the grey list and the extension of the interest allocation rules, allow the exemption for dividends. 3.5 Dividends that would not qualify for an underlying foreign tax credit under the current rules would not be eligible for the exemption. These dividends are those where: • the recipient does not have a sufficient interest in the CFC; or • the share is a fixed rate share; or 2 The Australian Board of Taxation is currently undertaking a review of all of Australia’s anti-tax-deferral rules, including its CFC rules. One objective of the review is to consider whether harmonisation of the current regimes can reduce complexity and compliance costs. 9 • the CFC is allowed a deduction for the dividend in calculating its liability for tax. 3.6 The repeal of the dividend withholding payment rules is a natural consequence of removing dividends from tax. The removal of the ability to refund a portion of New Zealand tax paid upon ultimate distribution to non- resident shareholders would also follow. This is appropriate as offshore active income is exempt from New Zealand tax. Any income which is taxable is passive income and should be treated as New Zealand income. Accordingly, it should be subject to New Zealand tax at the full company rate of tax and be subject to the general imputation rules. Types of passive income 3.7 A relatively narrow definition of passive income is proposed. In particular, passive income treatment would generally be reserved to the types of income which are not location-specific and therefore may be assigned to jurisdictions purely for tax purposes, rather than in response to underlying economic drivers, such as costs or markets. 3.8 This narrow definition is influenced by company concerns that a broad definition of passive income would expose them to considerable compliance costs. A broader definition could lead to more companies failing the active business test, thus calculating and paying tax on accrual. That is undesirable. Interest 3.9 Interest and interest substitutes are generally included as passive income. In particular, interest that arises from investments or as part of the business of lending money would be treated as passive. Thus passive income would include income that is financial in nature such as guarantee fees, interest swap payments and the interest portion of financial lease payments and sale and repurchase agreements. 3.10 Even so, interest can also arise as a consequence of active business. Such interest would not be treated as passive income. An example is trade debt. Further consideration in the next round of consultations would need to be given to hire purchase and other vendor financing arrangements. Dividends 3.11 In general, dividends and FIF income derived by a CFC are passive income. 3.12 As already noted, however, the government proposes to exempt dividends repatriated by a CFC to its New Zealand parent. This means that dividends paid between associated CFCs should also fall outside the definition of passive income. They will be exempt, as shown in figure 2. 10 New Zealand Outside New Zealand Dividend (exempt) Dividend (exempt) FIGURE 2: Exempt dividends Holding companies and financing subsidiaries 3.13 Groups of CFCs in a jurisdiction are often owned through a holding company. Furthermore, a group of active companies may have one subsidiary which centralises the financing operations for the group. In the absence of relieving provisions, holding and related party financing income earned from other active companies in the group could be treated as passive, which would effectively negate the active income exemption for the group. 3.14 In principle, the government is seeking to address this problem by excluding from the definition of passive income interest and dividends earned by a company from active related companies in the same jurisdiction. A related company would be considered active if it passed the active business test. 3.15 There will be issues for further consideration. For example, if related party interest is considered to be active income, the deduction of interest on money borrowed by the finance company to invest in other group companies should not be used to shelter otherwise taxable passive income. 3.16 Several New Zealand companies have regional holding and financing subsidiaries that receive income from related parties outside of the jurisdiction of the CFC. Under the “same jurisdiction” requirement, the holding/finance company would need to attribute any passive income. However, as previously noted, dividends paid between related CFCs would be exempt. This means that regional holding companies that receive dividends only from related CFCs will have no passive income to attribute, regardless of jurisdiction. NZ Co CFC 1 CFC 2 11 Royalty income 3.17 The taxation of royalty income requires further development. 3.18 As a starting proposition, royalty interests provide a financial return and can be traded like other investments. Accordingly, they would generally be considered to be passive in nature. One question is whether an exception should be made for royalty interests developed as part of an active business. In principle, there is a case to exclude such royalty income from passive income, and some countries do so. Australia, for example, treats as active royalties received from non-associates in the course of carrying on a business provided the property or right for which the royalty is paid originated with the CFC or was substantially improved or developed by the CFC. However, the determination of appropriate borderlines is very difficult. The wider question of the taxation of intellectual property remains controversial internationally. 3.19 A number of factors must be considered in determining whether such an exception for royalties associated with an active business is desirable, including: • the possibility of the transfer of intellectual property out of New Zealand without incurring a tax liability; • the general difficulty of separating royalty income from the value of related goods and services; and • the difficulty in assigning such income to a jurisdiction with certainty. 3.20 As a consequence of these difficulties, further consultation is necessary before the appropriate treatment of royalty income can be determined. Rental income 3.21 In most jurisdictions, rental income is considered passive in nature. This is also our starting position. 3.22 It might be argued that, in certain circumstances, rental income could be considered to have the character of active income. Specifically: • when the CFC is actually in the business of renting; • when the CFC is not in the business of renting, but is an active business earning incidental rental income – for example, by leasing spare capacity; and • when the CFC holds property used by related CFCs for the purposes of carrying on an active business, receiving rental income from those other CFCs. 12 3.23 In practice, appropriately distinguishing between active and passive rental income can be difficult and subjective. However, real property, by its nature, is tied to the jurisdiction in which it is situated. While equipment is obviously more mobile, concerns about profit shifting only arise if the CFC is earning rents from outside its jurisdiction. In the interests of keeping the definition of passive income limited, appropriately targeted and as straightforward as possible, it is therefore proposed to treat all rental income as active to the extent that it is derived from the leasing of real property or equipment situated in the same jurisdiction as the CFC. Other rental income will be passive. 3.24 Finance leases will be treated as loans giving rise to passive income irrespective of whether the source of the payments is within the same jurisdiction as the CFC. Foreign exchange gains and losses 3.25 Foreign exchange gains are brought to tax as interest under the rules for financial arrangements. When foreign exchange gains arise from trading foreign exchange instruments or when such instruments are part of an arrangement that yields a return that has the same nature as a return on a passive investment, they should be taken into account for the purposes of attribution and the active business test. 3.26 On the other hand, when the gains arise as part of hedging strategies for an active business, conceptually they should be considered to be part of that active business. Moreover, in a pure hedge no net gain or loss is made by the business. 3.27 This separate treatment requires foreign exchange transactions to be classified as active or passive. Further work is needed to explore whether this distinction can be based around categories used under IFRS accounting standards. Other income 3.28 Some types of income are incidental to the conduct of a business, with amounts involved typically being small: bank interest on the CFC’s account would be one example. Rather than attempting to make a specific definition of “incidental to the business”, such income would be covered by the five percent threshold of the active business test. Financial institutions 3.29 The discussion document raised the issue of whether the offshore interest and other income of financial institutions should be considered to be active or passive. The document recognised that such income, while passive in form, could be derived from an active business. Nevertheless, the document stated that, in the absence of substantial offshore activity for such industries, there was a preference to treat it as passive; that is, to continue to subject it to accrual taxation in New Zealand. 13 3.30 The government’s view continues to be that income earned by financial institutions should be treated as passive. 3.31 Consultations have demonstrated, however, that there are a number of insurance companies with offshore insurance CFCs. This raises the question of whether there should be a specific exception from the general rule for insurance companies. Whether to extend the active income exemption to such companies would depend upon the resolution of a number of difficult areas: • Defining the borderline between active and passive: investments within a CFC could be passive in nature even if the business of the New Zealand parent company were active. • Allocating expenses and income between New Zealand and the CFC. This is particularly difficult for any financial institution owing to the fungibility of money and its simple relocation. • Interest allocation rules: these would need to be developed and extended (for example, to deal with the role of reserves of insurance companies). • Managing the risk to the New Zealand tax base associated with vehicles such as captive insurance companies. Base company income 3.32 A number of countries, including the United States and Australia, have broad base company rules. Base company rules treat certain nominally active income of a CFC as passive in cases where there is a risk that either the income relates to activities conducted in the home jurisdiction or that the CFC has been created to relocate profits into a low-tax jurisdiction. 3.33 In our consultations, many companies expressed the view that, in the New Zealand context, broad base company rules would interfere with normal commercial business arrangements. The government acknowledges this concern. Indeed, it is very difficult to design any base company rules that do not catch some legitimate business in their net. Given this reality, the government proposes that base company rules should apply only where there appears to be a significant risk of tax base erosion and where transfer pricing rules are not applicable or would be especially difficult to apply. 3.34 For the sale of goods, transfer pricing rules are well developed, so base company rules should not apply. This logic extends to the supply of services by the CFC that are related to that sale of goods. Overall, the absence of base company rules for goods means that firms engaged in export and distribution activities will not be subject to such rules. 3.35 Developing the final policy and methods of implementation of base company rules for services requires further consultation. 14 Services provided in the home jurisdiction (Australian approach) Services provided to a related party (United States approach) New Zealand Outside New Zealand 3.36 Internationally, base company rules for services are focused on a number of situations. As shown in figure 3, factors that are relevant in the tests include: • (in Australia) whether the services are provided in the home jurisdiction; or • (in the United States) whether the services are provided to a related party and performed outside the jurisdiction of the CFC. F IGURE 3: Overseas approaches to base company services income 3.37 It is not yet clear how these rules would affect New Zealand businesses. Consider the first test, in which the services are provided to the home jurisdiction. There could be a concern if a CFC provided services back to New Zealand, giving rise to a deduction against the New Zealand income of a New Zealand resident. On the other hand, as with all base company rules, there is a risk that such a rule would catch income relating to a service provided back to New Zealand for legitimate commercial reasons. Overall, the risks in this area seem more pronounced when the New Zealand resident is a related party of the CFC providing the service. 3.38 The second test focuses on whether the service is provided to related parties, although in the US there is no base company income, even for services to related parties, when the service is performed in the jurisdiction of the CFC. Accordingly, another possible rule would be to apply base company rules if the services were performed outside the jurisdiction of the CFC. An example of the latter situation would be the services provided by a communication satellite. The related service, being the transmission of the information, is not performed in any particular location and so the service income related to the satellite could be allocated to New Zealand. 3.39 There could, however, be concerns with this test. For services, the determination of the place that the service is performed may not be concrete, certain, or necessarily confined to a single place. And, again, there is the prospect of catching legitimate commercial arrangements. New Zealand CFC 1 CFC 2 15 3.40 This is an area where further discussion with business is necessary to establish an appropriate approach for base company rules on services. Personal service income 3.41 The discussion to date has focussed on larger, multi-national businesses, although the rules could also be employed by individual taxpayers. In some cases the new rules could undermine the residence taxation of personal income. For example, an individual could use a personal service contract through a CFC to avoid personal tax in New Zealand on income arising from personal effort. This issue will be considered as part of the second stage of consultations. 16 4. MINIMISING COMPLIANCE COSTS 4.1 The discussion document outlined two principal ways that other countries use to implement an active-passive system. The first is the so-called entity approach, which categorises a CFC as active or passive depending upon the characteristics of the company. Once categorised as active, all the CFC’s income is exempt; if it is considered to be passive, all its income is subject to attribution. 4.2 The second approach discussed is the transactional method. This method looks at the transactions of the CFC and determines if they are active or passive; exempting the income associated with the former and taxing the income arising from the latter. 4.3 Most submissions on this issue expressed a preference for an entity approach. They expressed concern that the transactional approach would be very compliance-intensive and would force companies to make complex allocations and calculations to tax small amounts of incidental passive income. Also, there was concern that a transactional approach might involve more compliance costs than the current rules. 4.4 The government shares the private sector’s concerns about a pure transactional method. However, it does not support a pure entity approach either. The entity approaches used in European countries generally have a high tolerance (up to 50 percent) for passive income, which could lead to considerable amounts of passive income escaping New Zealand tax. Moreover, the large amount of passive income that would be allowed could leave room for considerable avoidance activity. 4.5 On the other hand, if the threshold for passive income were reduced from 50 percent to, say, 10 percent, companies that are predominantly active could be taxed as passive, contrary to the policy intent. In addition, much of the apparent simplicity of the entity system may be illusory once it must be applied in complex situations with many CFCs. A simple active business test for passive income 4.6 Instead, the government proposes a hybrid method, which arguably has the advantages of the pure methods, while avoiding or minimising their disadvantages. Under this approach, which would be similar in concept to the Australian method, CFCs would be allowed to earn up to five percent of their gross income from passive sources without triggering the attribution rules. 17 4.7 A five percent threshold may sound low, but in practice is anticipated to be relatively generous. First, using gross, rather than net, income when applying the active business test will make it easier for businesses to pass the test. This is because gross returns on active assets (such as manufacturing plants or distribution/sales facilities) are typically higher than those on passive assets (such as investments in securities) providing comparable net returns. This is as a result of the higher costs associated with generating returns from active assets. So firms that have a mixture of active and passive income would have to hold a significant proportion of passive assets to breach the five percent threshold. 4.8 Second, the Australian experience suggests that limiting the components of passive income is much more important than increasing the threshold in achieving compliance savings. The limited definition of passive income, particularly the absence of base company rules on goods, would simplify the test for most companies. 4.9 Consultation with New Zealand business to date has indicated that the proposed definition of passive income, outlined earlier, should exempt most major New Zealand companies with CFCs from the need to attribute offshore passive income, while also protecting the tax base from substantial erosion from tax minimising strategies using passive income. An advantage of a hybrid approach is that were a predominantly active business to cross the threshold, only its passive income would be taxed as it accrues. The active income would remain exempt from New Zealand tax, consistent with the underlying policy objectives of an active income exemption. Basing the test on the CFC’s books 4.10 Under the active business test none of the income of a CFC will be attributed if the passive income of the CFC is less than five percent. It is expected that very few genuinely active businesses will breach the five percent threshold. However, if they do, it will be necessary for passive income to be calculated under New Zealand tax rules. 4.11 It is proposed to base the active business test on amounts as calculated in the CFC’s books (using IFRS accounting principles). Taking the CFC’s financial statements as the basis for the active business test should minimise compliance costs for businesses determining whether they qualify for the full exemption. 4.12 Australia already adopts a similar approach. Indeed, implementation of the test in New Zealand should be comparatively more straightforward because of the more limited definition of passive income – in particular, the absence of base company rules on goods. 18 4.13 Two general questions might arise in using accounting standards for purposes of the test. • Can the categories of passive income be adequately identified from the accounts? • Are the amounts of income that are measured appropriate given differences in rules – for example, around timing? 4.14 Using financial statements might give rise to some odd results in particular cases. For instance, discrepancies between accounting principles and tax rules may result in CFCs failing the active business test but then having less than five percent passive income to attribute when the tax rules are applied. The opposite result could also happen. This is an inevitable consequence of using the financial statements as a proxy for the purposes of the threshold rule. 4.15 Further work will be undertaken to resolve any issues or difficulties associated with relying on accounting rather than tax principles. Managing the trade-offs between the clear advantages of using financial statements and consistency with the measure of passive income for the purposes of attribution (where applicable) will be the subject of further consultation. Keeping compliance costs to a minimum will be a key objective. 4.16 Another important issue for further exploration and consultation is the possibility of allowing businesses to use a single set of consolidated accounts for CFCs in a given jurisdiction when applying the test. This would allow the test to be applied once in each country, rather than separately for every CFC. This is consistent with the regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions, under which only one set of financial statements, covering a number of companies, is prepared. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission, for example, allows some groups of companies to file consolidated financial statements or provides relief from filing requirements under a financial reporting class order. Dealing with foreign exchange gains and losses for the purposes of the test 4.17 During the consultation process, it was pointed out that unanticipated foreign exchange gains and losses could produce considerable uncertainty in the operation of the active business test. To a certain extent, any active business with foreign currency debt transactions may experience gains or losses from year to year as a result of currency fluctuations. As noted earlier, to the extent that any gains are passive in character, it is appropriate to take them into account as passive income for the purposes of attribution. 4.18 However, the requirement to calculate any foreign exchange gain/loss by reference to fluctuations against the New Zealand dollar (NZD) may affect whether a company passes the active business test in any given year. It may fail the test one year and pass it the next because of fluctuations in the NZD exchange rate, even though the activities of the company and the nature and size of its revenue streams remain constant. 19 4.19 One way of preventing fluctuations in the NZD exchange rate affecting the active business test would be to allow the CFC to calculate foreign exchange gains and losses by reference to its functional currency, rather than the NZD, for the purposes of that test. This result would naturally occur if the test could be based on the books of the CFC, as discussed earlier. 4.20 Calculating foreign exchange gains and losses for the purposes of the active business test by reference to a currency other than the NZD does raise some base maintenance concerns because of the risk that choice of functional currency will be manipulated. This is the reason the rules currently stipulate that NZD must be used as the reference point. It will be necessary to explore how far this risk can be managed through appropriate anti-avoidance rules. The appropriate treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses for the purposes of the active business test will be a subject of further consultation. Attribution under a hybrid approach 4.21 For a CFC that fails the active business test, all its passive income will be taxable as it accrues (that is, not just that passive income that exceeds the five percent allowed under the active business test). Compliance costs can arise in calculating the passive income of the CFC and allocating foreign tax paid and costs to that income. While the later calculation is potentially complex, it is not expected that many firms would have mixed active and passive entities. The detail of the calculation methodology will, in any case, be the subject of further consultation. 20 5. KEY BASE MAINTENANCE ISSUES Replacement of the grey list 5.1 At present, all income earned by CFCs is subject to tax on accrual, except for income earned in eight grey list countries, which is exempt from tax. This exemption applies to both active and passive income because, in contrast to the proposed system, there is no such distinction in the current New Zealand system. 5.2 The grey list exemption is designed to reduce compliance costs. It assumes that the eight grey list countries have comparable tax systems to that of New Zealand. On the assumption of comparable taxation, applying New Zealand taxation would simply impose high compliance costs, with no net New Zealand tax being paid after the granting of foreign tax credits on the income. Should specific provisions lead to a less than comparable level of tax, there is provision for the current grey list exemption not to apply and the income to be taxed. 5.3 With the introduction of an active-passive distinction, the policy considerations “for and against” a grey list change substantially. Under the current system, the exemption depends upon the assumption of comparable taxation, regardless of the nature of the income. Under the proposed active income exemption, the exemption depends upon the nature of the income, regardless of the level of taxation. 5.4 The proposed system involves no taxation of the dividend and allows considerable margin in the application of the interest allocation rules (owing to the 75 percent safe harbour). Accordingly, taxation of passive income, no matter where it occurs, forms a cornerstone in protecting the domestic tax base from tax-eroding strategies. 5.5 Thus, in principle, passive income should be taxed, even if it is earned in a grey list country. 5.6 Submissions gave strong support in favour of retaining the grey list. For taxpayers, it is seen as the simplest way to avoid the compliance burden of proving that a CFC is active. The arguments advanced were essentially those for the current grey list exemption. It was argued that any passive income would be comparably taxed, except perhaps for certain specific provisions in the country. Submissions argued that such provisions could be easily monitored and specific exceptions from the exemption provided. 5.7 For active income there is considerable merit in these arguments. However, for passive income, such arguments are much less compelling. It is not easy to monitor changes in other jurisdictions, where non-taxation of passive income may occur, not just from explicit incentives, but from the architecture of the other country’s tax system. 21 5.8 For instance, the tax systems of different countries have technical differences that can be exploited with arbitrage schemes. Differences in tax treatment of preference shares between New Zealand and countries such as Australia and the US provide examples. Differences may also occur in the classification of entities, such as the treatment of limited partnerships in New Zealand and Australia and the check-the-box rules in the US. 5.9 The concern over compliance costs, however, is a valid one. In response to those concerns, a simplified active business test will be developed to limit the number of CFCs that are required to attribute passive income under New Zealand tax laws. Given that the new rules would apply to CFCs in all countries, they should result in a significant reduction in compliance burden for companies with CFCs in non-grey list jurisdictions. In the future the government expects there to be considerable growth in the number of CFCs in such jurisdictions. 5.10 Other methods of determining when passive income would be taxed have been considered. A number of countries apply tests based upon the nature of the CFC, such as whether it has paid a comparable level of tax or pays out most of its income as dividends. Such tests do not have an explicit grey list. As compared to the proposal, they would generally be more compliance intensive and would be less effective in targeting the exemption to situations where it is appropriate from a policy perspective. 5.11 In any event, it is not simply a question of whether or not to retain the grey list. Any future grey list would need to be supported by specific anti- avoidance rules to deal with existing and future tax minimising strategies. These rules would be complex and at risk of being circumvented by the development of future strategies that avoid their application. Extending interest allocation rules to outbound investment 5.12 The policy case for interest allocation rules is clear. If an exemption is to be given for offshore active income it is necessary to measure it properly. Among other things, this requires a reasonable allocation of interest costs throughout the group to match those costs to the income being earned. Otherwise a disproportionate share of the global interest costs could be allocated against the New Zealand tax base. 5.13 To protect the New Zealand tax base, the government proposes to extend the existing interest allocation rules to companies with CFCs and to remove investments in the CFCs from their New Zealand assets for purposes of calculating their New Zealand debt-to-assets ratio. 5.14 Australia has comprehensive interest allocation rules, and Canada has just announced that it will be denying interest deductions for loans incurred to fund outbound investments earning exempt income. The US has a form of interest allocation rule as part of its foreign tax credit system. Other countries, such as the UK, Denmark and Germany, are currently re- examining their treatment of interest. 22 5.15 It is recognised that, at times, loading debt into New Zealand is likely to be attractive. On the other hand, firms will not always prefer to borrow and take interest deductions in New Zealand rather than offshore. If, for example, income is taxed at a higher rate in the offshore CFC than in New Zealand, it would normally be preferable to borrow and take interest deductions offshore. Even where the tax rate in the offshore CFC is lower than in New Zealand, New Zealand’s full imputation system may provide incentives for New Zealand-owned firms to avoid stacking excessive debt into New Zealand. 5.16 Furthermore, the government recognises that the interest allocation rules will apply to a range of different businesses and industry sectors. Appropriate levels of debt will vary across those sectors. It will therefore be necessary to keep the interest allocation rules relatively loose. Tighter rules, which may be appropriate in some circumstances, would risk unfairly denying interest in others. This is in contrast to the banking sector, where capital is a main input in the structure of a bank and the focus of its regulatory and accounting rules. In that case, it was possible to develop thin capitalisation rules that are closely correlated with the income earning capacity of the bank. 5.17 The discussion document raised the possibility of lowering the 75 percent safe harbour. 3 However, as already noted, a tighter system risks denying interest that should be deductible. Moreover, Australia has a safe harbour of 75 percent. The government therefore proposes to maintain the safe harbour at its current percentage. 5.18 With a 75 percent threshold, a significant percentage of the New Zealand income of a company with either an offshore parent or CFCs is open to be sheltered by interest expenses relating to offshore activity. Figure 4 shows the impact of the 75 percent safe harbour for a company, NZ Co, which has a worldwide debt to assets ratio of 50 percent initially. In this example, NZ Co could move about one-third of its assets offshore to generate exempt income and still not breach the 75 percent safe harbour. As such, a portion of its New Zealand income could be sheltered by interest expenses relating to the offshore investments. 3 Under the current rules, interest deductions for an entire New Zealand group are not challenged if the group debt percentage does not exceed 75 percent (a debt-to-asset ratio of 3:1 for the entire New Zealand group). If this safe harbour is exceeded, interest deductions for the group will be limited to the higher of a debt level consistent with the 75 percent New Zealand group debt percentage or 110 percent of the worldwide group debt percentage. 23 FIGURE 4 : Impact of 75% safe harbour ratio NZ Co EquityDebt $100$100 NZ Co Active CFC EquityDebt $100$100 $66 equity investment (a) Initial - no outbound(b) With outbound NZ OVERSEAS 5.19 Nevertheless, for companies with active businesses offshore, even a relatively generous threshold of 75 percent would offer protection against aggressive tax planning when coupled with the taxation of passive income. 5.20 Therefore interest allocation rules with a 75 percent safe harbour can be seen as providing a basic protection for source taxation, and to buttress rules related to the definition of passive income. The rules would allow some allocation of interest costs from debt related to offshore investments to be deducted against New Zealand-sourced income. This could be of particular benefit to firms newly entering offshore activities if a threshold were part of the package. 5.21 The details of the interest allocation rules will be a subject of further consultation. Other interest allocation design issues 5.22 The discussion document raised a number of concerns relating to the design of the interest allocation rules. Following submissions on these issues, the government has decided not to proceed with a number of the options raised. Worldwide comparison 5.23 The discussion document raised the question of whether it is appropriate to maintain the current ten percent uplift for purposes of the worldwide comparison test for companies that exceed the safe harbour. Following consultations, the government proposes to maintain the worldwide comparison test with the ten percent uplift. 24 On-lending concession 5.24 The government also proposes to maintain the on-lending concession. This concession facilitates a New Zealand company’s movement of debt deductions to the CFC’s jurisdiction, in order to avoid interest denial in New Zealand. 5.25 The on-lending concession allows funds that are lent to CFCs to be removed from the liabilities and assets of the New Zealand company for purposes of the interest allocation rules. This would place the New Zealand company in the same position as if the funds had been borrowed directly by the CFC. 5.26 When financing the establishment or purchase of a CFC, a New Zealand parent has the choice of advancing the funds in the form of equity or debt to the CFC, or often, through a holding company in the jurisdiction of the CFC. The on-lending concession would allow the parent to advance the funds in the form of debt and so reduce the net debt recognised in New Zealand for purposes of the interest allocation rules. 5.27 While the interest payments to the parent would attract withholding tax, it would be normal that there were sufficient margin over the average cost of funds of the parent to absorb the foreign tax credit. Goodwill and the relationship to banking minimum equity rules 5.28 Another technical question raised in the discussion document was to what extent the minimum equity rules for banks should be extended to the non- banking sector. A number of these issues were of particular concern to firms. 5.29 In particular, the possibility that goodwill could be removed from assets for the calculation generated considerable negative comment. Discussions have underlined that the issues for the general business environment are different from those for banks, and that a simple transfer of provisions from the bank rules to the general rules would not make sense. It is recommended not to make an adjustment with respect to goodwill. 5.30 The discussion document also raised the question of whether the foreign tax credit adjustment under the banking interest allocation rules should be extended to the general interest allocation rules. Under the banking rules, a notional amount of foreign assets underlying a foreign tax credit claimed is deducted from New Zealand equity in determining whether there should be a denial of interest. It is not proposed that this adjustment be extended outside the context of the banking rules as it would effectively deny foreign tax credits in situations where this would be inappropriate. 25 5.31 Nevertheless, it may be appropriate to make some adjustments to the general rules based on the banking rules. Two specific adjustments will be developed for consideration in the second round of consultation: • The first adjustment would be to include preference shares issued to New Zealand residents as liabilities for purposes of the interest allocation calculations. Removal of preference shares issued to New Zealand taxpayers follows from the interaction of the imputation system and the interest allocation rules. A company at its interest allocation limit, which wishes to issue debt, the interest on which would be denied, can avoid the denial by issuing a debt-substitute preference share. • The second would be to bring the concept of liabilities used to calculate the worldwide ratio in line with the concept of liabilities used in calculating the debt to assets ratio of the New Zealand entity. Currently, the worldwide ratio includes a variety of non-interest bearing liabilities that, arguably, inflate the worldwide ratio relative to the New Zealand ratio. This disparity can be material for taxpayers who breached the 75 percent safe harbour threshold. Foreign tax credit rules 5.32 The discussion document also raised the issue of whether more extensive changes in the foreign tax credit rules were warranted. The government does not propose to make changes to the foreign tax credit rules. Rather, in our view, the extension of the interest allocation rules to all outbound investments provides general protection against excessive leverage. 5.33 Nevertheless, the issue of whether sufficient costs have been allocated to foreign income in calculating the allowable amount of foreign tax credits does arise in a specific avoidance context. It is possible to make arrangements that give rise to foreign tax credits and interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base when the tax being paid in the foreign jurisdiction does not impose an economic burden on the transaction. This is because the tax is effectively offset against other income of counterparties of the transaction. To counter this possibility, it is proposed to introduce a targeted anti-avoidance rule. The development of this anti-avoidance rule would be a subject of further consultations, but this rule should not affect active businesses. The conduit rules 5.34 The current conduit rules remove the income tax liability of New Zealand companies on foreign income to the extent that the company is owned by non-residents. It is proposed that the conduit rules be repealed. They will become unnecessary in relation to active income once the active income of CFCs becomes generally exempt. The rationale for continuing to provide conduit relief in relation to passive income only is much weaker. To do so would involve material, on-going risk to the tax base.
L\*M IHII Budge Saving and Investing Joint Statement Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue Budget gives $40 a week to support saving It is vital New Zealanders save more so we can better deal with our economic and social challenges, which is why Budget 2007 significantly enhances KiwiSaver. A new system of tax credits and compulsory matching employer contributions will be introduced to encourage more saving and make it even easier for New Zealanders to save through KiwiSaver, the landmark work-based saving scheme. "KiwiSaver gives New Zealanders a helping hand so more of us can start saving earlier in our working lives to avoid a harder savings challenge later in life," said Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne. "The changes we are announcing today will mean more New Zealanders can grow assets beyond the family home which is critical to growing an adequate retirement income to meet their aspirations. "If we are to build a stronger economy and a fairer society we must do more to improve saving habits. "If we save more, we spend less. That will mean less inflation and help to ease pressure on interest rates and the dollar. That's good for workers, good for businesses and good for the economy. "We have one of the poorest saving records in the world. Changing that requires boldness and leadership and that's why the Labour-led government is making saving a centrepiece of Budget 2007. "Budget 2007 supports saving by providing a contribution of up to $40 a week in tax credits - $20 per week for each KiwiSaver and another $20 a week via a tax credit for employer contributions. KiwiSavers • People who save through KiwiSaver will benefit from a new tax credit matching contributions at 100 per cent, up to $20 per week (about $1,040 per year) from 1 July 2007. • In addition, the government is kick-starting KiwiSaver with an initial upfront contribution of $1000 and will be providing an annual fee subsidy. The subsidy has been set at $40 per member, per annum. Employers • Where an employee opts to stay in KiwSaver, or to join it and make contributions, a compulsory employer matching contribution will be phased in over four years starting at one per cent in 2008/09. This will match the minimum employee contribution of four per cent by 2011/12. • Employers will be reimbursed for the cost of matching contributions by the government through a new tax credit capped at $20 per week per worker (about $1,040 per worker per year), and their contributions will also remain tax free under amendments introduced last year. "I am confident the enhanced KiwiSaver scheme will improve our saving record and help us achieve higher sustainable economic growth," said Dr Cullen. "The cost to support greater saving will not compromise our fiscal objectives. The KiwiSaver enhancements are projected to cost an additional $303 million in 2007/08, rising to $1.2 billion in 2010/11. The saving challenge "The OECD recently said household debt in New Zealand had climbed sharply to around 160 per cent of disposable income, higher than most other developed countries. Our official savings rate suggests for every dollar households earn, they spend $1.15 on average. Alternative measures of saving are less negative, but still have an alarming downward trend. A stark reminder of this trend is our persistent current account deficits, currently around 9 per cent of GDP, among the highest in the OECD. "Owning your own home is important for long term financial security. But it is not the only asset families need. Compared to many developed countries, many of us hold too high a proportion of our assets in housing, reflecting our poor level of savings overall. We need to increase saving in financial assets to sustain our lifestyles in retirement. Good for savers "By enhancing KiwiSaver New Zealanders will be able to build up more financial assets, more quickly, so they can have the retirement they deserve. The tax credits will make it easier for many lower and middle-income workers to make the decision to join KiwiSaver. Employer contributions mean workers' savings balances will also grow much more quickly. "KiwiSaver reinforces the benefits of Working for Families in reducing inequalities. It will help more New Zealanders feel wealthier and more secure. "And KiwiSaver also helps many into their first home because you are able to withdraw your own and your employer's contributions as a deposit on a first home after three years. Some first homebuyers will be entitled to additional help from the government of up to $5000 each after five years saving. Good for business "The employer tax credit makes it much easier for employers to provide matching contributions. In the first year it will meet the full cost of the contributions for 95 per cent of the workforce. Overall, the net additional costs to employers by 2011/12 should overall be no more than one per cent of the national wage and salary bill at that point. "KiwiSaver gives businesses more options to reward workers and so assist with the retention and recruitment of skilled staff from within New Zealand and overseas. I am confident it will also help to offset nominal wage increases. "KiwiSaver also makes it much easier for many smaller employers to offer a workplace saving scheme. It is a simple, easy and administratively low cost scheme - contributions are collected through PAYE, on-paid by Inland Revenue to KiwiSaver scheme providers and then deposited in the saver's account. "KiwiSaver will also help deepen our capital markets, which should make it easier for businesses to access capital they need to grow and prosper. Good for the economy "KiwiSaver will help lift economic performance. If we save more, we will no longer need to borrow so much from overseas to finance consumption and business expansion at home. "If we are to own more of our own businesses it is vital we save more. If we are to reduce inflationary pressures and help our businesses prosper without the stress of high interest rates and a high dollar, we must save more. "Active saving policies have worked overseas to strengthen economies like Singapore and Australia where there is now a trillion dollars invested in superannuation funds. In New Zealand there is just $64 billion. "The changes the Labour-led government are announcing today mirror the reform of business taxes also unveiled in Budget 2007. Greater saving coupled with improved investment in innovation and productivity will help make the New Zealand economy much more resilient and flexible. "KiwiSaver is good for workers and their families, good for businesses and good for our future prosperity. It will ensure we can face the challenges of today and tomorrow with much more confidence."

These contributions will not be eligible for the member tax credit. Choice of Scheme S Savers can select their own KiwiSaver scheme and investment products and can change schemes or investment products at any time. •S Savers who do not specify a KiwiSaver scheme are allocated by Inland Revenue to a conservative investment strategy fund with one of six named default KiwiSaver scheme providers. •/ Savers can only have one KiwiSaver scheme at any point in time. Impact on State sector employees •S Like private sector employees, employees in the State sector will be able to opt into KiwiSaver and receive KiwiSaver benefits, such as the member tax credit. S In some circumstances, contributions that State sector employers make to existing superannuation schemes e.g., the State Sector Retirement Savings Scheme (SSRSS), will count towards the required compulsory employer contribution. In these situations, employees will not be eligible for KiwiSaver compulsory employer contributions as well. •/ Although there is no decision to close existing State sector superannuation schemes, over time it is expected that KiwiSaver will become the core saving vehicle. Where do S go for more information? More information is available at www.kiwisaver.govt.nz. The website includes a link to an online tool to help you estimate how much you can save with KiwiSaver. The Sorted website (www.sorted.org.nz) now hosts the "Sort Me" tool - a free online financial check-up that aims to assess just how financially sorted you are. In addition, the online calculator on the Sorted website will be upgraded over the next few days to include the new KiwiSaver features. By late June, your employer will have received copies of the KiwiSaver Employee Information Pack to give you. 3 KiwiSaver Examples 1. Meg and Jack Meg and Jack are 30 years old. They both earn $37,500 per year - a combined household salary of $75,000, which is the average household income for couples. Meg and Jack join KiwiSaver through their respective workplaces on 1 July 2007, and both contribute 4 per cent of their salary. Five years after joining KiwiSaver, Meg and Jack decide to buy a house. As they are both eligible for the KiwiSaver housing deposit subsidy, with the savings they have made through KiwiSaver, they have a total deposit of $35,500 (in today's dollars). When Meg and Jack retire at age 65, they have total accumulated savings of $390,000 (in today's dollars). This is enough to generate them an extra $20,000 to $25,000 a year of gross income during their retirement, over and above what they will receive through New Zealand Superannuation (currently $22,164 per year for a couple). 2. Mike Mike is 50, single and works full time. He has a gross salary of $45,000, which is approximately the average full-time wage. Mike joins KiwiSaver through his workplace on 1 July 2007 and contributes 8 per cent of his gross salary - about $70 per week. When Mike retires at age 65, he has accumulated savings of $110,000 (in today's dollars). This is enough to generate him an extra $8,000 a year of gross income during his retirement, over and above what he will receive through National Superannuation (currently $14,407 per year). 3. Aroha and Robert Aroha and Robert are 30 years old. They both earn $22,500 per year - a combined household salary of $45,000, which is approximately 60 per cent of the average household income for couples. Aroha and Robert join KiwiSaver through their respective workplaces on 1 July 2007, and both contribute 4 per cent of their salary - about $35 per week between them. When Aroha and Robert retire at age 65, they have total accumulated savings of $300,000 (in today's dollars). This is enough to generate them an extra $15,000 to $20,000 a year of gross income during their retirement, over and above what they will receive through New Zealand Superannuation (currently $22,164 per year for a couple). 4 Questions and Answers A. Benefits How do I claim my member tax credit? Your KiwiSaver scheme provider (or complying superannuation fund provider) will make an annual claim to Inland Revenue on your behalf, based on the information it holds of the contributions you have made. Upon receipt of the member tax credit your provider will credit the amount to your KiwiSaver account (or complying superannuation fund). Why do I need to wait until 1 April 2011 for the compulsory employer contribution to reach 4 per cent of my gross salary? To help manage the cost to employers of compulsory matching contributions, particularly for those that are not currently offering work place superannuation schemes, the government has decided that the compulsory matching contributions will be phased in over four years. Will I be able to get the member tax credit and compulsory employer contributions if I am contributing to a non-KiwiSaver scheme? It depends. In order to get the tax credit and compulsory employer contributions, your contributions will have to be made to what is known as a 'complying superannuation fund'. A complying superannuation fund is a section within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Government Actuary as having met certain criteria similar to KiwiSaver (e.g., KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability). Ask your superannuation provider if you are unsure whether your scheme is a complying superannuation fund. What is the amount of the fee subsidy that is being provided? The fee subsidy has been set at $40 per member per year, and will be paid six-monthly into a member's account, with the first payment made on the date on which the $1,000 KiwiSaver kickstart is paid (that is, three months after Inland Revenue receives the first contribution for a person). Being a self-employed person what do I get out of the Budget 2007 announcements? You will be able to join KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. You will receive the $1,000 kickstart and an ongoing fee subsidy of $40 per year. Your personal contributions will also be matched by a tax credit up to a maximum $20 per week (about $1,040 per year) that will be paid directly into your KiwiSaver account. After three years of saving you may be eligible for the first home deposit subsidy. 5 B. Participation Are the same people still allowed to participate in KiwiSaver under the Budget 2007 changes? KiwiSaver remains voluntary. Eligibility to participate in KiwiSaver has not changed under the Budget 2007 announcements. What do I have to do, and when? The KiwiSaver enrolment process and timing has not changed as a result of the Budget 2007 announcements. Full details are available at www. kiwis a ver. go vt. nz Can I join KiwiSaver in addition to my current scheme? If so, can I get the member tax credit and the compulsory employer contributions twice? You can join KiwiSaver as well as be a member of another superannuation scheme. However, you can only get the member tax credit once (up to the cap) on contributions made to a KiwiSaver scheme or a 'complying' superannuation fund (i.e., a superannuation fund that has a section with KiwiSaver-like terms and conditions). If your employer is contributing to your current superannuation scheme, then these contributions may count towards the required compulsory employer matching contributions and they will not be required to make matching contributions to your KiwiSaver scheme as well. C. Contributions How have the Budget 2007 announcements changed the rules for my own contributions to KiwiSaver and my employer's contributions? From 1 April 2008, contributions by employers will become compulsory to the extent that an employee contributes to KiwiSaver (this is phased in from 1 April 2008 to 4 per cent of gross salary by 1 April 2011). Employer contributions will no longer count towards an employee's minimum 4 per cent KiwiSaver contribution (transitional arrangements apply - see below). Do compulsory employer contributions count towards my minimum contribution requirement? From 1 April 2008, employer contributions will no longer count towards an employee's minimum KiwiSaver contribution rate of 4 per cent of gross salary. Transitional arrangements will apply for those employees who join prior to 1 April 2008 and have agreed with their employer to have employer contributions to count towards the minimum contribution rate. 6 With my current super scheme I get an employer contribution above 4 per cent of my salary. Is this going to be cut back (e.g. to 1 per cent in from 1 April 2008)? No, your employer can continue contributing at this higher level to your existing superannuation scheme. Your employer will not be able to reduce their contribution unless the trust deed governing your superannuation scheme allows them to do so. You will need to contact your superannuation provider to determine whether they can. D. Withdrawals When will I be able to withdraw money from my KiwiSaver account? How has this changed under the Budget 2007 announcements? Following the Budget 2007 announcements there are new rules about when you can and can't withdraw the member tax credits you have accumulated. You will be able to withdraw all funds (including the $1,000 kickstart and member tax credits) from your KiwiSaver account: • When you reach the age of eligibility for New Zealand Superannuation, of after five years of membership, whichever is the later; or • In the event of serious illness. You will be able to withdraw all your own contributions and any vested employer contributions (but not the member tax credit) if you: • Permanently emigrate; • Suffer significant financial hardship 3 ; or • Wish to make a deposit on your first home 4 . In addition, the member tax credit will not be able to be withdrawn under mortgage diversion or for making a deposit on your first home. 3 In this circumstance you will not be able to withdraw the $1,000 kickstart. 4 In this circumstance you will not be able to withdraw the $1,000 kickstart. 7
iwi Saver Poua he Oranga Employers - Fact Sheet From 1 April 2008 employers will need to match their employees' contributions to KiwiSaver. The contributions will be phased in over a four year period, starting at 1 per cent of an employee's gross salary and rising to 4 per cent by 1 April 2011. The government will reimburse employers for their contributions to KiwiSaver (or a complying superannuation fund) by providing a matching tax credit up to a maximum of $20 per week ($1,040 per year) per employee. Employer tax credits will be paid to employers through the PAYE system. This will ensure that the tax credit will be paid at the same time the employer contribution is made to minimise cashflow impacts and compliance costs for employers. Employers and others will have the opportunity to comment on these proposals through the usual Select Committee consultation process. KiwiSaver will provide employers with an extra wage bargaining tool and will improve the competitiveness of New Zealand employers in the global labour market. How will it work? Benefits S Employers will be provided with an off-the-shelf superannuation scheme, which provides the efficiency of making employee and employer contributions through the PAYE system. S Employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme (or a complying superannuation fund) are exempt from Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT), subject to a cap - the lesser of the employee's contribution or 4 per cent of the employee's gross salary. •/ NEW All employers contributing to an employee's KiwiSaver scheme (or complying superannuation fund) will be eligible for a matching employer tax credit of up to $20 per week ($1,040 per year) per employee from 1 April 2008. S NEW Employer tax credits will be paid to employers through the PAYE system by offsetting the credit against the employer's contribution and other PAYE liabilities to minimise cashflow impacts and compliance costs. Buddet 2007 1 What employers need to do under KiwiSaver •S NEW From 1 July 2007, employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes will need to be made through Inland Revenue. All other KiwiSaver requirements are unchanged. S NEW From 1 April 2008, employer contributions will no longer be able to count towards the minimum contribution of the employee's 4 per cent of gross salary (transitional rules apply). S NEW From 1 April 2008, employers will be required to match employee contributions to KiwiSaver (or a complying superannuation fund). Compulsory matching will be phased in as follows: From 1 April 2008 1 April 2009 1 April 2010 1 April 2011 Minimum employee contribution (% of gross salary) 4 4 4 4 Minimum employer contribution (% of gross 1 2 3 4 salary) Total employee and employer contributions (% of gross salary) 5 6 7 8 / Compulsory employer contributions must vest in the employee immediately. EMPLOYERS OFFERING AN EXISTING SUPERANNUATION SCHEME The government recognises that non-KiwiSaver employer-sponsored schemes have been in place for some time that incorporate desirable characteristics of KiwiSaver schemes. Arrangements to accommodate these employers and schemes have been made, such as expanding the eligibility to tax credits and allowing employer contributions to count towards employers' compulsory requirement, and will apply in specific circumstances. Eligibiiity for the employer tax credit Employers will be eligible for the tax credit on contributions made to complying superannuation funds. A complying superannuation fund is a section within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Government Actuary as having met certain criteria similar to KiwiSaver, e.g., KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability. This ensures that the employer tax credit applies in respect of contributions towards an employee's long-term retirement savings. 2 CompuSsory employer matching contributions To minimise the impact of compulsory matching employer contributions, the government will allow employer contributions to all non-KiwiSaver schemes 1 to count towards compulsory contributions for: i employers who provide access to a superannuation scheme as of 17 May 2007 ii existing scheme members (ie. members prior to 1 April 2008), or where the employment contract of existing employees (ie. employees prior to 1 April 2008) provides access to the scheme iii existing employment (ie. employment as at 1 April 2008). Contributions that count towards the compulsory amount will vest immediately in the employee. Impact on State sector employers •/ State sector employers will be treated on the same basis as private sector employers: • They will be eligible for the employer tax credits on contributions to KiwiSaver schemes • They will be required to make matching contributions to an employee's KiwiSaver scheme • In some circumstances (outlined in the box above), contributions they make to existing superannuation schemes will count towards the compulsory amount. However, if these contributions are not being paid to a complying fund section within that scheme, they will not be eligible for the employer tax credits. S Over time, KiwiSaver schemes are expected to become the core saving vehicle in the State sector. -t Whether that scheme is a defined contribution, defined benefit, complying or non-complying scheme. 3 Example ABC Company has 30 staff paid between $35,000 and $90,000 per annum (15 at $35,000, 5 at $45,000, 5 at $60,000 and 5 at $90,000). 60 per cent of its staff choose to join KiwiSaver from 1 July 2007 and contribute 4 per cent of their salary each. The direct costs of making these contributions are as follows: Tax year 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 Total wage bill $1,500,000 $1,500,000 $1,500,000 $1,500,000 Matching contributions $9,000 $18,000 $27,000 $36,000 Employer tax credit $9,000 $15,240 $18,720 $18,720 Net cost Zero $2,760 $8,280 $17,280 As % of total wage bill 0 0.2 0.6 1.2 All ABC's employer contributions are also exempt from SSCWT, making it less costly for ABC to provide those of its employees who contribute to KiwiSaver with the same post tax income. Over time, ABC will also be able to trade off its KiwiSaver contributions for slower wage growth. Where do I go for more information? More information is available at www.kiwisaver.govt.nz By the end of May, you will receive copies of the KiwiSaver Employer Guide from Inland Revenue. Questions and Answers What are the benefits of the Budget 2007 announcements to me as an employer? New Zealand's labour markets are tight. Businesses have to compete for high-quality labour, not only from their own domestic competitors, but also internationally. Workplace superannuation is a key feature of the salary packages being offered by many internationally competitive businesses. The Budget 2007 announcements provide for all employers contributing to an employee's KiwiSaver scheme (or complying superannuation fund) to be eligible for a matching employer tax credit of up to $20 per week ($1,040 per year) per employee from 1 April 2008. In general, the employer tax credit will cover the cost to employers of the 1 per cent compulsory contribution in the first year, while allowing employers time to plan for, and negotiate with employees, the increase in employer contributions in subsequent years. Mine is a small business • what are the benefits of the Budget 2007 announcements to me? KiwiSaver provides all New Zealand businesses, regardless of size, with an off-the- shelf superannuation scheme, which can be efficiently administered through the existing PAYE system. KiwiSaver will assist businesses, large and small, in attracting and retaining staff. Increased savings also increase the supply of domestic savings that can be invested in New Zealand businesses, helping local businesses grow. This can be seen in the current depth/extent of funds in Australia, which is commonly attributed to the superannuation savings/contributions of Australians. Why is a compulsory employer contribution being introduced now? Employees and employers alike, have a stake in lifting the savings performance of New Zealand. Increased savings helps employees enjoy a higher standard of living in retirement and also increases the supply of domestic savings that can be invested in New Zealand businesses, helping local businesses grow. The compulsory employer contribution is being phased in over time (1 per cent of an employee's salary and wages from 1 April 2008, rising to 4 per cent by 1 April 2011) to help ease the transition. The government recognises that, over time employer contributions may effectively form part of the wage negotiation process, which will be for employers and employees to mutually agree. How can I have a say on how this policy will be designed? Employers and other interested parties will have the opportunity to comment on the changes relating to compulsory employer matching contributions and employer tax credit through the Select Committee consultation process in coming months. Once the relevant legislation has been referred to Select Committee, the Committee will publicly call for submissions. 5 Employers offering an existing superannuation scheme What are my responsibilities if I am already operating a work-based superannuation scheme? You can continue operating your current work-based superannuation scheme. If your scheme meets certain requirements you can apply to the Government Actuary for an exemption from the KiwiSaver automatic enrolment rules. However, even if you have an exemption from automatic enrolment, you are required to enrol an employee into KiwiSaver and make deductions from the employee's pay if that employee chooses to become a KiwiSaver member. Contributions you make to an existing scheme for existing employees will count towards the compulsory employer matching contributions (further details are outlined on page 2). However, if you wish to receive the employer tax credit you will need to redirect your contributions to a complying superannuation fund under your current superannuation scheme or to a KiwiSaver scheme. Will I be eligible for the employer tax credit if I am contributing on behalf of my employee to a non-KiwiSaver superannuation scheme? It depends. You will be eligible for the employer tax credit if your contributions are going to a complying superannuation fund. 6
Buddet M KiwiSaver Poua he Oranqa Providers of superannuation schemes - Fact sheet The KiwiSaver changes announced in Budget 2007 will encourage higher levels of take up and contributions, which are likely to add significantly to the number of KiwiSaver accounts and level of funds under management. Key policy changes include: • a tax credit for members that matches their contributions into KiwiSaver scheme (or a complying superannuation fund) up to a maximum of $20 per week ($1,040 per year) from 1 July 2007; • phasing in of compulsory matching employer contributions from 1 per cent of an employee's gross salary in 2008/09 to 4 per cent by 2011/12; and • a tax credit for employers that reimburses them for their matching contributions into KiwiSaver (or a complying superannuation fund) up to a maximum of $20 per week per employee ($1,040 per year per employee) from 1 April 2008. How will it work? Benefits S NEW More people will participate in retirement saving and contribution levels will be higher as a result of the tax credits and the compulsory employer matching contributions. S NEW The flow of funds into superannuation schemes and managed funds will grow significantly especially in the initial years following the introduction of KiwiSaver. s NEW Providers will need to deal with fewer inactive accounts because more people are likely to be making regular contributions to KiwiSaver. Becoming a KiwiSaver provider S Superannuation providers wishing to become KiwiSaver providers are required to: • enter into a scheme provider agreement with Inland Revenue (IRD); and • register with the Government Actuary. s The Government Actuary will register a scheme if it meets the requirements set out in Part 4 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. S If a provider wishes to establish a complying fund section within a registered superannuation scheme, they will need to seek approval from the Government Actuary. A complying superannuation fund will be approved if it meets certain criteria similar to those required of KiwiSaver schemes e.g., KiwiSaver lock in and portability. V NEW Members making contributions to a complying fund section within a registered superannuation scheme will be eligible for all the KiwiSaver benefits other than the $1000 KiwiSaver kickstart and fee subsidy. S NEW Employers making contributions to complying superannuation funds will also be eligible for the employer tax credits and the employer contributions will be exempt from Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT), subject to a cap - the lesser of the employee's total contribution or 4 per cent of the employee's salary or wages. S Members making contributions to existing schemes without a complying fund section will not be eligible for any KiwiSaver benefits. S NEW In some circumstances, employer matching contributions to non-complying funds will count towards the compulsory employer matching contributions (refer to the employer factsheet). However, employers will not be eligible for the employer tax credit on these contributions. IRD relationship with providers and employers s IRD will: • collect all contributions to KiwiSaver schemes that are channelled through the tax system and pass them on to providers; • pay the employer tax credits directly to employers using the PAYE system; • check that compulsory employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes are being paid in full; and • be the central agency for recovering all short paid compulsory employer contributions. •s The government will reimburse employees for any short-paid employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes or complying superannuation funds up to $20 per week per employee. IRD will on pay short-paid contributions to an employee's KiwiSaver scheme, or complying superannuation fund provider. IRD will seek to recover any short-payments directly from employers. s Providers will be required to submit an annual return to IRD showing each member's details and the amount of contributions eligible for the member tax credit. 2 Provider relationship with employers and members •s Providers will collect all contributions to complying superannuation funds. •S NEW From 1 April 2008, providers will be required to notify the Government Actuary when compulsory matching employer contributions to complying superannuation funds have not been paid in full. Other regulatory issues S NEW From 1 April 2008, KiwiSaver providers will be required to disclose their approach to responsible investment. A joint working party will be established to recommend options for giving effect to this decision. S NEW Given the increased incentives to join KiwiSaver, the Ministry of Economic Development will be investigating whether current KiwiSaver regulatory arrangements are still appropriate. Any proposed changes will build on existing regulatory arrangements. They will also aim for greater consistency between the regulation of complying funds and KiwiSaver schemes while ensuring, insofar as possible, that complying superannuation funds remain a viable and attractive option for existing schemes. Where do I go for more Information? More information is available at www.kiwisaver.govt.nz Inland Revenue will be emailing providers shortly with information. For more advice, providers can also contact their current KiwiSaver relationship manager at IRD. 3
iwi Saver Poua he Oranga KiwiSaver - General Q&A What impact is KiwiSaver going to have on household saving? It is expected that KiwiSaver will have a significant impact on household saving, although it is difficult to estimate this impact with any great certainty and it will also take time for the effects to be obvious. KiwiSaver's design combines a number of the elements of international saving schemes that have been successful in raising household saving, such as automatic enrolment, lock in and matching contributions (from the employer and government). What impact is KiwiSaver going to have on national saving? It is difficult to estimate with any great certainty the impact KiwiSaver will have on national saving. This depends on how the tax credits will ultimately be funded and the impact it will have on household saving. The government is doing its bit for national saving by continuing to manage its own finances in a fiscally prudent fashion. How are the Budget 2007 changes going to help financial markets in New Zealand? The incentives in KiwiSaver are expected to increase the level of participation and the level of contributions made to superannuation schemes (both for KiwiSaver and complying superannuation funds). This will increase the amount of money invested in superannuation funds and managed funds. Over time, a sustained increase in holdings of financial assets by New Zealand households should help broaden and deepen financial markets in New Zealand. It is likely to enhance financial product innovation and help develop greater quantity and quality of financial services. These should better serve both savers seeking good returns and firms seeking funding. Increased saving will also help diversify people's asset portfolios beyond property investments, thus improving the stability of the financial system through diversification and also the resilience of people's balance sheets. What happens if schemes go bust? KiwiSaver was not introduced as a government-guaranteed scheme and the Budget 2007 announcements have not changed this. Huddet 2007 1 There is already a regulatory system governing the operation of superannuation schemes generally and the KiwiSaver Act, passed last year, brought in additional requirements for KiwiSaver schemes. However, given the added incentives these changes will introduce for people to join existing schemes with KiwiSaver features and to ensure the regulatory requirements for schemes operating in the KiwiSaver environment is sound, the government will be extending some of those additional KiwiSaver requirements to other relevant schemes operating with KiwiSaver type benefits. The government will also look into whether any other additional regulatory requirements need to be put in place by 1 April 2008, or shortly thereafter, to ensure there is the appropriate degree of consumer protection. The regulation of superannuation more broadly has also been included in the current Review of non-bank Financial Products and Providers. Consideration of whether the proposals set out in the Review's discussion document on Collective Investment Schemes (released last year) will require amending as a result of these changes will now be included as part of the Review. For more information about the Review, visit www.med.govt.nz. What's the expected take up rate of KiwiSaver now? Under the original KiwiSaver model, it was expected that by 2016/17 40 per cent of New Zealanders aged 18-65 would be KiwiSaver members, with 30 per cent of this population actively contributing to the scheme. The Budget 2007 announcements increase the incentives both to join KiwiSaver and to actively contribute on an ongoing basis. Under the enhanced KiwiSaver it is expected that 50 per cent of New Zealanders aged 18-65 will be actively contributing to KiwiSaver or a complying superannuation fund. Assumptions around participation in KiwiSaver are difficult to predict. Take up has been estimated on the best information that is currently available, such as overseas evidence and past and current New Zealand experience. However, there is a wide range of plausible participation assumptions and the participation rate is likely to vary across different sub-groups of the labour force. 2
Budget Saving and Investing Hon Peter Dunne Minister of Revenue Fostering a culture of charitable giving Budget 2007 lays the foundation for a stronger culture of charitable giving in New Zealand, Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today. "New Zealanders are generous people. An estimated 1.3 million people take part in voluntary activities, and donations to charities and other non-profit organisations amounted to $356 million - and that's just from the people that claimed tax rebates for their donations. Charitable giving makes an invaluable contribution to our social, cultural, environmental and economic wellbeing. Therefore, Budget 2007 aims to reward and encourage charitable giving by removing the current $1,890 rebate threshold on donations made by individuals and the 5 per cent deduction limit on donations made by companies and Maori authorities. "The change, part of a taxation bill to follow the budget, will mean people and companies can claim rebates and deductions for donations up to the level of their annual net income." It is estimated that this will cost the government around $25 million a year in forgone revenue from 2009/10 ($15 million in 2008/09), or $65 million over four years. A further legislative change will allow unlisted companies with five or fewer shareholders to have access to company deductions for donations. "Charitable giving is not just about removing the rebate limits; it's about making it easier for people to give in both time and money. Introducing a payroll giving scheme is one of these potential measures, but we must ensure it does not raise excessive costs for employers and is simple to administer. "In recognition of the substantial contribution that volunteers make to the community, further work will also be carried out to clarify and streamline the tax treatment of volunteers' reimbursement payments and honoraria. "These changes and possible developments are the direct result of the confidence and supply agreement between United Future and Labour, which called for the development of a new rebate regime for charities and I am delighted that it will be possible for us to make this very significant contribution to the charitable, community and voluntary sectors in New Zealand". Contact: Ted Sheehan, press Secretary, 04 470 6985, 021 638 920 Fact sheet - charitable giving Law changes to the tax rules on charitable giving will remove both the $1,890 rebate threshold on donations made by individuals and the 5% deduction limit on charitable donations made by companies and Maori authorities. The company deduction for charitable donations will be extended to include unlisted companies with five or fewer shareholders. Together, the changes will provide greater incentives for individuals, companies and Maori authorities to donate more to charities and other non-profit organisations, which, in turn, will benefit charities and the communities they serve. The changes will also align the New Zealand tax relief provisions for charitable donations with those offered in other OECD countries such as Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Once enacted, the changes will take effect from 1 April 2008. How will the changes work? Individuals V The $1,890 threshold for which individuals can claim a tax rebate on for cash donations to donee organisations will be removed. V Donors will be able to claim a 33%% tax rebate for donations up to their annual net income. Example Indira donates $3,000 to various charities and other non-profit organisations, including her local church. Her taxable income for the year is $35,000. Under current rules, she would be entitled to a rebate of $630 on her donations. Under the new rules, her rebate claim would be $1,000 (33 1 / 3 % of $3,000), a gain for her of $370. Company deduction for charitable donations V The 5% limit on deductions that companies can claim for cash donations to charitable donations will be removed. V Companies will be entitled to a deduction for donations made to charitable organisations, limited only by the amount of the company's net income. V The company deduction is also being extended to unlisted close companies (companies with five or fewer shareholders). Example Company Ltd is a publicly-listed company. In the 2008/09 income year, its charitable donations amount to $10,000 and its income, before taking into account its donations, was $100,000. Under current law, the company is entitled to a tax deduction of $5000. Under the new rules, the company is entitled to a tax deduction of $10,000 - reducing its net income before tax to $90,000. Maori authority deduction for charitable donations V Maori organisations will be able to claim a tax deduction for cash donations to charitable organisations, limited only by the amount of their net income. V The 5% deduction limit for cash donations made by Maori authorities to charitable organisations and Maori associations (as defined in law) is being removed, in line with the changes to the company deduction limit. The change will operate in exactly the same way as the change to the company deduction. Where to from here? The changes are part of the taxation bill to be introduced following the Budget. Once enacted, they will apply from the 2008/09 income year. Investing in a culture of charitable giving: questions and answers 1. Who was consulted on the proposed tax law changes? The October 2006 discussion document Tax incentives for giving to charities and other non-profit organisations canvassed a range of options for encouraging greater giving to charities and other non-profit organisations and for making it easier to give to these organisations. A series of consultation workshops seeking public opinions on the options was held around the country and attended by 300 participants. We received 229 written submissions, from a wide range of people and organisations including, individual donors, charities and other non-profit organisations, sector advisors, tax specialists, crown entities, and overseas organisations involved in the charitable community. Feedback from consultation supported substantially increasing the current tax relief available for charitable donations and introducing other mechanisms for delivering tax relief such as a payroll giving scheme and tax deductions for non-monetary donations. 2. What are the benefits of the proposed tax law changes? Individuals, companies and Maori authorities will receive greater tax relief for the donations they make. Unlisted companies with five or fewer shareholders will now have access to company deductions for donations. Charities may also benefit from extra funding arising from greater donation amounts received. Removing the $1,890 rebate threshold limit on donations made by individuals will make it easier to introduce other tax mechanisms such as payroll giving, should we choose to do so in the future. 3. Will the process for claiming tax relief for charitable donations change? No. Individuals will continue to claim the rebate for charitable donations in the rebate claim form at the end of the year. Companies and Maori authorities will claim deductions for donations they make in their end of year income tax returns. What else is the government looking at? We are looking at a range of measures aimed at supporting the charitable, community and voluntary sector. These measures include payroll giving, making it possible to claim tax deductions for non-monetary donations such as artworks and other property and clarifying and streamlining the tax treatment of reimbursement payments and honoraria payments to volunteers. What do other countries do to encourage charitable giving? Most OECD countries offer a broader range of tax incentives and mechanisms for encouraging philanthropy and giving than New Zealand does. These include tax incentives for both cash and non-cash donations, payroll giving and special rules for charitable trusts. New Zealand is looking carefully at all the different ways of encouraging giving. What is payroll giving? Payroll giving enables employees to make regular charitable donations from their pay. The employer then forwards these donations either directly to the chosen charity or to an intermediary who then forwards them to a charity. Payroll giving is an efficient, low-cost way for charities to raise funds (compared with fundraising activities) and provides them with the regular income support that they need. For employers, payroll giving provides a low-cost and administratively simple way to support employee engagement in the community while building employee morale and mobilising significant funding and volunteer resources for community benefits. For employees, payroll giving provides a convenient and simple way to give. In particular, a pre-tax payroll giving scheme is tax-effective and eliminates the need to collect receipts or wait until the end of the year to obtain the tax benefit of donations.

Page 1 17 May 2007 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue The Member tax credit and other KiwiSaver related amendments in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Bill The government announced a set of enhancements to KiwiSaver in Budget 2007. They include a tax credit to be paid to members of a KiwiSaver scheme or a complying superannuation fund for their contributions. That change is given effect in the Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Bill, introduced on 17 May 2007. The technical aspects of the member tax credit and other KiwiSaver-related amendments in the bill are explained here. For information on related changes to the KiwiSaver scheme announced in Budget 2007 see the commentary on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Key features of the changes Member tax credit (Clauses 6, 39, 49(2), (3), (5) to (7), (9) and (11), 56, 58, 63, 68, 68 and 69 and 73) From 1 July 2007, people who contribute to a KiwiSaver scheme (or a complying superannuation fund 1 ) will be eligible for a member tax credit that matches the amount of their contribution to the scheme up to $1,042.86 a year ($20 a week). The tax credit will be available to members regardless of their employment status, which means that it will be available to employees, the self-employed and other people who are not employees. Employer contributions do not count for purposes of the member tax credit. The superannuation provider will claim tax credits annually on behalf of individual members. It will be able to be claim the tax credit part-way through the year for those who stop being a member of KiwiSaver or a complying superannuation fund during the year. When it receives the tax credit, the provider will apportion it across the investments the member has subscribed to or been allocated. If the person involved is a member of both a KiwiSaver scheme and a complying superannuation fund (or a member of more than one complying superannuation fund), the amount of the credit will be apportioned between the schemes on the basis of the contributions made to each. 1 A complying superannuation fund is a section within a registered superannuation scheme that has been approved by the Government Actuary as having met certain criteria, such as those relating to KiwiSaver lock-in rules and portability. Page 2 To qualify for the tax credit, a member will have to be between 18 years of age and the age of eligibility for withdrawal under Clause 4(3) of Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. This is the later of: • the date on which the member reaches the New Zealand superannuation qualification age (currently 65); or • the date on which the member has been a member of a KiwiSaver Scheme or complying superannuation fund for five years. Members will be required to have a principal place of residence in New Zealand, unless they are government employees serving overseas or work as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in the regulation made under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. In this case, the trustees of the scheme will have to be reasonably satisfied that the member’s principal place of residence is New Zealand. The tax credit can be withdrawn in the case of serious illness and will be paid to members’ estates upon their death. If members permanently emigrate and withdraw their interest, the nominal value of the tax credit, up to the value of their accumulation in their scheme, will be repaid to the government. The member tax credit cannot be withdrawn to assist with the purchase of a member’s first home, for purposes of significant financial hardship, or to help with mortgage repayments (mortgage diversion). The member tax credit will be treated as excluded income for income tax purposes. For GST purposes, it will be treated as non-taxable grant or subsidy. The bill also makes associated amendments to the definition of “complying fund rules” in the Income Tax Act 2004 and to section 56 of the KiwiSaver Act (Notification of transfers and requirement to transfer funds and information). The purpose of the changes is to ensure that member tax information is transferred when a member transfers to another fund. The bill incorporates the terms relating to the member tax credit into the KiwiSaver and complying superannuation fund trust deeds. The amendment also ensures that the law relating to this tax credit applies despite anything to the contrary in the trust deed. It provides a transitional measure in relation to prospectuses and investment statements issued before 1 July 2007, to ensure that they remain valid as a result of the new member tax credit. It also amends the KiwiSaver Scheme rules in schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act to reflect the member tax credit. Page 3 Employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes (Clauses 64 and 65) It will be mandatory for all employer contributions to a KiwiSaver scheme to be paid through Inland Revenue using the employer monthly schedule process. This requirement is to allow Inland Revenue to police the payment by employers of the proposed compulsory employer contribution. (See commentary on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Provisions) Bill.) The change is being made from 1 July 2007, to minimise compliance costs for employers in having to change systems from 1 April 2008, when the proposed compulsory employer contribution comes into force. Section 94 will be repealed as a result of this requirement. Complying superannuation fund rules (Clauses 49(4), (19) and (20) and 71) The bill amends the definition of “complying fund rules” in the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 35 of the Superannuation Schemes Act, to ensure that the rules for complying superannuation funds apply to superannuation schemes (or sections within schemes) that are defined contribution schemes in nature, as intended. Government employees (Clauses 59, 60, 61 and 62) The bill clarifies how the KiwiSaver Act applies to government employees who are serving outside New Zealand. KiwiSaver will apply to them only if they are employed under New Zealand terms and conditions and if it is lawful to offer KiwiSaver membership in the jurisdiction they are serving in. These employees will be excluded from the automatic enrolment rules. The bill amends the definition of “permanent employees” in section 25 and section 46, to exclude employees who are not subject to the automatic enrolment rules. As a result, employers will be: • eligible to be an exempt employer even though some employees who work overseas are not able to join; • able to choose a KiwiSaver scheme to which all new permanent employees will be allocated, even though some new permanent employees who work overseas are not able to join. Application date The amendments relating to the member tax credit and employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes will come into force on 1 July 2007. The amendments relating to government employees and the complying superannuation rules will come into force on the date of enactment.
Page 1 17 May 2007 A special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Technical amendments to tax rules for portfolio investment entities: how they will work Introduction The Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Bill contains a number of remedial amendments to the recently enacted portfolio investment entity rules. These technical amendments give effect to the policy intent of the portfolio investment entity rules. They provide greater flexibility in implementing the rules, ensure that different commercial arrangements are able to be accommodated, and make technical corrections to the rules. These changes will enable a smooth introduction of KiwiSaver and the portfolio investment entity rules in October 2007. Detailed analysis Calculation of portfolio entity tax liability for an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class The bill amends section HL 20 to ensure that the portfolio entity tax liability is calculated for a portfolio calculation period and a portfolio investor class and each investor in the portfolio investor class. Currently, the portfolio entity tax liability is calculated for a portfolio calculation period and an investor (that is, as being the sum of the portfolio entity tax liability for each portfolio investor class that the investor is a member of). There is no ability for a portfolio tax rate entity to calculate the tax liability for the investor as a member of a portfolio investor class. The new approach will provide the flexibility for portfolio tax rate entities to calculate a tax liability for an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class and apply the investor’s share of the tax credits for the class (both foreign and New Zealand) accordingly. The provisions relating to utilisation of foreign and New Zealand tax credits are also being amended so that credits can be allocated to an investor and used to reduce their liability as a member of a portfolio investor class. This is discussed in more detail below. It is important to note that these changes would not generally prevent a portfolio tax rate entity from applying an investor’s tax credits to reduce the investor’s portfolio entity tax liability across all their classes. That is, in addition to allowing a portfolio investor class-based approach to calculation of tax liabilities and utilisation of credits, the legislation will also support the current approach of allowing an investor’s portfolio entity tax liability to be reduced by all of the investor’s available foreign and New Page 2 Zealand tax credits. The way tax credits can be utilised (especially foreign tax credits) is relevant where a tax liability is triggered when an investor reduces their interest in a portfolio tax rate entity. The approach adopted in the bill is designed to support the different commercial arrangements that a portfolio tax rate entity may have. Payment of tax on switches between portfolio investor classes and partial exits The bill introduces new section HL 23B to allow portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 or HL 23 to make voluntary payments of tax when an investor fully or partially exits a portfolio investor class. This change is designed to allow portfolio tax rate entities to pay tax when an investor switches from one investor class to another within the same entity, and also to accommodate partial exits from a portfolio investor class (this may be a reduction in an investor’s interest in the entity as opposed to a switch to another class). In both cases the legislation does not currently trigger a tax liability. Currently, an investor switching between portfolio investor classes does not trigger a taxable event. This is because, for portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, a taxable event arises mid-period only if there is a so-called “portfolio investor exit period”. A portfolio investor exit period arises when an investor’s portfolio investor interest (defined in the context of their interest in the entity) is less than their portfolio entity tax liability. Therefore, a switch between portfolio investor classes does not trigger a portfolio investor exit period as it does not result in a reduction in an investor’s interest in the entity (that is, a reduction of the interest relating to one class would be offset by an increase in the interest relating to another class). Similarly, a withdrawal from a portfolio investor class does not currently trigger a taxable event if the interest being withdrawn is not sufficiently significant to give rise to a portfolio investor exit period. That is, a taxable event would not be triggered if the remaining interest in the entity exceeds the tax liability that would otherwise arise in respect of the amount withdrawn. This is what is referred to as a partial exit. A portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23 would have the option of treating switches between investor classes as a taxable event under section HL 23B and as a result section HL 7. That is, if an investor withdraws from a portfolio investor class (either completely or partially) and reinvests the funds in another portfolio investor class of the same entity, then the entity can elect to pay the tax for the part of the year before the withdrawal. Similarly, if there is a partial exit from a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, the entity could elect to pay tax in respect of the portion of the interest that was withdrawn. This would include switches between portfolio investor classes that are not complete withdrawals. As the application of section HL 23B is voluntary, a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23 could choose not to pay tax for investors switching between classes or when there are partial exits from a portfolio investor class or the entity as a whole. Page 3 Income allocated by portfolio tax rate entities to partial withdrawals If an entity elects to make optional payments of tax on reductions of investor interests, the portfolio entity tax liability referred to in the proposed section HL 23B will be up to the portfolio tax rate entity to determine. That is, as the payment of tax is voluntary it would be left to the discretion of the entity to calculate the amount of tax payable. In any case, an accurate tax calculation for the investor as a member of a portfolio investor class would be required at the end of a quarter or a tax year. This effectively means that a portfolio tax rate entity would have the option of calculating an investor’s portfolio entity tax liability either in respect of the actual interest that is redeemed, or it can choose to treat the interest being cancelled as a proportion of the investor’s interest in the entity as a whole. In the case of the latter, under section HL 23B the entity would be able to calculate the tax liability in respect of the interest redeemed as a proportionate share of the investor’s tax liability for all portfolio investor classes that the investor has an interest in. An example illustrates: An investor has an interest in Class A and Class B of a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23. On two days the classes derive portfolio investor allocated income and portfolio investor allocated loss as outlined in the table below. At the end of day two the investor redeems 20% of their interest in Class A. The 20% redemption represents a 10% redemption of the investor’s interest in the entity. Class A Class B Day 1 Income = $100 Income = $20 Day 2 Loss = $80 Income = $10 Under the proportionate approach, total income for the investor is $50. Therefore, given the investor redeems 10% of their interest in the portfolio tax rate entity, the entity could pay tax under section HL 23B on $5. Alternatively, the entity could pay tax in relation to the amount actually redeemed. This means that tax could be paid on 20% of income attributable to class A (20% x $20 = $4). Section HL 23B would allow both approaches to calculating the tax liability when there is a partial exit from a portfolio investor class as outlined above. Under the proposed changes to the definition of “portfolio investor exit period” (in particular, paragraph (b) of the definition), a portfolio investor exit period would arise where the portfolio entity tax liability for an investor for a portfolio investor class and any other class exceeds the investor’s portfolio investor interest for the portfolio investor class and any other class. In other words, a portfolio investor exit period would arise where the total accumulated tax liability for the investor exceeds the value of their interest in the entity as a whole. If a portfolio investor exit period arises, section HL 23(2) requires a tax payment, the amount of which is the portfolio entity tax liability of the entity for the portfolio investor exit period – that is, the total accumulated tax liability across all classes. Page 4 Option for a section HL 21 portfolio tax rate entity to pay tax rather than zero-rate when an investor withdraws Under new section HL 23B, if an investor in a portfolio investor class of a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 withdraws their interest in the class or the entity in a quarter, the entity would have the option of paying the tax relating to the quarter in which the exit occurs, rather than zero-rating the withdrawal. If this is the case, then a portfolio investor exit period would not arise and the investor would not need to include any income relating to the quarter in which the withdrawal was made in their tax return. This has the benefit of ensuring that the income relating to the period of the withdrawal remains excluded income of the investor. Again, because the application of section HL 23B would be voluntary, the entity would still have the option to zero-rate the investor. In this case it would be the responsibility of the investor to pay the resulting tax liability. Timing of optional tax payment An optional payment of tax under the proposed section HL 23B would need to be made to Inland Revenue by the end of the month following the month in which the investor switch or partial exit occurred, in the case of an investor in a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23. Optional payments of tax relating to investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 would be due at the same time as the normal quarterly tax payment. Rebates under section KI 1 can also arise on investor switch or partial exit from a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23. The timing for payment of these rebates is the same as would occur if tax was payable. An amendment to section HL 26(2) will be made to provide this rebate mechanism for partial exits. Consequential amendments to the definition of portfolio investor exit period The definition of “portfolio investor exit period” in section OB 1 is being consequentially amended to ensure that it applies generally on a portfolio investor class basis, and is therefore consistent with subpart HL. However, a portfolio investor exit period would continue to arise where there is a reduction in an investor’s interest so that the investor’s total remaining interest in the entity across all classes is less than the tax liability relating to the reduction. For portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 23, this means that they are only required to pay tax for an investor on a part-year basis if there is a portfolio investor exit period. However, as discussed above, these entities can make voluntary payments of tax under section HL 23B when investors partially exit a class or the entity as a whole. Page 5 In the case of investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21, a portfolio investor exit period would not arise if the entity has made a payment of tax under proposed section HL 23B sufficient to meet the relevant portfolio entity tax liability for the investor. This should ensure that any income allocated in the quarter in which the investor withdrew their interest, and on which the entity has paid tax, is still excluded income under section CX 44D. A section HL 7 adjustment As the section HL 23B payment gives rise to a portfolio entity tax liability of the entity, an adjustment under section HL 7 to reflect the liability would be required. The maximum period for making this adjustment is discussed in more detail below. Investor return adjustment in section HL 7 can apply for an investor’s interest in a portfolio investor class or their interest in a different class Section HL 7 is being amended to allow a portfolio tax rate entity to perform an investor return adjustment to reflect the effect of the investor’s portfolio investor rate as a member of a portfolio investor class. Currently, the investor return adjustment must be performed in respect of the investor’s interest in the entity as a whole. It should be noted, however, that a portfolio tax rate entity would still have the flexibility to perform the investor return adjustment to whatever portfolio investor interest of the investor that the entity considers is required. This is because, under the proposed amendment to section HL 7(3), the entity would be able to adjust the investor’s portfolio investor interest in the relevant class, or their interest in another class. This means that a portfolio tax rate entity would be able to adjust an investor’s interest in any way it sees fit to reflect the tax paid. This proposed change, like the proposed changes to section HL 20 and the tax credits provisions (described below), provides greater flexibility for portfolio tax rate entities. Remedial changes to section HL 7(3) will provide that the investor return adjustment is required to be made within two months of the end of the tax year, if the entity has made an election to pay tax under section HL 23. The legislation currently allows the investor return adjustment to be made more frequently than within two months of the end of a calculation period or a tax year (depending on the type of portfolio tax rate entity). Section HL 7(3) specifies the maximum timeframe for making the return adjustment. It is not intended to preclude an entity making adjustments to investor interests earlier, if this is desired from a commercial perspective. Allocation of portfolio investor allocated income to zero-rated portfolio investors aligned with investor’s income year Currently, investors in portfolio tax rate entities that are zero-rated portfolio investors with non-standard balance dates are deemed to derive portfolio investor allocated income (or loss) in an income year, if the relevant income allocation period falls within their income year. Portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under sections HL 21 and HL 23 must operate on a 31 March tax year basis. This could result in zero-rated portfolio investors having to return income for two tax years of the entity, in their income year. Page 6 For example, an investor with a 30 June balance date would need to include all portfolio investor allocated income derived between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2009 in their 2008– 09 tax return. In contrast, the 2008–09 tax year for the portfolio tax rate entity would be from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009. The investor would therefore need to include their share of the income in the entity’s 2009–10 tax year as well (the three months from 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2009). However, income information for the 2009–10 tax year would not be communicated to the investor until 30 June 2010 and would not separately identify the 1 April – 30 June income. The bill amends section CP 1 and section HL 24 so that zero-rated portfolio investors with non-standard balance dates only derive in an income year an amount of portfolio investor allocated income from a portfolio tax rate entity that relates to the portfolio allocation periods in the entity’s income year that end in the investor’s income year. Similarly, zero-rated portfolio investors with non-standard balance dates will only have in an income year an amount of portfolio investor allocated loss, in relation to a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, that relates to the portfolio allocation periods in the entity’s income year that end in the investor’s income year. No portfolio investor allocated loss arises in relation to a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 22. Amendments are also being made to section HL 27 to ensure that the allocation of foreign and New Zealand tax credits matches the allocation of the income for non- standard balance date zero-rated investors. Under the proposed changes, it is intended that the investor in the example above would only be treated as deriving in their 2008–09 income year (that is, the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009) the portfolio investor allocated income or loss that relates to the portfolio tax rate entity’s 2008–09 tax year (that is, 1 April 2008 to 30 March 2009). Any portfolio investor allocated income relating to the period 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2009 would not be included in the investor’s return of income for 2008–09, as this relates to the portfolio tax rate entity’s 2009–10 tax year. Similarly, only the investor’s share of New Zealand and foreign tax credits that relate to the portfolio tax rate entity’s 2008–09 tax year would be available as a credit in the investor’s 2008–09 income year. Foreign tax credits Consistent with the changes to sections HL 20 and HL 7, the bill proposes amendments to section HL 27 so that tax credits (both foreign and New Zealand) are allocated to an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class, and are able to be utilised by a portfolio tax rate entity to reduce the investor’s portfolio entity tax liability relating to the portfolio investor class. In the case of foreign tax credits, depending on whether application of foreign tax credits is restricted to the tax liability of an investor as a member of a specific portfolio investor class or all portfolio investor classes the investor has an interest in, a different tax result may arise. The bill proposes a number of amendments to add greater flexibility in the way that a portfolio tax rate entity (particularly entities that pay tax under section HL 23) can use tax credits. The provisions do not remove current options available under the portfolio investment entity tax rules. Page 7 Foreign tax credits allocated to investors each day Under section HL 27(3), foreign tax credits are allocated for each portfolio allocation period (for example, a day) to each investor as a member of a portfolio investor class. The amount of foreign tax credit allocated is based on the investor’s share (that is, the investor fraction) of the class’s share of the foreign income which gives rise to the credit. Foreign tax credits can only be used by a portfolio tax rate entity to reduce the portfolio entity tax liability of the investor to which they have been allocated. Therefore, a portfolio tax rate entity would need to track foreign tax credits allocated to each investor in a tax year. This is also necessary because an investor who exits a portfolio investor class during the tax year, but re-enters the class in a future period within the same year, should be able to get the benefit of any foreign tax credit not previously used. The distinction between the allocation of foreign tax credits to investors (which will occur daily in most cases), and the ability of a portfolio tax rate entity to use the credits to pay the portfolio entity tax liability in respect of an investor, should be distinguished. The ability for a portfolio tax rate entity to utilise foreign tax credits is given under section HL 27(10). Similarly, if the investor is a zero-rated portfolio investor, section HL 27(7) governs the ability of the investor to utilise foreign tax credits to reduce the tax liability on their portfolio investor allocated income. A number of changes are proposed to these sections. These are discussed in greater detail below. Foreign tax credits can be used to reduce a portfolio entity tax liability for any portfolio investor class of the investor Foreign tax credits allocated to an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class can be used by a portfolio tax rate entity as a credit against income tax payable by the entity for the investor as a member of that class. Under the proposed amendments to section HL 27(10), a portfolio tax rate entity would also be able to use foreign tax credits that have been allocated to the investor as a member of one portfolio investor class, to reduce the portfolio entity tax liability of the investor for another portfolio investor class. Therefore, amended section HL 27(10) gives flexibility to portfolio tax rate entities in the way that they make use of foreign tax credits allocated to investors. If foreign tax credits are able to be used across different portfolio investor classes of the same investor, rather than just to reduce the portfolio entity tax liability of the class that gives rise to the credit, a different tax result will arise. The example below illustrates: Class A Class B Day 1 PETL = $10 (FTC = $5) PETL = $15 (FTC = $10) Day 2 PETL = -$10 (FTC = $0) PETL = $10 (FTC = $0) Page 8 If an entity chooses to utilise foreign tax credits allocated to an investor only against the portfolio entity tax liability of the portfolio investor class which gives rise to the credit, the total portfolio entity tax liability for Class A would be $0 (and no foreign tax credit would be able to be used). For Class B, a liability of $25 with an available credit of only $10 would arise. On the other hand, if the portfolio tax rate entity chooses to utilise the credits available to the investor as a member of both Class A and Class B to reduce the aggregate tax liability for the investor, the liability would be $25, with total available foreign tax credits of $15. In this case, the investor would benefit from having an extra $5 of tax credit. The above result would be an absolute tax difference, rather than a tax timing difference, as any excess foreign tax credits are forfeited at the end of a tax year. In other circumstances, a class approach to utilisation of foreign tax credits may be more beneficial (for example, where the overall entity result for the investor is a loss but they have foreign tax credits allocated to investment classes that are profitable). The legislation will allow both approaches outlined above, to provide greater flexibility to portfolio tax rate entities. New section HL 27(10B) outlines the amount of foreign tax credit that is available to be used in a portfolio calculation period to reduce an investor’s portfolio entity tax liability as a member of the portfolio investor class that gives rise to the credit, or as a member of another portfolio investor class. The amount of the credit is the lesser of available allocated foreign tax credits (excluding credits used in previous calculation periods) and the amount of the investor’s portfolio entity tax liability (again, excluding credits used to meet tax liabilities in previous periods). Foreign tax credits allowed to be carried back to reduce a portfolio entity tax liability of an investor in previous portfolio calculation periods The proposed amendments to section HL 27 ensure that foreign tax credits are able to be used for the benefit of an individual investor in a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23, in a tax year, irrespective of the portfolio calculation period in which they arise. Under the proposed changes, a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 22 or HL 23 would be able to use foreign tax credits to reduce an investor’s portfolio entity tax liability in the portfolio calculation period in which the credit is allocated and earlier portfolio calculation periods in the same tax year. This would effectively allow foreign tax credits allocated to an investor to be carried back (as well as forward) to previous allocation periods in the tax year. This should allow a more consistent income year approach to the utilisation of foreign tax credits by a portfolio tax rate entity, rather than the use of the credits being limited to the day in which they arise and any future period. Any foreign tax credits unable to be used at the end of the tax year would, as at present, be forfeited. Page 9 A broadly similar approach would apply to a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 – the main difference being that foreign tax credits could only be carried back within a portfolio calculation period. Foreign tax credits allocated to zero-rated investors Under proposed changes to section HL 27(7), foreign tax credits that are allocated to investors in a portfolio tax rate entity that are themselves portfolio tax rate entities can be used by these investor entities without restriction. This will allow such investors to flow-through the allocated foreign tax credits to their investors each day. Currently, all zero-rated investors in portfolio tax rate entities are restricted to the lesser of the allocated foreign tax credit or the entity’s share of the portfolio investor allocated income multiplied by the entity’s basic tax rate for the relevant tax year. This would no longer be the case for investors in portfolio tax rate entities that are themselves portfolio tax rate entities. Section HL 27(8) is being amended to deal with foreign tax credits allocated to zero- rated investors that are not portfolio tax rate entities. For these investors the maximum the investor can use in their income year would be the lesser of the amount of the credit that is allocated or: • for an investor with a portfolio investor exit period in a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21, the amount calculated by multiplying the investor’s portfolio investor rate by their portfolio investor allocated income for the exit period; • for a zero-rated portfolio investor in a portfolio tax rate entity that pay tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, the amount calculated by multiplying the basic statutory rate of tax for the investor by their portfolio investor allocated income for the tax year. As noted earlier, amendments are also proposed to align the foreign tax credits allocated in a tax year of the portfolio tax rate entity to the income year of zero-rated investors with non-standard balance dates. New Zealand tax credits Section HL 27(11), which deals with credits other than foreign tax credits under subpart LC, allows New Zealand tax credits to be used by a portfolio tax rate entity in a similar manner to foreign tax credits. That is, the total amount of New Zealand tax credits available would be able to be used for a portfolio entity tax liability in respect of an investor’s interest in a portfolio investor class. This would be relevant in the case of an investor who exits from a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23 or where an entity elects to make optional payments of tax under proposed section HL 23B. An example illustrates: Class A Class B Day 1 PETL = $50 (NZTC = $33) PETL = $20 (NZTC = $0) Day 2 PETL = $50 (NZTC = $0) PETL = $70 (NZTC = $15) Page 10 The investor withdraws 50% of his interest in Class A. The investor’s share of the tax liability for the interest redeemed would be $50. The entity would be able to use the investor’s total allocation of New Zealand tax credits over both classes – that is, $48 (not just the $33 credit relating to Class A) – to reduce this tax liability to $2. As any excess New Zealand tax credits that are allocated to individuals can be rebated, providing this flexibility alters the timing of tax payments rather than the amount of tax paid. The rules do not require an entity to follow the above approach – that is, using New Zealand tax credits allocated to an investor as a member of one portfolio investor class to offset the investor’s portfolio entity tax liability in relation to another portfolio investor class. This is simply another option that would be available to portfolio tax rate entities. As noted earlier, consequential amendments are proposed to align New Zealand tax credits allocated in a tax year of the portfolio tax rate entity to the income year of zero- rated investors with non-standard balance dates. New rules for use of portfolio entity formation loss The bill: • Removes the requirement to reduce the amount of any rebate under section KI 1 or a deduction under section DB 43 in relation to portfolio entity formation losses used in a tax calculation period. Portfolio investor allocated losses will be able to be rebated without restriction and similarly there would be no reduction in the amount of loss allowed as a deduction to zero-rated investors in portfolio tax rate entities. The bill repeals sections KI 1(3) and DB 43(2) to achieve this. • Allows a portfolio tax rate entity to use portfolio entity formation loss without restriction to reduce class net income for a portfolio investor class in a portfolio allocation period, if the total portfolio entity formation loss of the entity is less than 5% of the total market value of the entity’s portfolio entity investments. The bill replaces section HL 28(3) with new section HL 28(3)(a) to achieve this. • Allows a portfolio tax rate entity, whose portfolio entity formation loss exceeds 5% of the entity’s market value, to use on each day of the first three years of the entity’s existence, up to 1/1095 of the total portfolio entity formation loss of the entity to reduce any class net income for a portfolio investor class of the entity on that day. Under this change: – to the extent there is insufficient class net income for a portfolio investor class on a day, the day’s allocation of portfolio entity formation loss can be carried forward and added to the succeeding day’s allocation of portfolio entity formation loss; – if there is an amount of portfolio entity formation loss that has not been used after the end of the three-year period, the total amount of unused portfolio entity formation loss can be used without restriction to reduce class net income for a portfolio investor class and a portfolio allocation period. The bill adds new sections HL 28(4) and (5) which contain the formula for calculating the amount of portfolio entity formation loss that may be allocated to a portfolio allocation period. Page 11 New Zealand tax credits must be used before portfolio entity formation losses Portfolio entity formation losses allocated under new section HL 28(3) cannot be used to reduce the class net income of a portfolio investor class of an entity if sufficient New Zealand tax credits are available in a portfolio allocation period to offset the portfolio entity tax liability that would otherwise arise. New Zealand tax credits are defined as imputation credits, credits for resident withholding tax, dividend withholding payment credits and Māori authority credits. There is no restriction in relation to the use of portfolio entity formation losses where a portfolio investor class has foreign tax credits (that is, credits for foreign NRWT deducted) in an allocation period. Under new sections HL 28(6) and (7), the amount of portfolio entity formation loss allowed to be allocated to a portfolio allocation period is the lesser of: • the maximum allowable portfolio entity formation loss for the allocation period (calculated under section HL 28(4)); or • the amount by which the class net income of a portfolio investor class for the allocation period exceeds the total New Zealand tax credits allocated to the period, grossed up to an amount by dividing by the statutory rate of tax for a company. Clarification that formation losses can be held at the entity or portfolio investor class level While section HL 28 treats portfolio entity formation losses as arising at the entity level, a portfolio tax rate entity can choose for portfolio entity formation losses to be held at a portfolio investor class level. When calculating class taxable income under section HL 19, a class’s shares of a portfolio entity formation loss should be determined. The methodology for determining each class’s share is left to the entity. It therefore follows that the rules would not prevent an entity from dividing the entity’s formation losses between classes on becoming a portfolio tax rate entity. Investor fees to be allowed as a deduction against portfolio entity tax liability for an investor The formula in section HL 20(4) which calculates the portfolio entity tax liability for an investor in a portfolio investor class is being amended to allow certain fees relating to an investor’s portfolio investor interest to be taken into account. That is, a deduction for fees charged to an investor’s account (calculated as the amount of fees multiplied by the portfolio investor rate of the investor) can be used to directly reduce the portfolio entity tax liability of the investor. The fees that would be deductible are those that are charged to the investor for ongoing management and administration services in relation to their portfolio investor interest. These fees would need to be spread over each portfolio allocation period the investor is present in a portfolio investor class. As the fees charged are specific to the investor, section HL 20(4) is the appropriate mechanism to ensure that each investor’s individual fee circumstances are accurately reflected. The formula also takes into account any fee rebates credited to the investor’s account (these rebates would increase the portfolio entity tax liability of the investor, as they would be taxable if paid directly to the investor). Page 12 This change to allow fees to reduce the income tax payable by the entity, on behalf of investors, is designed to prevent investors having to file a tax return to get a deduction separately. Consequently, new section DB 43C is being added to prevent fees charged by portfolio tax rate entities that are included in the portfolio entity tax liability calculation under section HL 20, being deductible separately to the investor. Similarly, new section CX 44E is being added to prevent any fee rebates being separately taxable to the investor. These amounts will be excluded income to the investor. Consequential changes, to reflect the deduction of fees and addition of fees rebates, are also being made to section HL 24, which calculates the portfolio investor allocated income and portfolio investor allocated loss for an investor. Unlisted companies allowed to temporarily qualify as a portfolio listed company New section HL 11B is being introduced to allow certain unlisted companies to temporarily be treated as portfolio listed companies if they meet a number of criteria. These criteria include: • the company would meet paragraph (a) of the definition of “qualifying unit trust” in section OB 1 (if it were a unit trust); and • the company has resolved to become listed on a recognised New Zealand exchange if it were to obtain the required consents; and • the company has applied to the Securities Commission for an exemption to disclose in its prospectus its intention to become a listed company; and • the company satisfies the Commissioner that it would apply to become a listed company if it obtained the required consents. The company must be listed on a recognised exchange within two years from when it first elected to be a portfolio investment entity in order to retain portfolio listed company status. The definition of “portfolio listed company” is being consequentially amended so that a company that is eligible under proposed section HL 11B temporarily qualifies as a portfolio listed company. Foreign investment vehicles will be able to invest through other foreign investment vehicles Section HL 5 is being amended to allow a foreign investment vehicle to own more than 20% of another foreign investment vehicle. This will allow a foreign investment vehicle to hold investments through other foreign investment vehicles. Section HL 5 will also allow foreign investment vehicles to hold their investments through trusts where the foreign investment vehicle is the sole beneficiary. Page 13 Other amendments – Income Tax Act 2004 • Amendments are proposed to various sections of the Income Tax Act 2004 to ensure that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund receives the same treatment as a portfolio investment entity. These include amendments to sections CX 44C(1) and (2) to ensure that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund is not taxed on proceeds from the disposal of shares in New Zealand-resident companies and certain Australian-resident listed companies. • Section CX 44D(3)(a)(i) is being amended to remove the reference to zero-rated portfolio investors as this term is not relevant in relation to portfolio listed companies. The amendment ensures that a natural person, other than a trustee, can elect to treat a distribution from a portfolio listed company as a taxable amount. • Section CX 44D(3)(b) is being amended to provide that distributions from portfolio listed companies are not excluded income to the extent the distributions are fully dividend withholding payment credited. This will ensure that non- resident investors in portfolio listed companies are still subject to non-resident withholding tax on dividends which carry full dividend withholding payment credits. Section NG 1(2)(a) is being consequentially amended to remove a redundant reference. • Section HL 8 is being amended to ensure that only portfolio listed companies must attach full imputation credits (to the extent available) to distributions. The current wording of section HL 8 could be interpreted to include other portfolio investment entities, which were not intended to be covered by the provision. • Section HL 10(2) is being amended to ensure that portfolio investment entities that derive portfolio investor allocated income from investments in other portfolio investment entities and/or distributions from superannuation funds will meet the income type requirement under the eligibility rules. • Sections HL 10(3) and (5) are being amended so that they refer to the market value of the underlying investment held, rather than voting interests, in the case of investments in unit trusts. Before this change, there was an argument that the entity and class shareholding investment requirements could be circumvented for an investment by a portfolio investment entity in a unit trust. • Section HL 10(4) is being amended to remove investments in a life insurer from the exception to the entity shareholding investment requirement for a portfolio investment entity. • Section HL 12 is being amended to ensure that failures to meet the eligibility requirements under section HL 4 are considered when an entity becomes a portfolio investment entity. • Section HL 15 is being amended to allow portfolio tax rate entities that have a portfolio calculation period of a quarter to elect a portfolio allocation period of a month by giving notice to the Commissioner before the start of a tax year or when the entity chooses to become a portfolio tax rate entity. Page 14 • Section HL 16 is being amended to clarify that a portfolio tax rate entity can allocate a portfolio investor interest to an investor for a portfolio allocation period if the investor will have an unconditional entitlement to the interest at the end of a vesting period. The maximum duration of a vesting period, under section HL 16(2)(e)(ii), is also being increased to five years (from three years at present) to align with vesting periods for certain KiwiSaver funds. • Section HL 31 is being amended to require a portfolio investor proxy to provide information to a portfolio investment entity concerning whether the portfolio investor proxy would cause the portfolio investment entity to breach the eligibility criteria. As a consequence of this amendment, section HL 6(1)(a)(ii) is being removed. • Section IG 1(2) is being amended to clarify that the rules for determining which companies are treated as a group of companies do not apply for portfolio tax rate entities, rather than portfolio investment entities generally. In particular, a portfolio listed company can be included in a group of companies. • New section LD 10B is being added to allow a credit to a zero-rated portfolio investor for any income tax paid by a portfolio tax rate entity in relation to the investor’s portfolio investor allocated income. • Sections LD 10(2) and LD 11(2) are being amended to ensure that a taxpayer receives as a tax credit the amount of any income tax actually paid by the portfolio tax rate entity, in relation to an amount of portfolio investor allocated income that is not excluded income under section CX 44D(1)(b) or where the income relates to a portfolio investor exit period under section HL 21(5). • Section NG 1(2)(f) is being amended to ensure that distributions from portfolio tax rate entities to non-residents are not subject to further tax through deduction of non-resident withholding tax. • The definition of “income tax liability” is being amended to include income tax that is calculated under subpart HL for a portfolio tax rate entity. • The definition of “portfolio investor rate” is being amended to allow portfolio tax rate entities to apply an updated rate that the investor has provided before the end of the year and use that rate for amounts that the entity has not yet calculated a liability for the purposes of the rules. • The definition of “portfolio land company” is being amended to clarify that a company is a portfolio land company if the company owns land or shares in a portfolio land company that comprise 90% of the gross assets of the company on 80% or more of the days in the income year in which the company has gross assets of more than $100,000. • The definition of “portfolio tax rate entity” is being amended so that it refers to a portfolio defined benefit fund and not a defined benefit fund. Page 15 • The definition of “prescribed investor rate” is being amended to clarify that the $60,000 threshold in paragraph (b)(ii) is calculated taking into account both an investor’s portfolio investor allocated income and loss. A further clarification to the definition is proposed so that the 0% rate applies if the investor is a portfolio investment entity, other than a portfolio investment entity or superannuation fund which has a trustee that has elected a 33% tax rate. Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 • Section 31B is being amended to ensure that investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21 and have a portfolio investor exit period, are issued with information that the Commissioner considers relevant in respect of the exit period, at the end of the month following the quarter in which the exit period ends. Section 31B is also being amended to provide that portfolio tax rate entities must give a statement to zero-rated portfolio investors on an annual basis only. References to “income year” are also being changed to “tax year” to better align with core provisions. • Section 33A(1)(b) is being amended to ensure that zero-rated portfolio investors (or investors in portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under section HL 21, and have a portfolio investor exit period) receiving small amounts of portfolio investor allocated income do not have to file a return where these amounts, combined with other types of income which have not been correctly taxed at source, is $200 or less. • The return filing date for portfolio tax rate entities and portfolio investor proxies in section 57B is being amended to cater for non-standard balance dates. Amendments to other statutes • Section 53(2) of the Companies Act 1993 is being amended to correct a cross- referencing error. • The Taxation (Savings Investment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 is being amended to ensure that entities can make an election to be a portfolio investment entity from 1 April 2007 (although the date that the election is effective will be on or after 1 October 2007).

### Tax bills to transform saving and investing

Two bills tabled in Parliament today introduce the Business Tax Reform package and the enhancements to KiwiSaver and associated savings reforms announced in Budget 2007.

"The focus of the bills is on transformation – transforming New Zealand's savings culture and transforming the economy through tax reforms to encourage investing," Finance Minister Michael Cullen and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said today.

"Saving and investing are the centrepieces of Budget 2007. The two are closely associated. Expanding savings will strengthen the economy and deepen New Zealand's capital markets, which will provide additional funds for the investment that New Zealand firms need to undertake to lift our sustainable rate of growth.

"The $3.4 billion Business Tax Reform package features a cut in the company tax rate to 30 per cent, which will promote investment, add to productivity and help our businesses to compete globally.

"The new 15 per cent R&D tax credit will encourage businesses to invest more in R&D, which will also help to boost productivity and competitiveness.

"Enhancements made to the KiwiSaver scheme include a member tax credit of up to $20 a week, compulsory matching contributions by employers of up to 4 per cent of employees' gross salary or wages – phased in over four years, and a tax credit for employers of up to $20 a week per employee to reimburse them for their contributions.

"The KiwiSaver changes are designed to boost incentives for people to join the savings scheme and to continue to make contributions throughout their working lives, ensuring that all New Zealanders have a decent standard of living in retirement.

"The bills make associated changes to the way many savings vehicles are taxed, to help people accumulate their savings faster. People who save through entities such as unit trusts and widely held superannuation and group investment funds will benefit from the new 30 per cent tax rate applying to those funds. Similarly, many people who invest in managed funds that elect into the new portfolio investment entity tax rules will benefit from the reduction in the top tax rate from 33 per cent to 30 per cent.

"Other savings measures include technical tax changes to ensure the smooth introduction of KiwiSaver in July and the application of the associated portfolio investment entity rules in October.

"As announced in today's Budget, the proposed legislation provides major tax incentives for charitable giving, which in turn will greatly benefit charitable organisations and the communities they serve. Individuals, companies and Maori authorities will be able to claim rebates and deductions for charitable donations up to the level of their annual net income. Individuals will no longer be restricted by the $1,890 limit for tax rebates, which will encourage extra giving by those who are already donating substantial amounts. For the same reason, the 5 per cent limit for tax deductions for companies and Maori authorities is also being removed.

"A further, major reform in the proposed legislation is the liberalisation of tax penalties, such as the penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position, changes that have been welcomed by all sectors. The result is the relaxation of a whole range of tax penalties, to encourage voluntary compliance. Other changes involve removing certain penalties when voluntary disclosures are made, not penalising taxpayers who occasionally pay late, and updating the definition of 'tax agent'," the Ministers said.

Other major matters in the proposed legislation include:

*   Other changes resulting from the company tax rate cut: transitional changes relating to the imputation credit ratio so that the old 33/67 tax credits-to-cash ratio can be used for another two years in the case of profits that have been taxed at 33 per cent, as well as a number of other transitional and consequential amendments.
*   Adoption of IFRS: changes to the financial arrangement tax rules so that the timing of income and expenditure from financial arrangements follows their accounting treatment when taxpayers use GAAP, as well as consequential changes to the trading stock and R&D expenditure tax rules.
*   Child support data matching: introduction of an information matching system between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service, to allow Inland Revenue to identify when people with outstanding child support debt above a certain threshold enter or leave New Zealand.
*   Annual income tax rates: sets the annual income tax rates for the 2007/08 tax year.
