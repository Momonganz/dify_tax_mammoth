Executive summary Purpose An objective of undertaking the 2013 survey of SME tax compliance costs is to measure the change in these costs since 2004. This report addresses two key questions: 1. Have SME tax compliance costs been reduced since 2004 and/or 2009? If so, by how much? 2. Which aspects of compliance costs have changed more than others: in relation to which revenues and compliance cost components? And for which businesses? This report compares the self-reported tax compliance costs of SMEs provided in the baseline survey of 1,730 small and medium businesses (SMEs) in 2004, the follow-up survey of 1,728 SMEs in 2009 and the second follow-up survey of 1,206 SMEs in 2013/14. However, it should be noted that the results as described in this comparative report are not based upon a longitudinal study of the same businesses’ tax compliance costs over time. Each survey was conducted as an independent study, wherein businesses were randomly sampled on a stratified basis for each survey. As such, the comparisons detailed in this report are based upon three different measures of samples of New Zealand SMEs. Context Successive New Zealand governments have used tax policy and administration to ensure taxpayers meet their tax obligations, in addition to reducing and limiting the costs of compliance for taxpayers. However, it is a given that tax policy and administration changes can operate in the opposite direction as well, by adding compliance costs. Changes in the economy (e.g. those resulting from the recent financial recession), business practices (e.g. the use of third party agents) and circumstances can also affect compliance costs. However, it is believed that changes to tax laws and tax administrative processes can have the most significant impact on compliance costs. Changes to tax laws and administrative processes that have occurred since 2011 include: 2011 Effective April 2011, the reduction of the company tax rate from 33 percent to 28 percent resulted in most companies needing to deduct RWT from dividends. This was expected to have an impact on Business Income Tax administration and increase the amount of time involved for those companies which pay out dividends. In 2011 there was also a streamlining of different entity types, with the elimination of loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) rules and the introduction of ‘flow-through’ or looking through companies (LTC), which was also expected to increased Business Income Tax-related costs. 2012 Of the changes implemented in the Taxation Act 2012, the two that were expected to have the biggest impacts were:  Changes in the record keeping rules, with the expected flow-on to businesses being a decrease in time and costs spent on record keeping, and  The introduction of ESCT/removal of ESCT exemption in relation to KiwiSaver. This was expected to increase the costs associated with administering KiwiSaver initially, but this would be expected to abate over time as businesses made the relevant changes to their internal tax systems. 5 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Other policy administration changes in 2012, expected to decrease tax compliance costs, were the simplification of IR’s website and processes for e-filing GST (eGST), which were anticipated to have an impact on GST-related compliance; and the simplification of the IR10, expected to decrease time and costs spent by self-employed businesses. 2013 In April 2013 a change in relation to the mixed-use asset regime came into effect, which was expected to have an impact on Business Income Tax-related compliance costs for companies with five or fewer employees that have mixed-use assets (e.g. boats, baches). Other potential factors All of the above information has been provided for contextual purposes, as it is not possible to untangle the actual compliance cost effect of these different initiatives; i.e. there is insufficient data to attribute a causative effect of a particular policy/administrative change to any observed changes in the 2013 survey results, when compared with 2004 or 2009. It should also be noted that making a tax ‘easier’, does not necessarily equate with reducing compliance costs. However, we would expect that some of the changes observed in 2013, particularly in relation to the reduction of hours spent on specific tax types, are likely to be in part a result of some of the above changes. The survey was conducted in the latter part of 2013 and early 2014, roughly one year into New Zealand’s economic recovery. However, there is some evidence of the impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on New Zealand businesses. This can be seen in the value SMEs place on their time in 2013, which has not increased significantly compared with the 2009 survey. The GFC’s impact can also be observed in the inflation factors which have been used to adjust the historic 2004 and 2009 micro data to 2013 dollar costs (based on historic economic performance data sourced from Statistics New Zealand; specifically, the Producers Price Index and the Consumers Price Index). Other than what appears to be an impact on the value of owners’ time and inflation rates, as noted above, no data on the GFC’s broader impact on businesses’ practices was factored into the design of the 2009 and 2013 surveys. As such, the impacts and their flow-on effects of the GFC on tax compliance costs have not been taken into account in the approach to analysing the survey data. Neither have any attempts been made to explicitly or implicitly attribute any changes in tax compliance costs over time that are noted in this report as being due to the GFC. To do so without explicit evidence would be conjecture on our part. Similarly, any impacts of the Christchurch earthquakes, and more recently the Seddon earthquakes, have not been taken into account in our analysis or reporting. Methodology This report is based on the compliance costs measured from two paper-based surveys conducted with SMEs in October 2004 and September 2009 respectively, and a mixed methods (online and paper-based) survey of SMEs in late 2013/early 2014, referred to throughout this report as the 2013 survey. Particular care has been taken to ensure the 2013 survey replicated the methodologies used in 2004 and 2009, including sampling parameters. In addition, dollar values associated with reported tax-compliance hours spent as reported in 2004 and 2009 were inflation-adjusted to 2013 dollar values for the purposes of making comparisons with the 2013 survey results. This entailed recalibrating the micro data from the 2004 and 2009 surveys, based upon changes in the Labour Cost Index (LCI) and Producers Price Index (PPI) and recalculating the trimmed means of all hour and dollar-related data. Specific details as to how this was done are described in Section 4 of this report. Table 1.1 below shows the unadjusted and adjusted hourly rates applied to respondents’ time, based upon the personnel type, for the 2004 and 2009 surveys, as well as the hourly rates applied to 2013 survey respondents’ time. 6 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Table 1.1: Value of time; 2004 and 2009, 2004 and 2009 inflation adjusted, and 2013 Personnel 2004 unadjusted value 2004 inflation adjusted value 2009 unadjusted value 2009 inflation adjusted value 2013 Source Owners $43.99 $58.26 $61.12 $66.13 $61.13 SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey respondents Paid employees $20.31 $25.54 $25.39 $27.42 $28.03 Statistics New Zealand QES\* Unpaid family/friends $25.70 $32.31 $33.31 $35.97 $38.69 SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey respondents \*Average hourly rate from the New Zealand Income Survey December 2013 quarter. Some definitions Overall tax compliance costs A simplified version of the definition of compliance costs, as used in this report, is as follows:  Combined compliance cost = hours spent dealing with tax-related activities (converted to internal compliance costs) + external compliance cost + stress (as a measure of psychological cost). Business size by number of employees The following terms are used in this report to categorise business size:  Nil – no employees excluding the business owner  Micro – 1-to-5 employees excluding the business owner  Small – 6 to 9 employees excluding the business owner  Medium – 20 plus employees excluding the business owner. The upper threshold at which a businesses was no longer considered a “medium” SME, and therefore outside of the research’s scope, was 50 employees and/or turnovers of $13.5 million or greater. “All SMEs” Distinction is made between cost figures for all SMEs (as reported in Section 5) and cost figures for businesses that deal with specific taxes, each of which is reported in a different section of the report. “All SMEs” refers to every business in the sample, even though they may not file/pay all taxes (and therefore would have no costs associated with those taxes). This allows for providing the reader a New Zealand-wide view of SME tax compliance costs. Sample profiles for all three years’ survey results (all SMEs, regardless of tax type) can be found in Appendix C. 7 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Findings for all SMEs Changes in SMEs demographic characteristics  An examination of the profiles of 2004, 2009 and 2013 SMEs found that in 2013 a larger proportion of SMEs do not have any employees (64 percent, compared with 57 percent in 2009 and 56 percent in 2004).  More SMEs in 2013 report having been in operation for 10 or more years (51 percent), when compared with 2009 (38 percent), however the number of SMEs reporting this is the case is in line with the 2004 survey findings (46 percent). Overall combined compliance costs Overall combined compliance costs have not changed significantly over the five years since the 2009 study ($5,861 in 2013 compared with $5,962 in 2009). However, they have decreased overall since 2004 by 11.7 percent, from $6,640. There have also been a number of increases and decreases in relation to specific taxes – with the changes by no means being proportional across the different types of cost incurred, size of business and/or type of tax. Some of the most significant changes include:  Overall combined. As noted above, the average combined tax compliance cost has not changed significantly (a 1.7 percent decrease, or reduction of $101 per year per SME), when compared with 2009. However, it has decreased by 11.7 percent, or $779 per year per SME, when compared with 2004.  Source of costs 2009 versus 2013. Despite the lack of significant change in overall combined internal/external costs since 2009, the 2013 survey suggests that there has been some shifting of costs from internal to external sources since 2009. While internal costs have decreased by 12.6 percent since 2009 (a decrease of $543), external costs increased by $332, a 22.0 percent increase since 2009.  Source of costs 2004 versus 2013. While there are no significant differences between 2004 and 2013 external costs (a decrease of only 1.1 percent or $21), internal costs have decreased significantly – down 17.0 percent when comparing those reported in 2004 and those in reported 2013 (a decrease of $774 per SME on average). Components that contribute to a decrease in overall compliance costs  Internal hours spent on tax have reduced by 19.7 percent overall since 2004. While the results also suggest that SMEs are spending fewer internal hours on tax compliance in 2009, the observed decrease is not statistically significant and should therefore be treated as indicative only.  Personnel-specific time spent by owners in particular is down significantly from 2004 (20.8 percent), as well as that spent by employees (down 18.3 percent since 2004). There has also been a decrease in the number of hours reported for unpaid friends and family. However, as those hours do not contribute significantly to overall internal costs, the decrease in unpaid friends and family hours has not contributed significantly to the overall decrease observed.  Shifting of costs. As noted there has been a shifting of costs from internal components (i.e. owners and staff time) to external tax advisors and/or external payroll providers since 2009. Components that contribute to an increase in overall compliance costs  Personnel salary and wages. While the hourly dollar value for owners’ time is less than that reported in 2009, overall hourly dollar values for owners, employees and unpaid friends and family are up significantly when compared to inflation-adjusted 2004 hourly values. For example, the inflation-adjusted hourly rate for owners (whose time is the greatest contributor to overall internal compliance costs) in 2013 is $61.13, compared with $58.32 in 2004 (an overall change of 4.9 percent). The value of employees’ time has risen from $25.54 in 2004 to $28.03 in 2013 (an overall increase of 9.7 percent).  External compliance costs associated with income tax and GST. When compared with the inflation-adjusted external tax costs reported in 2009, external costs in 2013 ($1,842) are significantly higher (up 22.0 percent from $1,510 in 2009). The increase in overall external costs between 2009 and 2013 for all businesses (regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax) are driven by the significant increase in income tax and GST external costs (up 20.8 percent and 51.4 percent respectively). 8 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Changes in internal costs 2004 to 2013  Internal costs have trended downward since the 2004 benchmark from $4,552 in 2004 to $4,321 in 2009. Based on the 2013/14 survey results, mean internal costs decreased a further 12.6 percent to $3,778 between 2009 and 2013 – a total decrease of 17.0 percent since 2004 (in 2013 dollars). However, due to the relevant margins of error associated with the 2009 and 2013 results, the observed 12.6 percent decrease should be treated as indicative only.  The overall 24.1 percent decrease in hours spent by SMEs in relation to Income Tax since 2004 can be attributed to a significant decrease in the number of owner hours, while the 22.5 percent decrease in hours spent on GST is the result of a combination of reductions in both owner and employee hours. 2009 to 2013  Compared with 2009, there have been no significant changes in the number of hours spent on different taxes (reductions or increases), overall or by personnel type. However, in 2013 SMEs spent less time in relation to Income Tax, GST and/or FBT than they would have done in 2004. This suggests that the significant reductions in time spent by all SMEs in relation to those particular taxes between 2004 and 2009 have not been reversed by changes to the tax regime over the last five years. Changes in external compliance costs 2004 to 2013  Overall, external costs (i.e. the cost of external tax advisors) are unchanged since 2004 after adjusting the 2004 costs to 2013 dollars. This is despite the introduction of KiwiSaver since 2004. On average, SMEs paid $1,842 in external tax compliance costs in 2013, compared with $1,863 in 2004. 2009 to 2013  When compared with the inflation-adjusted external tax costs reported in 2009, external costs in 2013 ($1,842) are significantly higher (up 22.0 percent from $1,510 in 2009). The increase in overall external costs between 2009 and 2013 for all businesses (regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax) is driven by the significant increase in Income tax and GST external costs (up 20.8 percent and 51.4 percent respectively). Tables 1.2a and 1.2b overleaf provide details as to the percentage of change in mean compliance costs by component, tax type and number of employees. The first table compares results between 2004 and 2013, and the second table compares 2009 and 2013. Similar tables comparing the actual mean dollar costs for all SMEs in 2013, with the adjusted dollar costs as reported in 2004 and 2009, can be found in Section 5 of this report. Changes in overall stress levels The mean overall stress score (measured on a scale of 1 to 7) associated with meeting all Inland Revenue requirements (ignoring finding the money) in 2013 has decreased significantly from 3.4 in 2004 to 3.0 in 2013. However, when compared with 2009 reported stress levels, the observed decrease from 3.2 is not statistically significant. The proportions of all businesses that rated meeting Inland Revenue requirements as highly stressful (16 percent) 1 , is also down significantly from 2004 (24 percent), with significantly more businesses also reporting low stress (63 percent in 2013, compared with 50 percent in 2004). However, there are no statistically significant differences between reported stress levels in 2013 and 2009. 1 High stress is defined as a score of 5 or higher, while low stress is defined as a score of 3 or lower. 9 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Table 1.2a: Summary of changes in (trimmed) mean compliance costs 2004 to 2013 by component, tax type and by number of employees Change Nil Micro (1-5) Small (6-19) Medium (20+) All A.

However, income-tax costs are still lower than those reported in 2004 ($3,106 after adjusting 2004 costs to 2013 dollars).  The trimmed mean for all internal hours spent on income tax in 2013 (20.5) is in line with those spent by SMEs in 2009 (22.3), but is still down significantly from that reported in 2004 (27.0).  External compliance costs increased by 7.4 percent ($101 dollars on average) since 2009, but the increase is not statistically significant. 2013 external costs ($1,469 on average for businesses who pay/file income tax) are still 10.2 percent lower than those paid by such businesses in 2004 ($1,636 after adjusting 2004 costs to 2013 dollars). GST From 2004 to 2013, changes in mean compliance costs associated with GST for GST filers/payers include:  A significant increase in GST-related external costs since 2009 (reported as being $437 on average in 2013, which is a 44.2 percent increase from $303 in 2009). However, 2013 costs are in line with those reported in 2004 ($443).  A significant decrease in GST-related internal costs since 2004 (reported as being $2,027 on average in 2013, compared with $2,407 in 2004, a 15.8 percent decrease), though 2013 GST-related internal costs are not significantly different from those reported in 2009 ($2,183).  Hours spent on GST in 2013 (37.1 on average) are unchanged from 2009, however, they are down by 22.5 percent from 2004 (47.9). PAYE From 2004 to 2013, the findings in relation to mean compliance costs associated with PAYE for PAYE filers/payers include:  Total PAYE compliance costs ($1,256) remain relatively unchanged from those reported in 2009 ($1,324 after adjusting 2009 costs to 2013 dollars) or 2004 ($1,308).  However, external costs, which comprise a relatively small proportion of PAYE-related compliance costs, have dropped significantly from $115 in 2004 and $97 in 2009 to $29 on average in 2013, a decrease of 74.8 percent since 2004. FBT From 2004 to 2013, changes in mean compliance costs associated with FBT for FBT filers/payers include:  The costs associated with FBT have decreased significantly from both 2009 and 2004. In 2013 the total compliance cost associated with FBT was $219 on average (trimmed means), among FBT-liable businesses, compared with $461 in 2009 (a 52.5 percent reduction) and $354 in 2004 (a 38.1 percent reduction).  Despite businesses reporting a similar number of hours dealing with FBT in 2013 compared with 2009 and 2004, businesses who pay/file FBT reported lower internal costs in 2013 ($197 on average, compared with $245 in 2004 and $346 in 2009).  External costs are also down significantly; reported as being just $19 on average, compared with $100 in 2009 and $134 in 2004. 12 Prepared by: Research New Zealand KiwiSaver From 2009 2 to 2013, changes in mean compliance costs associated with KiwiSaver for SMEs which deal with KiwiSaver include:  On average the total number of hours spent by all businesses on KiwiSaver compliance was 14.9 in 2013, which is in line with 14.5 hours, as reported in the 2009 survey. However, costs associated with KiwiSaver, particularly external costs, are down significantly:  Internal costs in 2013 are $459 on average, compared with $714 in 2009 (a 35.7 percent reduction). The decrease is a reflection of the decreased dollar amounts that owners attached to their time since the 2009 survey.  External costs in 2013 are just $2 on average, compared with $49 in 2009 (a 96.0 percent reduction).  Total KiwiSaver costs in 2013 are $468 on average, compared with $761 in 2009 (a 38.5 percent reduction overall). 2 The KiwiSaver scheme was introduced in 2007 and was therefore included in the survey for the first time in 2009. SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013 13 Prepared by Research New Zealand Section 2. Purpose An objective of undertaking the 2013 survey of tax compliance costs of SMEs is to measure the change in those costs since 2004 and 2009. In 2004 Inland Revenue measured the tax compliance costs of nearly 2000 SMEs and 275 tax agents. 3 These results provided a baseline before the introduction of several initiatives aimed at making tax easier for small businesses (e.g., GST and provisional tax alignment, subsidised payroll intermediaries, a discount for early payment of provisional tax in the first year of business). In 2009 Inland Revenue conducted a second measure of SMEs’ tax compliance costs, 4 using similar methods to those used in 2004. The objectives of the 2009 survey were to assess trends in compliance costs during the preceding five years, and gauge the impact of major initiatives on tax compliance costs such as the introduction of KiwiSaver. Repeating the survey in late 2013 and early 2014 enables Inland Revenue to again assess on-going trends in tax compliance costs to small businesses, which is the focus of this report. The full results of 2013 tax compliance costs for SMEs are reported in a separate companion report – SME Tax Compliance Costs 2013. Evaluation objectives The overarching objective of this study is to provide evidence-based information on the tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized businesses in 2013, and how those costs have changed since the 2004 and 2009 surveys. As with the two previous surveys, the 2013 survey quantifies SMEs compliance costs in terms of hours and dollars spent, and reported stress levels. This report specifically addresses two key questions: 1. Have SME tax compliance costs been reduced since 2004 and/or 2009? If so, by how much? 2. Which aspects of compliance costs have changed more than others, in relation to which revenues and compliance cost components, and for which businesses? Structure of report Section 3 summarises tax changes of recent years aimed at making tax easier for SMEs; and other changes that may impact on tax compliance costs. Section 4 explains the methodology involved in comparing 2004 and 2009 compliance costs with those of 2013. Sections 5-11 record the findings of our analysis of the 2013 survey results, compared with the findings of the 2004 and 2009 surveys, after adjusting 2004 and 2009 dollar costs to 2013 dollars. Generally, the first page or two of each chapter summarises the main points. This is followed by detailed tables. Section 5 records the changes in the overall tax compliance costs for all SMEs, regardless of whether they file/pay a particular tax. Sections 6-10 examine changes in relation to a specific tax, mostly in relation to those SMEs that pay the tax in question. Section 11 provides concluding remarks. 3 Measuring the tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized businesses – a benchmark survey. Final report, 20 June 2005, Colmar Brunton, prepared for Inland Revenue. 4 Inland Revenue, SME Tax compliance costs 2009. Final report, August 2009. 14 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 3. Context Changes in the economy (e.g. those resulting from the recent financial recession), business practices (e.g. the use of third party agents) and circumstances can affect compliance costs, but more pertinently, it is believed that changes to tax laws and tax administrative processes can have the most significant impact on compliance costs. Successive New Zealand governments have used tax policy and administration to ensure taxpayers meet their tax obligations, in addition to reducing and limiting the costs of compliance for taxpayers. However, it is a given that tax changes can operate in the opposite direction as well, by adding compliance costs. Recent changes that may have affected tax compliance costs are detailed in Table 3.2 overleaf. This information has been provided for contextual purposes, as it is not possible to untangle the actual compliance cost effect of these different initiatives (i.e. there is insufficient data to attribute a causative effect of a particular policy/administrative change to any observed changes in the 2004, 2009 or 2013 survey results). It should also be noted that making a tax ‘easier’, does not necessarily equate with reducing compliance costs. That said, we would expect that some of the changes observed, particularly in relation to the reduction of hours spent on specific tax types, are likely in part as a result of some of the changes detailed in Table 3.2. The survey was conducted in the latter part of 2013 and early 2014, roughly one year into New Zealand’s economic recovery. However, there is some evidence of the impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on New Zealand businesses. This can be seen in the value SMEs place on their time in 2013, which has not increased compared with the 2009 survey. The GFC’s impact can also be observed in the inflation factors which have been used to adjust the historic 2004 and 2009 micro data to 2013 dollar costs (based on historic economic performance data sourced from Statistics New Zealand, i.e. the Producers Price Index and the Consumers Price Index), as shown in Table 3.1. Table 3.1: Inflation factors applied to historic data Inflation factor applied to 2004 data in 2009 Inflation factor applied to 2004 data in 2013 Inflation factor applied to 2009 data in 2013 Internal costs\* Owners 18.3% 32.4% 8.2% Employees 14.1% 25.7% 8.0% Friends and family 14.1% 25.7% 8.0% External costs\* 19.2% 30.0% 5.6% \*Internal costs were inflated using relevant the Labour Cost Index (LCI) unadjusted information rates. External costs were inflated based upon the weighted sum of the LCI (Professionals) and the Producers Price Index (PPI) output for Business Services. Specific details as to how the adjustments were arrived at can be found in the next section of the report. Other than what appears to be an impact on the value of owners’ time and inflation rates, as noted above, no data on the GFC’s broader impact on businesses’ practices was factored into the design of the 2009 and 2013 surveys. As such, the impacts and their flow-on effects of the GFC on tax compliance costs have not been taken into account in the approach to analysing the survey data. Neither have any attempts been made to explicitly or implicitly attribute any changes in tax compliance costs over time that are noted in this report as being due to the GFC. To do so without explicit evidence would be conjecture on our part. Similarly, any impacts of the Christchurch earthquakes, and more recently the Seddon earthquakes, have not been taken into account in our analysis or reporting. 15 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Table 3.2: Key tax policy and operational changes since October 2009 which impact compliance costs Policy Description When effective Tax affected Indicative impact on compliance cost Taxation Act 2011 Streamlining of different entity types Removal of LAQCs and introduction of flow through companies (LTC) 1 April 2011 Business Income tax Increase – removal of LAQC : all SMEs LTC: for SMEs that are registered companies with Nil-5 shareholders GST rate change (may have been in a Budget bill) Rate increased from 12.5% to 15%, causing software upgrade and potentially transitional return 1 Oct 2010 GST Increase for all GST registered entities Student Loans Managed Deductions regime IR closely monitors and manages loan deduction codes and requires employers to make changes as needed, to borrower’s codes. 1 April 2012 Student Loans Increase for all employers of Student Loan borrowers Company and personal rate tax cuts Decreasing the company tax rate below 33% now means most companies must deduct RWT from dividends.

They also enabled alignment of GST with provisional tax. SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013 17 Prepared by Research New Zealand Section 4. Measures and methodology The methodologies relating to the 2004, 2009 and 2013 surveys are reported in detail their respective reports. This section deals with the methodological issues relating to the comparison exercise covered specifically by this report. Units of analysis Depending on the question at hand, the analysis will relate to either:  All SMEs  Only those SMEs who file or pay the tax in question. The relevant group is noted in each analysis and as table footnotes. Measure of difference The comparison between the 2004 and 2009 compliance costs and those measured in 2013 is based upon the trimmed mean compliance costs for each year’s survey results, after taking into account the relevant inflation factors. The trimming systematically removes the worst distortions that can result from a few extremely high values and provides results which are more useful for detecting meaningful changes over time than non-trimmed means. As with the 2004 and 2009 surveys, a flexible trimming process was undertaken that allowed for varying percentages of trimming of the data relating to each finding. Details of the trimming can be found in the 2013 SME Tax Compliance Cost report. Trimmed means have been calculated for the following indicators.  Number of hours spent on tax (used to calculate internal $ compliance costs).  Internal compliance costs relating to each tax (all businesses and only those businesses which file/pay a particular tax).  External compliance costs relating to each tax (all businesses and only those businesses which file/pay a particular tax).  Overall combined compliance costs ($): internal compliance costs plus external compliance costs. Combined means versus internal and external means Trimmed means have been used to report the mean compliance costs incurred by businesses. On a business level, combined compliance costs are the sum total of all internal and external costs, as reported by that business and/or their tax agent. Because of flexible trimming undertaken in relation to each finding, and then the averaging of groups of businesses, the sums of individual costs will not necessarily match total costs as reported. Depending upon its relative distance from other values in a particular cost variable’s distribution, extreme costs for each variable have been excluded when calculating that variable’s mean value. Therefore, because trimming is done for the internal, external, and combined costs independently, the combined trimmed cost may not necessarily be the sum of the reported trimmed internal and external costs. That is, none of the individual internal and external trimmed means, as reported, are meant to be additive in relation to any other reported mean result. 18 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Psychological costs Psychological costs, as represented by mean stress scores, based on a 7-point scale, use untrimmed means. This is due to there being minimum and maximum anchors in a 7-point scale, so no wild fluctuations are expected to occur. In relation to stress in dealing with overall tax obligations, respondents were instructed to score their stress levels without taking into account any stress associated with finding the money to pay their overall tax obligations. For stress scores as they relate to individual taxes however, the respondents were asked to include any stress involved in “finding the money” to meet their tax obligations for that tax. Significance testing Statistical tests of significance of observed differences in trimmed means between the 2013/14 survey data and that of the 2004 benchmark and 2009 follow-up surveys have been conducted, using Taylor series linearization. 5 Where a difference has been commented on in the narration, the reader may conclude that the difference as noted is “statistically significant”, unless otherwise noted. Similarly, the reader can assume that any observed differences in trimmed means between current and historic data which have not been commented upon, are not statistically significant. Making 2004 and 2009 data comparable with 2013 data Two aspects were taken into account in relation to ensuring the historic data would be comparable to the new survey data: 1. Ensuring that the sample of businesses was drawn by Inland Revenue using the same parameters as were used in 2004 and 2009. 2. Applying relevant inflation adjustments to the various internal and external cost variables in the 2004 and 2009 data. The following procedures were used to adjust the 2004 and 2009 values to 2013 dollar values: 1. 2004 and 2009 internal cost adjustments. Both the 2004 and 2009 dollar values, as they relate to owners’, employees’, and friends’ and families’ times have been adjusted as follows: a. For owners/directors/partners, an adjustment factor of 32.4 percent has been applied to the 2004 data and a factor of 8.2 percent has been applied to the 2009 data. The relevant inflation adjustments were based upon the unadjusted inflation rates for “Professionals” in the Labour Cost Index (LCI). The unadjusted rate was used as it breaks down the LCI into different occupation groups. 6 b. For employees, as well as friends and family, an adjustment factor of 25.7 percent has been applied to the 2004 data and a factor of 8.0 percent has been applied to the 2009 data, based upon the unadjusted inflation rate for “Clerks” in the LCI. 7 2. The 2004 and 2009 external costs data are adjusted by factors of 30.0 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively. This is based upon the relevant weighted sums of the LCI (Professionals) and the Producers Price Index (PPI) output for “Business Services”. 8 5 When the design of a sample is stratified, as is the case for the SME Tax Compliance Surveys, the Taylor series linearization method combines stratum variance estimates to compute the overall variance estimate. When there are clusters (PSUs) in the sample design, the Taylor series method estimates variance from the variance among those PSUs. 6 The LCI for Professionals in the December 2013 quarter was 1082, with June 2009 Quarter=1,000 being the current base upon which the LCI is based. Back dating the December 2009 Quarter LCI of 1,000 to December 2004 values results in a 2004 index base of 817 (1082-817)/817=32.4 percent, hence the 32.4 percent inflation factor). 7 The LCI for Clerks in the December 2013 quarter was 1080, with June 2009 Quarter=1,000 being the current base upon which the LCI is based. Back dating the December 2009 Quarter LCI of 1,000 to December 2004 values results in a 2004 Index base of 859 (1080-859)/859=25.7 percent, hence the 25.7 percent inflation factor). 8 As advised by Statistics New Zealand, businesses classified as “Business Services” under ANZSIC99 were regrouped into other different categories under ANSIC 2006. For the purposes of back indexing the 2004 data and deriving the PPI component of the external costs adjustment factor, the back-dated PPI indexes for the following groups were used to derive an average inflation factor: CC41 Printing, FF Wholesale Trade, JJ Information Media and Telecommunications, MN Professional and Administrative Services, and RS21 Other Services. 19 Prepared by: Research New Zealand THE PPI was originally included as a component of the external costs inflation factor, as SMEs and/or their tax advisors were asked about the dollar amounts they spent for the different tax types. It has been assumed that the dollar amounts charged also included production costs. Definition of SME The definition of a SME includes lower and upper thresholds, which change over time. The lower thresholds exclude extremely small businesses while the upper one excludes businesses too large to qualify as a SME. As was done in 2009, these have been adjusted to avoid siphoning a proportion of unsuitably small enterprises in 2013, and on the other hand, to include the larger businesses that would have also qualified in 2004. The 2004, 2009 and 2013 thresholds are displayed in Table 4.1 below. Table 4.1: Changes in thresholds of SME definition SME threshold 2004 2009 2013 Criteria for lower threshold: Turnover PAYE deductions $20,000 $3,000 $25,000 $4,000 $30,000 $4,500 Criteria for upper threshold: Turnover PAYE deductions $10 million 50 employees $12.5 million 50 employees $13.5 million 50 employees Value of time When converting internal hours to dollars values, in order to keep the methodology comparable to that used in 2004 and 2009, a combination of Statistics New Zealand data (the Quarterly Employment Survey: December 2013 quarter) and respondent data from the SME Tax Compliance Survey was used. Table 4.2 provides details as to the hourly rates that have been applied to time to convert 2004, 2009 and 2013 hours into dollars. Table 4.2: Value of time; 2004 and 2009, 2004 and 2009 inflation adjusted and 2013 Personnel 2004 unadjusted value 2009 unadjusted value 2004 inflation adjusted value 2009 inflation adjusted value 2013 Source Owners $43.99 $61.12 $58.26 $66.13 $61.13 SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey respondents Paid employees $20.31 $25.39 $25.54 $27.42 $28.03 Statistics New Zealand QES Unpaid family/friends $25.70 $33.31 $32.31 $35.97 $38.69 SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey respondents 20 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Glossary Small and medium businesses (SMEs) – As was done in 2004 and 2009, the definition for SME is based on a combination of turnover and employee numbers. Business size categories are based on employee numbers, which is consistent with the bands as set by Statistics New Zealand to ensure international comparability. 9 Business size categories as used in this report are as follows:  Nil – no employees excluding the business owner  Micro – 1-to-5 employees excluding the business owner  Small – 6 to 9 employees excluding the business owner  Medium – 20 plus employees excluding the business owner. For ease of reading, notations of Nil, Micro, Small and Medium-sized businesses are used to refer to SMEs based on business size. Note that the report uses the terms “SMEs” and “businesses” interchangeably – all meaning SMEs included in the study population. Combined compliance: compliance cost = (internal time + external advisor costs) + psychological costs – (cash flow benefits + tax deductibility). In this study, internal time (hours converted to internal compliance costs), external advisor costs and reported psychological costs (stress levels) were measured. External advisor costs: the dollar value paid by businesses to tax agents and/or external tax advisors. Throughout this report external costs are referred to interchangeably as tax agent and/or third party advisor costs. Psychological costs: Qualitatively measured as self-reported stress, using a 7-point stress level scale where 1=not at all stressful, 4=moderately stressful and 7=extremely stressful. Owner: The term “Owner” has been used throughout this report as shorthand for owner/partner/director/trustee. 9 Ministry of Economic Development, SMEs in New Zealand: Structure and Dynamics, August 2005. SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013 21 Prepared by Research New Zealand Section 5. Changes in tax compliance costs – 2004 to 2013 SME profiles for 2004, 2009 and 2013 An examination of the profiles of 2004, 2009 and 2013 SMEs found that a larger proportion of SMEs in 2013 do not have any employees (64 percent, compared with 57 percent in 2009 and 56 percent in 2004). More SMEs in 2013 report having been in operation for more than 10 years (51 percent), when compared with 2009 (38 percent), however, this proportion is in line with the 2004 survey findings. Overall combined compliance costs This section looks at the difference in average (mean) annual combined compliance costs for all small and medium sized businesses, i.e. their internal and external costs combined. 10 Overall compliance costs have not changed significantly over the five years since the 2009 study ($5,861 in 2013 compared with $5,962 in 2009). However, they have decreased overall since 2004 by 11.7 percent, from $6,640 in inflation adjusted dollars. There have also been a number of increases and decreases – with the changes by no means being proportional across the different types of cost incurred, size of business and/or type of tax paid. Some of the most significant changes are summarised here and in Table 5.1:  Overall combined. Average combined tax compliance costs have not changed significantly since 2009 (a 1.7 percent decrease, or reduction of $101 per year per SME). However, they have decreased by 11.7 percent, or $779 per year per SME, since 2004.  Source of costs 2009 versus 2013. Despite the lack of significant change in overall combined internal/external costs since 2009, the 2013 survey suggests that there has been some shifting of costs from internal to external sources since 2009. While internal costs decreased by 12.6 percent since 2009 (a decrease of $543), external costs increased by $332, a 22.0 percent increase since 2009.  Source of costs 2004 versus 2013. While there are no significant differences between 2004 and 2013 external costs (a decrease of only 1.1 percent or $21), internal costs have decreased significantly, however – down 17.0 percent when comparing those reported in 2004 (a decrease of $774 per SME on average). Table 5.1: Overall change in internal and external costs since 2004 and 2009 2004 to 2013 2009 to 2013 Internal -$774 -17.0% -$543 -12.6% External -$21 -1.1% $332 22.0% 10 It is important to stress that this chapter records the average compliance costs for all taxes for all SMEs in New Zealand even though they many not pay all taxes. In subsequent chapters, the actual costs discussed are restricted to those SMEs who have the tax obligation in question. 22 Prepared by: Research New Zealand To understand in more detail the overall change in compliance costs, components that contribute to and influence the direction of change are listed below. In relation to this, note that although these components are highlighted individually, they do not affect the overall costs independently of each other, i.e. they overlap to some extent. Components that contribute to a decrease in compliance costs  Internal costs have trended downward since the 2004 benchmark from $4,552 in 2004 to $4,321 in 2009. Based on the 2013/14 survey results, mean internal costs decreased a further 12.6 percent to $3,778 between 2009 and 2013 – a total decrease of 17.0 percent since 2004 (in 2013 dollars). However, due to the relevant margins of error associated with the 2009 and 2013 results, the observed 12.6 percent decrease should be treated as indicative only.  Personnel time spent by owners in particular is down significantly since 2004 (20.8 percent), as well as that spent by employees (down 18.3 percent since 2004). There has also been a decrease in the number of hours reported for unpaid friends and family. However, as those hours do not contribute significantly to overall internal costs, the decrease in unpaid friends and family hours has not contributed significantly to the overall decrease.  Shifting of costs. There has been a shifting of costs from internal components (i.e. owners and staff time) to external tax advisors and/or external payroll providers, since 2009, however the ratios of internal and external costs as a proportion of combined costs in 2013, are similar to those observed in 2004. Components that contribute to an increase in compliance costs  Personnel salary and wages. While the mean hourly dollar value for owners is less than that reported in 2009, overall hourly dollar values for owners, employees and unpaid friends and family are up significantly when compared to inflation-adjusted 2004 hourly values. For example, the inflation-adjusted hourly rate for owners (whose time is the greatest contributor to overall internal compliance costs) in 2013 is $61.13, compared with $58.26 in 2004 (an overall change of 8.6 percent); while the mean hourly value of employees’ time has risen from $25.54 in 2004 to $28.03 in 2013 (an overall increase of 12.0 percent).  External compliance costs associated with income tax and GST. When compared with the inflation-adjusted external tax costs reported in 2009, external costs in 2013 ($1,842) are significantly higher (up 22.0 percent from $1,510 in 2009). This increase in overall external costs between 2009 and 2013 for all businesses (regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax) is driven primarily by the significant increase in income tax and GST-related external costs (up 20.8 percent and 51.4 percent respectively). 23 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Table 5.2: Summary of changes in mean annual compliance costs for all SME business, 2004 to 2013 Personnel 2004 2009 2013 $ change since 2004 $ change since 2009 % change since 2004 % change since 2009 Overall combined $6,640 $5,962 $5,861 -$779 -$101 -11.7% -1.7% Internal $4,552 $4,321 $3,778 -$774 -$543 -17.0% -12.6% External $1,863 $1,510 $1,842 -$21 $332 -1.1% 22.0% Number of employees Nil $5,083 $4,435 $4,534 -$549 $99 -10.8% 2.2% Micro (1-5) $7,924 $7,188 $7,378 -$546 $190 -6.9% 2.6% Small (6-19) $10,096 $10,191 $9,922 -$174 -$269 -1.7% -2.6% Medium (20+) $11,687 $10,120 $12,512 $825 $2,392 7.1% 23.6% Turnover Less than $40,000 $6,036 $4,003 $3,619 -$2,417 -$384 -40.0% -9.6% $40,000 to less than $100,000 $4,962 $4,913 $4,135 -$827 -$778 -16.7% -15.8% $100,000 to less than $250,000 $6,673 $6,337 $5,793 -$880 -$544 -13.2% -8.6% $250,000 to less than $500,000 $7,745 $6,719 $6,476 -$1,269 -$243 -16.4% -3.6% $500,000 to less than 1.3 million $9,206 $8,226 $8,657 -$549 $431 -6.0% 5.2% $1.3 million to less than $5 million $10,016 $9,116 $11,160 $1,144 $2,044 11.4% 22.4% $5 million and over $12,938 $9,593 $11,449 -$1,489 $1,856 -11.5% 19.3% Base: All respondents regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax type (excluding outliers). SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013 24 Prepared by Research New Zealand Internal compliance costs and hours spent on taxes As noted above, internal costs have trended downward since the 2004 benchmark from $4,552 in 2004 to $4,321 in 2009. Based on the 2013/14 survey results, mean internal costs decreased a further 12.6 percent to $3,778 between 2009 and 2013 – a total decrease of 17.0 percent since 2004 (in 2013 dollars). Changes in internal compliance costs since 2004 have been driven by a number of factors, some of which have decreased while others have increased. There has been a downward trend in the number of internal hours spent per annum, with the most marked decrease being hours spent by owners between 2004 and 2009 (down from 66.3 to 55.0 hours). While the average (trimmed) number of hours in 2013 (52.5 hours) is not down significantly from 2009, it is still significantly lower than that reported by owners in 2004. Smaller decreases in reported numbers of hours can also be observed among both employees and unpaid friends and family since 2004 (Figure 5.1 below and Tables 5.3a and 5.3b overleaf). However, the observed variances in the hours reported for employees and unpaid friends/family reported in 2009 versus 2013 are not statistically significant. In contrast, there has been a general increase in the hourly dollar value for owners, employees and unpaid family and friends over time, even after adjusting for inflation (Figure 5.1, see also Table 4.2 in previous section). For example, the value per hour of unpaid family and friends has increased from $32.31 in 2004 to $35.97 in 2009 and to $38.69 in 2013, a 19.7 percent increase overall since 2004. The value of employees’ time has risen from $25.54 per hour in 2004 to $28.03 in 2013, a 9.7 percent increase overall. 11 Figure 5.1: Changes in total compliance hours spent and changes in $ values of those hours – 2004 to 2013 Base: All respondents, regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax type (excluding outliers). Note: 2004 and 2009 dollar values have been recalibrated to 2013 values to take into account changes in inflation. 11 Sources for $ value of employees’ time are sourced from Statistics New Zealand’s Quarterly Employment Survey. The values of time for unpaid family and friends, as well as that of owners, are based upon survey data. 66.3 55.0 52.5 20.2 18.3 16.5 4.4 2.8 2.3 $58.26 $66.13 $61.13 $25.54 $27.42 $28.03 $32.31 $35.97 $38.69 0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 $0.00 $10.00 $20.00 $30.00 $40.00 $50.00 $60.00 $70.00 200420092013 Internal compliance cost in hours Hourly $ Value Owners hoursPaid employees hoursUnpaid family/friends hours Owners $ (hourly)Paid Employees ($ hourly)Unpaid family/friends ($ hourly) 25 Prepared by: Research New Zealand The value that owners attach to an hour of their time has been more volatile, with a marked increase of 13.5 percent from $58.26 in 2004 to $66.13 in 2009, but dropping downward by 7.6 percent in 2013 to $61.13. However, the mean hourly value for owners’ time in 2013 is still up 4.9 percent overall from that reported in 2004. In relation to this point, it is interesting to note that in 2009, New Zealand was just one year into the global recession. However, whether or not the downward adjustment in self-reported value of times by owners can be solely attributed to the GFC or some other factor cannot be known for certain from the survey data. Changes in hours spent by business size When viewed by all SMEs, the total hours spent on tax compliance activities between 2004 and 2009 decreased significantly from 93.3 hours in 2004 to 77.0 hours in 2009 (a 17.4 percent decrease overall). There is a relationship, however, between the size of the business and the mean number of hours spent internally on tax compliance activities. As observed in the 2004 and 2009 surveys, larger businesses tend to spend more hours internally on tax-related activities. Figure 5.2 below illustrates the changes in mean total hours spent on tax per annum by businesses between 2004 and 2013, broken down by business size. Notably, the total number of hours reported in 2009 versus 2013 is relatively unchanged (a decrease of only 2.1 hours from 77.0 to 74.9 hours, which is not statistically significant). This indicates that while the total hours spent on tax compliance by SMEs declined significantly between 2004 and 2009, they have not changed significantly between 2009 and 2013. Figure 5.2: Changes in total compliance hours spent by business size – 2004 to 2013 All respondents, regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax type (excluding outliers). 26 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Changes in hours spent by personnel As evidenced previously in Figure 5.1, owners’ time comprises the bulk of hours spent internally by SMEs on tax (roughly 70 percent in 2013, or 52.5 hours per annum on average), compared with relatively fewer hours spent by others (16.5 hours by SME employees, and just 2.3 hours among unpaid friends and family). When compared with the hours reported in the 2004 benchmark survey, however, total hours spent by SMEs have decreased significantly from an average of 93.3 in 2004 to 74.9 hours in 2013, an overall decrease of 19.7 percent (Figure 5.3 and Table 5.3b). This change has been driven primarily by the decrease in hours spent on tax by owners. In 2013 the average (trimmed mean) hours spent by owners was 52.5, compared with 66.3 hours in 2004, down by 20.8 percent. However, it should be noted that the bulk of this decrease occurred between 2004 and 2009 (total hours reported in 2009 by SMEs was 77.0 on average). When the hours spent on tax by different personnel in 2009 are compared with those reported in 2013, significance testing shows that none of the observed decreases are statistically significant. This suggests that there has not been a meaningful saving in the number of hours expended by SMEs over the last five years. Figure 5.3: Changes in total compliance hours spent by business size – 2004 to 2013 All respondents, regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax type (excluding outliers). 27 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Changes in hours by tax type Compared with 2009, there have been no significant changes in the number hours spent on different taxes (reductions or increases), overall or by personnel type (Figure 5.4 and Table 5.4a). However, when compared with the number of hours SMEs spent dealing with different taxes in 2004:  In 2013, all SMEs spend 24.1 percent less time internally dealing with income tax (20.5 hours on average, compared with 27.0 in 2004). This change can be attributed mostly to the significant decrease in the number of hours owners report spending in relation to the tax (16.3 hours on average, compared with 23.3 hours in 2004, a 30.0 percent decrease).  In 2013, SMEs also spend less time internally dealing with GST (37.1 hours on average, compared with 47.9 hours in 2004, a decrease of 22.5 percent). This change can be attributed mostly to changes in both the number of hours being spent by owners in relation to GST (down 21.6 percent from 35.7 hours on average in 2004 to 28 hours in 2013), as well as the hours spent by their employees (down 35.0 percent from 10.3 hours in 2004 on average to 6.7 hours in 2013). Figure 5.4: Changes in total compliance hours spent by business size – tax type All respondents, regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax type (excluding outliers). SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013 28 Prepared by Research New Zealand External compliance costs Overall, external costs, i.e. the cost of external tax advisors, are unchanged since 2004 after adjusting the 2004 costs to 2013 dollars. This is despite the introduction of KiwiSaver since 2004. On average, SMEs paid $1,842 in external tax compliance costs in 2013. What this means is that the significant reductions in relation to external costs, as observed between 2004 and 2009 have not been maintained over the last five years. For example, when compared with the inflation-adjusted external tax costs reported in 2009, external costs in 2013 ($1,842) are significantly higher (up 22.0 percent from $1,510 in 2009). This increase in overall external costs between 2009 and 2013 for all businesses (regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax) is driven by the significant increases income tax and GST-related external costs (up 20.8 percent and 51.4 percent respectively). Due to the relatively smaller sub-sample sizes, there were no statistically significant differences in relation to external costs between 2004 and 2013 when viewed by business size. Therefore, please note that any variances by year and business size in Tables 5.5a and 5.5b should be treated as indicative only and interpreted with caution. Figure 5.5: Changes in external costs by tax type All respondents, regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax type (excluding outliers). Overall mean stress score The mean overall stress score associated with meeting all Inland Revenue requirements (ignoring finding the money) in 2013 has decreased significantly from 3.4 in 2004 to 3.0 in 2013 (Table 5.6). However, when compared with 2009 reported stress levels, the observed decrease from 3.2 is not statistically significant. The proportions of all businesses that rated meeting Inland Revenue requirements as highly stressful (16 percent) is also down significantly from 2004 (24 percent), with significantly more businesses also reporting low stress (63 percent in 2013, compared with 50 percent in 2004) (Table 5.7). The reported mean overall stress levels for businesses with no employees in 2013 (2.9) is significantly lower than that reported by similar sized businesses in 2004 (3.3). Businesses with 1-to-5 employees also reported lower mean stress levels in 2013 (3.3, down from 3.6). While the results also suggest that small and medium businesses reported lower stress levels as well, the observed differences in Tables 5.6 and 5.7 are not statistically significant, due to the small sample sizes for those two size groups. There are no significant differences between reported stress levels in 2013 and those reported in 2009.

Income tax SMEs that pay income tax Ninety-six percent of businesses in the survey reported paying income tax in 2013, which is comparable to 97 percent in 2004 and 95 percent in 2009. Of those businesses that reported paying income tax, 79 percent also had external income tax compliance costs. 12 This is comparable with the 72 percent reported in 2004 and up from 68 percent in 2009. In 2013, significantly more SMEs that pay income tax report having no employees (65 percent, compared with 56 percent in both 2004 and 2009). SMEs that pay income tax in 2013 are also more likely to report having been in business for more than 10 years than was the case in 2009 (50 percent, compared with 39 percent of income tax-liable SMEs in 2009). However, the 2013 result is in line with the 2004 study (47 percent). The number of income tax-liable SMEs paying FBT has declined significantly to nine percent in 2013 (compared with 12 percent in 2009 and 25 percent in 2004). Fewer income tax-liable SMEs also reported paying GST (87 percent, down from 93 percent in 2009 and 94 percent in 2004). Key findings – Income tax From 2004 to 2013, changes in average compliance costs associated with income tax filers/payers include:  An overall increase of 9.8 percent in combined internal/external costs since 2009 ($2,881 in 2013, compared with $2,624 in 2009). However, income tax-liable SMEs’ overall income tax compliance costs in 2013 are still lower than those reported in 2004 ($3,106 after adjusting 2004 costs to 2013 dollars).  The trimmed mean average for all internal hours spent on income tax in 2013 (20.5 hours) is in line with those spent by SMEs in 2009 (22.3 hours), but down significantly from that reported in 2004 (27.0 hours).  Relatedly, owners’ hours in 2013 (16.3 hours) are in line with those incurred in 2009 (18.0 hours), but still down significantly from 2004 (23.3 hours).  While total internal compliance costs in dollars appear to have decreased by $229 (17.0 percent) since 2009, the result is not statistically significant due to the margins of error associated with the 2009 and 2013 trimmed mean costs. As such, the decrease should be viewed as indicative only. However, 2013 internal costs ($1,116) are down significantly when compared with 2004; a decrease of $384 (26.6 percent) from $1,520.  While external compliance costs appear to have increased by 7.4 percent ($101 on average) since 2009, the increase is not statistically significant. However, compared to 2004, 2013 external costs ($1,469 on average for businesses who pay/file income tax) are still 10.2 percent lower than those reported by income tax-liable businesses in 2004 ($1,636). 12 Technically, all of the respondents sampled for the survey should be dealing with income tax. However, some of these businesses did not tick the income tax box in Q1 in the survey, nor attribute any time to dealing with income tax, as well as there being no external cost data for income tax as reported by the business or their tax agent. Another reason why a business might feel they have not dealt with income tax could be that they have only paid provisional tax and did not consider this to be income tax at the time of the survey. 36 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Changes related to business size and turnover  Compared with the 2009 survey results, there were no statistically significant differences in internal or external income-tax related costs when viewed by business size, as measured by the number of employees, or business turnover band.  However, in 2013 micro businesses’ income tax-related costs ($1,079) are down significantly by $450 on average (a decrease of 29.4 percent) when compared with those reported by micro businesses in 2004 ($1,529 after adjusting for 2004 costs to 2013 dollars).  When compared with 2004 (Table 6.2b), businesses with a turnover of less $40,000 per annum in 2013 reported significantly lower internal costs and total costs. Internal costs are down by $872 (a 52.3 percent decrease) and total costs are down by $1,555 (a 46.1 percent decrease).  In 2013, businesses with an annual turnover of between $100k and $250k reported paying significantly lower income tax-related external costs ($1,264, compared with $1,651 in 2004, a decrease of $387 or 23.4 percent). Changes in level of stress – Provisional tax  While there are no statistically significant differences in relation to the average level of stress associated with meeting provisional tax requirements (including finding the money), when compared with 2009 (see Table 6.3), reported stress levels in 2013 (3.2 on average on a scale of 1 to 7) are significantly lower than those reported in 2004 (3.9).  When viewed by business size (as measured by number of employees), average reported stress levels are down significantly for businesses with no employees (3.1 compared with 3.7 in 2004), micro businesses (3.6 compared with 4.1 in 2004) and medium-sized businesses (3.1 compared with 4.1 in 2004).  Relatedly, the proportion of businesses reporting a high level of stress associated with meeting provisional tax requirements in 2013, 24 percent, is down significantly from 39 percent in 2004, while the proportion of businesses reporting low levels of stress has increased to 58 percent, compared with 43 percent in 2004.  In 2013, businesses with no employees were significantly less likely to report high levels of stress (20 percent, compared with 35 percent in 2004), as were micro businesses (33 percent, compared with 42 percent in 2004) and medium-sized businesses (18 percent, compared with 47 percent in 2004).  Relatedly, businesses with no employees were significantly more likely in 2013 to report low levels of stress (62 percent, compared with 47 percent in 2004), as were micro businesses (49 percent, compared with 37 percent in 2004) and medium-sized businesses (63 percent, compared with 37 percent in 2004).

GST SMEs that pay GST Eighty-seven percent of businesses in the survey reported paying GST in 2013, which is down from 93 percent of SMEs in 2009 and 94 percent in 2004. In 2013, SMEs that pay GST are more likely to report having no employees (60 percent), than was the case in the earlier tax compliance studies (54 percent in 2004 and 53 percent in 2009). SMEs that pay GST in 2013 are also less likely to report having between one and five employees (29 percent, compared with 34 percent in 2004 and 35 percent in 2009). SMEs that pay GST in 2013 are also more likely to report having been in business for more than 10 years than in 2009 (50 percent, compared with 38 percent of income tax-liable SMEs in 2009, see Table E.1 in Appendix E). In 2013, GST- liable SMEs are also more likely to report having been in business for between one and two years (18 percent, up from 10 percent in 2009 and 12 percent in 2004). Related to the increase in GST-liable SMEs who do not have any employees, in 2013 fewer SMEs paying GST also reported paying PAYE (45 percent, compared with 52 percent in 2009 and 56 percent in 2004). While the number of GST-liable SMEs paying FBT (10 percent) has not changed significantly since 2009, it is down considerably from 26 percent in 2004. Significantly more GST-liable SMEs also reported paying GST-related external advisor costs in 2013 (46 percent), when compared with the previous tax compliance studies (37 percent in 2009 and 40 percent in 2004). Key findings – GST From 2004 to 2013, changes in average compliance costs associated with GST filers/payers include:  A significant increase in GST-related external costs since 2009 (reported as being $437 on average in 2013, which is a 44.2 percent increase from $303 in 2009).  A significant decrease in GST-related internal costs since 2004 (reported as being $2,027 on average in 2013, compared with $2,407 in 2004, a 15.8 percent decrease).  Hours spent on GST by all SMEs in 2013 (37.1 on average) are unchanged from 2009; however, they are down by 22.5 percent from 47.9 hours 2004.  As with previous years, external GST-related costs are small relative to internal costs; and when compared with the external costs associated with meeting income tax-related obligations. Changes related to business size and turnover  SMEs with no employees and medium-sized SMEs reported significantly higher external costs ($367 and $844, respectively), when compared with those reported by similar SMEs in 2009 ($217 and $376, respectively).  In 2013, medium-sized SMEs reported significantly lower internal costs for GST ($2,277, compared with $3,948 in 2004; a 42.3 percent decrease). 42 Prepared by: Research New Zealand  SMEs with turnovers of less than $40,000 reported significantly higher external costs for GST ($362) when compared with those reported in 2009 ($162), however 2013 external GST costs are in line with those reported by similar SMEs in 2004.  SMEs with turnovers of $5 million or more reported significantly higher external costs for GST ($797) when compared with those reported in 2009 ($397), however 2013 external GST costs are in line with those reported by SMEs with turnovers of $5 million or more in 2004.  SMEs with turnovers of between $500k and $1.3 million reported significantly lower internal costs for GST ($2,229) when compared with those reported by SMEs with turnovers of $500k and $1.3 million in 2004 ($3,152, a 29.3 percent decrease). Changes in level of stress – GST  While there are no statistically significant differences in relation to the average level of stress associated with meeting GST requirements (including finding the money), when compared with 2009 (see Table 7.3), reported stress levels in 2013 (3.3 on average on a scale of 1 to 7) are lower than those reported in 2004 (3.8).  Relatedly, the proportion of SMEs reporting high levels of stress in 2013 (24 percent) is significantly lower when compared with those reported in 2004 (35 percent), while more SMEs in 2013 report having low stress levels (56 percent, compared with 43 percent in 2004).  SMEs with no employees reported significantly lower GST-related stress in 2013 (an average score of 3.1, compared with 3.7 in 2004), as well as micro-businesses (3.6, compared with 4.0 in 2004).  Relatedly, the proportion of SMEs with no employees reporting high stress costs in relation to GST (18 percent) is down significantly from 2004 (33 percent), while the proportion reporting low stress (61 percent) is up significantly from 46 percent in 2004.  Medium-sized SMEs were also significantly less likely to report high levels of stress related to GST in 2013 (18 percent, compared with 40 percent of medium-sized SMEs in 2004).

PAYE SMEs that pay PAYE Reflecting the increase in this year’s survey of SMEs who do not employ any staff, fewer SMEs in 2013 reported they file/pay PAYE (40 percent of responding businesses, which is down significantly from 49 percent in 2009 and 53 percent in 2004). However, other than PAYE-liable SMEs being more likely to have been in operation for 10 years or more (53 percent, compared with 42 percent in 2009 and 47 percent in 2004), there are no significant differences in their demographic characteristics when compared with SMEs that responded to the two previous surveys. The hours expended by all SMEs on PAYE (26 hours per year on average) have not changed significantly since 2009 or 2004 (Tables 5.4a and 5.4b). The proportion of SMEs with employees repaying student loans has increased significantly, however, with 33.4 percent of PAYE filers/payers reporting that they employee staff paying back student loans (compared with 25.1 percent in 2009 and 17.1 percent in 2004) (see table F.2a). The proportion of SMEs with employees who have child support obligations in 2013 (11.0 percent) is similar to that found by the 2004 and 2009 surveys (Table F.2b). The proportion of SMEs utilising external payroll services has increased from 6.9 percent in 2004 and 8.0 percent in 2009 to 13.7 percent in 2013 (Table F.2c). Key findings – PAYE From 2004 to 2013, the main changes in average compliance costs associated with PAYE for PAYE files/payers:  Total PAYE compliance costs ($1,256) remain relatively unchanged from those reported in 2009 ($1,324 after adjusting 2009 costs to 2013 dollars) and 2004 ($1,308).  However, external costs, which comprise a relatively small proportion of PAYE-related compliance costs, have dropped significantly from $115 in 2004 and $97 in 2009, to just $29 on average in 2013, a decrease of 74.8 percent since the 2004 survey. Changes related to business size and turnover  Micro SMEs’ external PAYE compliance costs have dropped significantly from $100 in 2009 and $111 in 2004 to just $31 on average in 2013, a 72.1 percent reduction since 2004.  Small employers’ external PAYE compliance costs have also dropped significantly from $102 in 2009 and $199 in 2004 to $38 on average, an 80.9 percent reduction since 2004.  Since 2009, PAYE-liable SMEs with turnovers of between $100k and $250k have seen external compliance costs in relation to PAYE decrease by 76.0 percent from $96 on average to $23 in 2013. SMEs with turnovers of between $250k and $500k also experienced a significant decrease in external PAYE compliance costs from $118 in 2009 to $25 on average in 2013, a 78.8 percent reduction. 48 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Compared with the findings of the 2004 benchmark survey, the following significant changes in PAYE-related compliance costs have occurred:  SMEs with turnovers of less than $40,000 experienced a 70.6 percent reduction in total PAYE-related compliance costs, from $1,404 in 2004 to $413 in 2013. This has been driven primarily by a reduction in reported internal costs from $1,230 on average to $322 in 2013, a 73.8 percent reduction.  While total PAYE-related compliance costs have not reduced significantly for SMEs with turnovers greater than $40,000, external costs have decreased significantly since 2004 for SMEs with turnovers of between $40,000 and $100k (down 66.7 percent), $100k to $250k (76.0 percent), $250k to $500k (82.0 percent), $500k to $1.3 million (74.8 percent), and SMEs with turnovers of between $1.3 million and $5 million (72.7 percent). Changes in level of stress – PAYE In 2013, the average stress levels associated with PAYE compliance costs (including finding the money) among PAYE filers and payers was 3.1 on a scale of 1 to 7, which is unchanged from levels reported by SMEs in 2004 and 2009. Compliance costs associated with student loans, child support and external payroll services Student Loans As was found in previous years’ surveys, on average SMEs with staff paying back student loans spend significantly more hours dealing with PAYE per year (42 hours), than do SMEs with no staff paying back student loans (22 hours on average). As such, in 2013 SMEs with staff paying back student loans reported significantly higher PAYE-related compliance costs ($1,802), than did SMEs who do not have staff paying back student loans ($1,195). Child Support Also reflecting the findings of previous years’ surveys, SMEs with staff paying child support spend significantly more hours on average per year dealing with their PAYE compliance obligations (43 hours on average, compared with 27 hours as reported by SMEs with no staff that are paying child support). In terms of combined compliance costs, as was found in relation to student loans, the PAYE-related dollar cost associated with SMEs with staff having child support obligations is roughly twice that of those SMEs who do not have any staff with child support obligations ($1,902 versus $964 respectively). External Payroll In 2013, the average payment to external payroll services for such SMEs was $1,053, which is in line with the average payment in 2009 (after adjusting 2009 costs to 2013 dollars). However, the total external payroll costs paid by SMEs are significantly lower than those reported in 2004 ($2,648 after adjusting 2004 costs to 2013 dollars). While one might expect that total internal hours spent on PAYE by SMEs using an external payroll service would be lower than that reported by SMEs not using such services, the survey data suggests that SMEs using such services actually spend more hours to comply with their PAYE obligations (34 hours on average, compared with 27 hours on average among SMEs not using an external payroll service). While this observed difference in hours is indicative only, due to the relatively smaller sub-sample of SMEs using an external payroll service, the discrepancy between those that use external payroll services and those that do not was also seen in the hours reported in both the 2004 and 2009 surveys.

Note: Totals may not sum to 100% due to rounding. SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013 53 Prepared by Research New Zealand Section 9. FBT SMEs that pay FBT Fewer than nine percent of businesses (8.7 percent) in the survey reported filing or paying FBT in 2013; and 42 percent of these also incurred external FBT costs. This compares with 24 percent of SMEs in 2004, 29 percent of which had external FBT costs. The comparable figures for SMEs incurring external FBT related costs in 2009 were 12 percent and 46 percent, respectively. When viewed by business size (as measured by number of employees), unlike GST, Income tax and PAYE, for which the proportions of different-sized businesses filing/paying each tax were similar to the overall proportions of businesses completing the survey, the profile of FBT-liable businesses is significantly different. Whereas businesses with no employees comprise 64 percent of all businesses surveyed, just 21 percent of such businesses reported filing or paying FBT. Similarly, medium sized businesses with 20 plus employees comprise just two percent of all businesses surveyed (similar to that seen in previous years), however 12 percent of such businesses reported filing/paying FBT in 2013. Key findings – FBT  The costs associated with FBT have decreased significantly from both 2009 and 2004. In 2013 the total compliance cost associated with FBT was $219 on average (trimmed means), among FBT-liable businesses, compared with $461 in 2009 (a 52.5 percent reduction) and $354 in 2004 (a 38.1 percent reduction).  Despite businesses reporting similar numbers of hours dealing with FBT in 2013 compared with 2009 and 2004 (see Tables 5.4a and 5.4b, which detail the results for all SMEs), businesses that pay/file FBT reported lower internal costs in 2013 ($197 on average, compared with $245 in 2004 and $346 in 2009).  External FBT-related costs are also down significantly; reported as being just $19 on average, compared with $100 in 2009 and $134 in 2004. Changes by business size When compared with 2009, overall FBT-related costs for businesses with no employees have reduced by 77 percent, while external costs associated with FBT for those businesses have reduced by 96 percent. Micro businesses also reported an 85 percent decrease in external costs. 13 While the large reductions in FBT-related costs for such businesses likely reflects policy implemented in the past to change minimum FBT thresholds for the smallest businesses, they may also reflect a reduction in the practice of providing employees with taxable fringe benefits, due cost-cutting measures in response to the Global Financial Crisis. When compared with 2004, businesses with no employees reported significantly reduced overall and external FBT- related costs (reductions of roughly 66 percent and 95 percent respectively). External FBT-related costs are also down for micro and small businesses, when compared with 2004 (90 percent and 73 percent, respectively). 13 Due to relatively small sub-samples of Nil, Micro and Small businesses with FBT compliance costs, figures have been rounded. 54 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Changes by turnover When compared with 2009, the following significant reductions in FBT compliance costs have occurred:  External costs – businesses with turnovers in the range of $40k to $100k reported a 93 percent reduction, $100k to $250k (88 percent reduction), $250k to $500k (88 percent reduction), $500k to $1.3 million (80 percent reduction), and $1.3 to $5 million (a reduction of 75 percent).  Total costs – businesses with turnovers of less than $40k reported an 82 percent reduction on average, $100k to $250k (70 percent reduction), $250k to $500k (81 percent reduction). When compared with 2004, the following significant reductions in FBT-related compliance costs have occurred in relation to:  Internal costs – businesses with turnovers of between $100k and $250k in 2013 reported 77 percent lower costs.  External costs – businesses with turnovers of between: $40k to $100k reported a 96 percent reduction, $100k to $250k (91 percent reduction), $250k to $500k (93 percent reduction), $500k to $1.3 million (79 percent reduction), $1.3 to $5 million (82 percent), $5 million and over (a reduction of 82 percent).  Total costs – businesses with turnovers of between $100k and $250k reported 80 percent lower total costs in relation to FBT. Changes in level of stress – FBT Reported stress levels associated with FBT (including finding the money) in 2013 were 2.7 on average on a scale of one to seven. Seventy-three percent reported low stress, nine percent moderate stress, and 18 percent reported high levels of stress associated with FBT. With the exception that medium-sized businesses were significantly less likely to report high levels of stress in 2013 (seven percent, compared with 22 percent in 2004 and 29 percent in 2009), there have been no statistically significant changes in reported FBT-related stress levels.

KiwiSaver SMEs that pay KiwiSaver Twenty-one percent of businesses in the survey reported paying KiwiSaver in 2013; 20 percent of whom incurred external KiwiSaver-related costs. In comparison, 24 percent of SMEs reported paying KiwiSaver in 2009, and of those 68 percent reported having external costs associated with KiwiSaver. When viewed by their demographic profiles, businesses with one-to-five employees are less likely to have any KiwiSaver-related compliance costs (58 percent, compared with 76 percent of business with six-to-nineteen employees and 88 percent of businesses with 20 or more employees). Businesses with larger turnovers are also more likely to have KiwiSaver-related costs. For example, 57 percent of businesses with turnovers of between $500k and $1.3 million reported having KiwiSaver-related costs, compared with just five percent of those with turnovers of between $40k and $100k and 17 percent of those with turnovers of between $100k and $250k. Key findings – KiwiSaver On average, the total number of hours spent by all businesses on KiwiSaver compliance (Tables 5.4 a and 5.4b) was 14.9 in 2013, which is in line with the 14.5 hours reported in the 2009 survey. However, costs associated with KiwiSaver, particular external costs, are down significantly in 2013, when compared with the 2009 survey results:  Internal costs in 2013 – reported as being $459 on average, compared with $714 in 2009 (a 35.7 percent reduction); the decrease being a reflection of the decreased dollar value that owners attached to their time in 2013 when compared with the 2009 survey results.  External costs in 2014 – reported as being just $2 on average, compared with $49 in 2009 (a 96.0 percent reduction).  Total KiwiSaver costs in 2013 – reported as being $468 on average, compared with $761 in 2009 (a 38.5 percent reduction overall). Changes by business size and turnover When viewed by business size, micro, small and medium businesses, all reported significant decreases in external costs, with reductions of those costs ranging from 95.6 percent among micro businesses, to 89.1 percent among medium-sized businesses. However, these reductions should be viewed in the context that, on average, external costs represented only six percent of total KiwiSaver-related compliance costs in 2009. When viewed by business turnover, businesses with turnovers of between $40k and $100k reported the greatest reduction in KiwiSaver costs, 65.3 percent. Changes in level of stress – KiwiSaver Reported stress levels associated with KiwiSaver (including finding the money) in 2013 were 3.1 on average, on a scale of one to seven. Sixty-five percent reported low stress, 15 percent moderate stress, while 20 percent reported high levels of stress associated with KiwiSaver. These results are in line with those reported by businesses in the 2009 survey. With the exception that businesses with 20 plus employees reported lower stress levels in 2013 (2.6 compared with 3.6 in 2009), there were no significant differences in mean stress levels when viewed by business size. Relatedly, in 2013, fewer medium businesses reported high levels of stress associated with KiwiSaver (10 percent, compared with 37 percent in 2009), while more reported low levels of stress (80 percent, compared with 51 percent in 2009).

Conclusion Changes in compliance costs for SMEs Overall compliance costs do not appear to have changed significantly over the five years since the 2009 study ($5,861 in 2013 compared with $5,962 in 2009). However, they have decreased overall since 2004 by 11.7 percent from $6,640, (a reduction of $779 on average). The decrease since 2004 has been by no means proportional across the different types of cost incurred (i.e. internal versus external), size of business and/or tax type. So in order to fully answer the query, have compliance costs reduced since 2004 and/or 2009 and if so, which aspects, we must return to the equation by which those costs have been assessed for the purposes of this study: Combined compliance cost = hours + external compliance cost = stress As discussed in earlier sections of the report, the main component of compliance costs for SMEs is the internal hours spent on tax, with owners contributing the most to those hours. Hours and hourly costs Overall internal costs have trended downward since the 2004 benchmark from $4,552 in 2004 to $4,321 in 2009. Based on the 2013/14 survey results, mean internal costs decreased a further 12.6 percent to $3,778 between 2009 and 2013 – a total decrease of 17.0 percent since 2004 (in 2013 dollars). Changes in internal compliance costs since 2004 have been driven by a number of factors, some of which have decreased while others have increased. There has been a downward trend in the number of internal hours spent per annum, with the most marked decrease being hours spent by owners in between 2004 and 2009 (down from 66.3 to 55.0 hours). In contrast, there has been a general increase in the hourly dollar value for owners, employees and unpaid family and friends over time, even after adjusting for inflation. For example, the value of employees’ time has risen from $25.54 per hour in 2004 to $28.03 in 2013, a 9.7 percent increase overall. When viewed by tax type, among all SMEs dealing with GST takes the most time (37.1 hours per year on average), followed by PAYE-related time (25.8 hours per year) and time spent dealing with Income tax (20.5 hours per year). Despite the significant reduction in time spent dealing with tax since 2004, the 2013 survey highlights on average, all SMEs are spending a similar number of hours in meeting their tax obligations as they were in 2009. External costs The 2013 survey suggests that there has been some shifting of costs from internal to external sources since 2009, external costs having increased by $332 on average, a 22.0 percent increase since 2009. Despite this apparent shifting of costs, since 2009, overall external costs for all SMEs in 2013 ($1,842 on average) are relatively unchanged when compared with the 2004 benchmark study ($1,863 after adjusting 2004 values to 2013 dollars). Stress The mean overall stress score (measured on a scale of 1 to 7) associated with meeting all Inland Revenue requirements (ignoring finding the money) in 2013 has decreased significantly from 3.4 in 2004 to 3.0 in 2013. Relatedly, the proportions of all businesses that rated meeting Inland Revenue requirements as highly stressful (16 percent) as defined by a rating of “5” or higher., is also down significantly from 2004 (24 percent), with significantly more businesses also reporting low stress (63 percent in 2013, compared with 50 percent in 2004). However, there are no significant differences between reported stress levels in 2013 and those reported in 2009. SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013 1 Prepared by Research New Zealand Impact of business size Looking purely at changes in costs since 2004, businesses with no employees had the greatest reduction in mean compliance costs (10.8 percent average). However this is likely to be a function of such businesses not having any costs associated with dealing with PAYE (or KiwiSaver, though KiwiSaver was not a factor for SMEs in 2004). In contrast, small businesses (i.e. those with six to 19 employees, besides the owner, have experienced only a 2.7 percent reduction in mean compliance costs since 2004, whereas micro businesses reported a 6.9 percent reduction in compliance costs overall, and medium sized businesses with 20 plus employees reported an increase in costs of 7.1 percent. In relation to the increase in costs for medium businesses, this has been driven by a significant increase in external costs, (up 38.5 percent since 2004), as such businesses are still spending significantly less time internally dealing with tax compliance than they were in 2004 (resulting in a decrease of 24.3 percent in hours spent, and a decrease of 16.2 percent in terms of the value of time spent). Changes by tax type As noted above, at the individual tax type level, the results are not as clear cut. For example, there has been a decrease in overall combined internal/external costs associated with Income tax among SMEs since 2004, with Income tax-liable SMEs spending $257 less on average per year in 2013 than they did in 2004. Similar savings have also been made in relation to GST (down $294 on average, when compared with 2004). In contrast, the costs associated with PAYE have not reduced as much as much as those associated with Income tax or GST. In 2013, PAYE-liable SMEs reported spending $52 less dealing with PAYE-related tax costs than they did in 2004 2004 (a reduction of just 4.0 percent). Total costs in relation to FBT have decreased significantly since 2004 (down 38.1 percent) and 2009 (down 52.5 percent); and while this is likely a function of changes made in relation to FBT thresholds, it could also be attributed in part to fewer SMEs providing their employees with FBT-liable fringe benefits as a result of cost-cutting measures they have implemented to deal with the impact of the Global Financial Crisis. In 2009, KiwiSaver-liable SMEs reported spending $761 on average to meet their KiwiSaver-associated compliance costs. In 2013, the average dollar costs spent by SMEs, in relation to KiwiSaver, was $459, a reduction of $293 (38.5 percent), with most of those savings being associated with internal time (a reduction of $255 on average). This suggests that the ‘bedding’ down period for KiwiSaver has now passed. Final remarks Overall, while the dollar and stress related costs associated with tax compliance have decreased since 2004, most of those ‘gains’ appear to have occurred between 2004 and 2009, with there being fewer significant changes in reported costs between 2009 and 2013. As noted at the beginning of this report, while successive New Zealand governments have used tax policy and administration to ensure taxpayers meet their tax obligations, in addition to reducing and limiting the costs of compliance for taxpayers (e.g. changes in relation to FBT), tax changes can operate in the opposite direction as well, by also adding compliance costs (e.g. the introduction of KiwiSaver). Changes in the economy (e.g. those resulting from the recent financial recession), business practices (e.g. the use of third party agents) and circumstances can also affect compliance costs. However, the degree to which the Global Financial Crisis has impacted on New Zealand businesses’ practices, and what if any flow on effects those changes have had on SMEs compliance costs, were outside of the scope of this particular study. Therefore, further investigations as to the impact of the GFC on SMEs business practices, and in particular tax-related compliance costs, may be merited.

US, NZ agree on fiscally transparent entities
=============================================

An agreement between US and NZ tax authorities has clarified that the benefits of the 1982 double tax agreement between the two countries apply to cross-border investments by limited liability companies and other fiscally transparent entities in both countries.

MEDIA RELEASE

### US, NZ agree on tax treatment of fiscally transparent entities

United States and New Zealand tax authorities have agreed to allow fiscally transparent entities owned by US and NZ residents to benefit from the double tax agreement between the two countries.

"The move should help New Zealand to attract more United States investment, especially venture capital," says Robin Oliver, Inland Revenue's Deputy Commissioner, Policy.

"United States investors into New Zealand have raised concerns that a strict interpretation of our 1982 double tax agreement would exclude certain types of commercial entities that have become more common in the last ten years."

"The result is that fiscally transparent entities based in the US that invest into New Zealand might not be eligible for the reduced non-resident withholding tax rates that our double tax agreement gives other US investors," he says.

"The two tax authorities have therefore agreed to clarify matters by interpreting our double tax agreement so as to ensure that its benefits apply to cross-border investments of limited liability companies and other fiscally transparent entities in both countries," Robin Oliver says.

A fiscally transparent entity is an entity that is disregarded for tax purposes, with tax imposed directly on the owners or shareholders, as happens with general partnerships.

_Text of the mutual agreement, 8 February 2005 follows:_

### U.S. and New Zealand reach Mutual Agreement Regarding Treatment of Income Derived Through Certain Fiscally Transparent Entities

The Competent Authorities of the United States and New Zealand have entered into a mutual agreement to clarify the entitlement of members of certain fiscally transparent entities to benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed on July 23, 1982, and as amended by Protocol signed on July 23, 1982, and as implemented in New Zealand by The Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983 signed on July 23 1983.

It has come to the attention of the Competent Authorities that a resident of a Contracting State may derive income from the other Contracting State through an entity that is organized in, and treated as fiscally transparent by, the first Contracting State, but that is not treated as fiscally transparent by the other Contracting State.

Consistent with the approach taken in Article 4 (Residence) of the Convention, and pursuant to the authority of Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the Convention, the Competent Authorities agree that, in applying the Convention, income paid to and through such an entity is considered to be derived by a resident of the Contracting State to the extent of the share the resident has in the income.

For example, if a resident of the United States is a partner or member of an entity created or organized in the United States, under the law of the United States or any state of the United States, and the entity is treated for United States federal tax purposes as a partnership or is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (e.g., a limited partnership; or a Limited Liability Company, including one owned by a single member), the resident of the United States would be afforded the benefits of the treaty on the income that the resident derives from New Zealand through the entity, even if under its domestic law New Zealand does not treat the entity as fiscally transparent. Consistent with Article 4 (1)(b) of the New Zealand/US treaty, the benefits extend to the income received by the fiscally transparent entity only to the extent of the resident’s share of that income.

New tax rules on corporate migration
====================================

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax incentives for migrating companies to go

The government will legislate to ensure companies pay New Zealand tax on income earned before they migrate from New Zealand, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

"Under present law, they can leave without having necessarily paid tax on all the income they earned while resident here.

"This is both unfair and inconsistent with the tax treatment of companies that liquidate as they are subject to tax on a higher proportion of their income," Dr Cullen said.

"The change will put migrating companies on a par with liquidating companies.  
When they migrate, companies will be deemed to have been liquidated at that point and to have paid a dividend to shareholders, upon which they must withhold tax.

"Companies will be allowed to attach imputation credits to these deemed dividends, and – to prevent double taxation – the amount of the distribution can be treated as an additional amount of tax-paid share capital that can be returned to shareholders.

"The change will be included in the next taxation bill to be introduced into Parliament and, once enacted, will be effective from today," Dr Cullen said.

Details of the proposed change are available in a special report, "Proposed tax rules for migrating companies", published at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)

A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue

21 March 2005

### Proposed tax rules for migrating companies

#### Introduction

The government has announced it will introduce legislation to ensure that a migrating company pays tax on its worldwide income earned while it was a New Zealand resident company. The change is intended to remove incentives for companies to migrate for tax reasons and, once enacted, will be effective from the date of announcement, 21 March 2005.

The new rules will be similar to those relating to companies that liquidate. Thus, for tax purposes, migrating companies will be deemed to have liquidated and paid a dividend to shareholders.

This special report describes the proposed tax treatment.

#### What is corporate migration?

A company has migrated from New Zealand if it is no longer a resident company for New Zealand tax purposes. This is generally achieved by companies transferring their place of incorporation overseas.

For New Zealand tax purposes, a non-resident company:

*   is not incorporated in New Zealand;
*   does not have its head office in New Zealand;
*   does not have its centre of management in New Zealand; and
*   is not controlled by its directors in New Zealand.

#### Key features of the proposed rules

On a company's migration from New Zealand, the company will be deemed to have liquidated and paid a dividend to its shareholders.

This will mean that the existing tax rules that apply on the liquidation of a New Zealand company will also apply in the event of a company ceasing to be a New Zealand-resident.

The company will first be deemed to have disposed of all assets and liabilities and realised them at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand-resident. Under existing legislation, certain proceeds (such as gains in the value of revenue account property) will be subject to tax.

The company will then be deemed to have distributed all shareholder funds (which will include the deemed disposal proceeds) to its shareholders by way of a dividend.

A migrating company will be required to "withhold" tax from the dividend immediately before it ceased to be a New Zealand-resident company, under the resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules, as appropriate.

Under the RWT rules, RWT on dividends applies at the rate of 33%. A deemed dividend "paid" to a resident shareholder will then be taxed at the shareholder's personal marginal tax rate, less imputation credits attached by the company.

A deemed dividend "paid" to a non-resident shareholder will be taxed at 30% if the shareholder is a resident of a non-treaty country and the dividend is not fully imputed or credited with dividend withholding payments. NRWT at 15% will apply to a deemed dividend "paid" to a shareholder of a treaty country or a non-treaty country if the dividend is fully imputed or credited.

While realised capital reserves will generally be excluded from the deemed distribution, for consistency with the liquidation rules, they will be included for non-resident related company shareholders.

The amount of the deemed dividend will therefore vary between certain shareholders as shown in the following table.

| Resident shareholder | Non-related non-resident shareholder | Related non-resident company shareholder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dividend subject to RWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. | Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. | Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital. |

Property that continues to be subject to tax in New Zealand after a company's migration (for example, standing timber) because it is located in New Zealand, could be treated as re-acquired by the company at the same market value for which it was deemed to have been disposed of at the time of migration. This will establish a new cost base to apply in the event of a subsequent realisation.

To remove potential double taxation in the event that a migrating company pays a dividend to its shareholders, the amount of the deemed distribution to a migrating company's shareholders could be treated by the company as an additional amount of tax paid share capital or available subscribed capital (ASC).

**Example: Migration of a New Zealand company**

S Ltd was incorporated in New Zealand in 1995 and issued 140,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to resident shareholders and 60,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to non-resident shareholders (40,000 of those shares are held by related non-resident companies).

The shareholders resolve to transfer S Ltd's place of incorporation and its directorial and managerial functions offshore. S Ltd has a realised capital profit of $150,000 and revenue reserves of $300,000. S Ltd also owns shares held on revenue account in a company that owns commercial rental property in Wellington. The market value of these shares is $500,000. They were purchased for $450,000. S Ltd also owns a New Zealand-registered patent worth $250,000. The cost of the patent was $200,000, and depreciation deductions of $50,000 have been claimed.

S Ltd's imputation credit account has a credit balance of $100,000.[\[1\]](#footnote1)

##### Deemed disposal rules

S Ltd will be deemed to have disposed of all of its assets and liabilities at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident.

The taxable amount from the deemed disposal of the patent is $100,000 (market value less cost (reduced by the amount of depreciation already claimed)).[\[2\]](#footnote2)
 The taxable amount from the deemed disposal of the shares is $50,000 (market value less cost).[\[3\]](#footnote3)
 S Ltd's tax liability on the deemed disposal of its revenue account property is therefore $49,500, and the tax paid is credited to S Ltd's imputation credit account.

The company that owns the commercial property will remain in New Zealand, and the patent is registered in New Zealand. Therefore future income derived from the shares and the patent will continue to be subject to New Zealand tax.[\[4\]](#footnote4)
 S Ltd will be deemed to have re-acquired the shares at $500,000 and the patent at $250,000, which will establish new cost bases for those assets.

##### Deemed liquidation rules

S Ltd will be deemed to have liquidated and made a distribution to shareholders immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. The total amount "received" by each shareholder is $4.75 per share.[\[5\]](#footnote5)

In calculating the amount of the taxable dividend deemed to have been paid by S Ltd it is first necessary to exclude capital amounts from total funds. For these purposes, capital amounts comprise the amount of "ASC per share cancelled" and, for shareholders that are not related non-resident companies, the "excess return amount" per share - essentially a shareholder's share of capital assets and realised capital gains.

Applying the formulae in the legislation, ASC per share cancelled is calculated as $2, and the excess return amount is 75 cents. Therefore the tax-free capital component of the amount distributed by S Ltd in respect of each share is $2.75, and the remaining $2 per share (representing revenue reserves) is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend.

S Ltd may attach imputation credits of 70 cents per share[\[6\]](#footnote6)
 to dividends paid to resident shareholders.

##### Resident shareholders

The total amount received per share distributed to resident shareholders on S Ltd's migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. Imputation credits of 70 cents per share could be attached for offset against the shareholder's personal tax liability.

S Ltd is required to withhold RWT from the dividends paid to resident shareholders. S Ltd's RWT cost per share is 19 cents.[\[7\]](#footnote7)
 S Ltd's total RWT cost is $26,600.[\[8\]](#footnote8)

The amount of the deemed distribution, less RWT and NRWT, becomes ASC and in the event of S Ltd paying a dividend to resident shareholders, could be returned to those shareholders tax-free.

##### Non-related non-resident shareholders

The total amount received per share distributed to non-related non-resident shareholders on S Ltd's migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend.

S Ltd is required to withhold NRWT from dividends paid to non-related non-resident shareholders. S Ltd's NRWT cost per share held by these shareholders is 30 cents.[\[9\]](#footnote9)
 S Ltd's total NRWT cost in relation to these shareholders is $6,000.[\[10\]](#footnote10)

##### Related company non-resident shareholders

The amount of the dividend to the related non-resident company shareholder subject to NRWT is that amount which would arise as a dividend if the excess return amount (that is, the share of capital assets and realised capital gains) were nil.

The total amount received by related non-resident company shareholders on S Ltd's migration is $4.75, of which $2 (being $2 + nil) is tax-free. The remaining $2.75 (representing revenue reserves and capital profits) is taxable to the company shareholder as a dividend subject to NRWT. S Ltd's NRWT cost per share held by these shareholders is 41 cents.[\[11\]](#footnote11)
 S Ltd's total NRWT cost in relation to these shareholders is $16,400.[\[12\]](#footnote12)

These calculations per share for the various shareholders are summarised in the following table.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |Summary of tax calculations
|     | Resident shareholder | Non-related non-resident shareholder | Related non-resident company shareholder |
| Deemed distribution | $4.75 | $4.75 | $4.75 |
| ASC "cancelled" | $2.00 | $2.00 | $2.00 |
| Excess return amount | $0.75 | $0.75 | $0.75 |
| Taxable amount | $2.00 | $2.00 | $2.75 |
| Imputation credits | $0.70 | \-  | \-  |
| RWT | $0.19 | \-  | \-  |
| NRWT | \-  | $0.30 | $0.41 |

\[1\] A company could make use of the foreign investor tax credit rules by paying a fully imputed dividend and a supplementary dividend to its non-resident shareholders before it ceases to be a New Zealand-resident company. The company will not be able to obtain credits in relation to deemed dividends to its non-resident shareholders on its migration.

The change is intended to remove incentives for companies to migrate for tax reasons and, once enacted, will be effective from the date of announcement, 21 March 2005. The new rules will be similar to those relating to companies that liquidate. Thus, for tax purposes, migrating companies will be deemed to have liquidated and paid a dividend to shareholders. This special report describes the proposed tax treatment. What is corporate migration? A company has migrated from New Zealand if it is no longer a resident company for New Zealand tax purposes. This is generally achieved by companies transferring their place of incorporation overseas. For New Zealand tax purposes, a non-resident company: is not incorporated in New Zealand; does not have its head office in New Zealand; does not have its centre of management in New Zealand; and is not controlled by its directors in New Zealand. Key features of the proposed rules On a company�s migration from New Zealand, the company will be deemed to have liquidated and paid a dividend to its shareholders. This will mean that the existing tax rules that apply on the liquidation of a New Zealand company will also apply in the event of a company ceasing to be a New Zealand-resident. The company will first be deemed to have disposed of all assets and liabilities and realised them at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand-resident. Under existing legislation, certain proceeds (such as gains in the value of revenue account property) will be subject to tax. The company will then be deemed to have distributed all shareholder funds (which will include the deemed disposal proceeds) to its shareholders by way of a dividend. A migrating company will be required to �withhold� tax from the dividend immediately before it ceased to be a New Zealand-resident company, under the resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules, as appropriate. Under the RWT rules, RWT on dividends applies at the rate of 33%. A deemed dividend �paid� to a resident shareholder will then be taxed at the shareholder�s personal marginal tax rate, less imputation credits attached by the company. A deemed dividend �paid� to a non-resident shareholder will be taxed at 30% if the shareholder is a resident of a non-treaty country and the dividend is not fully imputed or credited with dividend withholding payments. NRWT at 15% will apply to a deemed dividend �paid� to a shareholder of a treaty country or a non-treaty country if the dividend is fully imputed or credited. While realised capital reserves will generally be excluded from the deemed distribution, for consistency with the liquidation rules, they will be included for non-resident related company shareholders. The amount of the deemed dividend will therefore vary between certain shareholders as shown in the following table. Resident shareholderNon-related non-resident shareholderRelated non-resident company shareholder Dividend subject to RWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves.Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital.  Property that continues to be subject to tax in New Zealand after a company�s migration (for example, standing timber) because it is located in New Zealand, could be treated as re-acquired by the company at the same market value for which it was deemed to have been disposed of at the time of migration. This will establish a new cost base to apply in the event of a subsequent realisation. To remove potential double taxation in the event that a migrating company pays a dividend to its shareholders, the amount of the deemed distribution to a migrating company�s shareholders could be treated by the company as an additional amount of tax paid share capital or available subscribed capital (ASC). Example: Migration of a New Zealand company S Ltd was incorporated in New Zealand in 1995 and issued 140,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to resident shareholders and 60,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to non-resident shareholders (40,000 of those shares are held by related non-resident companies). The shareholders resolve to transfer S Ltd�s place of incorporation and its directorial and managerial functions offshore. S Ltd has a realised capital profit of $150,000 and revenue reserves of $300,000. S Ltd also owns shares held on revenue account in a company that owns commercial rental property in Wellington. The market value of these shares is $500,000. They were purchased for $450,000. S Ltd also owns a New Zealand-registered patent worth $250,000. The cost of the patent was $200,000, and depreciation deductions of $50,000 have been claimed. S Ltd�s imputation credit account has a credit balance of $100,000. Deemed disposal rules S Ltd will be deemed to have disposed of all of its assets and liabilities at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. The taxable amount from the deemed disposal of the patent is $100,000 (market value less cost (reduced by the amount of depreciation already claimed)). The taxable amount from the deemed disposal of the shares is $50,000 (market value less cost). S Ltd�s tax liability on the deemed disposal of its revenue account property is therefore $49,500, and the tax paid is credited to S Ltd�s imputation credit account. The company that owns the commercial property will remain in New Zealand, and the patent is registered in New Zealand. Therefore future income derived from the shares and the patent will continue to be subject to New Zealand tax. S Ltd will be deemed to have re-acquired the shares at $500,000 and the patent at $250,000, which will establish new cost bases for those assets. Deemed liquidation rules S Ltd will be deemed to have liquidated and made a distribution to shareholders immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. The total amount �received� by each shareholder is $4.75 per share. In calculating the amount of the taxable dividend deemed to have been paid by S Ltd it is first necessary to exclude capital amounts from total funds. For these purposes, capital amounts comprise the amount of �ASC per share cancelled� and, for shareholders that are not related non-resident companies, the �excess return amount� per share � essentially a shareholder�s share of capital assets and realised capital gains. Applying the formulae in the legislation, ASC per share cancelled is calculated as $2, and the excess return amount is 75 cents. Therefore the tax-free capital component of the amount distributed by S Ltd in respect of each share is $2.75, and the remaining $2 per share (representing revenue reserves) is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. S Ltd may attach imputation credits of 70 cents per share to dividends paid to resident shareholders. Resident shareholders The total amount received per share distributed to resident shareholders on S Ltd�s migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. Imputation credits of 70 cents per share could be attached for offset against the shareholder�s personal tax liability. S Ltd is required to withhold RWT from the dividends paid to resident shareholders. S Ltd�s RWT cost per share is 19 cents. S Ltd�s total RWT cost is $26,600. The amount of the deemed distribution, less RWT and NRWT, becomes ASC and in the event of S Ltd paying a dividend to resident shareholders, could be returned to those shareholders tax-free. Non-related non-resident shareholders The total amount received per share distributed to non-related non-resident shareholders on S Ltd�s migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. S Ltd is required to withhold NRWT from dividends paid to non-related non-resident shareholders. S Ltd�s NRWT cost per share held by these shareholders is 30 cents. S Ltd�s total NRWT cost in relation to these shareholders is $6,000. Related company non-resident shareholders The amount of the dividend to the related non-resident company shareholder subject to NRWT is that amount which would arise as a dividend if the excess return amount (that is, the share of capital assets and realised capital gains) were nil. The total amount received by related non-resident company shareholders on S Ltd�s migration is $4.75, of which $2 (being $2 + nil) is tax-free. The remaining $2.75 (representing revenue reserves and capital profits) is taxable to the company shareholder as a dividend subject to NRWT. S Ltd�s NRWT cost per share held by these shareholders is 41 cents. S Ltd�s total NRWT cost in relation to these shareholders is $16,400. These calculations per share for the various shareholders are summarised in the following table. Summary of tax calculations Resident shareholderNon-related non-resident shareholderRelated non-resident company shareholder Deemed distribution $4.75$4.75$4.75ASC �cancelled�$2.00$2.00$2.00Excess return amount $0.75$0.75$0.75Taxable amount $2.00$2.00$2.75Imputation credits $0.70��RWT $0.19��NRWT �$0.30$0.41  A company could make use of the foreign investor tax credit rules by paying a fully imputed dividend and a supplementary dividend to its non-resident shareholders before it ceases to be a New Zealand-resident company. The company will not be able to obtain credits in relation to deemed dividends to its non�resident shareholders on its migration.  See section EN 2.  See section CD 3.  Assuming that there are no DTA implications.  (400,000 + 150,000 +300,000 +150,000 - 49,500)/200,000. Note that all figures in this example have been rounded to two decimal places.  Existing imputation credit rules require the same imputation credit ratio to apply to all distributions within an income year. Applying this rule to the total imputation credit account balance of 149,500 allows dividends to resident shareholders to receive 70 cents per share of imputation credits.  ((2+.70) x .33) - .70 

A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue 21 March 2005 Proposed tax rules for migrating companies Introduction The government has announced it will introduce legislation to ensure that a migrating company pays tax on its worldwide income earned while it was a New Zealand resident company. The change is intended to remove incentives for companies to migrate for tax reasons and, once enacted, will be effective from the date of announcement, 21 March 2005. The new rules will be similar to those relating to companies that liquidate. Thus, for tax purposes, migrating companies will be deemed to have liquidated and paid a dividend to shareholders. This special report describes the proposed tax treatment. What is corporate migration? A company has migrated from New Zealand if it is no longer a resident company for New Zealand tax purposes. This is generally achieved by companies transferring their place of incorporation overseas. For New Zealand tax purposes, a non-resident company: • is not incorporated in New Zealand; • does not have its head office in New Zealand; • does not have its centre of management in New Zealand; and • is not controlled by its directors in New Zealand. Key features of the proposed rules On a company’s migration from New Zealand, the company will be deemed to have liquidated and paid a dividend to its shareholders. This will mean that the existing tax rules that apply on the liquidation of a New Zealand company will also apply in the event of a company ceasing to be a New Zealand-resident. The company will first be deemed to have disposed of all assets and liabilities and realised them at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand-resident. Under existing legislation, certain proceeds (such as gains in the value of revenue account property) will be subject to tax. 2 The company will then be deemed to have distributed all shareholder funds (which will include the deemed disposal proceeds) to its shareholders by way of a dividend. A migrating company will be required to “withhold” tax from the dividend immediately before it ceased to be a New Zealand-resident company, under the resident withholding tax (RWT) or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules, as appropriate. Under the RWT rules, RWT on dividends applies at the rate of 33%. A deemed dividend “paid” to a resident shareholder will then be taxed at the shareholder’s personal marginal tax rate, less imputation credits attached by the company. A deemed dividend “paid” to a non-resident shareholder will be taxed at 30% if the shareholder is a resident of a non-treaty country and the dividend is not fully imputed or credited with dividend withholding payments. NRWT at 15% will apply to a deemed dividend “paid” to a shareholder of a treaty country or a non-treaty country if the dividend is fully imputed or credited. While realised capital reserves will generally be excluded from the deemed distribution, for consistency with the liquidation rules, they will be included for non-resident related company shareholders. The amount of the deemed dividend will therefore vary between certain shareholders as shown in the following table. Resident shareholder Non-related non-resident shareholder Related non-resident company shareholder Dividend subject to RWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital and realised capital reserves. Dividend subject to NRWT = shareholder funds, less available subscribed capital. Property that continues to be subject to tax in New Zealand after a company’s migration (for example, standing timber) because it is located in New Zealand, could be treated as re- acquired by the company at the same market value for which it was deemed to have been disposed of at the time of migration. This will establish a new cost base to apply in the event of a subsequent realisation. To remove potential double taxation in the event that a migrating company pays a dividend to its shareholders, the amount of the deemed distribution to a migrating company’s shareholders could be treated by the company as an additional amount of tax paid share capital or available subscribed capital (ASC). Example: Migration of a New Zealand company S Ltd was incorporated in New Zealand in 1995 and issued 140,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to resident shareholders and 60,000 ordinary shares at $2 each to non-resident shareholders (40,000 of those shares are held by related non-resident companies). 3 The shareholders resolve to transfer S Ltd’s place of incorporation and its directorial and managerial functions offshore. S Ltd has a realised capital profit of $150,000 and revenue reserves of $300,000. S Ltd also owns shares held on revenue account in a company that owns commercial rental property in Wellington. The market value of these shares is $500,000. They were purchased for $450,000. S Ltd also owns a New Zealand-registered patent worth $250,000. The cost of the patent was $200,000, and depreciation deductions of $50,000 have been claimed. S Ltd’s imputation credit account has a credit balance of $100,000. 1 Deemed disposal rules S Ltd will be deemed to have disposed of all of its assets and liabilities at market value immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. The taxable amount from the deemed disposal of the patent is $100,000 (market value less cost (reduced by the amount of depreciation already claimed)). 2 The taxable amount from the deemed disposal of the shares is $50,000 (market value less cost). 3 S Ltd’s tax liability on the deemed disposal of its revenue account property is therefore $49,500, and the tax paid is credited to S Ltd’s imputation credit account. The company that owns the commercial property will remain in New Zealand, and the patent is registered in New Zealand. Therefore future income derived from the shares and the patent will continue to be subject to New Zealand tax. 4 S Ltd will be deemed to have re-acquired the shares at $500,000 and the patent at $250,000, which will establish new cost bases for those assets. Deemed liquidation rules S Ltd will be deemed to have liquidated and made a distribution to shareholders immediately before it ceases to be a New Zealand resident. The total amount “received” by each shareholder is $4.75 per share. 5 In calculating the amount of the taxable dividend deemed to have been paid by S Ltd it is first necessary to exclude capital amounts from total funds. For these purposes, capital amounts comprise the amount of “ASC per share cancelled” and, for shareholders that are not related non-resident companies, the “excess return amount” per share – essentially a shareholder’s share of capital assets and realised capital gains. Applying the formulae in the legislation, ASC per share cancelled is calculated as $2, and the excess return amount is 75 cents. Therefore the tax-free capital component of the amount distributed by S Ltd in respect of each share is $2.75, and the remaining $2 per share (representing revenue reserves) is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. 1 A company could make use of the foreign investor tax credit rules by paying a fully imputed dividend and a supplementary dividend to its non-resident shareholders before it ceases to be a New Zealand-resident company. The company will not be able to obtain credits in relation to deemed dividends to its non–resident shareholders on its migration. 2 See section EN 2. 3 See section CD 3. 4 Assuming that there are no DTA implications. 5 (400,000 + 150,000 +300,000 +150,000 - 49,500)/200,000. Note that all figures in this example have been rounded to two decimal places. 4 S Ltd may attach imputation credits of 70 cents per share 6 to dividends paid to resident shareholders. Resident shareholders The total amount received per share distributed to resident shareholders on S Ltd’s migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. Imputation credits of 70 cents per share could be attached for offset against the shareholder’s personal tax liability. S Ltd is required to withhold RWT from the dividends paid to resident shareholders. S Ltd’s RWT cost per share is 19 cents. 7 S Ltd’s total RWT cost is $26,600. 8 The amount of the deemed distribution, less RWT and NRWT, becomes ASC and in the event of S Ltd paying a dividend to resident shareholders, could be returned to those shareholders tax-free. Non-related non-resident shareholders The total amount received per share distributed to non-related non-resident shareholders on S Ltd’s migration is $4.75, of which $2.75 (being $2 + $0.75) is tax-free. The remaining $2 per share is taxable to each shareholder as a dividend. S Ltd is required to withhold NRWT from dividends paid to non-related non-resident shareholders. S Ltd’s NRWT cost per share held by these shareholders is 30 cents. 9 S Ltd’s total NRWT cost in relation to these shareholders is $6,000. 10 Related company non-resident shareholders The amount of the dividend to the related non-resident company shareholder subject to NRWT is that amount which would arise as a dividend if the excess return amount (that is, the share of capital assets and realised capital gains) were nil. The total amount received by related non-resident company shareholders on S Ltd’s migration is $4.75, of which $2 (being $2 + nil) is tax-free. The remaining $2.75 (representing revenue reserves and capital profits) is taxable to the company shareholder as a dividend subject to NRWT. S Ltd’s NRWT cost per share held by these shareholders is 41 cents. 11 S Ltd’s total NRWT cost in relation to these shareholders is $16,400. 12 6 Existing imputation credit rules require the same imputation credit ratio to apply to all distributions within an income year. Applying this rule to the total imputation credit account balance of 149,500 allows dividends to resident shareholders to receive 70 cents per share of imputation credits. 7 ((2+.70) x .33) - .70 8 .19 x 140,000 9 .15 x 2 (assuming that the standard NRWT treaty rate of 15% applies). 10 .3 x 20,000 11 .15 x 2.75 12 .41 x 40,000 5 These calculations per share for the various shareholders are summarised in the following table.

New tax discount from 1 April
=============================

From 1 April the new 6.7% tax discount becomes available to many self-employed people and members of partnership in their first year of business. An idea first canvassed in the 2003 discussion document 'Making tax easier for small businesses', the discount is intended to encourage people starting up in business to make early payments of tax in the year before they begin paying provisional tax. For more information see the government's [media statement](/news/2005/2005-03-31-new-tax-discount-1-april#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax discounts for new small businesses

Starting a small business will become less taxing from April this year when a 6.7 per cent tax discount becomes available, Associate Revenue Minister David Cunliffe says.

The tax discount, available from April 1, will be open to many self-employed people and members of partnerships in their first year of business.

"The discount is designed to reduce some of the financial strain that small businesses face in those vital first three years of business. Mr Cunliffe says.

"When they begin paying provisional tax, often in their second year of business, people can be hit hard by having to make payments of two years' income tax very close together – one for the previous year and one for the current year. That can be a real strain for some small businesses."

Mr Cunliffe says the government has introduced the discount to relieve this problem by encouraging people who are starting up in self-employment and partnerships to make early payments of tax in the year before they begin to pay provisional tax.

"Those who choose to do so will receive a 6.7 per cent discount for each dollar of tax paid during the first year, to be calculated when their end-of-year tax bill is prepared. In this way they will have less tax to pay in year two and will save money as well."

The discount is one of several measures designed to make tax easier for small businesses.

"Similar measures in the pipeline are aligning provisional tax and GST payments, allowing small businesses to base provisional tax payments on GST turnover and helping small businesses with PAYE," Mr Cunliffe said.

### Who qualifies for the tax discount?

To qualify, individuals must:

*   be either self-employed or a partner in a partnership;
*   derive gross income predominantly from a business (and not interest, dividends, royalties, rents or beneficiary income);
*   not be required to pay provisional tax in the income year in question;
*   make a voluntary payment of income tax before the end of the income year (31 March for a March balance date taxpayer);
*   elect to receive the discount within the timeframe for filing a return of income for that income year;
*   not have been liable to pay provisional tax in the previous four years; and
*   not have received an early payment discount within the last four years – if they have a four-year break during which they do not receive income from self-employment or a partnership they become eligible again.

Once they have made a voluntary payment they must keep the lesser of the following in their income tax account until terminal tax date for the income year:

*   the amount of voluntary payments made before the end of their income year; or
*   the amount of terminal tax for the income year.

Those who are provisional taxpayers before they begin receiving self-employed or partnership income will not be entitled to the discount.

The discount is not available to taxpayers who merely stop paying provisional tax, rather than stop deriving business income. For example, a business that has a tax loss would not qualify for the discount.

SPEECH NOTES

### Address to 28th Annual International Fiscal Association Conference

_Crowne Plaza Hotel, Kilmore and Durham Sts, Christchurch_

Last year the government's main focus in the area of tax reform was on providing a fairer deal for working families. The fruits of those labours were the tax changes in the Working for Families package in last year's budget. They are already delivering benefits. From 1 April this year, 260,000 families will be entitled to extra money for living costs, housing and childcare.

The focus of tax changes in this year's budget will be on facilitating savings, increasing New Zealand's access to worldwide labour, skills and capital, and ensuring their efficient use so as to increase productivity and grow the economy.

This is an ambitious tax programme, and it will be implemented in a way that maintains the government's strong fiscal position. That fiscal position is what establishes the parameters for tax changes, and it needs to be considered over the long term, where there is not as much headroom as many are claiming. For this reason I want to deal first with the fiscal position before announcing some specific tax policy proposals.

The major rationale for the government's policy of running strong fiscal surpluses is the need to place the nation's finances in a strong position to prepare for the higher costs we can expect in the future. Many of these costs relate to the growing proportion of the population who will be elderly. New Zealand, like other developed countries, faces substantially increased health and pension costs in the future. The increases in total age-related spending are likely to be significant and long lasting, and so fiscal policy that takes no account of this will lead to an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio starting in around 10 years time. Clearly, rising debt levels would lead to higher debt servicing costs that, in turn, would require funding through lower spending and/or higher taxes. This in turn would create a fiscal position that is vulnerable to economic shocks – a situation previously encountered in New Zealand's history.

Consequently, the government's fiscal strategy is to strengthen public finances over the longer term, to prepare for the future costs associated with an ageing population. To achieve this we set a number of long-term fiscal objectives. They are:

*   to run operating surpluses on average across the economic cycle sufficient to meet New Zealand Superannuation Fund contributions;
*   to meet capital spending pressures and priorities;
*   to ensure that revenue and expenses are consistent with the operating balance objective; and
*   to manage total debt at prudent levels

Some commentators have focused on the size of the operating surplus. They have concluded that there is a large store of cash that, for some inexplicable reason, I refuse to use to increase expenditure or cut taxes further. This view fails to appreciate that the operating surplus is not available solely for tax cuts or expenditure, but is also used to fund capital expenditure, to build up the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, and to maintain debt at prudent levels.

Last year, to strengthen the role of the debt objective as a "fiscal anchor", we lowered the debt-to-GDP objective so that gross sovereign-issued debt as a percentage of GDP would slowly reduce over the longer term, passing through 20 per cent of GDP before 2015. In short, we recognise that a sound fiscal policy is one that takes a longer view, reacting to pressures long before they impact. Only by adopting prudent fiscal management can we advance our key priority areas.

In preparing for this year's budget, I have been careful to ensure that decisions we take now will be consistent with our long-term strategy. Government revenue and expenditure are very large numbers, and shifts of a relatively small magnitude can quickly turn a favourable outlook into an unfavourable one. For example, the forecasts presented in the December Update showed gross debt falling to 19.6 per cent of GDP in 2008/09. But if growth in education and health spending were to continue at recent rates, gross debt would start to rise as a share of GDP beyond 2009. This shows how important it is not to lose sight of the longer-term fiscal position when making short-term decisions.

I have also been very aware that the New Zealand economy, which has outperformed the OECD average over the past five years, is facing capacity constraints. As such, I am wary of putting further pressure on already overstretched sectors of the economy in the coming year.

This forms the backdrop to both the tax policy decisions I am announcing today and the tax and spending policies I shall announce in the budget. As responsible economic managers, we look not only to provide a stable fiscal framework that will support the economy, but we also take active steps to enhance our economic growth prospects. In this year's budget we will continue with the Growth and Innovation Framework, as well as announcing further measures to support labour productivity growth. We will also progress new initiatives to encourage a savings culture, and to assist businesses with compliance.

Budget announcements that will be of particular interest to this audience concern work-based savings, the related issue of the taxation of investment intermediaries, and tax depreciation.

We have an ambitious tax policy work programme. Fiscally, the most significant of the areas I am discussing today relate to tax simplification and fringe benefit tax proposals.

_Making tax easier for small businesses_

I turn first to tax simplification for small businesses.

Two years ago the government put out for consultation a series of proposals designed to make tax compliance easier for small businesses, a sector of the economy that can be disproportionately affected by such costs.

One of those proposals was to make available a new 6.7 per cent discount – the equivalent of a 10 per cent pre-tax discount – to many self-employed people and members of partnerships in their first year of business if they make early payments of tax during that first year. The idea is for the government to help reduce some of the financial strain that small businesses face in their first three years of business. The discount has been enacted and came into effect this month.

The fiscal cost of the discount is estimated to be negligible over the forecast period, 2005/06 to 2008/09.

Three other proposals from the same source have now worked their way through the policy process and are set to be included in a taxation bill planned for introduction in late May. They relate to the alignment of payment dates for provisional tax and GST, basing provisional tax payments on GST turnover, and a subsidy to payroll agents for meeting PAYE-related compliance costs imposed on small employers.

Inland Revenue research has shown that the two most significant tax compliance costs faced by small businesses are: the time needed to fill out forms; and the fact that provisional tax payments are not aligned with cash flow. Businesses and individuals pay provisional tax in three large instalments during the year, and most pay GST every two or six months. However, many of the small businesses that were consulted said they would prefer to pay provisional tax more frequently, to help with their budgeting.

As a result of the consultation process, the alignment proposal in the forthcoming taxation bill will be a modified version of that floated in the discussion document. The current three provisional tax payments will be aligned to GST due dates, and small businesses will be able to make voluntary payments during the year.

This should suit most businesses. Those who want to pay more frequently, as they earn their income, can make six payments a year. On the other hand, those who do not want to pay provisional tax more frequently will be able to continue with the three payment date system.

A complementary change in the tax bill will give GST-registered businesses the option of basing their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST turnover. This will suit businesses that have seasonal income, since their tax payments will be more closely aligned with income flow.

These two measures are estimated to have a combined cost over the forecast period of around $100 million. The impact on the operating balance looks much larger because the deferral of payment dates by about two months will shift $760 million of tax revenue out of 2007/08.

I confidently predict that this particular aspect of the budget will be misunderstood and misinterpreted by those who have a reason to do so, but I am not going to let sensible tax reforms be stymied by such efforts. It is the longer term fiscal position of the government, rather than yearly changes, that should drive decision-making.

_PAYE subsidy_

The third major change in the bill arising from the discussion document on making tax easier for small business concerns the introduction of a subsidy to encourage small businesses to take advantage of the help that payroll agents can give them in meeting their PAYE obligations.

When businesses take on their first employees they take on a whole new set of payroll obligations, which – in addition to PAYE – include deducting child support and student loan payments from staff wages. Using a payroll agent can help with the extra work, but that is not something most small businesses do.

The subsidy will be paid to payroll agents in respect of a maximum of five employees of a small business. The bill will introduce a mechanism that allows a subsidy to be set by regulation for an amount that will be decided by negotiation with payroll agents.

Although this measure does not have an impact on the government's tax forecasts, it will have an impact on expenditure, estimated at $45 million over the forecast period.

_FBT changes_

Changes resulting from the government's review of fringe benefit tax will also be included in the forthcoming bill. The focus of the review, which began in 2002, has been on simplifying and improving FBT so as to reduce compliance costs, while dealing with base maintenance and tax policy concerns. Over $400 million in revenue was raised from FBT in the year ending March 2004, two-thirds of which was from motor vehicles provided by employers.

The tax treatment of motor vehicles was the main concern of the majority of those who made submissions, both when we invited submissions on the issues people thought the review should cover, and later when we released a discussion document setting out proposals.

The package of changes that I shall outline shortly has involved extensive consultation with business and stakeholder groups.

The government has decided not to proceed with all the proposals canvassed earlier. For example, the proposal to extend the FBT rules to include car parks provided by employers in the CBDs of major cities will not proceed. While such a change could be justified on policy grounds, submissions expressed a great deal of concern about its practical application.

Nor will there be any change to the FBT boundary for vehicles used for both business and private purposes. Submissions considered it to be a key area where change was needed, and not surprisingly, the overwhelming view of submissions favoured the most fiscally expensive option; that is, to retain the exemption for work-related vehicles but also halve the FBT rate on other vehicles used primarily for work purposes. The fiscal cost of this was too high for this year's budget, amounting to over $60 million a year, or $190 million over the forecast period.

The issues here are complex and require distinctions to be made between private and business use as well as between the cost to a firm of making a fringe benefit available to an employee and the value of the benefit the employee receives. I have therefore instructed officials to undertake further policy work in this area, in order to achieve the best balance between the appropriate recognition of the business use of a vehicle and the need to tax the private benefit element.

The bill in May will, however, introduce several changes to the FBT treatment of motor vehicles, including the following:

*   Owners will have the extra option of calculating the motor vehicle fringe benefit based on a vehicle's tax book value as an alternative to using the vehicle's cost price.
*   In recognition of lower real motoring costs since the 1980s, the fringe benefit valuation rate applying to the cost price of a motor vehicle will be reduced from 24 per cent to 20 per cent of the cost. The equivalent tax book value rate will be 36 per cent.
*   The treatment of leased vehicles will be aligned with that of owned vehicles, meaning that the fringe benefit from a leased vehicle will be based on its cost or tax book value – rather than its market value, as at present.

The bill will also include a number of FBT changes that are not related to motor vehicles. For example, the minimum value thresholds applying to unclassified fringe benefits will be raised, to reduce compliance costs. The employee minimum value threshold will go up from $75 to $200 per quarter, and the employer threshold will rise from $450 a quarter to $15,000 a year. This will reduce compliance costs for businesses by reducing the need to measure and account for FBT for minor benefits. For some it will mean that FBT returns will no longer need to be filed.

Similarly, the private use of employer-owned or leased business tools such as cell phones and laptop computers will be exempted from FBT when they are provided to employees primarily for business purposes, as long as they cost no more than $5000. The change recognises that it is difficult and therefore expensive for employers to monitor and value the private use of these items. For example, when a business provides laptops to employees it will no longer have to worry about FBT liabilities should the computer occasionally be used to play games.

These are some of the main features of the FBT changes to be included in the bill. Subject to the progress of the legislation, the changes will apply from 1 April next year.

The overall fiscal cost of the fringe benefit tax measures is estimated to be $28 million a year, or $84 million over the forecast period.

_FIF rules & Australian superannuation funds_

I am also proposing changes that will help to resolve problems associated with the New Zealand tax treatment of accrued entitlements in foreign superannuation schemes. The issue was raised at last year's Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum in the context of Australia's Superannuation Guarantee Scheme.

In Australia, employers generally make compulsory contributions into Australian superannuation funds on behalf of employees, who do not generally have access to their superannuation entitlements until they reach retirement age. Those who come to New Zealand for long-term or permanent employment – whether Australians or returning New Zealanders – may be required to pay tax on those or subsequent entitlements under our foreign investment fund rules.

There are exemptions under the rules, but determining what qualifies is not always easy and can create high compliance costs for the people involved. Moreover, business feedback has been that the potential tax consequences are a disincentive to people taking up permanent or long-term employment here – and this at a time when the government is looking at a variety of measures to attract highly skilled people to New Zealand.

Subject to the outcome of further work by officials, we propose to exempt specified Australian employment-related superannuation schemes from the foreign investment fund rules. We will need to work with Australia on the proper scope of any exemption. For example, should it encompass all Australian superannuation schemes generally, rather than be limited to employment-related superannuation schemes? That is one of the matters to be considered.

Maintaining the open labour market between Australia and New Zealand is a major benefit of CER. The superannuation issue is an impediment to that aim so is a top priority for the Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum, which is being held in Melbourne today.

I hope to be in a position to make specific decisions on the matter so that any amending legislation can be included in the first taxation bill to be introduced next year.

The foreign investment fund rules will also be amended to make more generous the current exemption for interests in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes. At present, the exemption applies only to new migrants and only to entitlements acquired while the person concerned was not a resident of New Zealand. The May bill will extend the exemption to returning New Zealanders as well.

It will also cover all entitlements that were acquired when the individual was resident overseas as well as those acquired up to the end of the fifth year of each new period of New Zealand residence. The exemption will take effect for persons who become resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006.

_Foreign trusts_

The government's proposed foreign trust policy is another area where we have worked extensively with affected taxpayers to produce good, workable tax policy.

Under current law, foreign trusts that have New Zealand-resident trustees but receive no New Zealand income are not required to provide information to Inland Revenue on a regular basis, or to keep New Zealand tax records. There is no need for that, since they are not taxed here, and rightly so, because they are outside our tax base. However, a problem arises for the tax authorities when other countries with whom we have double tax agreements request tax information on foreign trusts that have a presence here, as they are entitled to do under those treaties.

This has been of particular concern to the Australian government. Our bilateral relationship with Australia is critical to us but, at the same time, we do not want to impose rules that unnecessarily hinder legitimate New Zealand business. We have therefore worked with those who will be most affected by any policy changes in this area.

The government has sought to develop policy that works for all concerned, one that enables New Zealand to co-operate with other tax jurisdictions while not disrupting the legitimate financial transactions of foreign trusts. There have been two rounds of very productive consultation involving people such as trustees who act for foreign trusts and overseas practitioners who advise their clients on the use of New Zealand's foreign trust rules.

As a result, New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts will have to provide only limited information to Inland Revenue when the changes take effect and keep financial records in New Zealand for each trust. At least one New Zealand resident trustee of each trust will be required to be a member of an organisation that has been approved by Inland Revenue, such as an accounting or legal organisation.

Trustees will not be required to provide detailed financial information to Inland Revenue unless a trust has an Australian resident settler, or one of our partners to a double tax agreement requests information.

The changes will be included in the forthcoming taxation bill and, once enacted, are expected to apply from April next year.

_Unbundling payouts from co-operatives_

We often work closely with business on tax consequences that arise from broader commercial initiatives. For example, the government was recently asked to respond to the tax consequences that arose out of Fonterra's proposal to "unbundle" payouts to member shareholders.

Unbundling would provide greater transparency for member shareholders. Separating out the components of the payout would improve price signalling and give member shareholders better information about the company's performance.

The tax consequence, however, is that if the payout is unbundled, there is a risk that the part of the value-added portion of the payout that is related to non-member transactions, would be treated as a dividend. This might mean that the company would not be able to claim a deduction for the amount and would then have to pay the tax itself.

The government was able to move quickly on the matter, with policy officials meeting with all affected parties to work out a legislative solution to the tax problem, and consulting widely with other interested parties to ensure that its application is consistent for all co-operatives.

The result is that the forthcoming bill will contain an amendment confirming the full deductibility of payouts, including the entire value-added portion, by co-operative companies to members. In this way the tax rules will not be an impediment to a move that has a broader commercial rationale.

_Taxation of foreign hybrids_

In a similar manner, the government has been working with business to resolve a problem relating to the taxation of New Zealand investments into fiscally transparent foreign entities, which are generally known as "foreign hybrids".

These entities, which have become more common over the past ten or fifteen years, have the characteristics of both companies and partnerships. Like companies, they have limited liability and sometimes a separate legal personality, but tax is paid by the partners or shareholders rather than the entity itself.

The problem arises because a foreign hybrid is taxed as a company in New Zealand but may be taxed as a partnership elsewhere. In that case, foreign tax credits for foreign tax paid by the New Zealand investors are not available to New Zealand owners of the entity. Another problem is that a foreign hybrid cannot qualify for the so-called "grey list" exemption.

Policy officials have worked with groups such as ICANZ, the Law Society and the Corporate Taxpayer group to find a practical legislative solution. The result is an amendment in the May bill that will ensure that tax credits will be available to New Zealand investors for foreign tax paid in relation to foreign hybrids and that foreign hybrids will be eligible for the grey list exemption.

The change will therefore align the tax treatment of investments into foreign hybrid vehicles with the treatment of investments into other foreign companies.

_Limited partnerships_

Some tax consequences will also arise from government plans to modernize the special partnership legislation in the Partnership Act 1908, replacing it with special rules on limited partnerships, which will have a separate legal personality. The aim is to remove tax and regulatory barriers that impede the flow of foreign venture capital into New Zealand and to create rules that will provide clarity to investors and reflect international best practice.

Limited partnerships developed in the United States and have now become the preferred method of investment, especially for venture capital. Countries such as Australia and Singapore have recently introduced limited partnership rules so that they can attract foreign investment.

New Zealand needs to keep up with these developments if we want this valuable flow of funds, and we shall do so.

The Minister of Commerce will be announcing the details of the reform later today.

This has implications for tax, since entities with separate legal status are taxed as companies under current tax law, although investors will doubtless want to retain "flow-through" treatment for tax purposes. Therefore it would seem that substantial tax changes will be needed, but further policy work will determine their nature and scope. I hope to be able to release a discussion document on proposals for dealing with the tax-related issues later this year.

_Geothermal exploration & development_

Policy work is also under way on the tax treatment of geothermal exploration and development. A number of concerns have been raised about the lack of tax certainty in relation to geothermal exploration and development activities. This is a situation that some within the industry regard as disadvantageous. As a matter of priority, tax policy officials will be working with the industry to develop more workable tax rules, and if all goes well I hope to be able to include changes in the first taxation bill to be introduced next year.

_Privilege_

Finally, I want to mention the issue of extending legal-type privilege to non-legal tax advisers. As you know, the matter is in legislation currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The legislation requires more than normal development in select committee because of the tight timetable to get this into the last taxation bill. I am following the issue closely, and my policy officials are working with those involved to ensure that we achieve a workable regime that meets the objectives I have previously discussed with many of you. I am totally confident that we shall achieve a good outcome.

To conclude, the measures I have announced today are the result of government working with business to improve our tax system. I appreciate the effort that many of you have put into consultation to produce this result, and I thank you for that.

The announced measures do not come without a fiscal price tag for the government. The total fiscal cost of the tax simplification and fringe benefit tax measures is estimated to be $230 million over the forecast period. There are real tax reductions and real benefits to business. I will be announcing further tax measures in the budget. The overall "business package" in the budget will be partly funded by revenue from a carbon tax, details of which will be announced shortly.

I wish you a very successful conference, and trust I have provided you with some additional topics of discussion.

Looking ahead, I am quite proud that in the election later this year we will go to the country and offer more of the same.

Thank you.

### Tax changes to reduce costs of business

The costs of doing business in New Zealand will be reduced through a series of tax changes proposed by the government, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today.

A taxation bill to be introduced next month will contain a number of measures of special relevance to small and medium-sized businesses, he told the International Fiscal Association conference in Christchurch.

"The changes are part of the government's drive to simplify tax and reduce business compliance costs," Dr Cullen said. "They will be complemented by a further – larger - tax package to assist business and economic growth in the May budget.

"The three payment dates for provisional tax will be aligned with the GST due dates, to reduce the number of payment dates. Small businesses that want to pay provisional tax more frequently, to help with their budgeting may choose to make six payments a year, rather than three larger payments.

"A complementary change will give GST-registered businesses the option of basing their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST turnover. This will suit businesses with seasonal income, since their tax payments will be more closely aligned with income flow.

"Also to be introduced is a new subsidy for small businesses employing payroll agencies. When a business takes on its first employees it takes on a whole new set of payroll obligations, which include not only PAYE work but also deducting child support and student loan payments from staff wages.

"The amount of the subsidy, which will come into effect on 1 April next year and be paid on up to five employees, will be decided by negotiation with payroll agents and introduced on a trial basis with a review after two years," Dr Cullen said.

The provisional tax reforms will have a phased implementation:

*   The due date for payments of GST will change from the last working day of the month to the 28th of the month, with effect from taxable periods ending on or after 31 March 2006.
*   Provisional taxpayers will begin paying provisional tax along with their GST payments and will be able to base their provisional tax on a percentage of their GST sales with effect from the beginning of the 2007-08 income year.

### Fringe benefit tax changes

The fringe benefit tax rules will be improved to reduce business compliance costs, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

"Under the new rules, to come into effect from 1 April next year, employers will be able to calculate the motor vehicle fringe benefit based on a vehicle's tax book value as an alternative to using the vehicle's cost price.

"In recognition of lower real motoring costs since the 1980s, when the rules were introduced, the FBT valuation rate applying to the cost price of a motor vehicle will be reduced from 24 per cent to 20 per cent of the cost. The equivalent tax book value rate will be 36 per cent.

"Also, the FBT treatment of leased vehicles will be aligned with that of owned vehicles, meaning that the fringe benefit from a leased vehicle will be based on its cost or tax book value – rather than its market value, as at present.

"The minimum value thresholds applying to miscellaneous fringe benefits will be raised. The employee minimum value threshold will go up from $75 to $200 per quarter, and the employer threshold will rise from $450 a quarter to $15,000 a year. This will lower compliance costs for businesses by reducing the need to measure and account for FBT for minor benefits. For some it will mean that FBT returns will no longer need to be filed.

"The private use of employer-owned or leased business tools such as cell phones and laptop computers will be exempted from FBT when they are provided to employees primarily for business purposes, as long as they cost no more than $5000 each.

"The change recognises that it is difficult and therefore expensive for employers to monitor and value the private use of these items. For example, when a business provides laptops to employees it will no longer have to worry about FBT liabilities should the computer occasionally be used to play games, Dr Cullen said.

Full information on these and other planned FBT changes will be available when the bill is introduced next month.

### Rule changes for NZ based foreign trusts

A forthcoming law change will require foreign trusts with New Zealand-resident trustees to provide some tax information to the Inland Revenue Department, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The change, due to come into effect on 1 April next year, will enable New Zealand to meet international commitments to disclosure of information with other tax jurisdictions, Dr Cullen told the International Fiscal Association conference in Christchurch.

"Foreign trusts that have New Zealand-resident trustees but receive no New Zealand income are not currently required to provide information to Inland Revenue on a regular basis, or to keep New Zealand tax records," Dr Cullen said.

### New tax rules on foreign super schemes

The government will introduce tax changes to improve the New Zealand tax treatment of accrued entitlements in foreign superannuation schemes, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

"The superannuation issue is a tax impediment to maintaining an open labour market between Australia and New Zealand, which is a major benefit of CER, Dr Cullen told the International Fiscal Association conference today.

Carbon tax policy detailed
==========================

The government today announced details of its carbon tax policy and released a consultation paper seeking feedback on how the tax is to be implemented. The carbon tax will apply to fossil fuels when they are imported or produced and to certain other emissions of greenhouse gases from large geothermal developments and manufacturing processes. It will be set at $15 per tonne of carbon dioxide or carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions, is expected to come into effect on 1 April 2007, and will be collected by Inland Revenue and the Customs Service.

### Government adds detail to 2002 carbon tax policy

The government today gave further detail on its carbon tax policy, first announced in 2002, and released a consultation paper on technical implementation design.

"Climate change is a direct threat to the New Zealand environment, economy, and way of life. This government takes that threat seriously and is acting responsibly to protect New Zealand's interests," says Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson. "We stand by commitments made by successive governments to act. We are proud to be one of 150 nations that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol."

The carbon tax will be set at $15 per tonne and introduced in April 2007. As outlined in 2002, this will add around one cent to the cost of a unit of electricity, about 4 cents to a litre of petrol, 46 cents to a 9kg bottle of LPG and 68 cents to a 20kg bag of coal. The impact on the typical Kiwi household will total about $4 per week for electricity, petrol, and other fuels. It has been designed to allow for a future transition to emissions trading.

"If we are going to tackle climate change, we need to start taking environmental costs into account in the economic choices we make. The carbon tax introduces a price differential between clean and polluting energy sources that reflects their environmental costs, so individuals and businesses can make informed choices."

The carbon tax will not lead to an increase in government revenue. Net proceeds from the tax will be used for tax changes elsewhere. These will be announced as part of the business tax package in the budget.

"As tax tends to dissuade consumption it makes sense to shift it onto those things we want less of such as greenhouse gases. If the revenue raised is used to reduce tax on those things we want more of, such as investment in new technology to make our economy more productive, we can start to make a difference to both.

"The world economy is changing. It is vital for the future of New Zealand that our economy keeps pace with that change, realises that emissions now have a price and that emissions trading is coming. By introducing a carbon tax now, albeit at a modest level, we can begin to make a smooth transition. This government is not prepared to gamble with the future of New Zealand's environment, way of life and economy by failing to take action."

### Questions and answers

_Why a carbon tax?_  
New Zealanders want economic prosperity that also protects the environment and our quality of life. Globally, we cannot continue our present course of ever-increasing emissions without serious environmental, societal and economic impacts.

A carbon tax signals that certain options for fuel and energy come at a cost to society and the environment. This cost can no longer be ignored. The carbon tax ensures that consumers and producers begin to take this cost into account in the choices they make.

In 2002, the Government announced its intention to introduce a carbon tax as part of New Zealand's response to climate change. Revenue from carbon tax will not be used to improve the Crown's fiscal position, but will be returned to the economy through other tax changes. A carbon tax won't change emissions overnight, but it begins a process of transition to a low emissions future that is needed to help reduce the risks of climate change for future generations.

_Isn't this just the Government adding more money to its coffers?_  
No. The aim of the tax is to protect our environment, not to raise revenue. Revenue collected as a result of the tax will be used for tax changes elsewhere. The details of how the Government will use the carbon tax revenue will be announced as part of the business tax package in the 2005 Budget.

_How much money is involved?_  
After Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements are accounted for, the carbon tax is expected to raise approximately $360M per year. The details of how the Government will recycle this revenue back into the economy will be announced as part of the business tax package in the 2005 Budget.

_What other countries have a carbon tax?_  
Several European countries have carbon taxes including the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Switzerland. Most countries also collect various forms of excise duty on some or all sources of energy, and have done so for some time. The European Union introduced an emissions trading scheme in January 2005, which places annual caps on CO2 emissions. Carbon taxes and emissions trading systems are different ways of achieving the same outcome: that greenhouse gas emissions carry a price that becomes part of normal business decision-making. Other greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes are being developed or implemented in Korea, Norway, Canada, among the Australian states, and among the northeastern states of the USA.

_Why is New Zealand taking on binding commitments when developing countries like China and Malaysia haven't?_  
When the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997, it was recognised that developed countries have caused most of the greenhouse gases to date. Even today, New Zealand's per capita emissions are more than five times those of China. So, to start with, it was developed countries that took on binding targets to reduce emissions, with developing countries instead having obligations to track and report emissions. After 2012, once developed countries have demonstrated that they are willing to take the lead, developing countries will be expected to follow by taking on appropriate commitments.

_Why has New Zealand ratified when Australia and the United States have not?_  
Of the 38 developed countries that negotiated the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, all have ratified except Australia, Monaco and the United States. The government believes it is in New Zealand's best interests to work with the other 149 countries that have ratified the Protocol, rather than acting independently.

_What will the overall impact be on the economy?_  
A very small but negative impact on economic activity (measured by GDP) is expected. Depending on the international emissions price, GDP in 2010 is likely to be in the order of 0.03% lower than it would otherwise have been. \[NB 0.03% total change, not 0.03% per annum\]

_How will the tax be implemented?_  
The obligation to pay the tax will be imposed as early in the supply chain as possible i.e. for NZ-produced coal and gas the obligation will be at point of first sale, for imported coal it will be when it crosses the border, and for liquid fossil fuels it will be when they leave the Marsden Point oil refinery or when they cross the border. This means that most firms will not be directly involved in paying the tax. Instead, they will see its effect through costs passed on by energy suppliers, especially fossil fuels and electricity.

_Couldn't the carbon tax put New Zealand's international competitiveness at risk?_  
No. The Government has introduced Negotiated Greenhouse agreements (NGAs) to prevent the risk of businesses moving from New Zealand to countries with less stringent climate change policies. That policy has also been recently reviewed in order to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of the process.

_Then aren't Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements simply a 'free ride' for big business?_  
No. In return for exemption from the tax, NGAs comprise a contractual agreement by the firm or industry to reduce emissions intensity to 'world's best practice' levels. This involves a legally-binding commitment by the company regarding the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of its operations. There would be financial consequences if their commitments are not met.

_What is the government doing to assist small and medium sized businesses manage the transition to the carbon tax?_  
There is a range of services available to assist businesses to reduce the effect of the carbon tax by improving energy efficiency. These services include information about simple, no or low-cost actions available to all firms (see [www.eeca.govt.nz](https://www.eeca.govt.nz/)
). Businesses can benefit from undertaking measures to improve energy efficiency and save on fuel costs, particularly in the areas of fleet management and efficient electrical equipment.

The government will also run pilot grants and demonstration schemes from 2005 to evaluate measures to assist small energy intensive businesses to adjust to a carbon tax. This includes the irrigated dairying and arable crops farming sectors. It will be targeted at technologies that offer significant potential energy savings. EECA and the Ministry for the Environment's Climate Change Office will work with industry associations to identify firms that would be willing to host demonstration projects. The pilot will enable business and government to work together to further assess and address the adjustment needs of industry prior to the introduction of the carbon tax in 2007.

_So where will the majority of New Zealanders see the impact of the carbon tax?_  
Most New Zealanders will notice the carbon tax through increases in the price of petrol, diesel, gas and electricity. Whilst small in comparison with the price fluctuations often experienced due to changes in world oil prices or the New Zealand exchange rate for example, the price increases from the carbon tax begin to signal the environmental and economic costs of climate change.

In the two years between now and when the tax is implemented, New Zealanders have time to make energy and fuel-efficient choices, and the government will be providing information to assist consumers who want to implement low and no-cost actions to save energy and reduce their bills.

_What about commuters – they still need to get from A to B and now it's going to cost them more?_  
Simple things can be done to keep costs down. Basic energy efficient practices around the home and on the road can also save money on power bills and fuel costs. For example, keeping tyre pressure correct and cars tuned regularly can save on fuel costs, while good insulation is not only warmer and healthier but can also save money on electricity. There are also two years before the tax is implemented for New Zealanders to make their energy and fuel choices that may include more fuel-efficient car purchases.

_What about people on fixed incomes?_  
Superannuation is now indexed to CPI changes, so benefits will be adjusted to account for price changes such as those resulting from the carbon tax.

_What does the carbon tax mean for coal-fired electricity generation?_  
The carbon tax does not rule out use of coal, it simply means that environmental costs will now be taken into account in project economics. If coal or gas-fired power generation can still compete once environmental costs are included, then companies can still choose to bring such projects forward.

_Won't a carbon tax just make it harder for electricity security?_  
No. In fact electricity generators have indicated that the setting of the price of carbon as soon as possible will give greater certainty for business planning and investment decisions.

_What about coal use at home?_  
The price impact will be 68cents on a 20kg bag of coal. To help those consumers who wish to make a change in their coal-burning home heating, the Ministry for the Environment is investigating ways to help New Zealanders improve the warmth of their homes and upgrade to cleaner heating sources. The primary driver for these investigations is to improve the air quality in New Zealand's towns and cities, but it will also have climate change and health benefits.

_Some countries have opted for emissions trading instead of a carbon tax. Why did New Zealand not pick that route?_  
At present, international emissions markets are immature, making trading difficult and prices variable and unpredictable. We view the carbon tax as a transitional path toward full or partial emissions trading, which may become a better option as world markets develop. A tax gives firms a greater level of certainty about the price of emissions in the interim.

_Why not wait until after 2012 and go straight to emissions trading then?_  
If New Zealand does nothing while awaiting the development of international markets, our emissions will continue to rise as will the future cost of reducing them. A low-level carbon tax (offset by the reduction of other taxes) sends a signal about the price of emissions that will, at the margin, influence investments in energy generation and use. If we can begin to curb our growth in greenhouse gas emissions now, we will be better placed to make a smooth transition to more challenging commitments after 2012.

_Why not use our forestry sinks to free ride until 2012, instead of introducing a carbon tax?_  
When the National Party's Simon Upton negotiated the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, he made a commitment that sink credits would not be used to shield the New Zealand economy from the international price of emissions. This commitment was important in getting agreement for sinks to be included in the Kyoto framework. Future negotiations on the inclusion of sinks after 2012, worth billions of dollars to New Zealand, could be hampered if New Zealand was to backtrack on this commitment.

More importantly, sinks provide us with a temporary buffer that will allow New Zealand to make the transition to a low-emissions future at a lower cost than many other countries. The responsible approach is to use this buffer period to undertake the necessary economic shifts, so that the New Zealand economy will be positioned well to take advantage of a low-emissions future, rather than struggling to catch up.

_Why are you announcing further information about the tax now, when it doesn't come in until 2007?_  
There is a need for certainty about how the tax will be applied, particularly for energy supply investment decisions over the next few years. To address any uncertainty the Government is indicating now the level of the carbon tax, how it will be applied and when it will come into effect.

_How did the Government come up with the price of $15 per tonne?_  
This price was deemed appropriate given the current and projected price of emissions globally. If the international price changes dramatically and for a sustained period, it is possible this rate could be reconsidered. However, the Government is clear that the price will be capped at NZ$25 per tonne to the end of the first commitment period in 2012.

_What greenhouse gas emissions will be subject to the carbon tax?_  
In general the tax will be applicable to emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from fossil fuel and geothermal sources. The tax will also apply to all greenhouse gases that are emitted from industrial processes. The NGA process will result in exemption from the tax for some emitters in return for binding obligations managing their emissions.

_Methane and nitrous oxide from the agriculture sector accounts for almost half of New Zealand's greenhouse gases – why are they not being taxed?_  
It has been the government's policy since 2002 that no carbon tax will be imposed on methane or nitrous oxide for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. This is because, unlike most sectors that produce emissions, there are currently limited means of reducing agricultural emissions without reducing output.

The Government and the agriculture sector have signed a Memorandum of Understanding agreement on voluntary research to find ways of reducing these emissions. This partnership is supported by an industry-led research strategy which aims to develop safe, cost-effective greenhouse gas abatement technologies that will reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock and soils.

_What will happen after 2012?_  
In international negotiations, New Zealand will be seeking broader international participation in binding commitments after 2012. It is also likely that deeper cuts in emissions from all parties will be needed.

New Zealand may move to an emissions trading regime once international markets are sufficiently robust. Implementing a carbon tax from 2008-2012 will set the New Zealand economy up better for deeper commitments and emissions trading than if we were to do nothing in the interim.

### Budget 2005

### $4.45 million for carbon tax mitigation

The government today announced the scale of the pilot grants, training and education package to help energy intensive small and medium size enterprises take up energy saving technologies to offset the impact of the carbon tax.

$4.45 million will be made available for the pilot programme over the next three years.

"The government realises that there are a number of energy intensive small and medium sized enterprises that might be adversely affected by the tax. While many larger companies are applying for Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements, the transaction costs involved for individual smaller companies might be prohibitive. That is why we are piloting a programme to help them overcome the barriers to adopting energy efficient technologies and practices," says Convenor, Ministerial Group on Climate Change, Pete Hodgson.

The package is being developed in partnership with representatives of energy intensive businesses. It will be rolled out from 01 July this year and closely monitored to ensure that it is developed in a way that meets the needs of business.

R&D tax changes announced
=========================

Tax changes announced today will improve access to deductions for R&D expenditure when companies bring in new equity investors after their initial development stage. The changes are part of a business tax package in next week's Budget, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said in a speech to the Canterbury Manufacturers Association. The R&D changes will be part of a forthcoming taxation bill and apply from the 2005-06 income year.

### Budget 2005 to focus on long game

"Budget 2005 will focus on the long game," Finance Minister Michael Cullen told a meeting of the Canterbury Manufacturers' Association in Christchurch today.

"That means creating an environment in which businesses can make investment decisions with increasing assurance. It means long term fiscal and monetary stability, and a programme of careful public investment in those things which underpin a modern, knowledge based economy," Dr Cullen said.

He announced provision in the budget to improve access to tax deductions for R&D expenditure where companies bring in new equity investors after their initial development stage, as commonly happens in the technology sector. \[Refer attached [fact sheet](/news/2005/2005-05-12-rd-tax-changes-announced#fact)\
 for more details.\]

Dr Cullen said the change built on the new R&D rules introduced by the government in 2001 and was part of a multi-faceted package of business tax cuts provided for in the budget. Measures designed to reduce compliance costs, especially for smaller firms, had already been announced with a further suite of announcements scheduled for budget day.

He said the budget would continue a "conservative fiscal approach." The budget numbers would show the rate of debt reduction flattening out, leaving little room for large new initiatives, including tax cuts, if the government was to stick to its long term debt commitments.

"In fact, the budget will signal an intention to lower the growth trajectory in high spend areas such as health and tertiary education. Spending in both these sectors has expanded considerably in recent years. We need to be satisfied that the taxpayer is getting value for money and that efficiency gains are realised, reducing the need for ongoing, large increases in expenditure," Dr Cullen said.

Speech Notes

### Speech to Canterbury Manufacturers' Association

_Holiday Inn on Avon, 356 Oxford Terrace, Christchurch_

What I would like to discuss today is the broad economic and fiscal background to this year's budget, so that, come next Thursday, the reason for the detailed choices the government has made will become apparent.

The over-riding theme of this year's budget, as with the past five budgets, is the need to play the long game, to ensure that our economic fundamentals remain strong. That means creating an environment in which businesses can make investment decisions with increasing assurance. It means long-term fiscal and monetary stability, and a programme of careful public investment in those things which underpin a modern, knowledge-based economy. Things like high quality infrastructure, world-class education, and the social services and environmental and cultural values that make New Zealand a place where skilled people want to live and do their best work.

One of the implications of a long-term approach is the need to resist the advocates of 'kick-start' economic policy. New Zealand has fallen prey to this in the past couple of decades: an argument that if we only cut taxes here, slash spending there, de-regulate, sell public assets, privatise education or health, then a cornucopia of riches will be released into our laps.

The reality has never been that simple, although each time the economy enters the rough end of the business cycle these ideas rear their heads again. This is where we are coming to now, as the slowdown in growth that has been confidently predicted in each of the last three years appears to be arriving.

This will be one of the most comprehensively heralded downturns in recent history. Indeed there is something of a tone of relief amongst the commentators who have feared that they have been crying wolf for the last three years.

Nevertheless, to misquote Tolstoy, while happy economies all resemble each other, each unhappy economy is unhappy in its own way. For that reason it is important that we understand the facts as they stand.

The latest figures show that New Zealand’s rate of economic growth slowed further in the final quarter of last year and was even weaker than most commentators expected. Although there were indications of a bounce back in the March 2005 quarter, economic growth has probably peaked in the year to December 2004 and while remaining positive is likely to slow in the second half of 2005.

The slowdown is due primarily to a moderating of domestic demand, which has been at full steam for quite some time. Private consumption increased 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, down from 1.7 per cent in September, while residential investment fell 3.8 per cent and other investment fell 0.8 per cent.

If we look beyond the domestic sector, things start to look more promising:

*   The labour market is still extraordinarily strong, with unemployment at 20 year lows.
*   The net external sector (that is, exports minus imports) made a positive contribution to growth in December for the first time since March 2003.
*   The December quarter saw an 8.5 per cent seasonally adjusted rise in merchandise export volumes, together with a 0.8 per cent lift in the terms of trade. This drove a reduction in the seasonally adjusted goods deficit from $928 million in September to $658 million in December.
*   Prices for our commodity exports continue to rise, with the ANZ's World Commodity Price Index up 1 per cent in March, with prices for dairy, beef and lamb at or near record levels.

The current account for the December 2004 quarter showed a seasonally adjusted deficit of $2.5 billion, and in annual terms the current account deficit widened to $9.4 billion, or 6.4 per cent of GDP. The largest component contribution to the quarterly deficit figure was an investment income deficit of $2.35 billion. What that says in part is that we are delivering better returns to overseas investors than our own investors are earning offshore.

Indeed the overall picture is one of a small, fundamentally strong economy that cannot escape forever the weakness in the global economy, in particular as it translates itself into the exchange rate. There will be an eventual return of the kiwi to something closer to its historical post-float average. But for many here, the difficulty is "eventual" may be some time arriving.

Already this exchange rate push has been longer and stronger than the previous two. That has largely been because of prolonged US dollar weakness, a factor over which we have no control or influence. As for the market's irrational exuberance over New Zealand's dollar, there is by definition little rational response the government can make.

So we are entering a period of economic slowdown that looks set to continue for 2005 and into 2006. Instead of barrelling along on the open road at the rate of 4 per cent plus per annum, we have entered a built up area and are reducing speed, heading to around 2.4 per cent by March 2006.

We need to bear in mind that, in economics, provided that the fundamentals remain strong, what goes down must come back up.

So how strong are our economic fundamentals? Stronger than we had realised, as evidenced by our continued solid performance through three years when global conditions started to turn against us. And certainly stronger than they were five years ago by a considerable margin.

We have continued to diversify into a broader range of products, and are shifting the balance away from commodities to high-value niche goods and services.

We are also diversifying our markets, and reaping the rewards of improved market access. The government has made it a priority to continue the momentum in the World Trade Organisation’s multilateral round of negotiations.

We worked hard to ensure the Doha Round was started three years ago. We now have an historic commitment to eliminate export subsidies - the most egregious form of trade distorting support - as well as firm prospects of a substantial improvement in market access for all products. This includes non-agricultural market access which incorporates sectors of major importance to New Zealand, such as forestry and fisheries

We are also putting significant effort into bilateral trade negotiations. We are currently negotiating a free trade agreement with China, where the potential for growth is enormous across the whole of the export sector.

We are making good progress on other fronts, including the ASEAN nations, a bilateral agreement with Mexico, and the "Pacific 3" agreement with Singapore and Chile.

Some major challenges still face us, but we have already made significant progress.

We know we need to upgrade our key infrastructures, and the last five years have seen a turnaround in public investment in this area. In the 1990s New Zealand lost the plot somewhat with respect to maintaining investment in infrastructure. We were perhaps too busy seeking for the perfect regulatory framework for electricity, tinkering with the funding regime for roading and exploring the boundaries of the Resource Management Act to ask the essential questions about whether we were putting enough resources into infrastructure to meet future demand.

In the last five years we have had to play a game of catch up. For example, in the years from 1994 to 2000 net purchase of physical assets by government amounted to an average of $800 million per annum. Over the period 2001 to 2008 we have increased that by over 70 per cent.

Playing catch up is never an easy position to be in, especially because there are many competing interests, difficult issues of sequencing projects and very real constraints on the capacity of the construction industry to deliver. I think we have succeeded reasonably well in allocating new resources in sensible way and in forging the kind of local and regional strategies that give a logic to infrastructure investment, rather than it being simply a matter of ad hoc decisions.

We also know we need to grow the productivity of our workforce, especially in an environment where labour force participation is at an historic high. That is something we have been attacking from a number of angles, including getting better focus in our tertiary education system, increasing our investment in industry training and more proactive immigration policies and practices. We have also been addressing it by reducing the barriers to workforce participation amongst those have young children, but want to maintain a career.

So what are the implications of all this for Budget 2005? Primarily a need to stay the course we have been following. That means a focus on fiscal stability and maintaining prudent levels of debt, and on careful control of government expenditure.

Our record of economic and fiscal management speaks for itself. It has been founded on a conservative approach to government expenditure and debt, and a proactive approach to returning the economy to a higher growth path.

New Zealand will again have a set of government accounts that is envied throughout the world, and that has been achieved by careful management rather than by an excess of taxation. Tax rates on businesses in New Zealand are lower than in Australia, once the total picture of state and commonwealth taxes and payroll levies is taken into account. And they compare very favourably with other developed nations.

What is more we have set the scene for future fiscal stability by making sizeable transfers to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund in order to partially prefund the cost of the state pension at the height of the demographic bulge towards the middle of the century. Few countries are able to boast of that, and it is a factor that will strengthen our creditworthiness and our economic stability going forward.

Budget 2005 will continue a conservative fiscal approach. Indeed, one thing that will become obvious is the absolute necessity for caution in translating fiscal forecasts into fiscal policies. Recent forecasts have shown fiscal surpluses in the outyears which have caused great excitement and sparked ambitions plans for spending or for tax cuts.

What Budget 2005 will show is the rate of debt reduction flattening right out. There is little room for large new initiatives, including tax cuts, if we are to stick to our long-term debt commitments.

My government is under no illusions as to the importance of managing expenditure. I have already indicated that the government is considering pushing out some capital spending to avoid putting excessive pressure on the construction sector.

Budget 2005 will commit far more resources to health and education than National ever did, but it will also signal an intention to lower the growth trajectory in these high expenditure areas over the long term.

For example, for some years we have been orienting our health spending towards early intervention through better primary care, with the aim not only of improving health status, but also of avoiding the need for more intensive and costly treatment. We must ensure that those efficiency gains are realised and banked, and that the benefits of more enlightened health spending accrue not just to patients but to the taxpayer in the form of reduced expenditure pressures.

Another key area of focus is the control of expenditure on tertiary education. This has seen a considerable expansion in recent years, and without a doubt the vast bulk of this expenditure constitutes a valuable investment in building up the skills of our population, both those entering the workforce and older workers seeking to upskill themselves.

We have been particularly proud of our achievements in expanding industry training, modern apprenticeships and trades training. So too, we are proud of the steady increase in the participation rates amongst Maori and Pacific peoples, who have traditionally been under-represented.

However, we have concerns over the quality of some tertiary provision, and its relevance to the skills that are demanded in the workforce. To some extent, a strong labour market has masked this effect, since any level of proven skill has been enough to secure employment of some sort. In time, however, low quality training will be revealed for what it is.

We are particularly concerned about the increase in sub-degree courses, which, the evidence indicates, deliver little return to students in terms of a measurable increase in earnings capacity. Given the tight labour market, we cannot countenance funding courses which give students the impression that they are gaining marketable skills when they are in fact merely treading water, and attracting subsidies and incurring debt in the process.

I have already indicated that Budget 2005 will include a package of tax changes that are targeted in four key areas:

*   First, encouraging savings and supporting work-based savings, in particular. This includes proposals to remove current inconsistencies in the taxation of investment income;
*   Second, reducing compliance costs for businesses. These include the set of changes I recently announced to Fringe Benefit Tax and aligning GST and provisional tax payment dates.
*   Third, ensuring a more productive use of capital, for example, through changes to tax depreciation rules and the tax treatment of R&D expenditure.

The depreciation changes will ensure that depreciation rates better reflect how assets decline in value and reduce compliance costs for businesses. These changes will be the 2nd stage in the depreciation reforms emerging from last year's officials' issues paper. The first stage, included in the taxation bill currently before the select committee, included changes to the depreciation treatment of patents, the special tax depreciation rules and added to the list of depreciable intangible property.

Since April 2001, new R&D tax rules have provided increased certainty over the tax treatment of R&D expenditure and immediate deductibility of R&D costs that are expensed for accounting purposes under FRS13 provided that the general deductibility provisions are met.

Budget 2005 will improve access to tax deductions for R&D expenditure for companies that bring in new equity investors after their initial development stage. Currently, shareholding changes can result in the company losing its R&D deductions. This is particularly a problem for companies in the technology sector where it is common for additional investors to come in after the initial development work has occurred. This change, to be included in the next tax bill, will enable tax deductions to be retained until they can be offset against income resulting from the company's R&D products. This will remove a tax barrier to R&D investment by allowing R&D deductions to be matched with income from that expenditure.

*   Fourth, improving New Zealand's access to worldwide capital, skills and labour through reducing tax-related barriers to these flows. Firms need access to capital if they are to develop and grow to the optimal level. In legislation enacted last year the government removed a tax barrier to unlisted New Zealand companies accessing offshore equity finance. This measure provided that offshore tax-exempt investors and foreign funds of funds from countries with which we have double tax agreements are exempt from tax when they sell shares in unlisted New Zealand companies. The change targets offshore institutional investors – such as US pension funds, which provide a significant amount of the world's venture capital.

My colleague, the Hon Pete Hodgson, recently announced further changes aimed at removing tax and regulatory barriers to the flow of foreign venture capital into New Zealand. The government intends to update special partnership law by introducing new rules on limited partnerships, which are to have a separate legal personality. Resulting tax changes will be the subject of a discussion document to be released later this year. Further measures aimed at reducing tax-related barriers to the flow of worldwide capital, skills and labour will be announced in the budget.

Whereas across the board tax cuts are likely to be merely stimulatory and to prompt their own undoing by stoking inflation, the benefits of this tax package are tangible and likely to have a real impact on the drivers of economic growth and social stability.

Over the last five years, the government has moved progressively to improve its capacity to deliver a range of assistance to the business sector. In my first budget funding of $68 million (GST incl) was provided for Trade New Zealand and $36 million (GST incl) for Industry New Zealand. Support for New Zealand Trade and Enterprise in 2005/06 will be more than double that in this year’s budget.

Looking across the OECD, New Zealand's business R&D appears fairly low, but the growth in recent years is encouraging. Business R&D has risen from only 0.3 percent of GDP in 2000 to 0.47 percent in 2004 - that's a 57 per cent increase. It's still short of Australia and just under a third of the OECD average, but is heading in the right direction.

The government is playing its part to stimulate business R&D activity through Technology New Zealand, with grants available to improve technological capability and to undertake R&D itself. Government support for business R&D has almost tripled since 1999, increasing from $14 million in 1999/2000 to $41 million in 2004/05.

Consistency and ease of access is important for the effectiveness of R&D support. The government is in the process of streamlining access to related programmes at New Zealand Trade & Enterprise and the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology. Immediate steps are being taken to improve coordination and delivery of support for SMEs. Within the next 12 months we aim to achieve a common system of access for businesses seeking support for R&D.

This kind of incremental improvement in economic fundamentals is what builds long term sustainable growth. In this sense, the major thrust of Budget 2005 is entirely predictable:

*   stable fiscal policy,
*   stable monetary policy,
*   high-quality investment in what really drives our prosperity,
*   minimising the costs of doing business within a business environment that is already amongst the most attractive in the world, and
*   delivering high-quality public services that are value for money.

I have yet to see any credible alternative to this, and definitely not one that gives us a better chance of seeing us through the modest economic downturn that lies ahead of us in the next year to eighteen months.

Thank you.

### Factsheet - Removing barriers to R&D investment

Companies that bring in new equity investors will have better access to tax deductions for R&D expenditure under tax changes to come into effect from this year. Technology companies, in particular, often have a long lead-in period in which they incur major expenditure before realising income from it. Under current law, however, they can lose R&D deductions if they bring in extra investors after their initial development stage.

The changes will cater for the growth cycle of technology companies and remove a barrier to R&D investment by allowing R&D deductions to be matched with income from that expenditure.

**How will it work?**

*   Taxpayers will be able to allocate certain R&D tax deductions to income years after the year in which the related expenditure is incurred. Deductions will not be lost if there is a shareholding change between when the expenditure is incurred and when the deduction is recognised by the taxpayer.
*   The tax treatment will be optional.
*   Those who choose this approach must allocate R&D deductions against income resulting from the R&D expenditure.
*   Most of the pre-commercial production expenditure of start-up technology companies, which typically incur significant expenditure for a long period before any income is realised, will qualify.

**Example:**

A start-up technology company incurs significant expenditure on biotechnology products in the first five years of its existence. At the end of this period it has developed several innovative products with significant commercial potential. The company now needs to bring on board new investors to fund the next stage of development. Under current law, introducing new investors could result in deductions for previous R&D expenditure being forfeited. However, the change will preserve these tax deductions until they can be offset against income resulting from the company's R&D products.

**Where to from here?**

The new rules for R&D investment will be included in a taxation bill to be introduced this month. Once enacted, the new rules will apply from the 2005-06 income year.

### Multi-million dollar suite of pro-business tax cuts

Budget 2005 reinforces the government's commitment to economic growth, delivering a multi-million dollar suite of pro-business tax changes, Finance Minister Michael Cullen says.

He said the package more than delivered on the government's promise to recycle back to business any revenue received from the carbon charge.

"Estimates are that the carbon tax will generate around $720 million over the forecast period ending 30 June 2009. The business tax proposals the government is putting in place are expected to cost almost twice that amount at $1.42 billion.

"This is equivalent to a cut of around 2 per cent in the corporate tax rate. It will deliver a better growth dividend, because the government measures are designed to raise productivity and to support the transition to a knowledge-based economy," Dr Cullen said.

Specific themes of the budget business tax pack are to encourage savings, ensure a more productive use of capital, improve New Zealand's access to worldwide capital, skills and labour, and reduce compliance costs.

#### To encourage savings and support work-based savings:

*   Ensuring portfolio investment by financial intermediaries, such as collective funds, is not overtaxed relative to direct investments.
*   Ensuring that income from these funds is taxed at the individual's correct tax rate, thereby preventing the over-taxation of members earning less than $38,000 a year.

#### To ensure a more productive use of capital:

*   Changing the depreciation rules so that rates better reflect how assets decline in value and to reduce the compliance costs to business.
*   Removing barriers to R&D investment \[announced last week.\]

#### To improve New Zealand's access to worldwide capital, skills and labour:

*   Assisting the recruitment of top talent by providing a temporary tax exemption on the foreign income of new migrants and of New Zealanders who have been non-resident for tax purposes for at least ten years and who come here to work.
*   Making New Zealand more attractive to international investment by aligning our tax rules on securities lending more closely with those of other countries.

#### To reduce compliance costs:\[Announced last month.\]

*   Changes to Fringe Benefit Tax to reduce the fringe benefit valuation rate applying to motor vehicles, raise the minimum value thresholds for unclassified fringe benefits and exempt the private use by employees of work tools where the tool in question costs less than $5000 each.
*   Aligning GST and provisional tax payments to reduce the number of tax payment dates and allowing businesses to base their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST turnover.

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Finance

### Tax changes for low income and small investors

Tax changes to create a fairer savings regime for low income and small investors are outlined in Budget 2005.

Finance Minister Michael Cullen said the proposals, which developed out of the Craig Stobo report [Toward Consensus on the Taxation of Investment Income](/news/2004/2004-11-16-stobo-report-taxing-investment-income)
, would remove current inconsistencies in the treatment of different taxpayers and investments and would create a more transparent and coherent tax environment.

They will:

*   eliminate a tax disadvantage applying to collective funds and;
*   ensure that income from these funds is taxed at the recipient's correct tax rate.

"The new rules, to come into effect on 1 April 2007, will apply to registered superannuation schemes, group investment funds, widely held unit trusts and other entities which have savings as their primary function.

"Currently gains from the sales of New Zealand shares tend to be taxed if the shares were bought through a collective fund but not if they were bought directly. This anomaly disadvantages collective funds and will be removed.

"The second rule change will allow the income from investments through managed funds to 'flow through' to the saver's normal income tax rate, whether that be 19.5 per cent, 33 per cent or 39 per cent. Now many are taxed at a flat 33 per cent, which delivers a modest incentive to people on the 39 per cent rate but penalises lower income earners on 19.5 per cent.

"The two changes are inter-linked and voluntary. Not all funds are equipped to make the transition immediately. Those that are will have to decide what offers the best deal to their members," Dr Cullen said.

He said the issue of offshore investment was proving more difficult. The government had considered using a version of the risk free rate of return method but had rejected this as administratively complex and also because of "perception problems" surrounding the requirement that tax be applied even when the investor had incurred losses.

"Officials are now focussing instead on an income calculation system based on actual shifts in value," Dr Cullen said.

Details will be outlined in a forthcoming discussion document.

### Fairer rules on taxing investment income

New rules will make the taxation of income from investment through managed funds more consistent and fairer to investors. They will apply to widely held unit trusts, registered superannuation schemes, group investment funds and other pooled investment vehicles - to be known as "collective investment vehicles".

The changes will reduce inconsistency in the taxation of investment income and remove the main tax disincentives to investing through managed funds.

The government will also consult on proposals to reduce the extent to which offshore investment in shares is taxed differently, depending on where and how the investment is made.

All the proposals will be detailed in a government discussion document to be released next month.

#### How will it work?

*   In most cases income in managed funds will "flow through" to investors and will be taxed at their correct tax rate (not a flat 33% rate).
*   The complex differences between superannuation schemes, unit trusts, group investment funds and other entities performing a similar savings function will be removed.
*   Funds will be able to make tax-free capital gains on domestic shares in the same way as individual investors do now.
*   There will be no distinction between tax-favoured passive funds and tax-penalised active funds.
*   Tax on offshore investment in shares will not be dependent on which country the investment is made in.

#### Flow-through and domestic investment

*   The new rules for managed funds will apply from 1 April 2007 and will be optional.
*   Instead of funds themselves paying tax on the income, they will withhold tax on behalf of each investor, at the investor's correct tax rate. This is known as "flow-through" treatment. Funds will then pay the tax to Inland Revenue in the same way as banks pay withholding tax on the interest paid to depositors. This approach has real advantages for investors on a 21% tax rate, whose investment income will be taxed correctly at 21% and without their having to provide any cash to fund the tax.
*   The tax withheld at the fund level will be treated as final withholding tax. This will ensure that the earning of fund income will not:
    *   automatically trigger the need for the investor to file a tax return;
    *   affect social policy programmes delivered through the tax system (such as family assistance).
*   An approach for dealing with tax losses in a "flow-through" environment will be presented in the discussion document, and the government will explicitly seek feedback on the proposed approach.
*   If the fund income cannot be allocated to specific investors in the fund, the income will continue to be taxed at the managed fund level at a flat 33% tax rate.
*   Profits from sales of domestic shares that investors earn through a qualifying fund will not generally be taxed. This will make the tax treatment consistent with the treatment of share profits from direct investment.
*   Certain gains from the sale of New Zealand shares that would be taxed if they had been earned by an individual direct investor will continue to be taxed if they are earned via a collective investment vehicle: for example, schemes that have been entered into to exploit the boundary between debt and equity. A proposed approach to achieving this will be presented in the discussion document, and the government will explicitly seek feedback on the proposal.

**Example**

_At the beginning of the tax year Mike invests $1,000 into a defined contribution superannuation fund that invests in domestic shares. At the same time he provides his tax rate of 21% to the managed fund. The fund earns $100,000 for its 100 investors for the tax year - made up of $50,000 ($40,000 + $10,000 imputation credits) in dividends and $50,000 from profits on the sale of shares. The $50,000 sale profits are not taxed. The $50,000 of dividends is taxable to the fund's investors. Mike's share of the taxable dividends is $500 ($400 + $100 imputation credits). The tax payable by the fund on his behalf is $500 X 21% = $105. The fund can use Mike's share of the imputation credits of $100 to offset his tax, leaving $5 of tax to pay. The fund pays the $5 to Inland Revenue and adjusts Mike's investment in the fund to reflect the tax payment. (Under current law, the superannuation fund would probably pay tax on the entire $100,000 that it earns for its investors at 33%.)_

#### Portfolio investment into foreign shares

*   The current distinction between investments in grey list countries (Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Canada and Norway) and investments in other countries that are more heavily taxed under the FIF rules will be removed. This will remove a disincentive for New Zealanders to invest in high growth economies - such as those in Asia.
*   This will not result in the current foreign investment fund rules applying to all offshore investments. Instead the government will outline proposed new rules in the discussion document.
*   These proposed new rules will reduce the extent to which offshore investments in shares are taxed differently. The proposals will balance revenue, economic and compliance concerns.

#### Where to from here?

The proposed changes will be detailed in a forthcoming discussion document that will invite further consultation on the operation of the new rules. Once enacted, the changes are planned to come into force from 1 April 2007.

* * *

### Depreciation changes for better investment decisions

Changes to the tax depreciation rules will see new depreciation rates that better reflect how assets decline in value and reduce compliance costs for businesses. Current tax depreciation rates are likely to be too fast for buildings and too slow for short-lived plant and equipment, which can create tax biases that distort the structure of capital investment away from the best investment opportunities. To deal with any biases, depreciation rates for short-lived plant and equipment will increase and depreciation rates on buildings will reduce.

More neutral tax depreciation rules will mean that businesses have incentives to invest in assets that provide the best commercial returns. The changes will help businesses make better decisions about capital investments.

#### How will it work?

##### Improved tax depreciation rates to better reflect how assets decline in value

*   Tax depreciation rates for short-lived plant and equipment will be made more consistent with those applying to long-lived plant and equipment. Rates for short-lived equipment will increase.
*   Tax depreciation rates for buildings will reduce for buildings acquired from today. The new rates will not apply to existing building investments.

Examples

| Asset | Old diminishing value rate (%) | Old diminishing value rate plus loading (%) | New diminishing value rate (%) | New diminishing value rate plus loading (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Laptop computer | 40  | 48  | 50  | 60  |
| Appliances (domestic) | 26  | 31.2 | 30  | 36  |
| Metal detectors | 22  | 26.4 | 25  | 30  |
| Printing machines (rotary) | 9.5 | 11.4 | 10  | 12  |
| Buildings | 4   | (no loading for buildings) | 3   | (no loading for buildings) |
| Dams (concrete) | 2   | 2.4 | 2   | 2.4 |

##### Reducing compliance costs for businesses

*   To reduce some of the compliance costs to business from having to maintain fixed asset registers, the low value asset threshold will rise from $200 to $500. This will reduce the number of assets that businesses must annually account for on their fixed asset registers and the number of tax adjustments required when disposing of assets.

_**Example**_

A company buys a facsimile machine for $450 for use in its office. Under the current rules, the machine would be placed on the company's fixed asset register and tracked and depreciated over its five-year estimated useful life. Under the new rules, the company will be able to claim an immediate tax deduction for the entire purchase price of the machine. This will mean it will not have to track the asset on its tax fixed asset register.

#### Where to from here?

The changes are included in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, introduced today. Changes to the depreciation rate for buildings will apply to buildings acquired from today, while changes to the other depreciation rates will apply to assets acquired from 1 April 2005. The increase in the low value asset threshold will apply to assets acquired after today.

* * *

### Reducing tax costs for international recruitment

A temporary tax exemption on foreign income will be made available to people who come to work here, whether they are foreigners or New Zealanders who have been non-resident for tax purposes for ten years.

Tax on offshore income is an important issue for highly skilled people who are in demand internationally and for the businesses that recruit them from overseas, which often end up bearing the "tax costs" themselves in the form of higher pay. The new exemption will thus remove a tax barrier to New Zealand gaining the skilled people it needs.

#### How will it work?

*   New and returning residents can apply for a certificate of exemption if they have not been tax-resident for at least ten tax years.
*   New employees will be exempted from tax for five years on all foreign income except dividends, interest, employment income and business income relating to services.
*   Those who come, or return, to New Zealand who are not in employment will receive the same exemption for three years.
*   The exemption will be available to people only once.

_**Example**_

A New Zealander who has worked in France for fifteen years owns $70,000 worth of shares in French companies and pays tax in France on the dividends she receives. Under current New Zealand law, if she returns to work in New Zealand her shareholding will be treated as foreign investment funds. She will have to pay New Zealand tax on the value of the shares as it accrues, regardless of how much has been distributed. The new exemption will mean that only distributions from the shares will be taxed in New Zealand during the period of exemption.

#### Where to from here?

The new exemption is included in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, introduced today. Once enacted, the exemption will apply to people arriving in New Zealand from 1 April 2006.

* * *

### Updated tax rules for securities lending

The tax rules on securities lending transactions will be updated to bring them into line with the rules relating to other commercial transactions and with those of countries such as Australia. The reform will remove tax barriers to securities lending transactions and make New Zealand more attractive to international investment. It will also introduce new rules to prevent the use of securities lending for tax avoidance.

Securities lending involves the lending of shares to another party for a fee. It allows brokers to transact in shares in which they have a shortfall and provides a relatively risk-free way for larger holders of shares to increase their overall returns. Internationally, securities lending plays an important role in facilitating market liquidity.

#### How will it work?

*   "Qualifying transactions" involving the lending of equities will be taxed on their economic substance rather than legal form, meaning the lender will be treated as the owner of the shares over the period of the transaction.
*   New anti-avoidance rules will apply to arrangements where a party, unable to use imputation credits, "lends" the relevant securities to a resident party who can use the credits.

_**Example of taxing transactions on their economic substance**_

_A broker, anticipating a drop in the share price of NZ Limited, enters into a contract to sell NZ Limited shares to a third party for $6.00 a share. The broker does not hold any NZ Limited shares so enters into a securities lending agreement to "borrow" the shares required from an institutional investor. Legally, the borrowed shares are sold by the institutional investor to the broker, who then goes into the market at the end of the month to buy replacement shares (at $5 per share) to return to the institutional investor. Instead of being taxed on any realised gain on sale of the shares, the institutional investor is treated as holding the shares for the entire period and receives a taxable lending fee as additional income. The broker is able to enter into an additional sale and makes a profit of $1 per share less the lending fee. The market benefits from additional transactions and increased liquidity._

#### Where to from here?

The new rules are included in the taxation bill introduced today. Once enacted, they will apply for income years and transactions beginning on or after enactment. The associated anti-avoidance measures will apply from the date of enactment

### Income tax inflation indexed from 1 April 2008

Personal tax rate thresholds will be raised 6.12 per cent on 1 April 2008 under a Budget 2005 commitment to inflation proof incomes, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said today.

The decision will cost the government an estimated $68 million in 2007-08 and $360 million in 2008-09.

"This means that in future taxpayers will pay more tax only if their incomes rise in real terms," Dr Cullen said. "The adjustments will take place every three years beginning on 1 April, 2008."

"To provide greater certainty and administrative ease, we have decided to raise the thresholds by a uniform 2 per cent each year - the mid-point of the Reserve Bank's price stability target range. Compounded over three years, this produces an increase of 6.12 per cent," Dr Cullen said.

As a result of the changes, taxpayers who earn more than $10,081 will pay $35 less tax each year. Those earning more than $40,324 will pay $314 less and those earning more than $63,672 will pay $534 less.

Legislation to implement the indexation regime will be introduced next year.

SPEECH NOTES

### Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill – First Reading Speech

I move that the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill be now read a first time.

I shall be recommending later that the bill be referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration.

The main feature of the bill is a package of tax measures, announced in Budget 2005 and over recent weeks, designed to promote economic growth. Many of these changes take the form of reducing tax barriers and impediments to economic growth.

The bill introduces changes to the tax depreciation rules designed to ensure more productive use of capital. That is achieved by reducing biases in the depreciation rules that distort the structure of capital investment away from the best investment opportunities. And when taxes distort investment decisions, the result is lower growth.

The changes are motivated by concerns that our current depreciation rates are too fast for buildings and too slow for short-lived plant and equipment, which can result in excessive investment in tax-preferred assets and under-investment in others. For this reason, the depreciation rates for buildings will decrease, while the rates for short-life plant and equipment will increase, becoming consistent with the rates for longer-lived plant and equipment.

To reduce some of the compliance costs for businesses, the low-value threshold for depreciable assets will rise from $200 to $500.

A number of other changes in the bill also focus on reducing the cost of tax to business and generally making the tax side of business easier for small businesses.

To reduce the number of tax payment dates that businesses must cope with, the bill aligns the three payment dates for provisional tax with those for GST, both of which will now be due on the 28th of the month. Small businesses that want to pay provisional tax more frequently, to help with their budgeting, may choose to make six payments a year, rather than three large payments, as at present.

A related change will allow businesses the option of basing their provisional tax payments on a percentage of their GST turnover. This will suit businesses that have seasonal income and who want their tax payments to be more closely aligned with their income flow.

Also introduced is a new subsidy designed to encourage small businesses to take advantage of the help that payroll agents can give them in dealing with PAYE, child support and student loan deductions from staff wages. Payroll agents will be subsidised for up to five employees per employer, for an amount to be decided by negotiation with payroll agents.

Wide-ranging changes to the fringe benefit tax rules are designed to reduce compliance costs and remove anomalies that have developed since the rules came into operation in the 1980s, including the inadvertent over-taxation of some benefits. As well, improved anti-avoidance measures ensure that the original purpose of the rules, to treat non-cash remuneration on par with cash remuneration, is not undermined.

Several of the changes relate to motor vehicles, the main source of fringe benefit tax. Employers will have the option of calculating the private benefit from an employer-provided motor vehicle on the basis of its depreciated tax value, instead of its cost, a change that a lot of businesses have said they want.

At the same time, the valuation rate applied to the cost price of a motor vehicle will be reduced from 24 percent to 20 percent, which will significantly reduce the amount of FBT paid on motor vehicle benefits.

These changes will also apply to leased vehicles, as part of achieving a better alignment of the FBT treatment of leased vehicles with that of owned vehicles.

To reduce compliance costs in relation to other fringe benefits, several new options and exemptions from FBT are being introduced, and the minimum value thresholds applying to miscellaneous fringe benefits are being raised substantially. As a result, many small, hard-to-measure or unintended benefits will no longer be covered by the rules.

Several other amendments in the bill are aimed at increasing New Zealand's access to worldwide labour, skills and capital.

To remove a tax barrier to international recruitment to New Zealand, a new exemption on certain types of foreign income will be made available to migrants or returning New Zealanders who have been non-resident for tax purposes for ten years.

To help resolve problems associated with the New Zealand tax treatment of accrued entitlements in foreign, job-related superannuation schemes, the bill introduces changes to extend the scope of the current exemption for interests in those schemes.

The government proposes to introduce in a subsequent bill, subject to further work, an exemption for certain Australian superannuation schemes. These changes should resolve any recruitment problems and disincentives arising from our current tax treatment of interests in those schemes.

The tax rules on securities lending transactions are being updated to bring them into line with the rules on other commercial transactions and with those of countries such as Australia. The changes remove tax barriers to securities lending transactions and make New Zealand more attractive to international investment, while also preventing the use of securities lending for tax avoidance.

The bill allows companies that bring in new equity investors to have better access to tax deductions for research and development expenditure. The changes cater for the growth cycle of technology companies, in particular, and remove a barrier to R&D investment.

Similarly, the bill exempts non-resident investors from tax on the sale of shares in companies they have invested in alongside the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund. The change complements earlier reforms aimed at removing tax barriers to venture capital investment in New Zealand.

The bill introduces a number of other business tax changes. For example, it clarifies the tax treatment of income from investments in what are known as "foreign hybrids". The change will allow members of a controlled foreign company to access tax credits for foreign tax paid on its income. Foreign hybrids will also be eligible for the so-called grey list exemption.

The bill extends the concessionary continuity rules, which apply to carrying forward losses and imputation credits, to allow for the use of the concession when a smaller, widely-held listed company takes over or merges with a larger one. I understand there is some concern about the proposed application date, so I will be interested in what submissions to the select committee have to say about it.

It introduces new information-reporting and record-keeping requirements for New Zealand-resident trustees of foreign trusts, to ensure that New Zealand can satisfy information requests from tax jurisdictions with which we have a double tax agreement.

It clarifies the tax deductibility of re-grassing and fertilising costs associated with farm conversions, to provide greater certainty and reduce compliance costs for farmers.

The bill introduces important measures to protect the tax base. New tax rules on corporate migration will ensure that companies that migrate from New Zealand pay tax on their worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand. The changes will apply from the date of announcement, 21 March this year.

A further measure prevents avoidance of GST by use of third parties to import goods, such as luxury cars, that were offshore at the time of supply. Once enacted, that change will apply from 19 May, the date of the bill's introduction.

Finally, the bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2005-06 tax year.

These, then, are many of the changes introduced in this large, omnibus taxation bill. They and other changes proposed in the bill are described in detail in the separate, 135-page commentary on the bill, which has been distributed to members of this House.

I commend the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to the House.
10 June 2005 Media release—Finance and Expenditure Committee Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill Clayton Cosgrove, chairperson of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, announced today that the committee is inviting public submissions on the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The closing date for submissions is 12 August 2005. Mr Cosgrove said, “the bill makes a number of changes to the tax depreciation rules, intended to ensure that depreciation rates are more closely aligned to the commercial reality of an asset’s economic life. The bill also increases the low-value asset threshold, which allows taxpayers to write off the value of an asset immediately, from $200 to $500. “Measures to change the payment of provisional tax and GST are included in the bill. The due dates for payment of both provisional tax and GST are aligned with each other, and both will now be required on the 28th day of the month, although the frequency of required provisional tax payments will usually be lower than the frequency of GST payments. It is proposed that taxpayers will be able to calculate their provisional tax using the ratio method, based on a percentage of their taxable supplies, in order to align their provisional tax payments with cashflow. “The bill provides for the payment of a subsidy where small businesses voluntarily make use of a PAYE intermediary. Provisions in the bill detail the eligibility criteria for payroll agents to be listed, as well as a process for revoking that listing; the obligations on PAYE intermediaries; the process and conditions that must be met when claiming the subsidy; and the administrative process to be followed when an agreement between an employer and the intermediary is terminated. “A number of measures to reduce compliance costs and remove anomalies in the fringe benefit tax regime are included. Key changes apply to the application of fringe benefit tax to motor vehicles although a large number of other measures, affecting both the general fringe benefit tax regime and the application of the regime to particular benefit types, are also included in the bill. “The bill contains provisions governing the taxation of securities lending transactions. Specific securities lending rules are introduced to allow qualifying share lending transactions to be taxed on the basis of economic substance (as a loan) rather than legal form (as a sale of shares), meaning they will not be treated as a taxable disposal. In addition, the imputation and non- resident withholding tax rules are strengthened to prevent an unintended fiscal cost from arising out of non-qualifying share lending transactions. “Under other provisions in the bill, taxpayers seeking a tax deduction for research and development expenditure (including depreciation losses) will be able to choose to allocate the deduction to income years after the year where the expenditure is incurred, allowing the timing of the deduction to be marched to the timing of income resulting from the research and development expenditure. This amendment is intended to prevent accumulated tax deductions from being lost as a result of shareholding changes where new equity investors are brought into the company after the expenditure is incurred. These provisions will be optional, and taxpayers will be able to continue their current treatment of research and development expenditure. “The bill includes provisions intended to remove incentives that encourage companies to migrate rather than liquidate for tax reasons. The current rules that apply where a company has been liquidated will also apply where the company ceases to be a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes. The company will be regarded as having disposed of its property at market value, and all shareholder funds will be treated as having been paid to shareholders as a dividend, and will be subject to tax. The provisions should ensure that migrating companies pay tax on their worldwide income earned while resident in New Zealand. “A number of measures intended to reduce the additional tax burden imposed on new migrants and expatriates (who have not been tax resident in New Zealand for 10 years) are contained in the bill, in order to remove barriers inhibiting the recruitment of skilled employees from overseas. The bill provides an tax exemption for all foreign income except dividends, interest, employment income, and business income relating to the supply of services. This exemption will have a term of five years for migrant employees, and for three years for all new migrants. “New rules covering information reporting and record-keeping require the disclosure of increased information from New Zealand resident trustees of foreign trusts, including trusts that receive no New Zealand-sourced income. Trustees will be required to keep certain records and maintain them in New Zealand, to be provided to the Inland Revenue Department on request. These requirements are needed to ensure that the New Zealand is able to meet its international obligations to meet information requests from it double tax agreement partners. The Australian Taxation Office will automatically be provided with information on foreign trusts with a New Zealand-resident trustee and an Australian-resident settler, while information requests on other trusts will be made on a case-by-case basis. “The bill also • narrows the provisions relating to double tax treaties, so that they override only the Inland Revenue Acts 1994 and 2004, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982 • clarifies that distributions from co-operatives are deductible for the co-operative and taxable for the member • introduces a framework requiring the Accident Compensation Corporation to withhold tax at source on attendant care payments when an independent caregiver is used • exempts non-resident investors from tax on the sale of shares in companies that they have invested in accordance with an agreement with the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund • provides a separate tax exemption for the gaming machine income of licensed gaming trusts • includes provisions intended to resolve tax issues arising out of natural disasters • allows people who invest in foreign hybrids, which have the characteristics of both a company and a partnership, to receive grey-list treatment and foreign tax credits for tax paid overseas on income earned by a foreign hybrid • applies an exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for interests held by returning residents in employment-related foreign superannuation schemes • extends the statutory life of the exemption from the controlled foreign company rules for investments in listed controlled foreign companies • increases the maximum child rebate payable from $156 to $351 a year • provides a new ownership tracing rule for reverse takeovers and mergers, in order to preserve shareholding continuity and allow losses and imputation credits to be carried forward • adds Spain to the grey list to which the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules do not generally apply • clarifies the capital account treatment of regressing and fertilising expenditure where that expenditure is associated with a significant capital activity, such as converting a farm from ones agricultural purpose to another, and updates the capital account treatment to reflect modern farming practices with shorter pasture rotation cycles • amends and clarifies the GST treatment of supplies of goods and services to security holders; international postage stamps; distributions from a testamentary trust or as a gift between associated registered persons; and goods that were intended to be consumed in New Zealand but were located outside New Zealand at the time of supply • makes a number of remedial amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Mr Cosgrove also said that the bill seeks to confirm that current annual income tax rates will apply for the 2005/06 tax year. “These changes involve amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.” Copies of the bill can be purchased from Bennetts Government Bookshops.

Tax bill passed
===============

Legislation introduced in November in the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill passed through its final stages in Parliament yesterday. New thin capitalisation rules for foreign-owned banks operating in New Zealand are the main feature of the new legislation, which is expected to receive Royal assent next week. For more information see the [media statement](/news/2005/2005-06-16-tax-bill-passed#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Major tax bill passes

"Foreign owned banks operating in New Zealand will be required to pay sufficient tax on their New Zealand income as part of a major tax bill passed by Parliament yesterday,” Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said.

"New thin capitalisation rules will ensure that the income of banks cannot be sheltered by interest deductions arising from excessive debt. Banks will not have access to interest deductions if they do not hold a level of equity equivalent to 4 per cent of their New Zealand banking assets, weighted for risk.

"The bill also makes it easier for businesses to claim tax deductions for environmental expenditure, allowing environmental costs, like other business costs, to be taken into account for tax purposes.

"It introduces statutory 'privilege' - or a right not to disclose certain documents - to confidential tax advice that is given by advisors such as chartered accountants, a change that has been welcomed by tax professionals.

"The bill introduces several business-friendly changes. They include clarification of the income tax rules on transfers of assets and liabilities to beneficiaries when a taxpayer dies, a reform that is long overdue. They also include technical amendments to the tax depreciation rules to improve their operation and reduce compliance costs.

"The changes include the introduction of a six-year tax exemption on income from non-resident drilling rigs and seismic ships involved in exploration for petroleum in New Zealand, as part of a package of measures to boost gas exploration.

"This very important bill reflects the priorities of the government's tax policy work programme, which include promoting growth and innovation, making the tax system easier for businesses to work with, reducing compliance costs and protecting the revenue base. I am very pleased that it has been passed," Dr Cullen said.

### Environment-friendly tax changes good for business

Changes to tax legislation, including tax deductions for businesses cleaning up contaminated sites, were welcomed today by Environment Minister Marian Hobbs.

"The new tax law, passed by Parliament last night, will make it easier for businesses to do their bit towards a clean, healthy and safe environment. Environmental costs, like any other business cost, should be taken into account for tax purposes," Marian Hobbs said.

The changes update, clarify and expand tax deductions for business environmental expenditure.

"This is excellent news for businesses putting practices in place to reduce their impact on the environment," Marian Hobbs said.

A key benefit for business is that work towards restoring contaminated sites is now immediately tax deductible. Taxpayers with restoration liabilities can also opt to take part in a site restoration fund, setting aside money for future site restoration.

The tax deductions cover environmental expenditure such as preventing, remedying or mitigating the discharge of contaminants, monitoring the effects of pollution and testing options to deal with environmental issues. Examples of environmental improvements might include earthworks or ponds to reduce the effect of contaminants, or planting trees to reduce the impact of contaminants on a stream.

"The tax changes are another step to ensure businesses are assisted towards sustainable practice. As part of its work with industry the Ministry for the Environment will also promote these tax benefits," Marian Hobbs said.

Tax discussion document released
================================

A government discussion document released today proposes changes to the rules on taxing income from collective funds and offshore portfolio share investments. The changes aim to reduce inconsistencies in the taxation of investment income, remove disincentives for domestic investment through managed funds and reduce the differences in how income from offshore shares is taxed. Submissions close on 30 September. For more information see the government's [media statement](/news/2005/2005-06-28-tax-discussion-document-released#statement)
 and the discussion document, "[Taxation of investment income](/publications/2005/2005-dd-investment-income)
".

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Revenue

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Fairer rules on taxing investment income

A government discussion document released today outlines proposals for fairer, more consistent rules on taxing income from collective funds and offshore portfolio share investments.

"Radical change in the tax treatment of different kinds of investment income is long overdue," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said today.

"As noted in Budget 2005, the current rules tend to overtax investors – particularly those who have lower tax rates, advantage certain forms of offshore investment, and favour investment in some countries over investment in others.

"The discussion document seeks feedback on changes to reduce inconsistencies, remove disincentives for domestic investment through managed funds, and reduce the differences in how income from offshore shares is taxed.

"The changes complement the new KiwiSaver announced in Budget 2005, which has been designed to encourage New Zealanders to save through work-based savings schemes. It is therefore vital that their investments are taxed consistently and fairly," Dr Cullen said.

Key proposals include:

_Domestic investment through collective investment vehicles (CIVs)_

*   Collective investment vehicles – widely held unit trusts, registered superannuation schemes, group investment funds and other pooled investment vehicles – can choose to use the new tax rules.
*   Investors' taxable income earned through a CIV will generally exclude realised domestic share gains.
*   Under the new rules, investors will generally be taxed at their correct rate, instead of a flat 33%. CIVs will deduct tax at rates notified to them by individual investors.
*   Tax losses can be carried forward and used to offset assessable income in future years or allocated to investors' accounts.
*   Tax credits such as imputation credits will be available to offset tax on assessable income derived via the CIV.

_Portfolio investment into foreign shares_

*   The "grey list", which allows for concessionary tax treatment of investments into seven countries, will be removed for portfolio investment – offshore investment in shares where the investor owns 10 per cent or less of the foreign entity invested into.
*   CIVs and other investors that are not individuals will use the change in an asset's value over the tax year to calculate assessable income.
*   Individual investors will also base their assessable income on an asset’s change in value over the tax year, but tax paid will generally be spread over several years to reflect cashflow.
*   Assessable income on assets that do not have a readily verifiable market value will be calculated under a simplified deemed rate of return method.
*   The new rules will not apply to individuals' investments under $50,000 into foreign companies that are listed in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement.

The discussion document is published at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2005/2005-dd-investment-income)
. Submissions on the proposals close on 30 September.
